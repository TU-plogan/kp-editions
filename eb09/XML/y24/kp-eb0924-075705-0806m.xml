                <p><label type="entry">YUCATAN</label>, a peninsular region of Central America,
                    forming the south-eastern extremity of Mexico (see vol. xvi. pl. I.), of which,
                    since 1861, it constitutes the two confederate states of Campeche (Campeachy) in
                    the west and Yucatan in the east. At its neck the peninsula is conterminous on
                    the south-east with British Honduras, on the south-west with the state of
                    Tabasco (Mexico), and on the south with the republic of Guatemala, the
                    boundaries towards these territories being largely of a purely conventional
                    character. From this base the land projects in a compact rectangular mass
                    between the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea, west and east, for 280 miles
                    northwards, across nearly four degrees of latitude (18° to 21° 40' N.) and three
                    of longitude (87° 30' to 90° 30' W.), to within 120 miles of Cuba, from which it
                    is separated by the Yucatan Channel. It has a mean breadth of about 200 miles, a
                    coast-line of 700 miles, and a total area of 55,400 square miles, with a
                    population in 1882 of 393,000 (Yucatan, 29,570 square miles, population 302,500;
                    Campeche, 25,830 square miles, population 90,500).<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Previous estimates assigned 32,650 square
                    miles to Yucatan and 26,100 to Campeche.</p></note></p>
                <p>The coast-line presents a uniform monotonous aspect, being fringed by no islands
                    except Cozumel near the northeast point, and broken by no indentations except
                    the shallow Lake Terminos on the west and the inlets of Ascension, Espiritu
                    Santo, and Chetumal Bays on the east side. But the north coast is skirted by an
                    almost continuous line of low dunes, nearly 200 miles long, enclosing a broad
                    lagoon, which varies in length and depth with the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n807/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0807-0758"/> seasons. Behind the lagoon a bed of coralline and
                    porous limestone rocks, composing nearly the whole tableland of Yucatan, rises
                    continuously southwards in the direction of the Sierra Madre, which, beyond the
                    frontier, traverses the whole of Guatemala and Central America. Geologically,
                    Yucatan thus presents the character of a comparatively recent formation, built
                    up by polypi in shallow waters, and gradually covered with a layer of thin dry
                    soil by the slow weathering of the coral rocks. But the surface is not so
                    uniformly level and monotonous as it appears on most maps; for, although there
                    are scarcely any running streams, it is diversified here and there by a few
                    lacustrine basins, of which Lakes Bacalar and Chicankanah are the largest, as
                    well as by some low isolated hills and ridges in the west, and on the east side
                    by the Sierra Alta, a range of moderate elevation, traversing the whole
                    peninsula from Catoche Point southwards to the neighbourhood of Lake Peten in
                    Guatemala.</p>
                <p>There are thus no elevations sufficiently high to intercept the moisture-bearing
                    clouds from the Atlantic, while those from the Pacific are cut off by the Sierra
                    Madre. Hence the climate is necessarily dry, with a deficient and uncertain
                    rainfall, especially in the central and northern districts. Here also the
                    tropical heats are intensified by the neighbourhood of the Gulf Stream, which in
                    its passage through the Yucatan Channel Hows much nearer to the coast of the
                    peninsula than to that of Cuba. Still, the climate, although “hot of the
                    hottest” (Ober), with a temperature ranging from 75° to 98° Fahr. in the shade,
                    is comparatively healthy, owing to its great dryness and to the cool breezes
                    which prevail night and day throughout a great part of the year. The atmosphere
                    is also occasionally purified by the fierce <hi rend="italic">temporales</hi> or
                    “northers,” which sweep across the Gulf freely over this open low-lying region.
                    Yellow fever, however, periodically visits the Campeche coast, while ague is
                    endemic in the undrained swampy districts towards the southern frontiers. Like
                    most regions lying entirely within the tropics, Yucatan has two seasons only,
                    which are determined by the alternations not so much of temperature as of
                    atmospheric moisture. The dry season lasts from October to May, the wet season
                    for the rest of the year; the hottest months appear to be March and April, when
                    the heat is increased by the burning of the corn and henequen fields on the
                    plateau.</p>
                <p>All the northern districts, as well as the greater part of the Sierra Alta, are
                    destitute of large trees; but the coast-lands on both sides towards Tabasco and
                    British Honduras enjoy a sufficient rainfall to support large forest growths,
                    including the mahogany tree, several valuable cabinet woods, vanilla, logwood,
                    and other dyewoods. Logwood forests fringe all the lagoons and many parts of the
                    seaboard which are flooded during the rainy season. The chief cultivated plants
                    are maize, the sugar-cane, tobacco, cotton, coffee, and especially henequen, the
                    so-called Yucatan hemp or Sisal hemp, which, however, is not a hemp at all, but
                    a true fibre. It is yielded by <hi rend="italic">Agave sisalensis,</hi> which
                    grows everywhere, and is used chiefly for the manufacture of coarse sackcloth,
                    cordage, and hammocks. In 1880 as much as 40,000,000 lb of this article, valued
                    at £350,000, was shipped at Progreso. The yearly maize crop is estimated to be
                    worth over £1,000,000, and the whole of the agricultural produce about
                    £2,000,000. But a comparatively small area is under tillage, owing largely to
                    the prevailing system of vast haciendas (estates), which the owners have neither
                    the necessary capital nor the energy to administer. Hence symptoms of decay are
                    everywhere visible; the whole country is “mainly a wilderness” (Ober); and there
                    is probably much less land under cultivation than at the time of the Spanish
                    conquest.</p>
                <p>Of the state of Yucatan the capital is Merida (40,000 inhabitants in 1882), which
                    is connected with its port of Progreso, on the northwest coast, by a railway 25
                    miles long, the only line in the country. The state of Campeche has for its
                    capital the town and seaport of the same name (16,000), on the west coast. Other
                    towns in the peninsula are Tikul, Ixmal, and Valladolid in Yucatan, and the port
                    of El Carmen on an island in Lake Terminos in Campeche. According to the
                    official returns, there are at present (1888) in Yucatan altogether 7 “cities,”
                    13 towns, and 143 villages, besides 15 abandoned settlements and 333 haciendas.
                    But scarcely any of these places have as many as 10,000 inhabitants, while the
                    population of the great majority falls below 1000.</p>
                <p>The contrast is most striking between the picture conveyed by these returns,
                    which also include 62 “ruined cities,” and the state of the country at the time
                    of the Spanish conquest, as revealed by the innumerable remains of towns,
                    cities, temples, palaces, and other public buildings dotted over the plateau,
                    being especially numerous round the now desolate northern and north-eastern
                    shores of the peninsula. The whole of the northern section of Yucatan, which is
                    now destitute alike of running waters, of dense vegetation, and almost of
                    inhabitants, was at that time thickly peopled and full of populous cities
                    remarkable for the great size, splendour, and artistic taste of their public
                    monuments. For Maya, as the land was then called,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Yet the term <hi rend="italic">Yucatan</hi>
                    occurs in the very earliest Spanish records, although clearly originating in a
                    misunderstanding, of which several versions are given by Bancroft <hi
                    rend="italic">(Hist. Pacific States,</hi> iv. p. 11). It appears even on the
                    very oldest maps, on whieh, however, the country figures as an island, and is
                    spoken of as such in conjunction with Cozumel (“the islands of Yucatan and
                    Cozumel”) in the commission (1526) granted to Francesco Montejo the elder to
                    occupy and settle those lands <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.,</hi> i. p.
                    154).</p></note> was the chief centre of the wide-spread Maya-Quiché power and
                    culture, which rivalled, and in some respects excelled, those of the Peruvian
                    Incas and of the Aztecs on the Anahuac plateau. Although the Maya nation had at
                    that time already entered on a period of decadence, it was still strong and
                    vigorous enough to resist the conquistadores for a period of fully twenty years
                    (1527-47), the reduction of this barren region costing “the lives of more
                    Spaniards than had been expended in wresting from the Incas and the Montezumas
                    the wealthiest empires of the western world” (Bancroft).</p>
                <p>Wonder has been expressed that such a bleak, arid, and almost streamless land
                    could have ever become the seat of empire and the home of a flourishing
                    civilization. But the absence of rivers on the plateau appears to be due not so
                    much to the deficient rainfall as to the extremely porous nature of the
                    calcareous soil, which absorbs the waters like a sponge and prevents the
                    development of surface streams. Beneath the surface, however, the waters
                    accumulate in such abundance that a sufficient supply may always be had by
                    sinking wells in almost any part of the tableland. What the present inhabitants
                    neglect to do was systematically practised by the former populations, whose
                    aguadas or artificial lakes and underground reservoirs must be reckoned amongst
                    the most remarkable monuments of Maya culture. “Intelligence, much skill in
                    masonry, and much labour were required to construct them. They were paved with
                    several courses of stone laid in cement, and in their bottoms wells or cavities
                    were constructed. More than forty such wells were found in the bottom of one of
                    these aguadas at Galal, which has been repaired and restored to use. In some
                    places long subterranean passages lead down to pools of water, which are used in
                    the dry season. One of these subterranean reservoirs is 450 feet below the
                    surface of the ground, and the passage leading to it is about 1400 feet long”
                    (Baldwin, p. 145). Thus the Mayan, like the Peruvian, the Egyptian, and the
                    Babylonian culture, was based on a well-planned and carefully executed system of
                    waterworks, specially adapted to the peculiar physical conditions of the
                    country.</p>
                <p>The monumental remains which must be assigned to the Maya-Quiché, as
                    distinguished from other native civilizations, are spread over a great part of
                    Central America, but are mainly comprised within the triangular space formed by
                    connecting Mitla in Oajaca, Copan in Honduras, and the north coast of Yucatan
                    above Tizimin by three straight lines. But of the “sixty-two ruined cities” of
                    Yucatan proper the most important, or at least the best known and most fully
                    described, are Izamal, Mayapan, Aké, Acanceh, Uxmal, Tikul, and Kabah, all
                    centred in the north-west corner of the peninsula round about Merida, which
                    itself stands on the ruins of Tihu; Chichen-Itza, about midway between Tikul and
                    the east coast; and Labna, Nohbecan, and Potonchan in the Campeche district.
                    Most of these places were described and illustrated by Stephens and Catherwood
                    over forty years ago, and have recently been re-visited and re-described by Μ.
                    Désiré Charnay. The structures especially of Uxmal, Aké, Kabah, and Chichen-Itza
                    rival in magnitude and splendour those of Palenque in Chiapas, of Coban and
                    Lorillard (the “Phantom City ”) in Guatemala, and of Copan in Honduras. There is
                    nothing comparable to them on the Mexican tableland, and in the New World they
                    are surpassed in architectural skill and artistic taste only by the beautiful
                    edifices at Mitla in Oajaca and some of the monuments of Peruvian culture.</p>
                <p>Mayapan (“El Pendon de los Mayas,” or “Banner City of the Maya Nation ”) was
                    already in ruins at the time of the conquest, having been overthrown during a
                    general revolt of the feudatory states about a century before that period.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Or, according to other
                    interpretations of the confused national traditions, by the people of
                    Chichen-Itza some three centuries before the arrival of the
                    Spaniards.</p></note> Yet its ruins, overgrown with vegetation, still cover a
                    considerable space, and include a huge artificial mound which from a distance
                    looks like a wooded hill. But Uxmal stands altogether unrivalled for the
                    magnitude of its buildings, the richness of its sculptured façades, and the
                    almost classic beauty of its statuary. Conspicuous amongst its edifices are the
                    so-called “nunnery” and the famous Casa del Gobernador or governor’s palace, the
                    latter with a wonderful frieze, 325 feet long, “having a row of colossal heads
                    divided in panels, filled alternately with grecques in high relief” (Charnay).
                    The nunnery, which contained eighty-eight compartments of all sizes, forms a
                    vast quadrangle<pb break="no"

                    court 258 by 214 feet. Here Dr Le Plongeon discovered in 1881 a surprisingly
                    beautiful statue, surpassing anything of the kind ever found in Central America.
                    But this object he again carefully hid away to prevent it from falling into the
                    hands of the Mexican authorities, who had seized another remarkable statue
                    previously brought to light by this industrious explorer (Ober).</p>
                <p>Conspicuous amongst the crumbling monuments of Aké, which lies ten leagues east
                    of Merida, is a huge pyramid, with an immense flight of steps, presenting some
                    extraordinary features different from anything elsewhere discovered in Yucatan.
                    This strange monument is surmounted by thirty-six pillars (twenty-nine still
                    standing), each 4 feet square and from 14 to 16 feet high, disposed in three
                    parallel rows 10 feet apart, the whole supported by a platform 212 feet by 46
                    and approached by steps from 4½ to 6½ feet long and from 1 to 1½ feet high. At
                    Izamal, a few miles east of Aké, stands another great pyramid, with a base of
                    nearly 650 feet, besides three others, and a colossal head 13 feet high, not,
                    however, a monolith, but built up of rough stones coated with mortar. But the
                    gigantic face described and reproduced by Stephens had disappeared at the time
                    of Charnay’s visit to Izamal.</p>
                <p>To this explorer we are indebted for the first detailed account of the wonderful
                    remains of Chichen - Itza, which include another nunnery, a tennis-court,
                    several temples, and other buildings profusely embellished with rich friezes,
                    statues, pillars, reliefs, and the like, the whole grouped round a central
                    pyramid of great size, known as the Castillo, from the beautiful structure still
                    standing on its summit. Chichen-Itza, which was certainly inhabited at the time
                    of the conquest, was the capital of the Itzaes, one of the most powerful Maya
                    nations, who appear to have afterwards migrated southwards to the neighbourhood
                    of Lake Peten, where tribes of this name are still found. They constituted one
                    of the eighteen semi-independent Maya states, whose incessant internecine wars
                    at last brought about the dismemberment of the once potent theocratic empire of
                    Xibalba (Palenque ?) and the destruction of the Maya civilization.</p>
                <p>Scarcely less important than those of Chichen-Itza are the monuments of Kabah,
                    which lies about 12 miles south of Uxmal. The two places were formerly connected
                    by a plastered causeway, traces of which are still visible, and Kabah must have
                    been a very large city, for its ruins are scattered over a considerable area.
                    Amongst them are comprised lofty pyramids, vast terraces, and sumptuous palaces
                    or temples, with elaborate ornamentation, sometimes almost completely disguising
                    the architectural features of the edifices.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    cornices form a frame to immense friezes which in their details would compare
                    favourably with our proudest monuments" (Charnay). On others are sculptured some
                    remarkable basreliefs, which represent Maya warriors receiving the swords of
                    kneeling Aztec captives, the nationalities of the figures being clearly
                    identified by their respective costumes. The significance of records of this
                    sort has either been altogether overlooked or else strangely misinterpreted by
                    most writers on Central-American antiquities.</hi></p></note> Charnay mentions
                    “triumphal arches,” but adds that he sought in vain for the unique specimen of
                    this kind of monument in America which is mentioned and figured by Stephens, and
                    which bears such a striking resemblance to the triumphal arches of the Boman
                    type. Many other remains have either disappeared or crumbled away almost beyond
                    recognition since they were first sketched by Catherwood.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">In 1841 Stephens was
                    assured by the cura of Santa Cruz del Quiché that the palaces of that place,
                    then in a dilapidated state, were quite perfect thirty years before, and that
                    the now deserted city of Utatlan in the province of Vera Paz was then almost as
                    perfect as when its inhabitants had abandoned it Uo had himself walked in its
                    silent streets amid its colossal buildings, whieh were as entire as those of
                    Santa Cruz.</hi></p></note> But, on the other hand, numerous buried cities and
                    monuments probably still remain concealed amid the rank tropical vegetation,
                    especially in the almost unknown territory of the unreduced Lacandons and Itzaes
                    towards the Guatemala frontier. But enough has already been surveyed fully to
                    justify Maudslay’s general remark, that Yucatan is thickly covered with the
                    ruins of great buildings "even superior in some respects to those found in other
                    parts of Central America.”</p>
                <p>Like those of Palenque, Lorillard Town, Tikul, and Copan, many of these buildings
                    are covered with inscriptions, the key to the deciphering of which has not yet
                    been discovered. Notwithstanding certain divergences, seen especially at
                    Lorillard, all belong obviously to the same writing system. But whether that
                    system is purely ideographic, phonetic, or intermediate cannot be asserted with
                    any certainty, although Holden, who has attacked the problem from a fresh
                    standpoint, declares emphatically that they are not phonetic, “except in so far
                    as their rebus character may make them in a sense phonetic.” He claims by his
                    system to have fixed the order in which the inscriptions are to be read (in
                    lines left to right, in columns vertically downwards), and fancies he has
                    determined the meaning of three characters representing Maya divinities. But
                    Holden is ignorant of the Maya-Quiché language, of which a few manuscripts have
                    been rescued from the fury of the early Spanish iconoclasts. One of these
                    documents, the <hi rend="italic">Popol-Vuh,</hi> written or copied about 1558
                    from an older Quiché book, has been edited and even translated by Brasseur de
                    Bourbourg. This uncritical writer makes use of a so-called Maya-Quiché alphabet
                    preserved by Diego de Landa, first bishop of Yucatan, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Relacion</hi> or history of the Mayas. But the alphabet in question is
                    admittedly extremely defective and inadequate to interpret the native writings,
                    and has even been pronounced “a Spanish fabrication” by Dr Valentini,<note

                    view which Holden appears to endorse. The puzzle thus remains still unsolved,
                    and no safe inference can be drawn beyond the fact that the inscriptions and
                    manuscripts are composed in a highly conventional form of writing, and probably
                    in more than one Maya-Quiché dialect.</p>
                <p>Other difficult questions connected with the origin and antiquity of the Maya
                    culture, and the nature of its relations to that of Mexico, will be found
                    discussed under <hi rend="smallcaps">Mexico</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi>
                    But, since that article was written, fresh materials have been collected and
                    published which help to throw some further light on these obscure subjects.
                    Unfortunately Μ. Charnay, who since the time of Stephens and Catherwood has
                    undoubtedly contributed most to our knowledge of the Central-American remains,
                    has revived in an exaggerated form the old views of Morelet, Orozco y Berra, and
                    others regarding the Toltec origin of all these monuments. This observer sees
                    everywhere the clearest evidences, not merely of Toltec influences, which are
                    obvious enough, but of the Toltec institutions themselves, of the Toltec
                    religion, architecture, and civilization, to the exclusion of all others in
                    Central America. He even boldly traces on the map the lines of a twofold Toltec
                    migration, from Tula along the Atlantic and from Toluca along the Pacific side,
                    to their junction at Copan in Honduras, some few centuries before the discovery
                    of the New World. But our faith in the soundness of these views is greatly
                    shaken when we find Μ. Charnay identifying the Toltecs themselves somewhat
                    wildly with Malays, Indo-Chinese, and other Asiatic races. Some of the present
                    populations of Yucatan are even pronounced to be “a cross between the Malay and
                    the Chinese,” and all the exploded theories are thus revived of an Asiatic
                    origin of the civilized inhabitants of the New World and of their cultures. But,
                    as Ober well remarks, the evidence is cumulative in favour of the independent
                    evolution of these cultures. Late contact,—that is, contact since the remote
                    Stone Age,—with the inhabitants of the eastern hemisphere has been either of the
                    most casual nature or else as shadowy as the Atlantis itself, which is seriously
                    referred to in this connexion by otherwise sane writers, but which was obviously
                    as pure an invention of Plato as the Utopia was of Sir Thomas More.</p>
                <p>An essential condition of the Toltec theory is the assumed recent, or
                    comparatively recent, date of all the Central-American monuments, and Charnay
                    has certainly dispelled the extravagant ideas at one time prevalent regarding
                    the hoary antiquity of some of these remains. He has shown in particular that no
                    argument in favour of great age can be drawn from the size of the trees by which
                    many of them are overgrown. By actual experiment ho has proved that the
                    concentric circles of these trees correspond, not to so many years, as had been
                    supposed, but rather to so many months, if not even to shorter periods of
                    growth. Thus collapse the extravagant estimates of 2000 years (Waldeck) or 1700
                    (Lorainzar) assigned to the buildings on this assumption. At the same time some
                    of the cities were already forgotten ruins at the time of the conquest, and many
                    of the structures date evidently back to a period prior to the Toltec migrations
                    southwards. The bas-reliefs of Kabah also clearly show that these Toltecs,
                    probably of Nahua stock and closely related to the Aztecs, already found the
                    land occupied by a civilized people, able to record on stone monuments their
                    triumphs over the northern invaders. Some of these monuments themselves equal,
                    if not surpass, in artistic taste and workmanship anything the Toltec builders
                    are known to have produced on the Anahuac plateau. They also present many
                    distinctive features, especially in their design and decorative parts, while the
                    inscriptions are altogether different from those of the Aztecs as seen in extant
                    manuscripts. The conclusion seems inevitable that the Maya-Quiché culture was an
                    independent growth, brought in later times under Nahua influences, the relations
                    being perhaps somewhat analogous to those existing between the Graeco-Bactrian
                    and Indian or the Moorish and Spanish in the Old World.</p>
                <p>At the time of the conquest a great part of Central America was found to be
                    occupied, as it still is, by peoples related, at least in speech, to the Maya
                    inhabitants of Yucatan. The numerous branches of this widespread family ranged
                    from Tamaulipas (about the Tropic of Cancer) southwards to north Honduras and
                    San Salvador (14° N. lat.). But the chief divisions were the Mayas of Yucatan
                    and the Quichés of Guatemala, whence the compound term Maya-Quiché collectively
                    applied to the whole race. Owing partly to the uncertainty of their mutual
                    affinities, but mainly to tho confusing and inconsistent nomenclature of the
                    early Spanish and later writers, the classification of the various Maya-Quiché
                    nations presents serious difficulties, some of which have not yet been overcome.
                    In the subjoined scheme are embodied the results of the researches of De
                    Bourbourg, Berendt, Stoll, and others in this intricate branch of ethnology

                <p>Yucatan is still almost entirely inhabited by the same Maya race that was found
                    in possession of the land at the time of the discovery. About five-sixths of the
                    population are of nearly pure Maya stock and speech, the Spanish and mestizo
                    elements being mostly confined to the large towns. The mestizos are said to be
                    the handsomest on the continent, while the full-blood natives are perhaps the
                    least characteristic of all the aboriginal populations. They have the coarse
                    black and straight hair, the arched nose, and the reddish-brown complexion
                    common to most of the primitive inhabitants of America. But they can be readily
                    distinguished from all of them by their regular features, low cheek-bones, small
                    mouth and ears, straight jaws, frank expression, and a certain air of refinement
                    betraying descent from a highly cultured people. “It would be difficult,” says
                    Charnay, “to find among the rural classes of Europe men of a better build, or
                    with more intelligent and open countenances.” Although generally peaceful,
                    patient under oppression, and even somewhat indolent, their history since the
                    conquest (1547) has not been wholly uneventful. After more than two centuries of
                    passive resistance, there was a general revolt in 1761, brought about by the
                    intolerable misrule of the Spanish administration. The declaration of
                    independence (1821) was followed in 1824 by the union with the Mexican
                    confederacy, which continued without interruption till 1840. In that year an
                    independent republic was set up in Yucatan, which, however, was suppressed in
                    1843. Then came the general uprising of the natives in 1846, when Mexico was
                    engaged in a disastrous war with the United States. To quell the revolt, the
                    ruling classes were obliged to call in the aid of the Mexicans (1847-53),
                    whereby the peninsula again lost its autonomy, and was divided (1861) into the
                    two federal states of Yucatan and Campeche. But the rebellion was not entirely
                    suppressed, and many of the natives, withdrawing eastwards to the coast-lands
                    beyond the Sierra Alta, have hitherto defied all the efforts of the authorities
                    to reduce them.</p>
