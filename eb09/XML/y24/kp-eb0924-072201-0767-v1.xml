                <p><label type="entry">Y</label></p>
                <p>The history of this symbol has already been given under U. The three symbols U,
                    V, Y are only differentiations of one original form.</p>
                <p>The sound of <hi rend="italic">y</hi> in Greek was that of French <hi
                        rend="italic">u</hi> in “lune” and German <hi rend="italic">ü</hi> in
                    “übel.” In Boeotian and Laconian Greek the old <hi rend="italic">u</hi>-sound
                    was retained; but it was represented by oυ, a digraph which had also the value
                    of <hi rend="italic">u</hi> in other dialects where it arose from phonetic
                    change, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in τoὑs (for <hi rend="italic">τόvs</hi>).
                    The name <hi rend="italic">ὔ ψιλόν</hi> was probably given to distinguish it
                    from ὔ διά <hi rend="italic">διφθόγγου,—</hi> that is, the same sound, but
                    denoted by oι, which in the 2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> was
                    beginning to have the value of υ <hi rend="italic">;</hi> just so ἕ <hi
                        rend="italic">ψιλόν</hi> is opposed to αι, or ἕ <hi rend="italic">διà
                        διφθόγγου.</hi> The difference in sound between the full and the modified
                        <hi rend="italic">u</hi> is this: for the first the lips are rounded as much
                    as possible, and the back part of the tongue is raised towards the palate; for
                    the second the rounding of the lips is the same, but the tongue is in the
                    position for <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> so that in sounding <hi rend="italic"
                        >ü</hi> we are sounding <hi rend="italic">i</hi> with the lips rounded in
                    addition. This explains the ease with which the ι-sound is produced instead of ü
                    by persons unfamiliar with the latter sound: when an Englishman pronouncing
                    “Müller” says “Miller,” he puts the tongue right for <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                    but omits to round the lips as well. This change has been a regular one in our
                    language. There is no doubt that <hi rend="italic">y (i.e., ü)</hi> was a sound
                    of Early English (or Anglo-Saxon), as of the other Teutonic languages, in words
                    like “fÿr” (fire), “synn” (sin); it was the “umlaut” of <hi rend="italic"
                    >u</hi>, especially when followed in the next syllable by <hi rend="italic"
                        >i</hi> or <hi rend="italic">e</hi>; so “burg” has for gen. and dat.
                    “byrig,” orig. “burges,” “burge.” But in Middle English <hi rend="italic">y</hi>
                    passed into <hi rend="italic">i</hi>: thus “fÿr” (sounded as für) came to be
                    sounded as “fir” (feer), and this (as in other cases where ī occurs) was
                    diphthongized in comparatively modern times into “fire” (faior). Thus in the
                    middle of a word <hi rend="italic">y</hi> lost its special value; on the other
                    hand, at the beginning of a word it easily passed into the consonant <hi
                        rend="italic">y,</hi> the value which it has regularly in modern English.
                    This explains the fact that the English language had no symbol for the sound of
                    French « when this sound was re-introduced into England after the Norman
                    Conquest. Accordingly the French symbol as well as the sound was taken: it is
                    found in words like “muse,” “lute,” sounded as “myyz,” “lyyte.” The <hi
                        rend="italic">yy</hi> gradually developed into the <hi rend="italic">iu</hi>
                    sound with which we are familiar in “miūz,” “liūt”; but the spelling remained
                    unchanged. It must have been awkward to have the symbol « representing both the
                    full (native) sound and the modified (French) sound; this was partially obviated
                    by borrowing for the full «-sound the French writing <hi rend="italic">ou:
                        e.g.,</hi> “hūs” was written “house,” without at first any change of sound;
                    but this was not consistently carried out. Much later, at the end of the 16th
                    century, the sound was diphthongized into “haus” (as now), but the spelling (o«)
                    remained. The fact that <hi rend="italic">y</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                    became indistinguishable led to the use of <hi rend="italic">y</hi> at the end
                    of a word instead of <hi rend="italic">i</hi>: thus we write “day” instead of
                    the older “dai.”</p>
                <p>In Early English we find the symbol 3 (which is a modification of the Anglo-Saxon
                        <hi rend="italic">f)</hi> used initially with the value of <hi rend="italic"
                        >g</hi>, and medially (chiefly before <hi rend="italic">t</hi>) where modern
                    English writes <hi rend="italic">gh,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">light.</hi>
                    This is due to French scribes, who used the French <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi>
                    our modern) form of <hi rend="italic">g</hi> for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi>-sound, and then the 3 for the sound which had been weakened in
                    Anglo-Saxon from <hi rend="italic">g</hi> to <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> as in <hi
                        rend="italic">yard</hi> (our <hi rend="italic">yard)</hi> for original <hi
                        rend="italic">gard</hi> (Norse <hi rend="italic">garth</hi>; in North
                    English Aysgarth and Gatesgarth). About the 15th century this same symbol was
                    mistaken for <hi rend="italic">2,</hi> and as such it is still occasionally
                    employed in cursive, when 3 is written instead of 2.</p>
