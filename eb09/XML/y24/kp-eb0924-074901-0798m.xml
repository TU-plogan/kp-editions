                    narrow picturesque streets, the remains of ancient walls, and many churches and
                    other buildings of considerable architectural interest. The Ouse is crossed by
                    three bridges for general traffic,—the Ouse bridge, of three elliptical arches,
                    erected 1810-20 where a bridge had stood from time immemorial; Lendal bridge,
                    opened in 1863, a handsome structure of iron, consisting of a single arch 175
                    feet in span; and Skeldergate bridge, 1880, constructed of iron resting on stone
                    piers. The Foss is crossed by five bridges. Of the old Roman city there are some
                    remains of the fortifications, including ten sides of a thirteen-sided building
                    called the multangular tower, occupying one of <pb break="no"

                    lower part of the wall leading from this tower to Bootham Bar, the upper part of
                    the wall being of later origin. The walls of the English city, enclosing a much
                    wider area, though they have undergone reconstruction at various periods and
                    were much battered during the siege of the city in 1644, are in remarkably good
                    preservation, especially the portion to the west of the Ouse. They contain
                    Norman and Early English architecture, but the bulk of the walls are in the
                    Decorated style. There are four principal gates or “bars” —Micklegate Bar, at
                    the southern entrance to the city, where the heads of traitors were formerly
                    exposed, consist-</p>
                <p>1684. It formed the keep or donjon of the later fortress, which was dismantled at
                    the Civil War and converted into a prison. The debtors’ prison, erected in 1708,
                    and the North and East Riding assize courts, erected in 1777, are also included
                    within the castle wall, which was constructed in 1836.</p>
                <p>The cathedral of St Peter, if surpassed by some other English cathedrals in
                    certain special features, is as a whole the most striking and imposing specimen
                    of ecclesiastical architecture in England. It is in the form of a Latin cross,
                    consisting of nave with aisles, transepts, choir with aisles, a central tower,
                    and two western towers. The extreme external length is 524 feet 6 inches, the
                    breadth across the transepts 250 feet, the height of the central tower 213 feet,
                    and the height of the western towers 202 feet. The material is magnesian
                    limestone. The cathedral occupies the site of the wooden church in which King
                    Edwin was baptized by Paulinus on Easter Day 627.</p>
                <p>ing of a square tower built over a circular arch, probably Norman, with embattled
                    turrets at the angles; Bootham Bar, the main entrance from the north, having
                    also a Norman arch; Monk Bar, on the Scarborough road, the most imposing of the
                    four, probably belonging to the 14th century, formerly called Goodramgate, which
                    after the Restoration was changed to Monk Bar in honour of General Monk; and
                    Walmgate Bar, belonging to the time of Edward I. and retaining the barbican
                    rebuilt in 1648. Of the Norman fortress built by William the Conqueror in 1068
                    some portions were probably incorporated in Clifford’s Tower, which was partly
                    destroyed by fire in</p>
                <p>After his baptism Edwin, according to Bede, began to construct “a large and more
                    noble basilica of stone,” but it was partly destroyed during the troubles which
                    followed his death, and was repaired by Archbishop Wilfrid. The building
                    suffered from fire in 741, and, after it had been repaired by Archbishop Albert,
                    was described by Alcuin as “a most magnificent basilica.” At the time of the
                    Norman invasion the Saxon cathedral, along with the library of Archbishop
                    Egbert, perished in the fire by which the greater part of the city was
                    destroyed, the only relic of it now remaining being the central wall of the
                    crypt. It was reconstructed by Archbishop Thomas of Bayeux (1070-1100); but of
                    this building few portions now remain. The apsidal choir and crypt were
                    reconstructed by Archbishop Roger (1154-91), the south transept by Archbishop
                    Walter de Gray (1215-55), and the north transept and central tower by John
                    Romanus, treasurer of the cathedral (1228-56). With the exception of the crypt,
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n800/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0800-0751"/> the transepts are the oldest portions of the
                    building now remaining. They represent the Early English style at its best, and
                    the view across the great transept is unsurpassed for architectural effect. The
                    south transept is the richest and most elaborate in its details, one of its
                    principal features being the magnificent rose window; and the north transept
                    contains a series of beautiful lancet windows called the Five Sisters. The
                    foundation of the new nave was laid by Archbishop Romanus (1285-96), son of the
                    treasurer, the building of it being completed by Archbishop Melton about 1345.
                    The chapter-house was built during the same period. The west front, consisting
                    of a centre and two divisions corresponding with the nave and aisles, is one of
                    the finest features of the whole building, and has been described as “more
                    architecturally perfect as a composition and in its details than that of any
                    other English cathedral,” the great window above the door being, in the words of
                    Mr Britton, “an unrivalled specimen of the leafy tracery that marks the style of
                    the middle of the 14th century.” In 1361 Archbishop Thoresby (1352-73) began the
                    lady chapel and presbytery, both in the Early Perpendicular style. The
                    rebuilding of the choir, begun about the same period, was not completed till
                    about 1400. It is a very fine specimen of Late Perpendicular, the great east
                    window being one of the finest in the world. With the rebuilding of the choir
                    the whole of the ancient Norman edifice was removed, the only Norman
                    architecture now remaining being the eastern portion of the crypt of the second
                    period, built by Archbishop Roger (1154-91). To correspond with later
                    alterations, the central tower was re-cased and changed into a Perpendicular
                    lantern tower, the work being completed in 1444. The south-west tower was begun
                    in 1432 during the treasurership of John de Bermingham, and the north-west tower
                    in 1470. With the erection of this tower the church was completed as it now
                    stands, and on 3d February 1472 it was re-consecrated by Archbishop Neville. On
                    2d February 1829 the woodwork of the choir was set on fire by Jonathan Martin, a
                    madman. On 2d May 1840 a fire broke out in the southwest tower, reducing it to a
                    mere shell. The cathedral within recent years has undergone extensive
                    restoration.</p>
                <p>Next to the cathedral the most interesting building in York is St Mary’s Abbey,
                    situated in Museum Gardens, founded for Benedictines by Alan, earl of Richmond,
                    and latterly one of the most powerful ecclesiastical establishments in England,
                    its head having the rank of a mitred abbot with a seat in parliament. The
                    principal remains of the abbey are the north wall and the ruins of the church,
                    in the Early English and Decorated style, and the principal gateway with a
                    Norman arch. The hospitium, a curious building of wood, is now used as a museum
                    of antiquities, and contains a fine collection of Roman remains discovered in
                    the vicinity. A considerable portion of the abbey was employed for the erection
                    of the king’s manor, a palace for the lord president of the north, now occupied
                    as a school for the blind. In the gardens is also situated the ambulatory of St
                    Leonard’s hospital, founded by King Athelstan and rebuilt by Stephen. Besides
                    the cathedral, York possesses a large number of churches of special
                    architectural interest, including All Saints, North Street, Decorated and
                    Perpendicular, with a spire 120 feet in height; Christ Church, with south door
                    in the Decorated style, supposed to occupy the site of the old Roman palace;
                    Holy Trinity in Goodramgate, Decorated and Perpendicular with Perpendicular
                    tower; Holy Trinity, Micklegate, in a dilapidated condition, with Roman masonry
                    in its foundation walls; St Denis, Walmgate, with rich Norman doorway and Norman
                    tower; St Helen’s, St Helen’s Square, chiefly Decorated; St John’s, North
                    Street, chiefly Perpendicular; St Lawrence, without the bar of Walmgate, with
                    rich Norman doorway; St Margaret’s, Walmgate, celebrated for its curiously
                    sculptured Norman porch and doorway; St Mary the Elder, Bishophill, Early
                    English and Decorated, with brick tower, rebuilt in 1659; St Mary the Younger,
                    Bishophill, with a square tower in the Saxon style, rebuilt probably in the 13th
                    century; St Mary, Castlegate, with Perpendicular tower and spire 154 feet in
                    height; St Michael-le-Belfry, founded in 1066, but rebuilt in 1538 in the Late
                    Perpendicular style; and St Olave, Mary-gate, Perpendicular, said to have been
                    founded by Siward, earl of Northumberland. Among the principal secular buildings
                    are the guild hall, with a fine old room in the Perpendicular style, erected in
                    1446, and containing a number of stained-glass windows; the mansion-house, built
                    in 1725 from designs by the earl of Burlington; the assembly rooms, erected in
                    1730, also from designs by the earl of Burlington, with the concert-room
                    adjoining, built in 1823; the corn exchange; the infantry barracks; the cattle
                    market; the theatre, founded by Tate Wilkinson in 1765, and lately re-faced in
                    the Gothic style by the corporation, who own the property; the De Grey rooms for
                    balls and concerts; the fine old merchant’s hall; the merchant tailors’ hall;
                    and the masonic hall. The public institutions of a learned or educational
                    character include the Yorkshire Philosophical Society, whose museum in the
                    Grecian style was opened in February 1830; the subscription library, instituted
                    1784, and containing upwards of 20,000 volumes; the York institute of science
                    and literature, established in 1827, and removed to the present premises in
                    1846; the Wilberforce school for the blind; the York fine art and industrial
                    institution; and the Government school of art. The charities include the York
                    county hospital, the union workhouse, the dispensary, Colton’s hospital for 8
                    poor men, Harrison’s hospital, Dorothy Wilson’s hospital (founded in 1777) for
                    16 poor women, Sir Arthur Ingram’s hospital (founded in 1640) for 10 poor
                    widows, and the old maids’ hospital for 10 poor spinsters. The principal schools
                    are St Peter’s cathedral grammar-school (originally endowed in 1557), Archbishop
                    Holgate’s grammar-school, the York and diocesan grammar-school, and the
                    blue-coat school for boys (founded in 1705), with the associated grey-coat
                    school for girls.</p>
                <p>In modern times York has ceased to retain its commercial importance; but it
                    possesses several iron foundries, railway engineering works, a large glass
                    factory, breweries, flour-mills, tanneries, glove manufactories, and
                    confectionery and other minor establishments. Within its municipal limits the
                    city of York constitutes a separate division of the county of York; the
                    municipal city and the ainsty are for parliamentary purposes included in the
                    North Riding, for registration purposes in the East Riding, and for all other
                    purposes in the West Riding. The parliamentary city of York, which formerly
                    extended beyond the municipal limits, is partly in the North and partly in the
                    East Riding, The corporation consists of a lord mayor, 12 aldermen, and 36
                    councillors. The city returns two members to parliament. In 1884 the boundaries
                    of the city were extended to include the townships of Holgate and St Olave, and
                    part of the townships of Clifton, Dringhouses, Fulford, Heworth, and
                    Middlethorpe. The population of the municipal borough (area 1979 acres) was
                    43,796 in 1871 and 49,530 in 1881, and that of the parliamentary borough (area
                    2789 acres) 50,765 in 1871 and 60,343 in 1881. The new area is about 3553 acres,
                    with a population estimated at over 70,000 in 1888.</p>
                <p>York, the British name of which was Caer-Ebroc, was chosen by the Romans as an
                    important depot after the conquest of the Brigantes by Agricola in 79 and named
                    <hi rend="italic">Eboracum.</hi> Ultimately it became the military capital and
                    centre of the Roman power in Britain. The original Roman city was rectangular in
                    form, about 650 yards by 550, and built somewhat after the plan of ancient Rome
                    on the east bank of the Ouse. In York the emperors sat in the praetorium, and a
                    temple was erected there to Bellona. The first emperor to take up his residence
                    in York was Hadrian, when he visited Britain in 120. Severus died at York in
                    February 211, and his body is supposed to have been burnt at Severus’s Hill, a
                    short distance south of the city. Constantius Chlorus also died at York in July
                    306, and his son Constantine the Great was there inaugurated Roman emperor.
                    Early in the 7th century the city, under the name of Eoforwic, became the
                    capital of the Bretwaldas. Edwin after his conversion in 627 made it an
                    archbishop’s see. The province of York, of which Paulinus was the first bishop,
                    formerly included a great part of Scotland, but is now confined to the six
                    northern dioceses of England. From the time of Archbishop Egbert (732-766) York
                    became celebrated as a school of learning and under Alcuin was one of the most
                    famous places of education in Europe. The city was one of the principal Danish
                    settlements and seats of commerce, its population in 990 being estimated at
                    30,000. It was the capital of the Danish jarl; and Siward is stated to have died
                    at York in 1055 and to have been buried in St Olave’s church. After the death of
                    Edward the Confessor York was captured by Harold Hardrada, who, however, was
                    shortly afterwards defeated and slain at Stamford Bridge. It was captured by
                    William I. in 1068 and to guard it he erected a tower; but it was re-taken and
                    the whole Norman garrison put to death. In revenge for their slaughter William,
                    on re-capturing the city after a siege of six months, devastated the country
                    between York and Durham. In 1175 Henry II. held the first English parliament at
                    York, when Malcolm of Scotland did homage for his kingdom. The city was
                    frequently visited by subsequent monarchs, and was the scene of important
                    conventions and parliaments. After the suppression of the rebellion known as the
                    Pilgrimage of Grace in 1569, the Council of the North was established at York.
                    The city was besieged during the Civil War by the Parliamentary troops, to whom
                    it surrendered on 16th July 1644. York received its first charter of
                    incorporation from Henry I.</p>
