                    area of 992,870 square miles—as large as one-half of European Russia—has Tobolsk
                    and Tomsk on the W., Yakutsk and Irkutsk on the E., northwestern Mongolia on the
                    S., and the Arctic Ocean on the N. (see vol. xxii. pl. L). Its southern
                    extremity being in 51° 45' N. lat. and its northern (Cape Tcheluskin) in 77°
                    38', it combines a great variety of orographical types, from the Sayan alpine
                    regions in the south to the <hi rend="italic">tundras</hi> of the Arctic
                    littoral.</p>
                <p>The border-ridge of the high plateau of north-western Mongolia, which is known
                    under the general name of the Western Sayans, and reaches altitudes of from 7000
                    to 8000 feet, limits it in the south. This is girdled on the north-western slope
                    by a zone, nearly 100 miles wide, of alpine tracts, characterized by narrow
                    valleys separated by several parallel chains of mountains, which are built up of
                    crystalline slates, from 6000 to 7000 feet high. Here in the impenetrable
                    forests only a few Tungus families find a precarious living by hunting. Towards
                    the south, in the basins of the tributaries of the Tuba, the Sisim, and the Yus,
                    and in those of the Kan, the Aguł, and the Biryusa, the valleys of the alpine
                    tracts contain rich auriferous deposits, and numerous gold-washings have been
                    established along the <hi rend="italic">taiga.</hi> In 53° 10' N. lat. the
                    Yenisei emerges from the mountain tracts into the wide steppes of Abakan and
                    Minusinsk, from 1500 to 2000 feet above sea-level, which extend along the base
                    of the mountain region north-eastwards<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0787-0742"/> towards the upper Lena. A flattened ridge of
                    mountains, hardly attaining more than 3000 to 3500 feet, shoots north-east from
                    the Kuznetskiy Alatau (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Tomsk)</hi> and separates the
                    dry steppes of Minusinsk and Abakan from the next terrace of plains, from 1200
                    to 1700 feet in height, which also stretches in a north-eastern direction from
                    Barnaul in the Altai to Krasnoyarsk, and into the upper basin of the Vilui.
                    Another system of mountains, known under the general name of the Yeniseisk
                    Taiga, rises on the outer border of this terrace, in the space between the Upper
                    Tunguska, or Angara, and the Podkamennaya Tunguska. This system consists of
                    several parallel chains running south-west to north-east, from 2500 to 3500 feet
                    in altitude, though they are much lower on the left bank of the Yenisei, and
                    passing on north-eastwards into the basin of the Olenek. For many years past the
                    Yeniseisk Taiga has been one of the richest auriferous regions of Siberia, not
                    so much on account of the percentage of gold in its alluvial deposits (which are
                    poor in comparison with those of Olekminsk) as on account of the facilities for
                    supplying the gold-fields with articles of food produced in the steppes of
                    Minusinsk.</p>
                <p>Beyond the Yeniseisk Taiga begin the lowlands, which at no point rise more than a
                    few hundred feet above the sea and which slope gently towards the Arctic Ocean.
                    They are covered with lakes, thin forests, and marshes; and, as they approach
                    the ocean, they assume more and more the characters of barren tundra, devoid of
                    tree vegetation and covered with lichens. Beyond 70° N. lat. trees occur only
                    along the courses of the rivers. Two ranges, however, break the monotony of the
                    lowlands,—the Tungusskiy ridge, which stretches north-east between the Khatanga
                    and Anabara rivers, and the Byrranga Mountains, which run along the
                    north-western shore of the Taimyr peninsula.</p>
                <p>The shores of the Arctic Ocean are indented by deep estuaries, that of the Taz
                    penetrating 600 miles into the interior of the continent, and that of the
                    Yenisei 300 miles. Gyda Bay, between the estuaries of the Ob and the Yenisei,
                    and Taimyr, Thaddeus, and Khatanga Bays, are wide and deep indentations,
                    ice-bound almost all the year round. Taimyr peninsula, which protrudes as a
                    massive block of land between the Yenisei and the Khatanga, is an utterly barren
                    stony tundra.</p>
                <p>In the south are the granites and granitic syenites of the border-ridge of the
                    plateau. In the alpine region all varieties of crystalline slates—gneisses,
                    diorite slates, talc and mica-schists, and clay slates—are found, the latter
                    being auriferous, and the whole intersected with dykes and veins of protogene,
                    diorites, porphyry, marble, and quartz. The same crystalline rocks are met with
                    in the Kuznetskiy Ałatau, the Yeniseisk Taiga, and the Byrranga Mountains. The
                    plains are built up of Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Triassic
                    limestones and sandstones, with extensive freshwater deposits of the Jurassic
                    period. Chalk and Eocene deposits are met with farther north. The mountain
                    region bears traces of extensive glaciation, and the lowlands of having been
                    covered during the post-Glacial period with immense lakes and marshy tundras,
                    where thousands of mammoths and rhinoceroses were buried, along with other (now
                    fossil) representatives of extinct Tertiary and post-Tertiary mammals. All the
                    country gives evidence of having been covered with numberless lakes during the
                    Lacustrine period.</p>
                <p>Yeniseisk is exceedingly rich in all kinds of metals and minerals. Gold dust
                    appears in three different regions,—the northern Yeniseisk Taiga, where 100,740
                    oz. of gold were extracted in 1884; the region of the Kuznetskiy Ałatau and its
                    spurs, with the basins of the Tuba, Sisim, and Black and White Yus (25,860 oz.
                    in 1884); and the upper parts of the tributaries of the Kan and Aguł (12,540
                    oz.), where the gold-washings merge into those of the Nijne-Udinsk district of
                    Irkutsk. Silver ore is found at several places in the basin of the Abakan, but
                    the mines have been abandoned. Iron ore occurs almost everywhere in south
                    Yeniseisk, but there is only one ironwork on the Abakan (25,000 cwts. in 1884).
                    Salt lakes are very common, and about 50,000 cwts. of salt are extracted every
                    year.</p>
                <p>The whole of Yeniseisk is watered by the Yenisei and its affluents. The Yenisei
                    rises in north-western Mongolia in several branches (Bei-khem, Ulu-khem,
                    &amp;c.), the chief of which, the Ulu-khem, has its source in marshes to the
                    west of Lake Kossogol at a height of more than 5000 feet. As far as the Russian
                    frontier its course crosses the plateau at an altitude of not less than 3000
                    feet; on entering Yeniseisk it pierces the great border-ridge and the series of
                    parallel chains of the alpine region. At Sayansk (53° 10' N. lat.) it emerges
                    from the highlands and traverses the elevated steppes, receiving the Abakan on
                    the left and the Tuba on the right. In 55° N. lat. it suddenly turns to the
                    north-east, skirting the base of a low range of hills, on the northern slope of
                    which flows the Tchulym, a tributary of the Ob, separated from the Yenisei by an
                    isthmus only 6 miles in width. The possibility of connecting at this point the
                    two great river-systems of Siberia has often been discussed; the difficulty is
                    that the Tchulym valley is 440 feet higher than the other. A little below
                    Krasnoyarsk the Yenisei is joined by a great tributary, the Kan, and farther
                    north by the Angara or Upper Tunguska, which brings the waters of Lake
                    Baikal<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to
                    recent measurements, the Angara, where it issues from Lake Baikal, has a volume
                    of 121,400 cubic feet per second (<hi rend="italic">Izvestia,</hi> East Siberian
                    Geogr. Soc., xvii., 1886).</p></note> and is navigable from Irkutsk,
                    notwithstanding a series of rapids in its middle course. The right-hand
                    tributaries of the Ob,—the Ket, the Tym, and the Vakh,—approach the Yenisei so
                    closely, and their sources are so thoroughly inosculated with those of the
                    left-hand tributaries of the Yenisei, that the question of connecting the two
                    systems by means of a canal has been more than once raised; indeed something has
                    been done to connect the Great Kas, a tributary of the Yenisei, with the Ket,—a
                    boat with some 150 cwts. of cargo having already passed from the one to the
                    other.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to
                    Baron Aminoff’s measurements, Lake Bolshoye, through which the canal would have
                    to pass, is 66 feet above the Ket at its junction with the Ozernaya, and 181
                    feet above the Yenisei at its junction with the Kas.</p></note> A railway across
                    the narrow isthmus between the Tchulym and the Yenisei is now regarded as the
                    best solution of the question. In 61° N. lat. the Yenisei, already more than two
                    miles broad, divides into several branches, which wind amidst many islands, and
                    has several dangerous rapids. Then, before piercing a ridge of hills, it expands
                    into a kind of lake, 10 miles across, just above its junction with the
                    Podkamennaya Tunguska. Almost exactly at the Arctic Circle, opposite Turukhansk,
                    it receives from the right another large tributary, the Lower Tunguska, which
                    rises within a short distance of the upper Lena. The Yenisei, thus augmented,
                    becomes more than 6 miles wide in lat. 68°. Its estuary begins at the village of
                    Dudino, and has a breadth of 40 miles; it contains numberless islands. The great
                    river narrows once more (12 miles) before entering the Arctic Ocean (Yenisei
                    Bay), after a total course of more than 3000 miles. It is navigable on its
                    middle and lower courses, steamers plying between Krasnoyarsk and Minusinsk, as
                    also on the lower Yenisei. Its mouth has been visited almost every year of late
                    by steamers from Norway or Great Britain; and it is expected that regular
                    communication will be established between Dudino and European ports.</p>
                <p>The climate, though very severe throughout, offers, as might be expected, great
                    varieties. The Minusinsk steppes have a dry and relatively mild climate, so that
                    they are sometimes called the Italy of Siberia. At Krasnoyarsk (55° 1' N. lat.)
                    the climate is more severe, and the winds are exceedingly disagreeable. The
                    yearly fall of snow is so small that the winds blow it away in the neighbourhood
                    of the town; hence a circuit has to be made by the convoys of sledges to avoid
                    it, or the sledges changed for wheeled carriages. Yeniseisk (58° 27' N. lat.)
                    has an average temperature below freezing-point, and at Turukhansk the coldest
                    month (February) has an average temperature of - 24° Fahr. On the Taimyr
                    peninsula the average summer temperature hardly reaches 45°. For additional
                    particulars, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Siberia,</hi> vol. xxii. p. 6.</p>
                <p>The highlands of Sayan and Alatau are thickly clothed with forests of cedar,
                    pitch-pine, larch, elder, and birch, with a rich undergrowth of rhododendrons,
                    <hi rend="italic">Berberis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ribes</hi>; the Scotch
                    fir appears only in the lower and drier parts of the valleys. The summits and
                    slopes of the mountains are strewn with débris and boulders, and thickly sheeted
                    with lichens and mosses; but there are also patches of meadow land covered with
                    flowers, most of which are known in Europe. Still, the flora is poor as a rule,
                    and Dr Martianoff, after several years’ collecting, succeeded in gathering only
                    104 species of phanerogams.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    steppes of the Abakan at once strikes the traveller by the variety and
                    brilliancy of its forms. The meadows are covered with bright flowers scattered
                    amid the common <hi rend="italic">Gramineae,</hi> and in June and July they are
                    adorned and perfumed by the <hi rend="italic">Polygala, Dianthus, Medicago,

                    familiar in Europe, but attaining in Yeniseisk a larger size and greater
                    brilliancy of colour. The rich carpet of grass and flowers is overtopped by the
                    tall white blossoms of <hi rend="italic">Archangelica</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    attractive, on account of their wealth in anemones, violets, gentians, and so
                    on, and the numerous creepers which festoon the trees and shrubs. Μ.
                    Mar-tianoff's lists enumerate a total of 760 flowering and 760 cryptogamic
                    plants. Of the lower <hi rend="italic">Fungi</hi> and parasitical <hi

                    the Siberian lowlands (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Siberia,</hi> vol. xxii. p. 7).

                    numbers (only a few hundreds). The Kaibals, the Katcha Tartars, the Sagais, the

                    maintain their national features; but the Karagasses, the Kotts, and the
                    Arintses have almost entirely disappeared, and are represented only by a few

                    “settled” exiles. The “indigenes”— Tartars, Tunguses, Ostiaks, &amp;c.—number
                    about 50,000.</p>
                <p>The chief occupation of the Russians is agriculture, which prospers in Minusinsk,
                    the granary of the province; it is also carried on in west Kansk, Krasnoyarsk,
                    and Atchinsk, and in a few villages of the Yeniseisk district, the total area of
                    land under com being reckoned at nearly 2,500,000 acres. Wheat, summer and
                    winter rye, oats, barley, and buckwheat are the chief crops. Gardening is
                    carried on in Minusinsk. Cattle-breeding is important, especially in Minusinsk.
                    It has been estimated that there are in Yeniseisk about 270,000 horses, 240,000
                    cattle, 300,000 sheep, and 30,000 reindeer in Turukhansk. These figures,
                    however, must be below the true ones. The cattle being kept throughout the
                    winter in the steppes, the snow-storms of early spring prove disastrous, as also
                    do the murrains, to which no fewer than 200,000 head succumbed in the Minusinsk
                    district in 1881. Hunting and fishing are an important resource for most of the
                    indigenes and for many of the Russians.</p>
                <p>The manufactures of Yeniseisk are hardly worth mentioning, all capital being
                    engaged in gold-washing or in commerce. The chief trade is in furs (exported),
                    and in groceries and manufactured goods (imported). The gold-fields of the
                    Yeniseisk Taiga are supplied with grain and cattle by river from the Minusinsk
                    region, and with salt, spirits, and iron by the Angara. Attempts have recently
                    been made to stimulate the trade in tea with north-west Mongolia.</p>
                <p>Yeniseisk is divided into five districts, the chief towns of which are <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Krasnoyarsk</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> the capital,
                    which had 17,155 inhabitants in 1884; Atchinsk (7190) and Kansk (4050), two
                    small towns on the great Siberian highway, of which the latter is an entrepôt
                    for the gold-mines; Minusinsk (8270) on the Tuba, close by its junction with the
                    Yenisei, which has now a small but excellent natural history and ethnographical
                    museum; and Yeniseisk (7050), the chief entrepôt for the gold-mines, having a
                    public library and a natural history museum, created of late by exiles.
                    Turukhansk (139) is the chief town of a vast “region” <hi rend="italic"
