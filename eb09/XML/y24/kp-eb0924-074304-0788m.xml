                    off' from all sides of the branch, but which, owing to a twist in the base of
                    the leaf, become arranged in a single series on each side of it. The trees are
                    usually dioecious: the male flowers are borne on one individual and the female
                    on another, although instances occur in which flowers of both sexes are formed
                    on the same tree. The male flowers are more or less globular and occur in the
                    axils of the leaves. They consist of a number of overlapping brownish scales,
                    gradually increasing <pb break="no"

                    naked stalk that bears at its summit a head of anthers. Each anther has a flat
                    five-lobed top, something like a shield; from its under surface five, six, or
                    more pollen cases hang down, and these open lengthwise to liberate the globose
                    pollen-grains. Each flower thus consists of a number of monadelphous stamens;
                    but, according to the older view of its structure, each stamen constitutes of
                    itself a single flower, the whole mass being considered as an amentaceous
                    inflorescence or catkin of numerous monandrous flowers. The female flowers are
                    also placed each separately in the axil of a leaf, and consist of a number of
                    overlapping scales, as in the male. These scales surround a cup which is at
                    first shallow, green, and thin, but which subsequently becomes fleshy and red,
                    while it increases so much in length as almost entirely to conceal the single
                    straight seed. It is clear that the structure of the female flower differs from
                    that of most conifers; but the structure of the wood and other characters forbid
                    its being separated from them except as a subdivision <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Taxaceae).</hi></p>
                <p>The poisonous properties, referred to by classical writers such as Caesar,
                    Virgil, and Livy, reside chiefly if not entirely in the foliage. This, if eaten
                    by horses or cattle, especially when it has been cut and thrown in heaps so as
                    to undergo a process of fermentation, is very injurious. The leaves have also
                    been used for various medicinal purposes, but are seldom employed now. The
                    succulent portion of the yew berry is quite harmless; but it is probable that
                    some noxious principle is contained in the seed. As, however, it is hard and
                    disagreeable to the taste, the danger from this source is not great. As a timber
                    tree it is used for cabinet-work, axle-trees, bows, and the like, where strength
                    and durability are required.</p>
                <p>The yew occurs wild over a very large area of the northern hemisphere. In
                    north-eastern America and in Japan trees are found of a character so similar
                    that by some botanists they are all ranged under one species. The varieties
                    grown in the United Kingdom are very numerous, one of the most striking being
                    that known as the Irish yew,—a shrub with the pyramidal or columnar habit of a
                    cypress, in which the leaves spread from all sides of the branches, not being
                    twisted, as they usually are, out of their original position. In the ordinary
                    yew the main branches spread more or less horizontally, and the leaves are so
                    arranged as to be conveniently exposed to the influence of the light; but in the
                    variety in question the branches are mostly vertical, and the leaves assume a
                    direction in accordance with the ascending direction of the branches.</p>
                <p>The yew is a favourite evergreen tree, either for planting separately or for
                    hedges, for which its dense foliage renders it well suited. The wood is very
                    hard, close-grained, and of a deep red brown colour internally. Its younger
                    branches, owing to their toughness, were formerly used for bows. The planting of
                    the yew in churchyards was at one time supposed to have been done with a view to
                    the supply of yew staves. But, while importation from abroad was fostered, there
                    seems to have been no statute enforcing the cultivation of the yew in Great
                    Britain; on the other hand, a statute of Edward I. (cited in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gard. Chron.,</hi> 6th March 1880) states that the trees were often planted in
                    churchyards to defend the church from high winds. Be this as it may, yews of
                    huge size and great antiquity still exist in various parts of the country in the
                    vicinity of churches. Some of these are of historic interest; but it is hardly
                    prudent to cite either the measurements or the allegations as to age, the
                    circumstances under which the estimates were framed being different in each
                    case. Accurate comparative measurements made on a uniform plan would be very
                    serviceable. The Crowhurst yew, mentioned by Evelyn as 30 feet in circumference,
                    was still in existence in 1876 (<hi rend="italic">Gard. Chron.,</hi> 22d July
                    1876). The large yew at Ankerwyke near Staines, with a trunk 27⅔ feet in
                    circumference, might well have been in existence in 1215, when Magna Charta was
                    signed. Considerable interest also attaches to the fine yew in Buckland
                    churchyard near Dover, which in 1880 was removed to a distance of 60 yards. The
                    trunk had been split so that it had a direction nearly parallel with the soil.
                    This huge tree was moved with a ball of soil round its roots, 16 feet 5 inches
                    by 15 feet 8 inches, by 3 feet 6½ inches in depth, the weight of the entire mass
                    being estimated at 56 tons. The dimensions of the tree in 1880 were as
                    follows—“circumference of the main trunk, 22 feet; of the upright portion of the
                    trunk, 6 feet 10 inches; second horizontal trunk, 10 feet 10 inches; do., south
                    limb forking off at 9 feet from the main trunk, 7 feet 10 inches; do., west limb
                    forking off at 9 feet from the main trunk, 8 feet 8 inches; extent of branches
                    from centre of main trunk southwards, 30 feet 10 inches, and from north to south
                    48 feet; they extend from the main trunk westward 33 feet.” The tree was
                    replanted so that the horizontal portions were replaced in their original erect
                    position and the natural symmetry restored <hi rend="italic">Hard. Chron.,</hi>
