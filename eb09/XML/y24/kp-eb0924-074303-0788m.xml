                    buildings. A few of the houses are of considerable antiquity, but within recent
                    years the town has undergone much alteration. The church of St John the Baptist,
                    occupying a commanding site in the centre of the town, is a large and beautiful
                    cruciform structure in the Perpendicular style, consisting of chancel, nave of
                    seven bays, aisles, transepts, and lofty western tower. It is described by Mr
                    Freeman as “a grand and harmonious whole, as truly the work of real artistic
                    genius as Cologne or Winchester.” There are two ecclesiastical parishes within
                    the borough, Hendford and Yeovil Marsh. The principal secular public buildings
                    are the town-hall in the Grecian style, erected in 1849, and the corn exchange.
                    There are a reading room and a library in connexion with the young men’s
                    Christian association and mutual improvement society. The benevolent
                    institutions include Woborne’s almshouses for six men and six women, the
                    portreeves’ almshouses, and a few smaller charities. Water is obtained from
                    Holywell, 8 miles distant, by works constructed by the corporation. Formerly the
                    woollen manufacture was of some consequence, but this industry has now died out.
                    The staple industry is the manufacture of gloves, for which the town has long
                    been celebrated. Brewing and brick-making are also carried on. The agricultural
                    trade of Yeovil is of some importance, large corn markets and cattle and horse
                    fairs being held. The corporation consists of a mayor, four aldermen, and twelve
                    councillors, who hold the manorial rights and also form the urban sanitary
                    authority. The town has a commission of the peace, and petty sessions are held
                    both by the county and the borough magistrates. The population of the municipal
                    borough and urban sanitary district (area about 700 acres) in 1871 was 8527, and
                    in 1881 it was 8479.</p>
                <p>Yeovil was a borough by prescription. Anciently it was called the town, borough,
                    lordship, and hundred of Yeovil, and was included in a district which soon after
                    the Conquest was taken possession of by the crown. The manor of Yeovil included
                    in this district was some time afterwards assigned to the rector of St John the
                    Baptist church, and was incorporated under the name of the portreeve and
                    burgesses of Yeovil. In 1418 it was resigned by the rector to Henry V., who gave
                    the manor to the convent of the Virgin Mary and Saint Bridget. The grant was
                    confirmed by Edward IV. After the dissolution of the monasteries the manor was
                    settled by Henry VIII. on Catherine Parr, who held it till her death. In 1449
                    the town was visited by a fire, by which 117 houses were destroyed. In 1853
                    Yeovil was placed under the Municipal Act.</p>
