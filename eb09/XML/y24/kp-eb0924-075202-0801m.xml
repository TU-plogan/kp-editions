                    of a royal line. It may be said, indeed, that his claim, at the time it was
                    advanced, was rightly barred by prescription, the House of Lancaster having then
                    occupied the throne for three generations, and that it was really owing to the
                    misgovernment of Margaret of Anjou and her favourites that it was advanced at
                    all. Yet it was founded upon strict principles of lineal descent, and was
                    certainly a strong one, if it could only be maintained that hereditary right did
                    not suffer from interruption. For the duke was descended from Lionel, duke of
                    Clarence, the third son of Edward III., while the House of Lancaster came of
                    John of Gaunt, a younger brother of Lionel. The House of Lancaster, therefore,
                    had been clearly in wrongful possession of the throne, and Richard, duke of
                    York, claimed it as the true heir. One thing which might possibly have been
                    considered an element of weakness in his claim was that it was derived through
                    females,—an objection actually brought against it by Chief-Justice Fortescue.
                    For Lionel, duke of Clarence, left only a daughter, Philippa, who married Edmund
                    Mortimer, third earl of March; and the male line of the Mortimers also failed on
                    the death of Edmund, the fifth earl, whose sister, and ultimately his sole heir,
                    Anne, married Richard, earl of Cambridge, and became by him the duke of York’s
                    mother. But a succession through females could not reasonably have been objected
                    to after Edward Iii.’s claim to the crown of France; and, apart from strict
                    legality, the duke’s claim was probably supported in the popular estimation by
                    the fact that he was descended from Edward III. through his father no less than
                    through his mother. For his father, Richard, earl of Cambridge, was the grandson
                    of Edmund, duke of York, fifth son of Edward III.; and he himself was the direct
                    lineal heir of this Edmund, just as much as he was of Lionel, duke of Clarence.
                    His claim was also favoured by the accumulation of hereditary titles and
                    estates. The earldom of Ulster, the old inheritance of the De Burghs, had
                    descended to him from Lionel, duke of Clarence; the earldom of March came from
                    the Mortimers, and the dukedom of York and the earldom of Cambridge from his
                    paternal ancestry. And in addition to all this his own marriage with Cecily
                    Neville, though she was but the youngest daughter of Ralph, first earl of
                    Westmoreland, allied him to a powerful family in the north of England, to whose
                    support both he and his son were greatly indebted.</p>
                <p>The reasons why the claims of the line of Clarence had been so long forborne are
                    not difficult to explain. Roger Mortimer, fourth earl of March, was actually
                    designated by Richard II. as his successor; but he died the year before Richard
                    was dethroned, and his son Edmund, the fifth earl, was but a child at Henry
                    IV.’s usurpation. Henry took care to secure his person; but the claims of the
                    family troubled the whole of his own and the beginning of his son’s reign. It
                    was an uncle of this Edmund who took part with Owen Glendower and the Percies;
                    and for advocating the cause of Edmund Archbishop Scrope was put to death. And
                    it was to put the crown on Edmund’s head that his brother-in-law Richard, earl
                    of Cambridge, conspired against Henry V. soon after his accession. But this was
                    the last attempt made in favour of the family for a long time. The plot was
                    detected, being revealed, it is said, by the earl of March himself, who does not
                    appear to have given it any encouragement; the earl of Cambridge was beheaded.
                    The popularity gained by Henry V. in his French campaigns secured the weak title
                    of the House of Lancaster against further attack for forty years.</p>
                <p>Richard, duke of York, seems to have taken warning by his father’s fate; but,
                    after seeking for many years to correct by other means the deplorable weakness
                    of Henry VI.’s government, he first took up arms against the ill advisers who
                    were his own personal enemies, and at length claimed the crown in parliament as
                    his right. The Lords, or such of them as did not purposely stay away from the
                    House, admitted that his claim was unimpeachable, but suggested as a compromise
                    that Henry should retain the crown for life, and the duke and his heirs succeed
                    after Henry’s death. This was accepted by the duke and an Act to that effect
                    received Henry’s own assent. But the Act was repudiated by Margaret of Anjou and
                    her followers, and the duke was slain at Wakefield fighting against them. In
                    little more than two months, however, his son was proclaimed king at London by
                    the title of Edward IV., and the bloody victory of Towton immediately after
                    drove his enemies into exile and paved the way for his coronation.</p>
                <p>We need not follow the vicissitudes of Edward’s reign, of which a brief account
                    will be found under <hi rend="smallcaps">Edward</hi> IV. (vol. vii. p. 684).
                    After his recovery of the throne in 1471 he had little more to fear from the
                    rivalry of the House of Lancaster. But the seeds of distrust had already been
                    sown among the members of his own family, and in 1478 his brother Clarence was
                    put to death—secretly indeed, within the Tower, but still by his authority and
                    that of parliament—as a traitor. In 1483 Edward himself died; and his eldest
                    son, Edward V., after a nominal reign of two months and a half, was put aside by
                    his uncle, the duke of Gloucester, who became Richard III., and then caused him
                    and his brother Richard, duke of York, to be murdered. But in little more than
                    two years the usurper was defeated and slain at Bosworth by the earl of
                    Richmond, who, being then proclaimed king as Henry VII., shortly afterwards
                    fulfilled his pledge to marry the eldest daughter of Edward IV. and so unite the
                    Houses of York and Lancaster.</p>
                <p>Here the dynastic history of the House of York ends, for its claims were
                    henceforth merged in those of the House of Tudor. But the family history has
                    still much to do with the story of those reigns. For, although the union of the
                    Roses ought to have extinguished controversy, a host of debatable questions and
                    plausible pretexts for rebellion still remained. The legitimacy of Edward IV.’s
                    children had been denied by Richard III. and his parliament, and, though the Act
                    was denounced as scandalous, the slander might still be re-asserted. The duke of
                    Clarence had left two children, a son and a daughter, and the attainder of their
                    father could not be a greater bar to the crown than the attainder of Henry VII.
                    himself. Seeing this, Henry had, immediately after his victory at Bosworth,
                    secured the person of the son, who was named Edward, earl of Warwick, and kept
                    him a prisoner in the Tower of London. Yet a formidable rebellion was raised in
                    his behalf by means of Lambert Simnel, who, personating the prisoner in the
                    Tower, professed to have escaped, went to Ireland, and, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0802-0753"/> after being actually crowned as king in
                    Christchurch cathedral, Dublin, came over with a host of Yorkist sympathizers
                    into England, where he was defeated and taken prisoner at the battle of Stoke in
                    1487. The earl of Warwick lived for twelve years later in unjust confinement,
                    and was ultimately put to death in 1499 because he had consented to a plot for
                    his own liberation. As to his sister Margaret, she was married to one of Henry
                    VII.’s Welsh followers, Sir Richard Pole (or Poole), and could give no trouble,
                    so that, when Henry VIII. came to the throne, he thought it politic to treat her
                    with kindness. He made her countess of Salisbury, reversed her brother’s
                    attainder, created her eldest son, Henry, Lord Montague, and caused one of her
                    younger sons, Reginald, who displayed much taste for learning, to be very
                    carefully educated. This, however, was the very thing which involved the whole
                    family in ruin. For Henry looked to the learning and abilities of Reginald Pole
                    to vindicate before Europe the justice of his divorce from Catherine of Aragon;
                    and, when Pole not only was unable to comply but was conscientiously compelled
                    to declare the very opposite, the king’s indignation knew no bounds. Pole
                    himself was safe, having secured some time before a retreat in Italy. He was
                    even, for his great merits, made a cardinal by the pope. But this only made
                    matters worse for his family at home: his brother, Lord Montague, and even his
                    mother, the aged countess of Salisbury, were beheaded as traitors because they
                    had continued to correspond with him. Cardinal Pole, however, came back to his
                    own country with great honour in the reign of Queen Mary, and was made
                    archbishop of Canterbury on the deprivation of Cranmer.</p>
                <p>Two nephews of this cardinal, named Arthur and Edmund Poole, are the last members
                    of the family whom it is needful here to mention. Early in the reign of Queen
                    Elizabeth, being ardent young men, they conspired to go over to the duke of
                    Guise in F rance, hoping to return with an army into Wales and so promote the
                    claims of Mary Queen of Scots to the crown of England, for which service the
                    elder, Arthur, expected to be restored to the dukedom of Clarence. The result
                    was that they were condemned to death, but were only imprisoned for the rest of
                    their days in the Tower, where they both carved inscriptions on the walls of
                    their dungeon, which are still visible in the Beauchamp tower.</p>
                <p>There was yet another branch of the House of York which might have given trouble
                    to the Tudors, if they had not been very narrowly watched and ultimately
                    extinguished. Of the sisters of Edward IV. the eldest, Anne, who married the
                    duke of Exeter, left only one daughter by her second husband, Sir Thomas St
                    Leger; but the second, Elizabeth, married John de la Pole, duke of Suffolk, and
                    had several children of both sexes. Their eldest son was created earl of Lincoln
                    during his father’s life, and Richard III., after the death of his own son, had
                    designated him as his successor. Disappointed of a kingdom by the success of
                    Henry VII., he joined in Simnel’s rebellion and was killed at the battle of
                    Stoke. His brother Edmund thus became heir to his father; but in the reduced
                    circumstances of the family he agreed to forbear the title of duke and take that
                    of earl of Suffolk. He continued for some years in favour with the king, who
                    made him a knight of the Garter; but, having killed a man in a passion, he fled
                    abroad and was for some time entertained at the court of the emperor Maximilian
                    and afterwards of Philip, king of Castile, when resident in the Low Countries,
                    before his departure for Spain. But Philip, having been driven on the English
                    coast when going to take possession of his Spanish kingdom, was entertained at
                    Windsor by Henry VII., to whom he promised to deliver up the fugitive on
                    condition that his life should be spared. Edmund de la Pole accordingly was
                    brought back to his native country, to be lodged in the Tower for the remainder
                    of his days. And, though the promise to spare his life was kept by the king who
                    gave it, his son Henry VIII. caused him to be executed in 1513, when war broke
                    out with France, apparently for treasonable correspondence with his brother
                    Richard, then in the French service. After his death Richard de la Pole,
                    remaining in exile, called himself earl of Suffolk, and was flattered
                    occasionally by Francis I. with faint hopes of the crown of England. He was
                    killed at the battle of Pavia in 1525. There were no more De la Poles who could
                    advance even the most shadowy pretensions to disturb the Tudor dynasty.</p>
