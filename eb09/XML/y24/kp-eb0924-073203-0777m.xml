                <p><label type="entry">YAWS</label> is the name in use in the British West Indies
                    and on the West Coast of Africa for a peculiar disease of the skin in Negroes.
                    The learned name, first applied by Sauvages (1761), is <hi rend="italic"
                    >framboesia,</hi> from the likeness of the typical excrescences to a raspberry.
                    For many years yaws was thought to be peculiar to the African Negro, either in
                    his home (both west and east coasts) or in the West Indies and Brazil. But a
                    disease the same in every respect has long been known in the East Indies (first
                    mentioned by Bontius early in the 17th century), affecting the Malays rather
                    than the Negroes, its chief seats being Amboyna, Ternate, Timor, Celebes, Java,
                    and Sumatra. It has been identified more recently by De Rochas and other
                    observers in New Caledonia and Fiji. The <hi rend="italic">parangi</hi> of
                    Ceylon has been shown by Kynsey to be the same as the West Indian yaws. Also in
                    the Samoa group, to which there has been no Negro migration, an identical malady
                    occurs. The closely allied <hi rend="italic">verrugas</hi> of the Peruvian Andes
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Wart)</hi> is so different in its endemic
                    circumstances that it is not usually classified as a form of yaws. The account
                    that follows applies equally to all of the local forms, while it has more
                    especial reference to yaws in the Negroes of the West Indies.</p>
                <p>The general course of the disease is as follows. Previous to the eruption there
                    may or may not be any disorder of health; in children (who form a large part of
                    the subjects of yaws) there will probably be rheumatic pains in the limbs and
                    joints, with languor, debility, and upset of the digestion; in adults of
                    ordinary vigour the eruption is often the first sign, and it is attended with
                    few or no constitutional troubles. The eruption begins as small pimples like a
                    pin’s head, smooth and nearly level with the surface; they have a little whitish
                    speck on their tops, grow rapidly, and reach the size of a sixpence or a
                    shilling. The pustules then break, and a thick viscid ichor exudes and dries
                    upon them as a whitish slough, and around their base as a yellowish brown crust.
                    Beneath the whitish slough is the raspberry excrescence or yaw proper, a reddish
                    fungous growth with a nodular surface. The favourite seats of the eruption are
                    the forehead, face, neck, armpits, groin, genitals, perinaeum, and buttocks.
                    Hairs at the seat of a yaw turn white. In young children or infants the corners
                    of the mouth ulcerate, as in syphilis, and the perineal excrescences resemble
                    condylomata. The pustules and excrescences do not all arise in one crop: some
                    are found mature while others are only starting. If the patient be of sound
                    constitution and good reaction, the yaws may reach the full size of a mulberry
                    in a month, in which case they will probably be few; but in persons of poor
                    health they may take three months to attain the size of a wood-strawberry, in
                    which case they will be numerous inversely to their size. Often there is one yaw
                    much larger than the rest, and longer in falling; it is called the “master yaw”
                    or “mother yaw.” On the soles of the feet (less often on the palms of the hands)
                    the bursting yaws are as if imprisoned beneath the homy cuticle; they cause
                    swelling and tenderness of the foot, until set free by paring the callous skin
                    down to the quick; these yaws are called “crab yaws” or <hi rend="italic"
                    >tubbas.</hi> Usually a yaw is painless unless when rubbed or irritated. The
                    absence of pain is used as a diagnostic sign if there be any doubt as to the
                    nature of the attack: a pustule is opened, and a little of the juice of capsicum
                    dropped into it; if it be a yaw, no smarting will be felt. In some cases a few
                    yaws will show themselves long after the primary attack is over; these are
                    called “memba yaws” (from “remember ”), the term being sometimes applied also to
                    protracted cases with successive crops of eruption. Six weeks is the average
                    time in a good case, from the first of the eruption to the fall of the
                    excrescences; in such regular cases a scar remains, it may be for many months,
                    darker than the rest of the (Negro) skin. But the disease is often a much more
                    tedious affair, the more protracted type having become common in the West Indies
                    of recent years. In such cases the eruption comes out by degrees and as if with
                    difficulty, crop after crop; foul, excavating, and corroding ulcers may remain,
                    or a limb may be in part seamed and mutilated by the scars of old ulceration.
                    The scars after ulceration are not so dark as the skin around.</p>
                <p>That yaws is a communicable disease is beyond question; but that.it has always
                    arisen by conveyance of yawey matter from a previous case is neither proved nor
                    probable. Being to a great extent a disease of childhood, it is not usually
                    conveyed after the manner of syphilis, but by contact in other ways (as in the
                    epidemic syphilis of 1494-1520 and in recent circumscribed epidemics). An
                    abrasion or wound of the surface, such as a chigoe bite or a cut of the foot, is
                    a likely point of entrance for the virus. If the yawey matter finds access to a
                    pre-existing sore or ulcer, it causes the latter to take on a foul and sloughing
                    condition. No sore or yaw is induced at the point of infection, which will
                    probably be healed long before the eruption appears. It is said, however, that
                    the pustules appear earliest and in greatest numbers on the skin near the spot
                    where the virus entered. They follow the infection at an <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n778/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0778-0733"/> interval of several weeks (incubation period).
                    Cases of yaws by infection are not unknown in white persons of good position,
                    both children and adults, in the West Indies and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>The nature of the disease is obscure. It is alleged to be hereditary by some, and
                    denied to be so by others; the fact seems to be that some constitutions are much
                    more susceptible than others, and susceptible at some periods or states of
                    health more than at others. As an epidemic, the disease in a locality has
                    seasons of activity and quiet. One attack in childhood gives a large degree of
                    immunity for the rest of life. Yaws used to break out in the slaves on board
                    Guineamen. Both in Africa and among the slaves in the West Indies it was a
                    custom to inoculate the yaws, so as to get the attack over (called “buying the
                    yaws”) or to get put upon the sick list.</p>
                <p>As regards treatment, the malady in a person of good constitution runs its course
                    and gets well in a few weeks. Whatever tends to check the eruption, such as
                    exposure to chill, is to be avoided. <hi rend="underline">A</hi> week’s course
                    of cream of tartar and sulphur (confection of sulphur) at the beginning of the
                    illness is often resorted to, so as to bring the eruption well out. The patient
                    should remain indoors, in a well-aired room, and take daily warm baths and
                    diluent drinks. If the excrescences are flabby and unhealthy, it is an
                    indication for generous diet. Mercurial treatment is no longer in vogue. As
                    external applications, weak lotions of zinc or carbolic acid may be used, and,
                    if the excrescences are irritable, a watery solution of opium. Tedious and
                    unhealthy yaws should be dressed with a wash of sulphate of zinc or of copper;
                    the same may be applied to a yaw ulcer. The crab yaws of the horny soles or
                    palms, after they are let through by paring the cuticle, may be dusted with alum
                    powder. The most intractable cases occur in badly nourished and anaemic
                    subjects, and these will often go on for months in hospital without mending. Of
                    late in the West Indies the disease has become largely a <hi rend="italic"
                    >morbus miseriae,</hi> and to that extent less amenable to treatment.</p>
                <p>The date of the first appearance of yaws in the West Indies and Brazil is matter
                    of dispute; the general belief is that it came in with the African Negro. After
                    the emancipation in 1838 there was a marked decline in the prevalence of the
                    disease in Jamaica and other colonies. In Jamaica it began to be seen again from
                    1854 to 1864, the cases being more of adult age than formerly. The worst recent
                    centre of yaws has been Dominica, which is occupied by Negro communities
                    unprovided with medical attendance. In 1871 the Government opened and maintained
                    two special hospitals for yaws (under a board of commissioners), one at Morne
                    Bruce near Roseau, and the other at Prince Rupert’s. In Barbados and Antigua
                    cases of yaws are rarely seen, the population being more creole than Negro.
                    Trinidad has a good deal of the disease from time to time in the inland
                    villages; bad cases are admitted to the leper asylum at Port of Spain. In
                    Grenada, which has a special yaws hospital, and in St Vincent the immigration of
                    Hindu coolies received a check owing to the ravages made by the disease among
                    them. It prevails also in San Domingo, Guadeloupe, and others of the Antilles.
                    At Berbice and Essequibo there were 23 fatal cases in one year (1870). The
                    disease is common in all parts of Brazil. In western Africa cases are found
                    along the whole coast from the Senegal to the Congo, and in the interior
                    (Timbuktu and Bornu). On the East Coast it is found in Mozambique, Madagascar,
                    and the Comoros Its localities in the East Indies and islands of the Pacific
                    have been already mentioned.</p>
