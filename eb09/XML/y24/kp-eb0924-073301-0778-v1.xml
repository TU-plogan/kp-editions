                <p><label type="entry">YAZD, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Yezd</hi></label>, a city of
                    Persia, capital of the district of Yazd, province of Farsistán, in 31° 50' N.
                    lat. and 54° 25' E. long. Yazd stands on a flat sandy plain, about 50 miles
                    broad and encircled by an amphitheatre of picturesque hills, on the high road
                    between Ispahán and Karmán, 190 miles south-east of the former and 220
                    north-west of the latter place. The old and dilapidated walls enclose a very
                    large space, which, however, is much encumbered with ruins, the population
                    having fallen from about 100,000 at the beginning of the 19th century (Christie)
                    to about 30,000 in 1868 (Smith). Since the famine of 1870 the place has
                    recovered some of its former prosperity, and has at present (1888) an estimated
                    population of 50,000, including 1000 Jews and about 4000 fire-worshippers, Yazd
                    being the only town in Persia where these still form a separate community. There
                    are fifty mosques, sixty-five public baths, eight public schools, but no
                    building of any note except the chief mosque, a very old and decayed structure,
                    which still presents a lofty and imposing frontage. With the exception of a fine
                    new bazaar, which is well stocked with goods and much frequented the markets and
                    other parts of the town are irregularly planned, with narrow dark streets and
                    little life. Yazd is in fact a city of the wilderness, whose oasis, planted
                    chiefly with mulberries and other fruit trees, is everywhere surrounded by the
                    shifting sands, which at some points already threaten to encroach on the town
                    itself (Macgregor). In this way was engulfed its predecessor, Old Yazd or
                    Askizár, whose ruins are still visible 10 miles to the north-west on the road to
                    Kashan. Nevertheless the local traders maintain their old reputation for
                    intelligence and enterprise, and their agents still visit the distant markets of
                    India, Java, and China. The trade with India formerly carried on through Shiráz
                    now takes the more direct route through Karmán. The exports are chiefly sugar,
                    silks, opium (4000 chests in a single year to China), cordage, cotton, felts,
                    and copper; the imports wheat, rice, cotton goods, and henna. This henna,
                    together with rang for dyeing the hair, is brought from the Mináb and
                    Bandar-Abbás districts to be ground and prepared for the Persian market. From
                    the neighbouring villages and the remote province of Ghilán comes the raw
                    material for the silk-looms, which produce two kinds— <hi rend="italic"
                        >kasb</hi> and <hi rend="italic">aluhí</hi> —both of the very finest
                    quality. Other noted products of the local industries are the felts, equal to
                    the best in Karmán, and the candied sugars and sweetmeats, in the preparation of
                    which the fire-worshippers excel. A great drawback to Yazd is the defective and
                    irregular supply of water, which largely depends on the yearly snow and rainfall
                    on the surrounding hills. The annual revenue averages £35,000 to £40,000, of
                    which three-fifths go to the public treasury; the rest supports the local
                    administration and household of the governor, who resides in a kind of citadel
                    within the city walls</p>
