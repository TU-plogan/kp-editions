                    includes nearly the whole of the basin of the Lena, and covers an area of
                    1,517,127 square miles (nearly one-third of Siberia and almost one-fifth of the
                    entire Russian empire). It has the Arctic Ocean on the N., Yeniseisk on the W.,
                    Irkutsk, Transbaikalia, and Amur on the S., and is separated from the Pacific
                    (Sea of Okhotsk) only by the narrow Maritime Province (see vol. xxii. pl.
                    I.).</p>
                <p>The Vitim plateau, from 2500 to 3500 feet in altitude, and bordered on the
                    south-east by the Stanovoi Mountains, occupies the south-eastern portion of the
                    province. Its moist, elevated valleys, intersected by ranges of flat, domeshaped
                    hills, which rise nearly 1000 feet above the plateau, are unsuited for
                    agriculture, and form an immense desert of forest and marsh, visited only by
                    Tungus hunters, save in the south-west, where a few settlements of gold-miners
                    have lately sprung up. The high border-ridge of the plateau (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Siberia)</hi> stretches from the South Muya Mountains towards
                    the north-east, thus compelling the river Ałdan to make its great bend in that
                    direction. The ridge is almost entirely unknown, having been crossed by only two
                    geographers at points more than 500 miles apart. The alpine country fringing the
                    plateau all along its northwestern border is better known in the south-west,
                    where rich gold-mines are wrought in the spurs between the Vitim and the Lena;
                    and farther north-east it has been crossed by several geographers (Middendorff,
                    Erman, the Siberian expedition) on their way from Yakutsk to the Sea of Okhotsk.
                    The Lena, in that part of its course where it flows north-east, waters the outer
                    base of this alpine region. It is a wild land, traversed by several chains of
                    mountains, all having a north-eastern direction and intersected by deep, narrow
                    valleys, where wild mountain streams flow amidst immense boulders and steep
                    cliffs. The whole is covered with dense forests, through which none but the
                    Tunguses can find their way, and they only by means of marks made on the trees.
                    The summits of the mountains, ranging from 4000 to 6000 feet, mostly rise above
                    the limits of tree vegetation, but in no case pass the snow-line. Summits and
                    slopes alike are strewn with crystalline rock débris, mostly hidden under thick
                    layers of lichens, where only the larch, which sends out its roots horizontally,
                    can find support and sustenance. Birch and aspen grow on the lower slopes; and
                    where strips of alluvium have been deposited in the narrow bottoms of the
                    valleys thickets of poplar and willow make their ap pearance, or a few patches
                    of grassy soil are occasionally found. These last, however, are so rare that all
                    of them are known to the gold-diggers for scores of miles around their
                    settlements, and hay has to be brought at considerable cost from the lowlands.
                    All necessaries of life for the gold-diggings have to be shipped from Irkutsk
                    down the Lena, and deposited at entrepôts, whence they are <pb break="no"

                    their destination. A line drawn south-west and north-east, from the mouth of the
                    Vitim towards that of the Aldan, separates the mountain tracts from the elevated
                    plains (from 1500 to 2000 feet) which fringe the highlands all the way from the
                    upper Lena to Verkhne-Kołymsk, and probably to the mouth of the Kolyma. Immense
                    and sometimes marshy meadows extend over those plains in the south-west; farther
                    north mosses and lichens are the prevalent vegetation. The surface is much
                    furrowed by rivers and diversified by several mountain-chains (Verkhoyansk,
                    Tas-karyktakh, Kołymsk, and Ałazeya). Little is known as to the real character
                    of these mountains, although they are figured on maps as isolated ridges
                    shooting north-west from the highlands, between the chief rivers which flow into
                    the Arctic Ocean. Beyond the elevated plains vast tundras, covered with mosses
                    and lichens, stretch to the shores of the ice-bound ocean; only a few trees
                    succeed in the struggle for a miserable existence, though some isolated groups
                    penetrate farther north along the courses of the Lena, the Indighirka, and the
                    Kolyma, almost reaching in the first-named valley the seventy-second degree of
                    north latitude.</p>
                <p>The Arctic coast is indented by several bays—Borkhaya and Yana to the east of the
                    wide Lena delta, and Omul-yakh, Kolyma, and Tchaunskaya still farther to the
                    east. Islands have been explored as far as 78° N. lat. These fall into three
                    groups,—the Lyakhovskiye, the Anjou or New Siberian, and the De Long Islands.
                    The Medvyezhie (Bear) Islands off the Kolyma and the two Ayun Islands in
                    Tchaunskaya Bay are merely littoral. Wrangel’s Land seems to be the outer island
                    of a great and as yet unknown archipelago. The entire coast of Yakutsk is full
                    of memorials of the courageous explorations made in 1735-41 by Minin, Lapteff,
                    and Prontchischeff in small boats, without any of the modern appliances for
                    Arctic explorations, and Tchaunskaya Bay recalls the loss of Shałauroff's
                    expedition. The prospects of regular navigation recently raised by
                    Nordenskjöld’s bold circumnavigation of Asia seem unlikely to be fully realized,
                    the ice apparently having never again been in so favourable a condition as in
                    1878- 79. Every year, however, a narrow passage close by the coast is left
                    almost free of ice, enabling a ship or two to reach the estuary of the Yenisei,
                    or even the delta of the Lena.</p>
                <p>The great artery of Yakutsk, the Lena, rises on the western slope of the Baikal
                    Mountains, its sources being separated only by a narrow ridge from the great
                    Siberian lake. It soon issues from the mountain valleys, and flows over the
                    elevated plains, where it has carved a deep channel between horizontal layers of
                    Old Red Sandstone and further on of contorted beds of limestone. As far as
                    Yakutsk it maintains its north-eastern direction, with but one great bend in 60°
                    N. lat. and several small windings in its upper course. At Katchug—a
                    lading-place 180 miles north-east from Irkutsk—it is still shallow, but soon
                    becomes a mighty stream of much beauty, which is increased by the high crags and
                    mountains amidst which it has dug its channel. Though thus picturesque, its
                    valley can hardly be called hospitable: the narrow level stretches along the
                    base of the mountains are often marshy, while the raw and wet climate renders
                    agriculture most difficult; the villages are poverty-stricken, and in most of
                    them goitre is endemic. About 60° N. lat. the Lena receives from the right its
                    first great tributary, the Vitim (1400 miles in length), which after a very
                    sinuous course leaves the great plateau below Lake Oron, by a narrow gorge which
                    has not yet been visited by any geographer. It is navigable by steamers in its
                    lower course. The next large tributary of the Lena is the Olekma (about 800
                    miles), which also rises on the plateau and crosses it from south to north; it
                    is navigable only in the very lowest part of its course; higher up, its valley,
                    which offers the greatest difficulties for the traveller, has been utilized as a
                    route only by the Cossack conquerors of Siberia and by one of the members of the
                    Siberian expedition. The next important tributary, also from the right, is the
                    Ałdan (nearly 1300 miles), which first flows parallel to the Lena and then turns
                    north-westwards to join it, itself receiving on the left a large tributary, the
                    Amga. It is navigated from Ust-Maya. The only large tributary of the Lena on the
                    left is the Vilui (about 1300 miles), which has an immense drainage-area on the
                    lower plains, and since 1887 has been navigated by a steamer. At Yakutsk the
                    Lena becomes a magnificent stream of more than 4 miles in width, with numerous
                    islands, and this character it maintains for the next 1200 miles of its course,
                    sometimes reaching a width of 17 miles and a depth of 7 to 8 fathoms. It enters
                    the Arctic Ocean by a wide delta, occupying more than 250 miles of the
                    coast-line; here the river divides into seven or eight principal branches, the
                    chief of which vary from 35 to 65 miles in length, the largest being more than 6
                    miles broad. The bar, however, has only 8 feet of water, and the Swedish steamer
                    “Lena” had great difficulty in entering from the sea. The lower course of the
                    river is subject to terrible inundations when the ice breaks up on its upper
                    part, whilst at the same time the higher reaches of its lower course are still
                    covered with ice several feet in thickness. Large portions of the banks are then
                    torn away by the enormous masses of ice. The Olenek (1200 miles), which enters
                    the Arctic Ocean to the west of the Lena, is also a considerable river; the Yana
                    (1000 miles), Indighirka (950), and Kołyma (1000) to the east all rise in the
                    mountain region between 61° and 62° N. lat. and flow north and north-east into
                    the Arctic Ocean.</p>
                <p>The granites, granitic syenites, and gneisses of the high plateau are surrounded
                    by a variety of crystalline slates, Huronian and Laurentian; and vast layers of
                    Silurian and Devonian limestones and sandstones extend over large areas. Farther
                    north the Carboniferous, Chalk, and Jurassic formations are spread over a wide
                    region, and the whole is covered with layers of Glacial deposits in the
                    highlands and of post-Glacial elsewhere. The mineral wealth of Yakutsk is very
                    great; but gold (262,200 oz. in 1884) and salt (obtained from springs to the
                    amount of about 6000 cwts. annually) only are worked. Coal has been recently
                    discovered on the Vilui close by its mouth, as also on the lower Lena.</p>
                <p>Though there are spots in the North-American archipelago and in northern
                    Greenland where the cold is as intense as at Yakutsk, no region can be named
                    which has such extremes of cold and heat or winter temperatures so low, so long
                    continued, or spread over so immense an area. Verkhoyansk on the Yana (67° 34'
                    N. lat. and 134° 20' E. long.) is, in respect of cold, the pole of the Old
                    World; nowhere, even in Siberia, do we find such low winter temperatures: from
                    whatever quarter the wind may blow it cannot fail to bring a warmer temperature
                    to Verkhoyansk. Frosts of -76° Fahr. have been observed there, and the average
                    temperature of the three winter months is - 53°∙1; even that of March is but
                    little above the freezing-point of mercury (-37° ∙9). Neither Ust-Yansk (70° 55'
                    N. lat., but close to the sea coast), nor Yakutsk, nor even the polar station of
                    Sagastyr at the mouth of the Lena (73° 23' N. lat.), has a winter so cold and so
                    protracted. And yet at Sagastyr temperatures of - 63°∙6 were measured in
                    February 1883, and the average temperature of that month was only - 43°∙6. At
                    Yakutsk the average temperature of the winter is -40°∙2, and the soil is frozen
                    to a depth of 600 feet (Middendorff). Even at a depth of 382 feet the
                    temperature of the soil is 26° ∙4 Fahr. For further particulars, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Siberia,</hi> vol. xxii. p. 6. The Lena, both at Kirensk and at
                    Yakutsk, is free from ice for only 161 days in the year, the Yana at Ust-Yansk
                    for 105. While at Yakutsk only 145 days and at Verkhoyansk only 73 have no snow;
                    the interval between the latest frosts of one season and the earliest frosts of
                    the next is barely 37 days, and even less in the north.</p>
                <p>In spite of the rigours of its climate, the province of Yakutsk had 243,450
                    inhabitants in 1883, and the population is supposed to be increasing
                    notwithstanding the infectious diseases which sometimes sweep away whole
                    villages. The Russians constitute but a trifling element in the population; and
                    their villages, numbering scarcely twenty, are chiefly peopled by exiled
                    Nonconformists, belonging to the sects reputed “dangerous.” In 1879 there were
                    5100 exiles living in the towns or settled in the Yakut encampments, 5300
                    peasants (also formerly exiles), 1890 military, and 4100 artisans, merchants,
                    and officials. The remainder were chiefly Yakuts (211,900), and partly Tunguses
                    (10,400), with a few Yukaghirs, Lamuts, and Tchuktchis. The Yakuts belong to the
                    Turkish stem (see vol. xxiii. p. 661), and speak a dialect of Turkish, with an
                    admixture of Mongolian words. They call themselves Sokha (pl. Sokhalar), their
                    present name having been borrowed by the Russians from the Tunguses, who call
                    them Yeko or Yekot. Most probably they formerly inhabited southern Siberia, and
                    especially the upper Yenisei, where a Tartar stem calling itself Sakha still
                    remains in Minusinsk. They are middle-sized, have dark and rather narrow eyes, a
                    broad flat nose, thick black hair, and almost no beard. On the whole they are
                    healthy and reach an advanced age, are very laborious and enterprising, aud
                    display in schools much more intelligence than the Tunguses or Buriats. Their
                    implements show a great degree of skill and some artistic taste. They live in
                    log <hi rend="italic">yurtas</hi> with small windows, into which plates of ice
                    or pieces of skin are inserted instead of glass. A large fire is kept
                    continually burning in the middle of the yurta, which always has a wooden
                    chimney. The yιιrtas are usually at some distance from one another, but at the
                    same time are grouped into villages or <hi rend="italic">naslegs.</hi> During

                    conical tents, consisting of a few poles covered with prepared birch bark. Their
                    food is chiefly flesh, and their drink koumiss. Though nearly all are nominally
                    Christians, they retain much of their original Shamanism. Their settlements,
                    which formerly were limited to the valleys of the Lena and its northern
                    tributaries, are now steadily advancing southwards into the hunting domains of
                    the Tunguses, who give way before the superior civilization of the Yakuts.
                    Wherever they penetrate, even in the valleys at the base of the Vitim plateau
                    (Muya, Tchara), they always cultivate some barley, and carry on some trade.<note

                <p>Both the Russians and the Yakuts carry on some agriculture wherever possible in
                    the southern parts of the province; it was estimated in 1879 that 40,000
                    quarters of barley, summer rye, wheat, and oats were cropped in Yakutsk (23,000
                    quarters by the Yakuts). But cattle-breeding is the chief means of support; in
                    1879 there were in Yakutsk 130,400 horses of an excellent small, but most hardy
                    breed, 260,900 cattle, 49,000 reindeer, and several thousands of dogs, which are
                    used for travelling purposes. The hunting of the wild reindeer affords the chief
                    means of subsistence in the tundras; wealth or famine depends upon its success
                    or failure. The herds are attacked on the routes they pursue during their
                    migrations, especially where they have to cross a river. Farther north the
                    pursuit of water-birds, which come in innumerable flocks to breed on the lakes
                    of the tundras and the shores of the ocean, is a most important resource.
                    Fishing also is carried on even in winter from beneath the ice. The mountains
                    between the Lena and the Vitim have, during the last thirty years, become a most
                    important centre of gold-washings, and, notwithstanding the difficulties of
                    communication, and the necessity of bringing everything from Irkutsk or
                    Transbaikalia, the population of the goldmines of the Olekma and Vitim numbered
                    more than 13,000 in 1882. Thousands of workmen go every spring down the Lena to
                    work at the mines and return to their villages in autumn.</p>
                <p>The principal channel of communication in Yakutsk is the Lena. As soon as the
                    spring arrives, scores of boats are built at Katchug, Verkholensk, and Ust-Ilga,
                    and the goods brought on sledges in winter from the capital of Eastern Siberia,
                    including considerable amounts of corn and salt meat, are shipped down the
                    river. Steamers ply all along its course, and enter its tributary, the Vitim,
                    which is navigated almost to the gorges beneath Lake Oron. A few steamers
                    descend to the delta of the Lena, and return with cargoes of fish and furs.
                    There are very few overland routes. A new one, available for the transport of
                    live stock from Transbaikalia to the gold-mines of Olekma, was opened in 1869,
                    and cattle are brought every year from Transbaikalia, notwithstanding the
                    hardships of the 700 miles’ route across the plateau and the wild mountain
                    tracts. Two other routes, also mere footpaths, on which travellers and goods are
                    transported on horseback, radiate from Yakutsk to Ayan and to Okhotsk.
                    Manufactured goods and groceries, chiefly tea, rice, and sugar, were imported to
                    Yakutsk by the former route to the amount of some 1000 cwts. in 1883; these
                    goods cross the Stanovoi Mountains and the plateau on sledges as far as the
                    Maya, whence they are shipped to Yakutsk.</p>
                <p>The province is divided into five districts, the chief towns of which are— <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Yakutsk</hi> (see below), Sredne - Kołymsk (560), Olek-minsk
                    (500), Verkhoyansk (290), and Viluisk (390). Except Yakutsk, these “towns” are
                    but miserable villages. (P. A. K.)</p>
