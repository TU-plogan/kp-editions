                    small portion (of the municipal borough only) in Suffolk, is situated on a long
                    and narrow peninsula of sand, bounded on the west by the river Bure, the Breydon
                    (formed by the Yare and the Waveney), and the estuary of these rivers. It stands
                    on the Great Eastern and the Eastern and Midland Railway lines, 20 miles east of
                    Norwich and 122 <pb break="no"

                    Yarmouth was built chiefly along the eastern bank of the Yare, but within recent
                    years the town has extended beyond its ancient walls, of which some remains
                    still exist, to the seashore, where there are a marine drive and three piers—two
                    of them 700 feet long. The principal features of Yarmouth are the north and
                    south quays, and the straight narrow lanes, 145 in number, called “rows,”
                    running at right angles to them. These rows were at one time inhabited by the
                    wealthy burgesses, and many of the houses now tenanted by the poorer classes
                    have curiously panelled rooms, with richly decorated ceilings. The market place
                    of Yarmouth is one of the most spacious in the kingdom, its area being about
                    three acres. The old town of Great Yarmouth is connected with Little Yarmouth by
                    a bridge across the Yare of stone and iron, erected in 1854. The Bure is crossed
                    by a suspension bridge. The church of St Nicholas, founded in 1101 by Herbert
                    Losinga, the first bishop of Norwich (who removed the see from Thetford), and
                    consecrated in 1119, is one of the largest parish churches in England.
                    Originally it was in the form of a Latin cross, but only the tower of the
                    ancient building remains; and by successive alterations the form of the church
                    has been completely changed. The clerestoried nave in the Early English style,
                    with columns alternately octangular and circular, was rebuilt in the reign of
                    King John. A portion of the chancel is of the same date. About fifty years later
                    the aisles were widened, so that the nave is now the narrowest part of the
                    building. A grand west front with towers and pinnacles was constructed in
                    1330-38, but the building was interrupted by a visitation of the plague. Within
                    the church there were at one time eighteen chapels, maintained by guilds or
                    private families, but these were demolished by the Reformers, who sold the
                    valuable utensils of the building and applied the money to the widening of the
                    channel of the harbour. During the Commonwealth the Independents appropriated
                    the chancel, the Presbyterians the north aisle, and the Episcopalians were
                    allowed the remainder of the building. The brick walls erected at this time to
                    separate the different portions of the building remained till 1847. In 1864 the
                    tower was restored, and the east end of the chancel rebuilt; in 1869-70 the
                    south aisle was rebuilt; and in 1884 the south transept, the west end of the
                    nave, and the north aisle underwent restoration. The width of the nave is 26
                    feet, and its length to the tower 117, that of the tower 27 feet, and of the
                    chancel 92,—total 236 feet. The Roman Catholic church is a handsome Gothic
                    building erected in 1850. In 1551 a grammar school was founded, the great hall
                    of the dissolved hospital, founded in the reign of Edward I. by Thomas Fastolfe,
                    being appropriated as the building. The school was closed from 1757 to 1860,
                    when it was re-established by the charity trustees; and in 1872 new buildings
                    were erected. In the hospital school a number of boys and girls were formerly
                    boarded and educated, but since 1850 the charity has been administered as a
                    place of free education only. Among the other principal public buildings are the
                    town-hall and public offices, of red brick and red sandstone in the Queen Anne
                    style of architecture, with a tower 125 feet in height, erected in 1883; the
                    aquarium, erected in 1877 and extended in 1882; the old toll-house, formerly the
                    town-hall, a building of the 14th century, which has been carefully preserved as
                    a relic of antiquity; and the assembly and reading rooms, the drill-hall, the
                    custom-house, the barracks at Southtown, the bathhouse, the workhouse, the
                    public library, and two theatres. A Doric column, 144 feet in height, was
                    erected on the downs in 1817 to the memory of Nelson. Among the charitable and
                    benevolent institutions are the royal naval lunatic asylum, originally founded
                    as a lunatic hospital in 1811; the sailors’ home (1859), the boys’ home (1870),
                    the Walrond memorial smack-boys’ home (1875), the fishermen’s hospital (1702),
                    and Warne’s and various minor charities.</p>
                <p>Yarmouth Roads, except in east or north-east winds, afford excellent anchorage.
                    The present channel to the quays was made in 1567 by Joost Jansen, a Netherlands
                    engineer. It affords a depth of water at the bar of 12 feet, and at high water
                    of 18 to 20 feet. The town owes its origin to the fisheries, and is now one of
                    the chief fishing stations on the east coast of England, being specially famed
                    for its herring and mackerel fisheries (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Fisheries,</hi>
                    vol. ix. pp. 251-252), while cod and other white fish are also caught in great
                    quantities. The number of boats registered under the Fisheries Act in December
                    1886 was 439, employing from 4500 to 6100 men and boys. The boats engaged in
                    fishing are mostly trawling smacks. The curing of fish is an important industry,
                    Yarmouth bloaters being celebrated throughout the kingdom. A great stimulus was
                    given to the fishing trade by the erection of a fish wharf in 1869, having a
                    length of 2257 feet. There is a considerable inland trade on the rivers by means
                    of lighters and wherries. In 1883 the value of the imports of foreign and
                    colonial produce reached &lt;£285,742, and, although in 1886 it sank to
                    £173,636, the average for the five years preceding 1888 was about £235,000. The
                    value of the exports in 1882 was £3399 and in 1886 £14,706. The principal
                    imports are coal, timber, and provisions. The trade is chiefly with the Baltic
                    ports, France, Portugal, Spain, the Channel Islands, the United States, and
                    British North America. The number of vessels engaged in the foreign and colonial
                    trade that entered in 1886 was 191 of 38,134 tons, that cleared 99 of 18,299
                    tons. The number in the coasting trade was 1033 of 110,312 tons entered, and
                    1083 of 124,527 tons cleared. Steam-packets ply between London, Hull, and
                    Newcastle. Ship-building and boat-building are carried on chiefly in connexion
                    with the fisheries, the number built in 1886 being 11 of 781 tons. There are
                    also rope, twine, and trawl-net manufactories, silk-crape works, and extensive
                    maltings. Yarmouth is frequented in summer as a seaside resort. It is governed
                    by a mayor, twelve aldermen, and thirty-six councillors. The corporation act as
                    the urban sanitary authority. Water is obtained from one of the “broads” at
                    Ormesby. The borough has a separate commission of the peace and court of
                    quartersessions. The population of the municipal borough (area 3685 acres) was
                    41,819 in 1871 and 46,159 (9008 being in Gorleston in Suffolk) in 1881.</p>
                <p>At the close of the 5th century Yarmouth is said to have been the landing-place
                    of a Saxon invader Cerdic. At an early period it was resorted to by fishermen
                    from the Cinque Ports and from the Continent for the herring-fishing, who dried
                    their nets on the denes or downs, and also erected tents where they sold their
                    fish to merchants from London and elsewhere. At Domesday the place is described
                    as the king’s demesne, and as having seventy burgesses. Henry I. appointed a
                    provost as governor, and in the 9th year of John it received a charter of
                    incorporation. It received another charter from Henry III., who permitted the
                    inhabitants to enclose the borough with walls and moats. In 1338-39 the town
                    suffered severely from the plague, during which 7000 persons are said to have
                    died. In 1381 the rebels under Wat Tyler were defeated by the inhabitants of
                    Yarmouth. The town also rendered considerable assistance when England was
                    threatened by the Spanish Annada; in recognition of this Elizabeth empowered the
                    “bailiffs, burgesses, and commonalty" to hold an admiralty court, and extended
                    their liberties in other ways. In 1588 a castle was built in the centre of the
                    town, and a mound called the south mound raised and crowned with heavy ordnance.
                    The castle was demolished in 1621 and new fortifications thrown up, having a
                    circuit of 2½ miles. On account of the hardship experienced by the town from the
                    levying of ship-money by Charles I., it declared for the Parliament. At the
                    close of the war the fortifications were demolished. From an early period the
                    Cinque Ports had the power of sending bailiffs to Yarmouth to govern the town
                    during the herring-fishing season, <pb break="no"

                    being concurrent with that of the bailiffs of Yarmouth; but on account of the
                    jealousies that were thus created the privilege was abolished in the reign of
                    Charles II. Until the Act of William IV. the town was governed by a charter of
                    Queen Anne. It sent two members to parliament from the reign of Edward I. till
                    1867, when it was disfranchised; but by the Act of 1885 it was again allowed to
                    return one member. (T. F. H.)</p>
