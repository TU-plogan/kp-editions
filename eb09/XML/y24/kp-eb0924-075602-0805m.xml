                    Herbert Croft. The son of the dean of Sarum, educated at Winchester and Oxford
                    (New College and Corpus), Young obtained a law fellowship at All Souls in 1708,
                    and proceeded to use it as a base of operations for gratifying his “ruling
                    passion,” the love of fame. There was at the time an open career for young men
                    of talent who showed ability to recommend the policy and the persons of
                    statesmen in their struggle for power, and Young, full of unbounded energy and
                    eloquence, exuberant to eccentricity, joined in the race with a vigour that soon
                    raised him to distinction. He seems to have been for a time in the family of the
                    earl of Exeter as tutor; but the notorious marquis of Wharton (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Wharton)</hi> took a fancy to him, bribed him away from this
                    post with liberal promises of maintenance and patronage, settled two annuities
                    on him, and tried to get him into Parliament. Meantime Young began to publish
                    and to dedicate, the poems and the dedications taken together <hi rend="italic"
                    >(The Last Hay,</hi> 1713, and <hi rend="italic">The Force of Religion,</hi>
                    1714) showing the simple mixture of piety and worldliness that is one of the
                    notes of his character. He essayed tragedy, writing at mid-day with closed
                    shutters, by the light of a candle fixed in a human skull. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Busiris</hi> was performed at Drury Lane in 1719, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Revenge</hi> in 1721. Far from gloomy in the company of Wharton and his friends,
                    he had a decided bent for gloomy themes when alone, and a most copious and
                    lofty— often extravagantly lofty—eloquence in the treatment of them; a
                    paraphrase of the book of Job was one of his productions about this time. But he
                    showed equal facility in dashing and effective satire: his first great literary
                    success was made with the series of satires published between 1725 and 1728, and
                    collected in the latter year under the title <hi rend="italic">Love of Fame, the
                    Universal Passion.</hi> These satires do not bear comparison with Pope’s, to
                    which they pointed the way, but they have a charm of exuberant vitality and
                    power, an irregular abundance of wit and bold imagery, a frequent felicity of
                    diction, that entitle them to Johnson’s praise—“a very great performance”—and
                    enable us to understand the impression produced by Young in conversation. One of
                    the features in Young’s character that disarms resentment of his fulsome
                    adulation, and other extravagances and eccentricities, is his humorous
                    Falstaffian consciousness of his own faults. “Who can write the true absurd like
                    me ?” he cries in one of his satires. He abundantly proved this in <hi
                    rend="italic">Ocean: an Ode,</hi> with which he hailed the accession of George
                    II. Soon after, when nearly fifty, he took orders, was appointed a royal
                    chaplain, and presented by his college to the rectory of Welwyn. He was
                    disappointed in his desire of further promotion in the church; he had succeeded
                    some time before in extracting a pension of £200 from Walpole, and this favour
                    was cynically treated as a satisfaction in full of his claims on the Government.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Night Thoughts</hi> were published in separate “Nights”
                    between 1742 and 1744. In the preface Young said that “the occasion of this poem
                    was real, not fictitious, and that the facts mentioned did naturally force these
                    moral reflexions on the mind of the writer.” Croft has shown that this
                    statement, though justifiable in the main, has to be taken with some
                    qualifications, and that a common belief that Lorenzo was meant for the author’s
                    own son was undoubtedly a mistake. Still, it is true that Young’s wife, her
                    daughter, and her daughter’s husband died in rapid succession, and the poem —a
                    great work in spite of all its inequalities—was, like <hi rend="italic">In
                    Memoriam,</hi> the expression of a real sorrow and search for consolation. Young
                    continued to write occasionally even after he had passed his eightieth year. His
                    death took place on 12th April 1765.</p>

                    Young in Boswell’s <hi rend="italic">Johnson</hi> (see Birkbeck’s ed., iv. 119,
