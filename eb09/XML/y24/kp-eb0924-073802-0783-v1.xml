                    ancients is a mistranslation, the right hand being taken to mean “lucky”
                    (δϵξιόs, <hi rend="italic">dexter).</hi> Arabia Felix included all Arabia except
                    the peninsula of Sinai (Arabia Petraea) and the Syrian desert (Arabia Deserta):
                        <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it took in the Hijáz and Nejd as well as South
                    Arabia. The Arabs use the term Yemen in various extensions. A tradition of the
                    Prophet makes Yemen and Shám meet at Tabbák; but Abú ‘Abbás already confines the
                    name to all Arabia south of Mecca. This usage, which excludes Nejd and Hijáz
                    from Yemen, is not merely that of Moslem geographers, who take Mecca as their
                    imaginary standpoint, but is found in the heathen poets. When Imraolkais speaks
                    of a Yemenite trader, Tarafa, of tanned ox-hides from Yemen, Labíd of a youth
                    from Yemen who knew letters, or a poet of Hodhail of the excellent work of a
                    Yemenite smith, they all mean by Yemen the southern region where trade, letters,
                    and industry had their early home in the peninsula. The northern boundary of
                    Yemen is variously laid down. Al-Asma'í makes it a line drawn obliquely from
                    'Omán to Nejrán; but Hamdání rightly draws it farther north, from 'Omán and
                    Yebrín in the south of Yemáma by way of Al-Hujaira, Tathlíth, and Jorash to
                    Kodommol (Kotumble of the Admiralty chart, in lat. 17° 52'). In its narrowest
                    limitation Yemen comprises, not the whole south of the peninsula, but only the
                    south-west as far as Hadramaut, which was viewed as a dependency of Yemen. The
                    physical conformation of the south-western portion of the peninsula differs
                    greatly from that of Arabia proper, being similar to that of Ethiopia. A range
                    of mountains, which rises into peaks of considerable elevation, and descends
                    with a steep slope towards the shore of the Red Sea, stretches from the southern
                    extremity northwards as far as Táif. This range is pierced by several streams
                    and wadies, which flow into the Red Sea.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Sabaeans.—</hi> The ancient name of the people of Yemen was
                    Saba (Saba’ with final <hi rend="italic">hemza)</hi>; and the oldest notices of
                    them are in the Hebrew Scriptures. The list of the sons of Joktan in Gen. x.
                    26-29 contains in genealogical form a record of peoples of South Arabia which
                    must rest on good information from Yemen itself. Many of these names are found
                    on the inscriptions or in the Arabic geographers,—Sheba (Saba’), Hazarmaveth
                    (Hadramaut), Abimael (Abime'athtar), Jobab (Yuhaibib, according to Halévy),
                    Jerah (Waráh of the geographers), Joktan (Arab Kahtan; <hi rend="italic">wakata
                        = kahata).</hi> On the other hand, the names of some famous nations
                    mentioned on the inscriptions are lacking, from which it may be concluded that
                    they did not rise to prominence till a later date. Saba’ (Sheba) itself, which
                    was in later times the chief name, has in Gen. x. 28 a subordinate place; it was
                    perhaps only a collective name for the companies of merchants who conducted the
                    South-Arabian export trade (the root <hi rend="italic">saba'</hi> in the
                    inscriptions meaning to make a trading journey), and in that case would be of
                    such late origin as to hold one of the last places in a list that has
                    genealogical form. Two other accounts in Genesis, originally independent, give
                    supplementary information drawn from the Sabaean colonies, the stations and
                    factories established to facilitate trade through the desert. The inscriptions
                    of Al-'Ola published by D. H. Miiller show that there were Minaean colonies in
                    North Arabia. Other South Arabs, and especially the Sabaeans, doubtless also
                    planted settlers on the northern trade routes, who in process of time united
                    into one community with their North-Arab kinsmen and neighbours. Thus we can
                    understand how in Gen. xxv. 2-3 Sheba and Dedan appear among the North-Arab
                    “sons of Keturah.” Again, the Sabaeans had colonies in Africa and there mingled
                    with the black Africans; and so in Gen. x. 7 Sheba and Dedan, the sons of Raamah
                    (Raghma), appear in the genealogy of the Cushites. With the Ethiopians <hi

                    Biblical books do not mention the Sabaeans except incidentally, in allusion to
                    their trade in incense and perfumes, gold and precious stones, ivory, ebony, and
                    costly garments (Jer. vi. 20; Ezek. xxvii. 15, 20, 22 <hi rend="italic"
                        >sq.;</hi> Isa. lx. 6; Job vi. 19). These passages attest the wealth and
                    trading importance of Saba from the days of Solomon to those of Cyrus. When the
                    prologue to Job speaks of plundering Sabaeans (and Chaldaeans) on the northern
                    skirts of Arabia, these may be either colonists or caravans, which, like the old
                    Phoenician and Greek traders, combined on occasion robbery with trade. The
                    prologue may not be historical; but it is to be presumed that it deals with
                    historical possibilities, and is good evidence thus far.</p>
                <p>The Biblical picture of the Sabaean kingdom is confirmed and supplemented by the
                    Assyrian inscriptions. Tiglath Pileser II. (733 B.C.) tells us that Teima,
                    Saba’, and Haipá ( = Ephah, Gen. xxv. 4 and Isa. lx. 6) paid him tribute of
                    gold, silver, and much incense. Similarly Sargon (715 B.c.) in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Annals</hi> mentions the tribute of Shamsi, queen of Arabia,
                    and of Itamara of the land of Saba’,—gold and fragrant spices, horses and
                    camels.</p>
                <p>The earliest Greek accounts of the Sabaeans and other South-Arabian peoples are
                    of the 3d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Eratosthenes (276-194 B.c.) in
                    Strabo (xv. 4, 2) says that the extreme south of Arabia, over against Ethiopia,
                    is inhabited by four great nations,—the Minaeans (M <hi rend="italic"
                        >ϵιvαῐoι</hi>, Μ <hi rend="italic">ηναῐοι</hi>; Ma'ín of the inscriptions)
                    on the Red Sea, whose chief city is Cama; next to them the Sabaeans, whose
                    capital is Mariaba (Mariab of the inscriptions); then the Cata-banes (Katabán of
                    the inscriptions), near the Straits of Báb-al-Mandeb, the seat of whose king is
                    Tamna; fourthly, and farthest east, the people of Hadramaut (Chatramotitae),
                    with their city Sabota. The Catabanes produce frankincense and Hadramaut myrrh,
                    and there is a trade in these and other spices with merchants who make the
                    journey from Aelana (Elath, on the Gulf of 'Akaba) to Minaea in seventy days;
                    the Gabaeans (the Gaba’án of the inscriptions, Pliny’s Gebanitae) take forty
                    days to go to Hadramaut. This short but important and well-informed notice is
                    followed a little later by that of Agatharchides (120 B.c.), who speaks in
                    glowing terms of the wealth and greatness of the Sabaeans, but seems to have
                    less exact information than Eratosthenes. He knows only the Sabaeans and thinks
                    that Saba is the name of their capital. He mentions, however, the “happy
                    islands” beyond the straits, the station of the Indian trade (§ 103).
                    Artemidorus (100 B.c.), quoted by Strabo, gives a similar account of the
                    Sabaeans and their capital Mariaba, of their wealth and trade, adding the
                    characteristic feature that each tribe receives the wares and passes them on to
                    its neighbours as far as Syria and Mesopotamia.</p>
                <p>The accounts of the wealth of the Sabaeans brought back by traders and travellers
                    excited the cupidity of Rome, and Augustus entrusted Aelius Gallus with an
                    expedition to South Arabia, of which we have an authentic account in Strabo
                    (xvi. 4, 22). He hoped for assistance from the friendly <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Nabataeans</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi>; but, as they owed everything
                    to their position as middlemen for the South-Arabian trade, which a direct
                    communication between Rome and the Sabaeans would have ruined, their viceroy
                    Syllaeus, who did not dare openly to refuse help, sought to frustrate the
                    emperor’s scheme by craft. Instead of showing the Romans the caravan route, he
                    induced them to sail from Cleopatris to Leucocome, and then led them by a
                    circuitous way through waterless regions, so that they reached South Arabia too
                    much weakened to effect anything. But the expedition brought back a considerable
                    knowledge of the country and its products, and the Roman leader seems to have
                    perceived that the best entrance to South Arabia was from the havens on the
                    coast. So at least we may conclude when, a hundred years later (77 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> as Dillmann has shown), in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Periplus</hi> of an anonymous contemporary of Pliny (§ 23) we read that
                    Charibael of Zafar, “the legitimate sovereign of two nations, the Homerites and
                    Sabaeans,” maintained friendly relations with Rome by frequent embassies and
                    gifts. Pliny’s account of Yemen, too, must be largely drawn from the expedition
                    of Gallus, though he also used itineraries of travellers to India, like the <hi
                        rend="italic">Periplus Maris Erythraei</hi> just quoted.</p>
                <p>Nautical improvements, and the discovery that the south-west monsoon (Hippalus)
                    gave sure navigation at certain seasons, increased the connexion of the West
                    with South Arabia, but also wrought such a change in the trade as involved a
                    revolution in the state of that country. The hegemony of the Sabaeans now yields
                    to that of a new people, the Homerites or Himyar, and the king henceforth bears
                    the title “king of the Himyarites and Sabaeans.” Naval expeditions from Berenice
                    and Myoshormus to the Arabian ports brought back the information on which
                    Claudius Ptolemy constructed his map, which still surprises us by its wealth of
                    geographical names.</p>
                <p>Sabaean colonies in Africa have been already mentioned. That Abyssinia was
                    peopled from South Arabia is proved by its language and writing; but the
                    difference between the two languages is such as to imply that the settlement was
                    very early and that there were many centuries of separation, during which the
                    Abyssinians were exposed to foreign influences. New colonies, however, seem to
                    have followed from time to time, and, according to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Periplus</hi> (§ 16), some parts of the African coast were under the
                    suzerainty of the Sabaean kings as late as the Sabaeo-Himyaritic period; the
                    district of Azania was held for the Sabaean monarch by the governor of
                    Maphoritis (Ma'áfir), and was exploited by a Sabaean company. Naturally
                    difficulties would arise between Abyssinia and the Sabaean power. In the
                    inscription of Adulis (2d century) the king of Ethiopia claims to have made war
                    in Arabia from Leucocome to the land of the Sabaean king. And the Ethiopians
                    were not without successes, for on the Greek inscription of Aksúm (c. the middle
                    of the 4th century) King Aeizanes calls himself “king of the Aksumites, the
                    Homerites, and Raidán, and of the Ethiopians, Sabaeans, and Silee.” More serious
                    was the conflict under Dhú-Nu’ás (Dhú-Nuwás of the Arab historians) in the
                    beginning of the 6th century; it ended in the overthrow of the Himyarite king
                    and the subjugation of Yemen, which was governed by a deputy of the Aksumite
                    king, till (about 570) the conquerors were overthrown by a small band of Persian
                    adventurers (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Persia,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 613).</p>
                <p>With the exception of what the South-Arabian Hamdání relates of his own
                    observation or from authentic tradition, the Mohammedan Arabic accounts of South
                    Arabia and Sabaea are of little worth. The great event they dwell on is the
                    bursting of the dam of Ma’rib, which led to the emigration northwards of the
                    Yemenite tribes. We may be sure that this event was not the cause but the
                    consequence of the decline of the country. When the inland trade fell away and
                    the traffic of the coast towns took the sea route, the ancient metropolis and
                    the numerous inland emporia came to ruin, while the many colonies in the north
                    were broken up and their population dispersed. To this the Koran alludes in its
                    oracular style, when it speaks (xxxiv. 17) of well-known cities which God
                    appointed as trading stations between the Sabaeans and the cities He had blessed
                    (Egypt and Syria), and which He destroyed because of their sins.</p>

                    existence of a special Sabaean writing, called “Musnad,” of which the Arabs
                    tell, were still current when Niebuhr, in the 18th century, brought to Europe
                    the first account of the existence of ancient inscriptions (not seen by himself)
                    in the neighbourhood of Yarím. Following this hint, Seetzen, in 1810, was able
                    to send to Europe, from porphyry blocks near Yarím, the first copies of Sabaean
                    inscriptions. They could not, however, be read. But the inscriptions found by
                    Wellsted in 1834 at Hisn Ghoráb were deciphered by Gesenius and Rödiger. Soon
                    after this the courageous explorer Arnaud discovered the ancient Mariab, the
                    royal city of the Sabaeans, and at great risk copied fifty-six inscriptions and
                    took a plan of the walls, the dam, and the temple to the east of the city.
                    These, with other inscriptions on stone and on bronze plates brought home by
                    Englishmen, found a cautious and sound interpreter in Osiander. The historical
                    and geographical researches of Kremer and Sprenger gave a fresh impulse to
                    inquiry. Then Joseph Halévy made his remarkable journey through the Jauf,
                    visiting districts and ruins which no European foot had trod since the
                    expedition of Gallus, and returned with almost 800 inscriptions. Of more recent
                    travellers S. Langer and E. Glaser have done most for epigraphy, while Manzoni
                    is to be remembered for his excellent geographical work.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">alphabet</hi> of the Sabaean inscriptions is most closely
                    akin to the Ethiopic, but is purely consonantal, without the modifications in
                    the consonantal forms which Ethiopic has devised to express vowels. There are
                    twenty-nine letters, one more than in Arabic, <hi rend="italic">Samech</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">Sin</hi> being distinct forms, as in Hebrew. This
                    alphabet, which is probably the parent of the South-Indian character, is
                    undoubtedly derived from the so-called Phoenician alphabet, the connecting link
                    being the forms of the Safa inscriptions and of the Thamudaean inscriptions
                    found by Doughty and Euting. Of the latter we can determine twenty-six
                    characters, while a twentyseventh probably corresponds to Arabic z (b). A sign
                    for also probably existed, but does not occur in the known inscriptions. In the
                    Thamudaean and Sabaean alphabets the twenty-two original Phoenician characters
                    are mostly similar, and so are the differentiated forms for ^and while
                    &lt;A&gt;, 3, and probably also la and have been differentiated in different
                    ways. This seems to imply that the two alphabets had a common history up to a
                    certain point, but parted company before they were fully developed. The
                    Thamudaean inscriptions are locally nearer to Phcenicia, and the letters are
                    more like the Phoenician; this character therefore appears to be the link
                    connecting Phoenician with Sabaean writing. It may be noticed that a Thamudaean
                    legend has been found on a Babylonian cylinder of about 1000 B.c., and it is
                    remarkable that the Sabaean <hi rend="italic">satara,</hi> “write,” seems to be
                    borrowed from Assyrian <hi rend="italic">shatâru.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">language of</hi> the inscriptions is South Semitic, forming
                    a link between the North Arabic and the Ethiopic, but is much nearer the former
                    than the latter. To the details already given in the article <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Semitic Languages</hi> (vol. xxi. p. 653 <hi rend="italic"
                        >sq.</hi>) it may be added that of the two dialects commonly called Sabaean
                    and Minaean the latter might be better called Hadramitic, inasmuch as it is the
                    dialect of the inscriptions found in Hadramaut, and the Minaeans seem
                    undoubtedly to have entered the Jauf from Hadramaut.</p>
                <p>The inscriptions not only give names of nations corresponding to those in the
                    Bible and in classical authors but throw a good deal of fresh light on the
                    political history of Yemen. The inscriptions and coins give the names of more
                    than forty-five Sabaean kings. The chronology is still vague, since only a few
                    very late inscriptions are dated by an era and the era itself is not certain.
                    But the rulers named can be assigned to three periods, according as they bear
                    the title “mukrab of Saba,” “king of Saba,” or “king of Saba and Raidân.” The
                    last, as we know from the Aksum inscriptions, are the latest, and those with the
                    title “mukrab” must be the earliest. Four princes of the oldest period bear the
                    name Yatha'amar, and one of these may, with the greatest probability, be held to
                    be the “Itamara Sabai” who paid tribute to Sargon of Assyria. This helps us to
                    the age of some buildings also. The famous dam of Ma’rib and its sluices were
                    the work of this ancient prince—structures which Arnaud in the 19th century
                    found in the same state in which Hamdání saw them a thousand years ago. The
                    power of these old sovereigns extended far beyond Ma’rib, for their names are
                    found on buildings and monuments in the Jauf.</p>
                <p>We cannot tell when the kings took the place of the mukrab, but the
                    Sabaeo-Himyaritic period seems to begin with, or a little after, the expedition
                    of Aelius Gallus. A fragmentary inscription of Ma’rib (Br. Mus., 33) was made by
                    “Ilsharh Yahdib and Ya’zil Bayyin, the two kings of Saba and Raidán, sons of
                    Far'm Yanhab, king of Saba.” If this Ilsharh is identical with the 'Ι <hi
                        rend="italic">λάσσαρos</hi> of Strabo, king of Mariaba at the time of the
                    Roman invasion, the inscription preserves a trace of the influence of that event
                    on the union of the two kingdoms.</p>
                <p>The inscriptions of the latest period present a series of dates—669, 640, 582,
                    573, 385—of an unknown era. Reinaud thought of the Seleucid era, which is not
                    impossible; but Halévy observes that the fortress of Mawiyyat (now Hisn Ghoráb)
                    bears the date 640, and is said to have been erected “when the Abyssinians
                    overran the country and destroyed the king of Himyar and his princes.” Referring
                    this to the death of Dhú Nuwás (525 A.D.), Halévy fixes 115 B.c. as the epoch of
                    the Sabaean era. This ingenious combination accords well with the circumstance
                    that the oldest dated inscription, of the year 385 (270 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >a.d.),</hi> mentions 'Athtar, Shams, and other heathen deities, while the
                    inscriptions of 582 (467 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> and 573 (458 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> so far as they can be read, contain no name of
                    a heathen god, but do speak of a god Rahmánán—that is, the Hebrew Rahman, “the
                    compassionate” (Arabic, Al-Rahmán), agreeably with the fact that Jewish and
                    Christian influences were powerful in Arabia in the 4th century. The only
                    objections to Halévy’s hypothesis are (1) that we know nothing of an
                    epoch-making event in 115 B.c., and (2) that it is a little remarkable that the
                    latest dated inscription, of the year 669 (554 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi>
                    should be twenty-five years later than the Abyssinian conquest. An inscription
                    found by Wrede at 'Obne is dated “in the year 120 of the Lion in Heaven,” which
                    we must leave the astronomers to explain.</p>
                <p>The inscriptions throw considerable light not only on the Sabaeans but on other
                    South-Arabian nations. The Minaeans, whose importance has been already
                    indicated, appear in the inscriptions as only second to the Sabaeans, and with
                    details which have put an end to much guesswork, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> to
                    the idea that they are connected with Mina near Mecca. Their capital, Ma'ín, lay
                    in the heart of the Sabaean country, forming a sort of enclave on the right hand
                    of the road that leads northward from Ma’rib. South-west of Ma'ín, on the west
                    of the mountain range, and commanding the road from San'a to the north, lies
                    Barákísh, anciently Yathil, which the inscriptions and Arabic geographers always
                    mention with Ma'ín. The third Minaean fortress, probably identical with the <hi
                        rend="italic">Κάρνα</hi> of the Greeks, lies in the middle of the northern
                    Jauf, and north of the other two. The three Minaean citadels lie nearly in this
                    position (. ·.), with old Sabaean settlements (Raiam) all round them, and even
                    with some Sabaean places <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Nask and Kamná) within
                    the triangle they form. The dialect of the Minaeans is sharply distinguished
                    from the Sabaeans (see above). The inscriptions have yielded the names of
                    twenty-seven Minaean kings, who were quite independent, and, as it would seem,
                    not always friends of the Sabaeans, for neither dynasty mentions the other on
                    its inscriptions, while minor kings and kingdoms are freely mentioned by both,
                    presumably when they stood under the protection of the one or the other
                    respectively. The Minaeans were evidently active rivals of the Sabaean
                    influence, and a war between the two is once mentioned. In Hadramaut they
                    disputed the hegemony with one another, the government there being at one time
                    under a Minaean, at another under a Sabaean prince, while the language shows now
                    the one and now the other influence. The religions also of the two powers
                    present many points of agreement, with some notable differences. Thus, puzzling
                    as the fact appears, it is clear that the Minaeans formed a sort of political
                    and linguistic island in the Sabaean country. The origin of the Minaeans from
                    Hadramaut is rendered probable by the predominance of their dialect in the
                    inscriptions of that country (except in that of Hisn Ghoráb), by the rule,
                    already mentioned, of a Minaean prince in Hadramaut, and by Pliny’s statement
                        (<hi rend="italic">H. N</hi>., xii. 63) that frankincense was collected at
                    Sabota (the capital of Hadramaut; inscr. שבות), but exported only through the
                    Gebanites, whose kings received custom dues on it, compared with xii. 69, where
                    he speaks of Minaean myrrh “in qua et Atramitica est et Gebbanitica et Ausaritis
                    Gebbanitarum regno,” &amp;c., implying that Minaean myrrh was really a Hadramite
                    and Gebanite product. All this suggests a close connexion between the Minaeans
                    and Hadramaut; and from the Minaean inscriptions we know that the Gebanites were
                    at one time a Minaean race, and stood in high favour with the queen of Ma'ín.
                    Thus we are led to conclude that the Minaeans were a Hadramite settlement in the
                    Jauf, whose object was to secure the northern trade road for their products. We
                    cannot but see that their fortified posts in the north of the Sabaean kingdom
                    had a strategical purpose; and so Pliny (xii. 54) says, “Attingunt et Minaei,
                    pagus alius, per quos evehitur <hi rend="italic">uno tramite angusto</hi> [from
                    Hadramaut]. Hi primi commercium turis fecere maximeque exercent, a quibus et
                    Minaeum dictum est.” Besides this road, they had the sea-route, for, according
                    to Pliny, their allies, the Gebanites, held the port of Ocelis. If the Minaeans
                    were later immigrants from Hadramaut, we can understand how they are not
                    mentioned in Gen. x. In later times, as is proved by the Minaean colony in
                    Al-'Olá, which Euting has revealed to us, they superseded the Sabaeans in some
                    parts of the north. In the 'Olá inscriptions we read the names of Minaean kings
                    and gods. Notable also is the mention in 1 Chron. iv. 41 of the “Bedouin
                    encampments אהל׳ם <hi rend="smallcaps">)</hi> and the Ma'íním” smitten by the
                    Simeonites, which may possibly refer to the destruction of a Minaean caravan
                    protected by these Bedouins. The LXX. at least renders Ma'íním by <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Mιvαίυsj.</hi> It seems bold to conjecture that the
                    Minaeans were in accord with the Romans under Aelius Gallus, yet it is
                    noteworthy that no Minaean town is named among the cities which that general <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n786/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0786-0741"/> destroyed, though ruin fell on Nask and
                    Kamna, which lie inside the Minaean territory.</p>
                <p>The inscriptions seem to indicate that the monarchies of South Arabia were
                    hereditary, the son generally following the father, though not seldom the
                    brother of the deceased came between, apparently on the principle of seniority,
                    whieh we find also in North Arabia. Eratosthenes (in Strabo xvi. 4, 3) says that
                    the first child born to one of the magnates after a king came to the throne was
                    his designated successor; the wives of the magnates who were pregnant at the
                    king’s accession were carefully watched and the first child born was brought up
                    as heir to the kingdom. There seems to be a mistake in the first part of this
                    statement; what Eratosthenes will have said is that the oldest prince after the
                    king was the designated successor. This law of succession explains how we
                    repeatedly find two kings named together among the Sabaeans, and almost always
                    find two among the Minaeans; the second king is the heir. The principle of
                    seniority, as we know from North-Arabian history, gives rise to intrigues and
                    palace revolutions, and was probably often violated in favour of the direct
                    heir. On the other hand, it readily leads to a limited power of election by the
                    magnates, and in fact good Arabian sources speak of seven electoral princes.
                    Some inscriptions name, besides the king, an eponymus, whose office seems to
                    have been priestly, his titles being <hi rend="italic">dhú haríf, eponymus,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">rashúw, “</hi> sacrificer.” All royal inscriptions are
                    signed by him at the beginning and the end, and he appears with the king on
                    coins.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Religion.—</hi> In spite of the many ruins of temples and
                    inscriptions, the religion of the Sabaeans is obscure. Most of the many names of
                    gods are mere names that appear and vanish again in particular districts and
                    temples. Of the great national gods of the Sabaeans and Minaeans we know a
                    little more. The worship of the heavenly bodies, for whieh there is Arabic
                    evidence, had really a great place in Yemen. Sun-worship seems to have been
                    peculiar to the Sabaeans and Hamdanites; and, if the Sabis of Sabota (Pliny) was
                    in fact the sun deity Shams, this must be ascribed to Sabaean influence. The
                    Sabaean Shams was a goddess, while the chief divinity of the Minaeans was the
                    god 'Athtar, a male figure, worshipped under several forms, of which the
                    commonest are the Eastern 'Athtar and 'Athtar Dhú Kabd. Wadd and Nikrah, the
                    gods of love and hate, are possibly only other forms of the two ‘Athtars. The
                    Sabaeans also recognize 'Athtar; but with them he is superseded by Almakah, who,
                    according to Hamdání, is the planet Venus, and therefore is identical with
                    'Athtar. The moon-god Sin appears on an inscription of Shabwat; but, according
                    to Hamdání, Haubas, “the drier,” was the Sabaean moon-god. On the Shabwat
                    inscription 'Athtar is the father of Sin, and it is noteworthy that these two
                    deities also appear as nearly related in the Babylonian legend of 'Ishtar’s
                    descent to Hades, where 'Ishtar is conversely the daughter of the god Sin. The
                    mother of 'Athtar on another inscription is probably the sun. We find also the
                    common Semitic Il (El) and a Dhú Samai answering to the northern Ba'al Shamayim.
                    Three gods of the inscriptions are named in the Koran,—Wadd, Yaghúth, and Nasr.
                    In the god-name Ta’lab there may be an indication of tree-worship. The many
                    minor deities may be passed over; but we must mention the sanctuary of Riyám,
                    with its images of the sun and moon, and, according to tradition, an oracle. In
                    conformity with old Semitic usage, pilgrimages were made at definite seasons to
                    certain deities, and the Sabaean pilgrim month, Dhú Hijjatán, is the northern
                    Dhú’l-Hijja. The outlines, and little more, of a few of the many temples can
                    still be traced. Noteworthy are the elliptic form of the chief temples in Ma’rib
                    and Sirwáh, and the castle of Nakab-al-Hajar with its entrances north and
                    south.</p>
                <p>Sacrifices and incense were offered to the gods. The names for altar (<hi
                        rend="italic">midhbah)</hi> and sacrifice (<hi rend="italic">dhibh)</hi> are
                    common Semitic words, and the altar of incense has among other names that of <hi
                        rend="italic">miktar,</hi> as in Hebrew. A variety of spices—the wealth of
                    the land—are named on these altars, as <hi rend="italic">rand, ladanum, costus,
                        tarum,</hi> &amp;c. Frankincense appears as <hi rend="italic">lubán,</hi>
                    and there are other names not yet understood. The gods received tithes of the
                    produce of trade and of the field, in kind or in ingots and golden statues, and
                    these tributes, with freewill offerings, erected and maintained the temples.
                    Temples and fortifications were often combined. The golden statues were votive
                    offerings; thus a man and his wife offer four statues for the health of their
                    four children and a man offers to Dhú Samai statues of a man and two camels, in
                    prayer for his own health and the protection of his camels from disease of the
                    joints.</p>
                <p>Their commerce brought the Sabaeans under Christian and Jewish influence; and,
                    though the old gods were too closely connected with their life and trade to be
                    readily abandoned, the great change in the trading policy, already spoken of,
                    seems to have affected religion as well as the state. The inland gods lost
                    importance with the failure of the overland trade, and Judaism and Christianity
                    seem for a time to have contended for the mastery in South Arabia. Jewish
                    influence appears in the name Rahmán (see above), while efforts at
                    Christianization seem to have gone forth from several places at various times.
                    According to Philostorgius, the Homerites were converted under Constantius II.
                    by the Indian Theophilus, who built churches in Zafar and Aden. Another account
                    places their conversion in the reign of Anastasius (491-518). In Nejrán Syrian
                    missionaries seem to have introduced Christianity (Nöldeke). But, as the
                    religion of the hostile Ethiopians, Christianity found political obstacles to
                    its adoption in Yemen; and, as heathenism had quite lost its power, it is
                    intelligible that Dhú Nuwás, who was at war with Ethiopia before the last fatal
                    struggle, became a Jew. His expedition against Christian Nejrán had therefore
                    political as well as religious motives. The Ethiopian conquest rather hurt than
                    helped Christianity. The famous <hi rend="italic">kalis (έκκλησία)</hi> of
                    Abraha in San'á seems to have been looked on as a sign of foreign dominion, and
                    Islam found it easy to supersede Christianity in Yemen.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Coins.—</hi> In older times and in many districts coins were
                    not used, and trade was carried on mainly by barter. Nor have there yet been
                    many great finds of coins; indeed most of the pieces in European collections
                    probably come from the same hoard. At the same time the coins throw a general
                    light on the relations of ancient Yemen. The oldest known pieces are imitations
                    of the Athenian mintage of the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> with
                    the legend AΘE and the owl standing on an overturned amphora. The reverse has
                    the head of Pallas with a Sabaean N. Of younger coins the first series has a
                    king’s head on the reverse, and the old obverse is enriched with two Sabaean
                    monograms, which have been interpreted as meaning “majesty” and “eponymus”
                    respectively. In a second series the Greek legend has disappeared, and, instead
                    of the two Sabaean monograms, we have the names of the king and the eponymus. A
                    third series shows Roman influence and must be later than the expedition of
                    Gallus. As the standard of the coins of Attic type is not Attic but Babylonian,
                    we must not think of direct Athenian influence. The type must have been
                    introduced either from Persia or from Phoenicia (Gaza). One remarkable
                    tetradrachm with the Sabaean legend Abyath’á is imitated from an Alexander of
                    the 2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.o.,</hi> the execution being quite
                    artistic and the weight Attic. There are also coins struck at Raydán and Harib,
                    which must be assigned to the Himyarite period (1st and 2d century <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> The inscriptions speak of “bright Hayyilí coins
                    in high relief,” but of these none have been found. They also speak of sela'
                    pieces. The sela' in late Hebrew answers to the older shekel and the mention of
                    it seems to point to Jewish or Christian influence.</p>
