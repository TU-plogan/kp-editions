                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in τoὑs (for <hi rend="italic">τόvs</hi>). The name <hi
                    rend="italic">ὔ ψιλόν</hi> was probably given to distinguish it from ὔ διά <hi
                    rend="italic">διφθόγγου,—</hi> that is, the same sound, but denoted by oι, which
                    in the 2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> was beginning to have the value
                    of υ <hi rend="italic">;</hi> just so ἕ <hi rend="italic">ψιλόν</hi> is opposed
                    to αι, or ἕ <hi rend="italic">διà διφθόγγου.</hi> The difference in sound
                    between the full and the modified <hi rend="italic">u</hi> is this: for the
                    first the lips are rounded as much as possible, and the back part of the tongue
                    is raised towards the palate; for the second the rounding of the lips is the
                    same, but the tongue is in the position for <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> so that in
                    sounding <hi rend="italic">ü</hi> we are sounding <hi rend="italic">i</hi> with
                    the lips rounded in addition. This explains the ease with which the ι-sound is
                    produced instead of ü by persons unfamiliar with the latter sound: when an
                    Englishman pronouncing “Müller” says “Miller,” he puts the tongue right for <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> but omits to round the lips as well. This change has been a
                    regular one in our language. There is no doubt that <hi rend="italic">y (i.e.,
                    ü)</hi> was a sound of Early English (or Anglo-Saxon), as of the other Teutonic
                    languages, in words like “fÿr” (fire), “synn” (sin); it was the “umlaut” of <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi>, especially when followed in the next syllable by <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> or <hi rend="italic">e</hi>; so “burg” has for gen. and
                    dat. “byrig,” orig. “burges,” “burge.” But in Middle English <hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi> passed into <hi rend="italic">i</hi>: thus “fÿr” (sounded as für) came
                    to be sounded as “fir” (feer), and this (as in other cases where ī occurs) was
                    diphthongized in comparatively modern times into “fire” (faior). Thus in the
                    middle of a word <hi rend="italic">y</hi> lost its special value; on the other
                    hand, at the beginning of a word it easily passed into the consonant <hi
                    rend="italic">y,</hi> the value which it has regularly in modern English. This
                    explains the fact that the English language had no symbol for the sound of
                    French « when this sound was re-introduced into England after the Norman
                    Conquest. Accordingly the French symbol as well as the sound was taken: it is
                    found in words like “muse,” “lute,” sounded as “myyz,” “lyyte.” The <hi
                    rend="italic">yy</hi> gradually developed into the <hi rend="italic">iu</hi>
                    sound with which we are familiar in “miūz,” “liūt”; but the spelling remained
                    unchanged. It must have been awkward to have the symbol « representing both the
                    full (native) sound and the modified (French) sound; this was partially obviated
                    by borrowing for the full «-sound the French writing <hi rend="italic">ou:
                    e.g.,</hi> “hūs” was written “house,” without at first any change of sound; but
                    this was not consistently carried out. Much later, at the end of the 16th
                    century, the sound was diphthongized into “haus” (as now), but the spelling (o«)
                    remained. The fact that <hi rend="italic">y</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                    became indistinguishable led to the use of <hi rend="italic">y</hi> at the end
                    of a word instead of <hi rend="italic">i</hi>: thus we write “day” instead of
                    the older “dai.”</p>
                <p>In Early English we find the symbol 3 (which is a modification of the Anglo-Saxon
                    <hi rend="italic">f)</hi> used initially with the value of <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi>, and medially (chiefly before <hi rend="italic">t</hi>) where modern
                    English writes <hi rend="italic">gh,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">light.</hi>
                    This is due to French scribes, who used the French <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi>
                    our modern) form of <hi rend="italic">g</hi> for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi>-sound, and then the 3 for the sound which had been weakened in
                    Anglo-Saxon from <hi rend="italic">g</hi> to <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> as in <hi
                    rend="italic">yard</hi> (our <hi rend="italic">yard)</hi> for original <hi
                    rend="italic">gard</hi> (Norse <hi rend="italic">garth</hi>; in North English
                    Aysgarth and Gatesgarth). About the 15th century this same symbol was mistaken
                    for <hi rend="italic">2,</hi> and as such it is still occasionally employed in
                    cursive, when 3 is written instead of 2.</p>
