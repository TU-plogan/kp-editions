                <p><label type="entry">YARN</label> consists of any textile fibre prepared by the
                    process of spinning for being woven into cloth. It is only in a few minor and
                    exceptional cases, such as the weaving of hair-cloth or of wire, that there is
                    any making of woven fabrics without the previous spinning of yarn. As weaving
                    can be shown to be among the earliest and most universal of the industries of
                    mankind, the process of spinning yarn, which of necessity accompanies or rather
                    precedes weaving, can be claimed as one of the primal employments of the race.
                    There is ample evidence obtainable, not only of the great antiquity, but also of
                    the wide —almost universal—diffusion of the art of spinning. Remains of the
                    implements employed are found wherever traces of prehistoric and early man make
                    their appearance. It happens that the exceedingly simple apparatus which was
                    used in the earliest ages continued to be the spinning implements of civilized
                    communities till comparatively recent times, and it may therefore be said that
                    there is no art which has been more widely diffused, more uniformly practised,
                    and w'hich remained so long fixed and unprogressive, as that of yarn-spinning.
                    On the other hand, since human ingenuity bent itself to improve the art—and
                    these efforts only began in earnest about the middle of the 18th century—there
                    have not been developed in the whole range of mechanical industries implements
                    of greater variety, complexity, delicacy of action, and manifold productive
                    capacity than the varied machines now adapted for the production of yarn.</p>
                <p>The primitive spinning implement consists of a spindle, a rod of wood, usually
                    from 9 to 12 inches in length, rounded and tapering towards both extremities, as
                    showm in the accompanying cut. At the upper extremity there is usually a notch,
                    in which the yarn is caught while undergoing the operation of twisting, and to
                    the spindle there is commonly added a whorl—a perforated disk of stone or other
                    heavy material—the object of which is by its weight to give momentum and
                    steadiness to the spindle when it is rotated by the hands of the spinner. The
                    fibre to be spun is commonly attached loosely to a distaff or “rock” of wood,
                    which is held under the left arm of the operator; but in the case of certain
                    short fibres the material is made up in rolls or cardings. A rotatory motion is
                    given to the spindle by twirling it between the fingers of the right hand; and
                    the fibre to be spun is then drawn out in a uniform strand between the fingers
                    of both hands and simultaneously twisted into yarn by the rotating spindle to
                    which it is attached. The portion that is sufficiently twisted is wound on the
                    body of the spindle, and the operation is continued till the spindle is filled
                    with yarn of a smooth and equal calibre. The quantity thus rolled up gives the
                    name to a now definite measure of yarn, “the spindle.” Simple and primitive as
                    is this apparatus, a dexterous and experienced spinner is able to produce yarn
                    of an evenness, strength, and delicacy such as can scarcely be exceeded with the
                    aid of the most complicated appliances and by the numerous processes of
                    perfected modern spinning. The cotton yarns with which the famous Dacca muslins
                    of India,—textures which from their extreme flimsy airiness receive such names
                    as “woven air” and “evening dew,”—are spun with the aid only of these simple and
                    rude appliances. The spindle used by the deft Hindu is a slender strip of bamboo
                    not much bigger than a darning needle, lightly weighted with a pellet of clay;
                    and, as the tender thread formed cannot even support the weight of so slight a
                    spindle, the apparatus is rotated in a socket, which consists of a piece of
                    hollow shell. The spindle as here described was the sole apparatus with which,
                    so far as is known, the whole of the yarn woven into cloth by mankind till
                    comparatively modern times was made, and even at the present day it is not
                    wholly obsolete. Apart from its use in Eastern countries and among the untutored
                    tribes of Central Africa, the spindle in its original form continues to be used
                    in the remote districts of the Scottish Highlands and islands, and in many other
                    regions of Europe.</p>
                <p>Throughout all the changes and developments of modern yarn-spinning the rotating
                    spindle continues to be the essential implement, and all the improvements which
                    have been effected have had for their object,—(1) the providing of mechanical
                    means of rotating the spindle, (2) an automatic method of drawing out and
                    attenuating the fibre, and (3) devices for working a large group of spindles
                    together.</p>
                <p>The first improvement on the simple spindle consisted in mounting it horizontally
                    in bearings, and giving it a rotatory motion by a band from a large wheel,
                    passing round a small pulley or “wharve” fixed on the spindle itself. Such was
                    the first spinning wheel which, in the form of the “charka,” has long been known
                    in the East Indies; and from a drawing in a 14th-century MS. in the British
                    Museum it is obvious that it was not unknown, although certainly far from
                    common, in Europe at that early date. A jewelled model hand-wheel of this
                    description was formerly the property of Mary of Guise. This form of wheel came
                    ultimately to be known in Scotland as the “muckle wheel,” in contradistinction
                    to one of later invention, and the method of working it is not yet an altogether
                    forgotten art.</p>
                <p>No strict record of the dates at which various developments of the art of
                    spinning took place are to be found, and it is certain that many appliances were
                    long known and to some extent used before their adoption became general. Thus it
                    is quite clear that the flier, which is fitted around modern spindles for
                    twisting the yarn before it is wound on the bobbin, was known to Leonardo da
                    Vinci and probably invented by him. Among the numerous mechanical drawings left
                    by that man of genius there is one which shows a spindle with flier and bobbin,
                    with a device for moving the bobbin up and down on the spindle so as to effect
                    an even distribution of the yarn. But the use of the flier does not seem to have
                    been known in England till about the end of the 17th century. In a pamphlet
                    issued in 1681 by Thomas Firmin, entitled <hi rend="italic">Some Proposals for
                        the Employment of the Poor,</hi> there is an illustration of an improved
                    wheel, with two spindles provided with fliers, having on them hooks or pins for
                    directing the yarn on different parts of the bobbin. The sketch also shows the
                    spindle and flier driven by different bands, as was the case with the
                    spinning-wheel which subsequently came into common use. In hand-spinning the
                    further application of the treadle motion, with connecting-rod and crankaxle to
                    drive the little wheel with the feet alone, was the final development. By this
                    agency both hands of the spinner were free, continuous and uniform motion was
                    secured, and the spinner could work two spindles simultaneously, the one with
                    the right and the other with the left hand. It was in this condition that the
                    most advanced form of yarn-making was carried on in the 18th century, when a
                    great series of inventions revolutionized the entire range of textile industries
                    and laid the foundation of the gigantic factory system of spinning and weaving
                    which now prevails.</p>
                <p>The problem which lay before inventors was to bring tangled masses of fibrous
                    material into parallel order, and to draw out and twist these fibres into
                    uniform strands by automatic means, without the continuous application of
                    intelligent attention. The first stage in the evolution of mechanical spinning
                    was effected under the patent of Louis Paul in 1738, in which there was clearly
                    described and foreshadowed what is now one of the most important features of
                    spinning machinery—the drawing rollers. In his specification he says :—</p>
                <p>“One end of the mass, rope, thread, or sliver is put betwixt a pair of rowlers.
                    cillinders, or cones, or some such movements, which, being turned round, by
                    their motion draws in the raw mass of wool or cotton to be spun, in proportion
                    to the velocity given to such rowlers, cillinders, or cones As the prepared mass
                    passes regularly through or betwixt these rowlers, cillinders, or cones, a
                    succession of other rowlers, cillinders, or cones, moving proportionably faster
                        <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n776/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0776-0731"/> than the first, draw the rope, thread, or
                    sliver into any degree of fineness whieh may be required.”</p>
                <p>Next, to James Hargreaves of Blackburn is due the first conception of the famous
                    spinning-jenny, which he devised about 1767 and patented in 1770. In his
                    specification Hargreaves describes his invention as a machine or engine to be
                    managed by one person only, and that the wheel or engine will spin, draw, and
                    twist sixteen or more threads at one time by a turn or motion of one hand and a
                    draw of the other. At the same time the humble barber of Preston, Richard
                    Arkwright, was busily engaged in developing the important series of inventions
                    and adaptations which resulted in the modern throstle spinning-frame.
                    Arkwright’s principal patents were secured in 1769 and 1775; and in the latter
                    year Samuel Crompton of Bolton brought before the world his mule spinning-frame,
                    in which the drawing rollers of Paul and Arkwright were with happy effect
                    applied to the jenny of Hargreaves. These inventions are at the foundation of
                    all modern systems of yarn-spinning; details regarding them are given under <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Cotton, Linen, Silk,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Wool.</hi></p>
                <p>The various methods by which the sizes or counts of yarn have been fixed in
                    different countries have long been a source of much inconvenience in the
                    international exchange of spun yarns. The methods of estimating sizes or weights
                    of yarn are indeed complicated in the extreme, for not only has each country
                    different standards, which may locally be disregarded, but for the yarn from
                    each separate fibre there may be different lengths of hank and different methods
                    of estimating sizes. Thus, taking English standards, we find that cotton yarns
                    are made up into hanks of 560 “threads” of 1½ yards, giving 840 yards per hank,
                    and the “counts” are the number of hanks which go to make 1 lb weight of yarn.
                    For linen yarns there are 2½ yards in a thread, and 120 threads or 300 yards in
                    a lea, and the count is the number of leas per lb. In a hank of worsted or
                    woollen yarn there are 560 yards, and the count similarly is the number of hanks
                    per lb. In Continental countries the length of the hank or its equivalent is
                    different; the weight by which the count is reckoned also varies; and, as the
                    weights and measures of the several countries have only the most involved ratio
                    to each other, to estimate comparative sizes complex calculated tables are
                    necessary. Attempts have been made to establish an international standard of
                    numbering yarns based on the French metric system, in which the count is the
                    number of grams which a definite length of yarn—1000 metres—weighs. No progress,
                    however, has been made in coming to an international agreement in the question.
