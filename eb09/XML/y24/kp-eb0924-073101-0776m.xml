                    smallest, but at the same time one of the most populous and industrial
                    governments of Great Russia. It has an area of 13,751 square miles, and the
                    population was 1,118,130 in 1884. It consists of a broad and shallow depression,
                    elongated from west to east, where the Volga flows at a level ranging from 260
                    to 230 feet above the sea, while the surrounding hills rise to altitudes of from
                    700 to 800 feet. In the west, especially between the Mołoga and the Sheksna, the
                    country is covered with marshes and ponds, which become completely flooded when
                    the water rises in the rivers. There is another region of low and marshy tracts
                    in the south, about Rostoff. Gentle sloping hills appear in the north on the
                    left bank of the Sheksna.</p>
                <p>Jurassic clays, sandstones, and sands cover nearly the whole of Yarostavl, but
                    they are concealed almost everywhere by thick deposits of Glacial boulder clay,
                    which is regarded by Russian geologists as the bottom moraine of the great
                    ice-cap of the Glacial period. Triassic “variegated marls,” widely diffused
                    throughout the whole of the middle Volga region, undoubtedly underlie nearly all
                    the Jurassic deposits of the government, but only a few patches come to the
                    surface; many salt springs exist in these deposits. The Upper Carboniferous
                    limestones come to the surface only in the north-west and towards the east.<note

                    copper, and pottery clay. Peat occurs in thick beds. There are also several
                    mineral springs. The soil is mostly a kind of loess of moderate fertility; sandy
                    tracts are not uncommon; and wide areas are covered with marshes—relics of the
                    great lakes of the Lacustrine period.</p>
                <p>The chief river of the government is the Volga, which traverses it for 180 miles,
                    making a great bend to the north. The chief towns—Rybinsk, Yarosłavl, Motoga,
                    Romanoff-Borisoglyebsk, Uglitch, and Myshkin—are situated on its banks, and a
                    brisk traffic is carried on, both by the river itself and by two canals,
                    Mariinsk and Tikhvinsk, which connect it with the Neva through its tributaries
                    the Sheksna and the Mołoga. Another tributary received by the Volga within the
                    government is the Kotorost, which has many manufactories on its banks and is
                    navigated, especially in spring. The Kostroma flows along the eastern border and
                    is a channel for the export of timber and fuel. Small lakes are numerous, the
                    chief being Lake Nero or Rostoff. The forests, which consist chiefly of fir and
                    Scotch pine, cover one-third of the aggregate area; but they are rapidly being
                    destroyed. The flora of Yarosłavl, although similar to that of Moscow, bears a
                    northern stamp owing to the presence of the dwarf birch, <hi rend="italic">Rubus
                    arcticus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Linnaea borealis.</hi></p>
                <p>The climate is as continental as that of middle Russia generally. The average
                    temperature at Yarosłavl is 36°∙7 Fahr. (January 6°∙5, July 61°∙5); the
                    prevailing south-western and western winds render it moister than in central
                    Russia; and the average number of days with rain or snow is 114. The rivers
                    remain frozen from 118 to 183 days every year.</p>
                <p>The population is thoroughly Great Russian. The aboriginal Meryas have been
                    completely Russified; and traces of the Karelians, who immigrated in the 17th
                    century, can only be discovered in the names and features of some inhabitants on
                    the Siti river. There are moreover some 1000 Tartars, 2100 Jews, and about 500
                    Gipsies. Leaving out of account some 2700 Catholics and Protestants, the
                    population belongs to the Greek Orthodox Church or is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Raskolnik.</hi></p>
                <p>Although Yarosłavl is one of the chief manufacturing governments of the empire,
                    its inhabitants have by no means abandoned agriculture, 27 per cent. of the
                    total area being under crops (36 per cent. under forests and 8 per cent.
                    untillable); on the lands of the peasantry the percentage is still greater (from
                    46 to 58 per cent.). Rye, oats, and barley, with some wheat and pease, are the
                    chief crops, and in good seasons Yarosłavl has even a surplus of corn, which is
                    either sent to the distilleries or exported. The average crops of 1883-85 were
                    960,100 quarters of rye, 36,000 of wheat, 97,400 of barley, 1,097,100 of oats,
                    19,600 of other grain, and 6,992,800 bushels of potatoes. Nearly 40,000 cwts. of
                    flax are cropped every year. Market-gardening is largely engaged in and the
                    Yarosłavl gardeners have a wide repute throughout Russia. Chicory, sweet pease,
                    cucumbers, apples, and berries are exported. Although there is no want of
                    meadows, cattle-breeding is not greatly developed. In 1882-84 there were 178,370
                    horses, 260,000 cattle, 188,700 sheep, and 4700 pigs. One-third of the peasant
                    households had no horses. Cheese-making on the co-operative principle has spread
                    extensively of late, owing to the efforts of the <hi rend="italic">zemstvo</hi>;
                    93 associations have a yearly production to the value of £12,700. Domestic
                    trades are carried on in great variety in the villages, including the making of
                    linen cloth, boots, gloves, sheepskins, knitted wares, clothes, felts, all kinds
                    of wooden wares, pottery, and a variety of metallic goods. The total production
                    is very considerable, although no details are available. The manufactures are
                    growing rapidly, the yearly production of 1708 establishments being estimated at
                    £2,210,000 in 1884. Cotton and linen are the chief items (nearly £1,000,000);
                    flour-mills, distilleries, and tobacco works come next; and these are followed
                    by chemical works and workshops for machinery, metallic wares, and so on, which
                    are rapidly developing. The trade of the government is very active both on the
                    Volga and on the two railway lines, one of which connects Rybinsk with the St
                    Petersburg and Moscow line and the other connects Yarosłavl with Moscow and
                    Vologda. Rybinsk and Yarosłavl are the chief commercial centres, but Rostoff,
                    Motoga, Romanoff, and Poshekhonie also carry on an active trade in corn, timber,
                    and manufactured wares. The total merchandise shipped or discharged to and from
                    the towns and villages of Yarosłavl is estimated at 1,600,000 tons annually,
                    one-half by rail.</p>
                <p>One of the most distinctive features of Yarosłavl is the large numbers of its
                    male population who annually leave their homes in order to work all over Russia
                    as locksmiths, masons, plasterers, waiters in restaurants, greengrocers,
                    tailors, gardeners, carpenters, joiners, pilots, or boatmen. Many of these
                    employments have been specialties of the population of Yarosłavl from a remote
                    antiquity, and the native of this government can easily be distinguished by his
                    enterprising spirit, keen air, and energetic and nervous temperament In Moscow
                    and St Petersburg together there are about 76,400 employed in the above
                    capacities, and it may be estimated that as many as 100,000 persons annually
                    leave their homes in this way.</p>
                <p>The educational institutions were represented in 1884 by a lyceum (197 students),
                    six gymnasia (569 boys and 1219 girls), a military school (492 boys), a seminary
                    for teachers (81 students), and 745 elementary schools (25,780 boys, 10,140
                    girls).</p>
                <p>Yarosłavl is divided into ten districts, the chief towns of which, with their
                    population in 1884, are— <hi rend="smallcaps">Yakoslavl</hi> (see below),
                    Daniloff (5780), Lubim (3180), Mołoga (6360), Myshkin (2390), Poshekhonie
                    (5990), Romanoff-Borisoglyebsk (5300), Rostoff (12,450), Rybinsk (19,900), and
                    Uglitch (11,930). Petrovsk (1760) has municipal institutions.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> As early as the 9th century the Slavonians had
                    become masters of the Yarosłavl territory, which was formerly occupied by the
                    Finnish stems Vess and Merya, as also by Mordvinians, Muroms, and Tcheremisses
                    in the south. Rostoff was already in existence; but Yaroslavl, Rybinsk, and
                    Uglitch begin to be mentioned in the annals only in the 11th and 12th centuries.
                    The independent principality of Rostoff was divided in the 13th century into
                    three parts, but these were soon afterwards successively annexed to Moscow.</p>
