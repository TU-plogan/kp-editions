                    bird in some districts of South-eastern Europe, South-western Asia, and

                    ><p>This caution was not neglected by the prudent, even so long ago as Sir
                    Thomas Browne’s days; for he, recording the occurrence of a Pelican in Norfolk,
                    was careful to notice that about the same time one of the Pelicans kept by the
                    king (Charles II.) in St James’s Park had been lost,</p></note> since few
                    zoological gardens are without examples which are often in the finest condition.
                    Its usual haunts are the shallow margins of the larger lakes and rivers, where
                    fishes are plentiful, since it requires for its sustenance a vast supply of
                    them, pursuing them under water, and rising to the surface to swallow those that
                    it has captured in its capacious pouch. The nest is formed among the reeds that
                    border the waters it frequents, placed on the ground and lined with grass.
                    Therein two eggs, with white, chalky shells, are commonly laid. The young during
                    the first twelvemonth are of a greyish-brown, but this dress is slowly
                    superseded by the growth of white feathers, until when mature almost the whole
                    plumage, except the black primaries, is white, deeply suffused by a rich blush
                    of rose or salmon-colour, passing into yellow on the crest and lower part of the
                    neck in front. A second and somewhat larger species, <hi rend="italic">Pelecanus
                    crispus,</hi> also inhabits Europe, but in smaller numbers. This, when adult, is
                    readily distinguishable from the ordinary bird by the absence of the blush from
                    its plumage, and by the curled feathers that project from and overhang each side
                    of the head, which with some differences of coloration of the bill, pouch, bare
                    skin round the eyes, and irides give it a wholly distinct expression.<note

                    Two specimens of the humerus of as many Pelicans have been found in the English

                    England at no very distant period, and one of them being that of a young example
                    points to its having been bred in this country. It is possible from their large

                    estimate varying from six to ten or eleven; but the former is the number
                    recognized by the latest author on the subject, Μ. Dubois <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Bull. Mus. de Belgique,</hi> 1883). North America has one, <hi rend="italic"
                    >P. erythrorhynchus,</hi> very similar to <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">onocrotalus</hi> both in appearance and habits, but remarkable for
                    a triangular, compressed, horny excrescence which is developed on the ridge of
                    the male’s bill in the breeding season, and, as ascertained by Mr Ridgway <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1869, p. 350), falls off without leaving trace of its
                    existence when that is over. Australia has <hi rend="italic">P.

                    >Gannet</hi> (vol. x. p. 70) as well as the true Pelicans, and for a long while
                    these and some other distinct groups, as the <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    It may be necessary to state that there is no foundation for the venerable
                    legend of the Pelican feeding her young with blood from her own breast, which
                    has given it an important place in ecclesiastical heraldry, except that, as Mr
                    Bartlett has suggested <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1869, p.
                    146), the curious bloody secretion ejected from the mouth of the Flamingo may
                    have given rise to the belief, through that bird having been mistaken for the
                    “Pelican of the wilderness.” <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
