                    his wife Theodelinda, became the father of Paulus. The future historian (born
                    about 720 or 725) received an education unusually good for his times, possibly
                    in part conducted at the court of King Ratchis in Pavia. From a teacher named
                    Flavian he received at least the rudiments of Greek. In middle life, probably,
                    he retired into the great Benedictine monastery of Monte Cassino, which his
                    patron King Ratchis had entered in 749. The ruin which befell the Lombard
                    monarchy in 774 at the hands of Charles the Great may have caused him to take
                    this step. In this ruin was involved his brother Arichis, whose estates were
                    confiscated, himself confined in prison for seven years, and his wife and
                    children reduced to beggary. About 781 Paulus left his monastery and travelled
                    to France, probably in order to intercede for this brother, and after
                    considerable delay his request was granted. Meanwhile, his literary gifts had
                    come to be highly appreciated by the Frankish king. The letters and the verses
                    which passed between Charles (employing the pen of a secretary) and Paulus give
                    -a pleasant idea of the relation between the two parties, and remind us of the
                    intercourse between the Italian princes and the scholars of the Renaissance.
                    After some years’ residence in France Paulus returned to Italy and to his
                    convent, and died, probably between 790 and 800, at his beloved Monte Cassino.
                    His surname, Diaconus (or Levita), shows that he took orders as a deacon, no
                    doubt during his residence in the monastery.</p>
                <p>The chief works of Paulus are his <hi rend="italic">Continuation of</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Eutropius</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Lombard History.</hi> The
                    former (one of his earliest works) was written at the request of Adelperga, wife
                    of the duke of Benevento. Paulus recommended her to read the Roman history of
                    Eutropius, but, as she complained that this heathen writer said nothing of
                    church affairs, and stopped short at the death of Jovian, Paulus interwove some
                    extracts from the ecclesiastical historians, and added six books (xi∙-xvι),
                    bringing down the history to 553 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> At this point
                    his <hi rend="italic">Lombard History,</hi> in six books, written in the later
                    years of his life and cut short by his death, takes up the tale, which is told
                    henceforward from the point of view of a Lombard patriot. The sagas of the
                    Langobardic warriors, plentifully interspersed, give to the narrative a wild
                    barbaric interest. The document called the <hi rend="italic">Origo
                    Gentis</hi><hi rend="italic">Langobardicae</hi> and the lost history of Secundus
                    of Trient furnished some of his materials. He also makes free use of Gregory of
                    Tours, Bede, Isidore, and others. In some aspects Paulus naturally suggests a
                    comparison with Jordanes, that other historian of a barbarian nation falling
                    into ruin, but in learning and literary honesty the Lombard is greatly the
                    superior of the Goth. His style is, for his age, wonderfully good, though his
                    grammar shows the breaking down of the old Latin inflexions into the <hi
                    rend="italic">lingua volgare.</hi></p>
                <p>Paulus wrote also a history of the bishops of Metz, some homilies, and several
                    small poems, some rhythmical, some metrical. His works were frequently copied in
                    the Middle Ages. Of the <hi rend="italic">Lombard History</hi> there are more
                    than a hundred MSS. extant, those of Assisi, Cividale, and St Gall being the
                    most important. The edition of his histories published as part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Monumenta</hi><hi rend="italic">Germanise</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Historica</hi> (1878-79) supersedes all others. For further information, the
                    student may consult G. Waitz’s preface to the <hi rend="italic">Lombard
                    History</hi> in that edition, and F. Dahn’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Laηgobardische</hi><hi rend="italic">Studien,</hi> au able monograph, but
                    perhaps too negative in its conclusions. The English reader will find an
                    excellent sketch of Paulus’s life and writings in Ugo Balzani’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Early Chroniclers of Italy</hi> (London, 1883).</p>
