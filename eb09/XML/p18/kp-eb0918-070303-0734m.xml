                    desired to petition him should be heard <hi rend="italic">{Pot. Parl.,</hi> 8
                    Hen. IV., p. 585). The case of the seven bishops in 1688 confirmed the right,
                    and finally the Bill of Rights in 1689 declared “that it is the right of the
                    subjects to petition the king, and all commitments and prosecutions for such
                    petitioning are illegal.” Petitions to the crown appear to have been at first
                    for the redress of <pb break="no"

                    beyond those possessed by the courts. As equity grew into a system, petitions of
                    this kind tended to become superseded by bills in chancery (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Chancery).</hi> Statutes were originally drawn up by the judges
                    at the close of the session of parliament from the petitions of the Commons and
                    the answers of the crown. In the drawing up of the statutes frauds were at times
                    committed, the judges not always reciting correctly the tenor of the petition or
                    answer. To obviate this danger complete statutes in the form of bills began to
                    be introduced into parliament in the reign of Henry VI. The crown could accept
                    or reject them, but could not alter them (see Hallam, <hi rend="italic">Middle
                    Ages,</hi> ch. viii. pt. 3). A relic of the old form of the statute founded upon
                    petition still remains in the preamble of Appropriation Acts and other statutes
                    creating a charge upon the public revenue. It runs thus: “We, your majesty’s
                    most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Commons of the United Kingdom . . . do most
                    humbly beseech your majesty that it may be enacted; and be it enacted, àc.,”
                    from this point following the enacting words common to all statutes. Petitions
                    to the crown from the House of Commons in other matters now usually take the
                    form of addresses. The crown may refer petitions presented to it to be
                    adjudicated upon by a delegated authority. This is the course pursued in the
                    case of peerage claims, which are referred to the House of Lords, and by that
                    House to the committee for privileges, and in the case of petitions to the crown
                    in council, with which the judicial committee in most cases deals (see below);
                    or the crown may delegate the power of receiving petitions in the first
                    instance. Examples of petitions to the delegated authority are those addressed
                    to a court of justice or those addressed to the home secretary for the pardon or
                    mitigation of punishment of a convicted criminal. Petitions to the houses of
                    legislature seem to have been later in origin than petitions to the crown. The
                    political importance of petitioning dates from about the reign of Charles I. The
                    development of the practice of petitioning had proceeded so far in the reign of
                    Charles II. as to lead to the passing of 13 Car. II. c. 5 against tumultuous
                    petitioning. This is still law, though it has ceased to be enforced. It provides
                    that no petition or address shall be presented to the king or either house of
                    parliament by more than ten persons; nor shall any one procure above twenty
                    persons to consent or set their hands to any petition for alteration of matters
                    established by law in church or state, unless with the previous order of three
                    justices of the county, or the major part of the grand jury. Up to 1688
                    petitions usually dealt only with some specific grievance; from that time dates
                    the present practice of petitioning with regard to general measures of public
                    policy. Since 1833 more than 700,000 petitions on public matters have been
                    presented to the House of Commons. Petitions to the crown need not apparently be
                    in any particular form, but no doubt they would not be received if couched in
                    unbecoming language. Petitions to the Houses of Lords and Commons must be framed
                    in a prescribed form. They must be properly superscribed, and must conclude with
                    a prayer. They must be in writing (in the Commons), must contain none but
                    genuine signatures, and must be free from disrespectful language or imputations
                    upon any tribunal or constituted authority. They must be presented by a member
                    of the House, except petitions to the House of Commons from the corporation of
                    London, which may be presented at the bar by the sheriffs, and from the
                    corporation of Dublin, which may be presented by the lord mayor. Though a
                    petition is made to the House, in practice petitions to the Commons are referred
                    to the committee on public petitions, under whose directions they are classified
                    and analysed. In the Lords receivers and triers of petitions are still
                    appointed, though their functions have long been obsolete. Petitions may be sent
                    free by post to members of either house, provided they fulfil certain conditions
                    as to weight, &amp;c. (see May, <hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Practice,</hi>
                    ch. xix,).</p>
                <p>In the United States the right of petition is secured by Art. 1 of the Amended
                    Constitution, which enacts that “Congress shall make no law abridging . . . the
                    right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the Government for a
                    redress of grievances.”</p>

                    Strictly speaking these are no doubt an indirect mode of petitioning the crown,
                    for in the theory of English law the crown is the fountain of justice. But it is
                    more convenient to treat them separately, as they now form a part of the
                    practice of the courts. Appeals to the House of Lords and the privy council are
                    prosecuted by petition of appeal. The House of Lords has now no original
                    jurisdiction in judicial matters; the original jurisdiction of the privy council
                    in such matters is confined to petitions under certain statutes, such as the
                    Endowed Schools Acts 1867 and 1873, the Public Schools Act 1868, the
                    Universities Act 1877, and the Patents Act 1883. In most cases the petitions are
                    referred to the judicial committee of the privy council. Petitions may be
                    addressed to the lord chancellor in a few instances, such as the sealing of
                    patents and the removal of coroners and county court judges. The most important
                    use of petitions in England is in the Chancery Division of the High Court of
                    Justice. They may be presented either as interlocutory proceedings in the course
                    of an action, or as original proceedings where no litigation exists,—a petition
                    being generally a more cheap and speedy form of remedy than an action. Petitions
                    in the course of an action are usually presented to the court in which the
                    action is brought. Examples of original petitions are those under the Lands
                    Clauses Acts, the Trustee Acts, the Companies Acts. In a few cases they may be
                    brought by way of appeal, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> under the Charitable
                    Trusts Act 1860. Petitions are also modes of procedure in other courts with
                    jurisdiction in equity, as the chancery courts of the county palatine of
                    Lancaster and the county courts, in the latter only in certain cases falling
                    within the County Courts Act 1865, 28 and 29 Vict. c. 99, s. 1 (5) and (6). They
                    are used to initiate proceedings in bankruptcy and divorce, but are almost
                    unknown in the Queen’s Bench Division; the only case of procedure by petition in
                    that division seems to be the petition to sue <hi rend="italic">in forma
                    pauperis.</hi> Evidence in support of a petition is usually given by
                    affidavit.</p>
                <p>In Scotland petitions in the Court of Session are either original or in a pending
                    action. Original petitions are presented to one of the divisions of the inner
                    house, unless they are included in any of the matters mentioned in 20 and 21
                    Vict. c. 56, s. 4, when they are brought before the junior lord ordinary, or
                    unless, by special statutory provision, they may be brought before any lord
                    ordinary, as in the case of petitions under the Conjugal Rights Act 1861, or the
                    Trusts Act 1867. In the sheriff court actions are commenced by petition (39 and
                    40 Vict. c. 70, s. 6). A <hi rend="italic">petition and complaint</hi> is a
                    process of a quasi-criminal nature by which certain matters of extraordinary
                    jurisdiction are brought under the notice of the Court of Session. It lies
                    against magistrates and officers of the law for breach of duty, against parties
                    guilty of contempt of court, &amp;c. The concurrence of the lord advocate is
                    necessary to a petition and complaint. A <hi rend="italic">reclaiming
                    petition,</hi> obsolete in the Court of Session, is a form of process of appeal
                    in the sheriff court. See 39 and 40 Vict. c. 70, ss. 28, 30.</p>
                <p>In the United States petitions can be presented to the courts under much the same
                    circumstances as in England. “It is a general rule in such cases that an
                    affidavit should be made that the facts therein contained are true as far as <pb

                    which he states as knowing from others he believes to be true” (Bouvier, <hi

                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Elections</hi> must now be read subject to the
                    Parliamentary Elections Act 1879 and the Judicature Act 1881. By the Act of 1879
                    the trial of an election petition is conducted before two judges instead of one,
                    as before. If the judges differ in opinion as to whether the member petitioned
                    against is duly elected or not, he is deemed to be duly elected. The Act of 1881
                    provides for the annual appointment of three judges of the Queen’s Bench
                    Division for the trial of election petitions, and makes the judgment of the High
                    Court of Justice in election cases final unless leave be given to appeal to the
                    Court of Appeal. No appeal lies to tÿa House of Lords, nor can any judge who is
                    a peer sit on the trial of an election petition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Petition of Right</hi> is a term confined to English law. It is
                    used in two senses. (1) It denotes the statute 3 Car. I. c. 1, a parliamentary
                    declaration of the liberties of the people. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >England,</hi> vol. viii. p. 345.) (2) It denotes a mode of prosecuting a claim
                    against the crown by a subject. This remedy is said to owe its origin to Edward
                    I. It lies as a rule for obtaining possession of real or personal property, or
                    for breach of contract, not for breach of public duty, as failure to perform
                    treaty obligations, or for trespass, or for negligence of crown servants. The
                    remedy where the crown is in possession of property of the suppliant, and the
                    title of the crown appears by record, as by inquest of office, is a somewhat
                    different one, called <hi rend="italic">monstrans</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    droit.</hi> The procedure on a petition of right is either at common law or by
                    statute. At common law the petition suggests such a right as controverts the
                    title of the crown, and the crown indorses upon the petition <hi rend="italic"
                    >Soit</hi><hi rend="italic">droit</hi><hi rend="italic">fait al partie.</hi>
                    Thereupon a commission is issued to inquire into the truth of the suggestion.
                    After the return to the commission, the attorney-general pleads or demurs, and
                    the merits are then determined as in actions between subject and subject. If the
                    right be determined against the crown, judgment of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ousterlemain</hi> or <hi rend="italic">amoveas manus</hi> is given in favour of
                    the suppliant. The Petitions of Right Act 1860 (23 and 24 Vict. c. 34, extended
                    to Ireland by 36 and 37 Vict. c. 69) preserves to the suppliant his right to
                    proceed at common law, but gives an alternative remedy. In proceedings under the
                    statute the petition is left with the secretary of state for the home department
                    for her majesty’s consideration. She, if she think fit, grants her fiat that
                    right be done, whereupon the fiat is served upon the solicitor to the treasury,
                    and a statement of defence is put in on behalf of the crown. The proceedings are
                    thenceforth assimilated as far as possible to those in an ordinary action. A
                    judgment in favour of the suppliant is equivalent to a judgment of <hi
                    rend="italic">amoveas manus.</hi> Costs are payable to and by the crown. A
                    petition of right is tried in the Chancery or Queen’s Bench Division, unless the
                    subject-matter of the petition arises out of the exercise of belligerent right
                    on behalf of the crown, or would be cognizable in a prize court if the matter
                    were in dispute between private persons. In either of these cases the suppliant
                    may at his option intitule his petition in the Admiralty Division (27 and 28
                    Vict. c. 25, s. 52). <hi rend="smallcaps">(j.</hi> wf.)</p>
