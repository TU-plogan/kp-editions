                <p><label type="entry">PETER I</label>., <hi rend="smallcaps">Alexeievich,</hi>
                    surnamed <hi rend="smallcaps">The Great</hi> (1672- 1725), czar of Russia, was
                    born at Moscow on 11th June 1672. His mother, Natalia Narishkina, was the second
                    wife of the czar Alexis. He was taught reading and writing, and the limited
                    range of subjects which then constituted education in Russia, by the deacon
                    Nikita Zotoff. He came to the throne in the year 1682, on the death of his elder
                    brother Feodore; there was another brother, Ivan, who was six years his senior,
                    but he was weak both in body and mind. Feodore therefore had wished Peter to
                    succeed him, but Sophia, his sister, a woman of strong character and great
                    ambition, was desirous that Ivan should rule, so that she might be proclaimed
                    regent and in reality exercise the sovereignty. She therefore fomented a revolt
                    of the “streltzi,” or native militia, and the result was a compromise, whereby
                    Ivan and Peter were to reign jointly. On the death of Ivan in 1696 Peter became
                    sole ruler, and punished Sophia by incarcerating her for life in the Devichi
                    monastery, where she died in 1704.</p>
                <p>With the aid of Lefort, a Swiss adventurer, and other foreigners, Peter commenced
                    his remarkable reforms, for which see <hi rend="smallcaps">Russia.</hi> Here
                    nothing more than a brief summary of the leading events of his life is given. In
                    the year 1696 he besieged and took Azoff, his great object being to give Russia
                    a seaboard. In 1697 he made his first Continental tour, on which occasion he
                    worked at the dockyards of Zaandam and Deptford. On leaving England he took with
                    him many ingenious men who wished to try their fortunes in a new country,—among
                    them Perry the engineer, who has left us an interesting account of Russia at
                    that time. From England Peter went to Vienna, where he studied the tactics of
                    the imperial army, then enjoying a great reputation throughout Europe, and was
                    meditating a visit to Italy when he heard of a revolt of the streltzi, fomented
                    by the partisans of the old régime, in consequence of which he hurried back to
                    Moscow, and on his arrival punished the rebels with the greatest severity.</p>
                <p>In the year 1700 he joined Poland and Denmark against Sweden. Although defeated
                    at Narva the same year, he pursued his plans unremittingly, and in 1709 won the
                    battle of Poltava, after which Charles, the Swedish king, became a fugitive in
                    Turkey. In 1703 the foundations of St Petersburg were laid. Peter had married in
                    1689 <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n730/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0730-0699"/> Eudoxia Lopukhin, but had divorced her in 1696;
                    she bore him a son, Alexis. In 1711 he took as his second wife Martha
                    Skavronska, whom he caused to be baptized in the Greek Church under the name of
                    Catherine. In this year took place Peter’s unsuccessful campaign in Turkey,
                    which ended with the loss of Azoff. The well-known story of his being rescued by
                    Catherine when on the point of being obliged to surrender to the enemy has been
                    shown to be of very doubtful authority. In 1713 Peter had made himself master of
                    a considerable strip of the Swedish coast. In 1716 he went on another European
                    tour in the company of his wife; on this occasion he visited, among other
                    places, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, and Paris. During his absence his son Alexis, who
                    had been a constant source of trouble to him, became more rebellious and
                    estranged from his father. He was openly leagued with the reactionary party in
                    Russia, who looked forward to his assistance in reversing the policy of Peter,
                    as soon as he should succeed to the throne. Peter on his return in 1718 forced
                    his son to renounce all claim to the sovereignty. Alexis was afterwards tried
                    for high treason and sentenced to death; soon it was given out that he had died
                    suddenly. The fate of this wretched young man has only been ascertained in
                    modern times; it seems tolerably clear that he sank under repeated inflictions
                    of torture. His death is a dark stain upon the character of Peter. On 10th
                    September 1721 the peace of Nystad was concluded, by which Sweden ceded Livonia,
                    Esthonia, Ingria, Carelia, Viborg, and the adjacent islands to Russia. In 1724
                    Peter went to inspect the works on Lake Ladoga, and further weakened his
                    constitution, which had long been in an unhealthy state on account of the
                    continual excitement and arduous labours of his life. The czar died on 28th
                    January 1725.</p>
                <p>The character of Peter exhibits a strange congeries of opposed qualities.
                    According to some he “knouted” Russia into civilization; others see in him the
                    true “father of his country” and the founder of Russian greatness. In spite of
                    his errors, no one will deny that he was a man of great genius; his was the
                    “fiery soul that, working out its way,” exhausted prematurely a vigorous
                    physical organization. Although frequently cruel, on many occasions he showed
                    humanity and tenderness, and even in his most violent fits of temper was
                    amenable to advice, as he evinced in enduring the rebukes of Prince James
                    Dolgoruki. All Russia seems but the monument of this strange colossal man. He
                    added six provinces to her dominions, gave her an outlet upon two seas, a
                    regular army trained in European tactics in lieu of the disorderly militia
                    previously existing, a fleet, and a naval academy, and, besides these, galleries
                    of painting and sculpture and libraries. The title of “Great” cannot justly be
                    refused to such a man.</p>
