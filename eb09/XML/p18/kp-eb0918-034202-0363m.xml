                    the typical genus of the order to which it gives its name. The species are
                    mostly natives of western tropical South America; others are found in various
                    tropical and subtropical districts of both hemispheres. The tacsonias, by some
                    considered to form part of this genus, inhabit the Andes at considerable
                    elevations. They are mostly climbing plants (fig. 1 ) having a woody stock and
                    herbaceous or woody branches, from the sides of which tendrils are produced
                    which enable the branches to support themselves at little expenditure of tissue.
                    Some few form trees of considerable stature destitute of tendrils, and with
                    broad magnolia-like leaves in place of the more or less palmately-lobed leaves
                    which are most generally met with in the order. Whatever be the form of leaf, it
                    is usually provided at the base of the leafstalk with stipules, which are
                    inconspicuous, or large and leafy; and the stalk is also furnished with one or
                    more glandular excrescences, as in some cases are the leaf itself and the
                    bracts. The inflorescence is of a cymose character, the terminal branch being
                    represented by the tendril, the side-branches by flower-stalks, or the
                    inflorescence may be reduced to a single stalk. The bracts on the flower-stalk
                    are either small and scattered or large and leafy, and then placed near the
                    flower forming a sort of outer calyx or epicalyx. The flower itself (seen in
                    section in fig. 2) consists of a calyx varying in form from that of a shallow
                    saucer to that of a long cylindrical or trumpet-shaped tube, thin or fleshy in
                    consistence, and giving off from its upper border the five sepals, the five
                    petals (rarely these latter are absent), and the threads or membranous processes
                    constituting the “corona.” This coronet forms the most conspicuous and beautiful
                    part of the flower of many species, and consists of outgrowths from the tube
                    formed subsequently to the other parts, and having little morphological
                    significance, but being physiologically useful in favouring the
                    cross-fertilization of the flower by means of insects. Other outgrowths of
                    similar character, but less conspicuous, occur lower down the tube, and their
                    variations afford useful means of discriminating between the species. From the
                    base of the inner part of the tube of the flower, but quite free from it,
                    uprises a cylindrical stalk surrounded below by a small cup-like out growth, and
                    bearing above the middle a ring of five flat filaments each attached by a
                    thread-like point to an anther. Above the ring of stamens is the ovary itself,
                    upraised on a prolongation of the same stalk which bears the filaments, or
                    sessile. The stalk supporting the stamens and ovary is called the “gynophore” or
                    the “gynandrophore,” and is a special characteristic of the order, shared <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0364-0343"/> in by the Capparids and no other order. The ovary
                    of passionflowers is one-celled with three parietal placentas, and bears at the
                    top three styles, each capped by a large button-like stigma. The ovary ripens
                    into a berry-like, very rarely capsular, fruit with the three groups of seeds
                    arranged in lines along the walls, but embedded in a pulpy arillus derived from
                    the stalk of the seed. This succulent berry is in some cases highly perfumed,
                    and affords a delicate fruit for the dessert-table as in the case of the
                    “granadilla,” <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic">quadrangularis,</hi><hi

                    “curubas” in Spanish South America. The fruits in question do not usually exceed
                    in size the dimensions of a hen’s or of a swan’s egg, but that of <hi
                    rend="italic">P. macrocarpa</hi> is a gourd-like oblong fruit attaining a weight
                    of 7 to 8 Bb. Many species are cultivated for the beauty of their flowers, and
                    one or two species are nearly hardy in south and western Britain and Ireland,
                    the commonest, <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic">caerulea,</hi> being,
                    singular to say, a native of southern Brazil. Many species of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tacsοniα</hi> would probably prove equally hardy. The name
                    passionflower— <hi rend="italic">-flos passionis</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    arose from the supposed resemblance of the corona to the crown of thorns, and of
                    the other parts of the flower to the nails, or wounds, while the five sepals and
                    five petals were taken to symbolize the ten apostles,—Peter, who denied, and
                    Judas, who betrayed, being left out of the reckoning. In some of the botanical
                    books of the 16th and 17th centuries curious illustrations of these flowers are
                    given, in which the artist’s faith or imagination has been exercised at the
                    expense of actual fact.</p>
