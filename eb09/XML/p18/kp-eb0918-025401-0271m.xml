                    quantity of irrelevant rubbish which lies around those foundations, concealing
                    their real strength and security. The question of the parallel axiom in Euclid’s
                    geometry is to some extent an exception. There have been endless discussions
                    concerning it. The difficulty is well known, and will be found succinctly stated
                    in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Geometry</hi> (vol. x. p. 378). Those who
                    have treated the subject have devoted themselves either to criticizing the form
                    of Euclid’s axiom, suggesting modifications or substitutes (sometimes with
                    undoubted advantage, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Playfair), or to questioning
                    its necessity, offering either to demonstrate the axiom or to dispense with it
                    altogether. It would serve no useful purpose to attempt a complete account of
                    the literature of the subject; we may refer the reader who is curious in such
                    matters to the various editions of Perronet Thomson’s <hi rend="italic">Geometry
                    without Axioms.</hi> It will be sufficient to mention Legendre’s views, which,
                    although by no means reaching to the root of the matter, may be held as
                    indicating the dawn of the true theory.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Lagrange. It is said that towards the end of his life he wrote and actually took
                    to the Institute a paper dealing with the theory of parallels. He had begun to
                    read it; but, before he had proceeded very far, something struck him. He stopped
                    reading, muttered “Il faut que j’y songe encore,” and put the paper in his
                    pocket (De Morgan, <hi rend="italic">Budget of Paradoxes,</hi> p. 173). There
                    appears to be no doubt that the true theory first presented itself to the mind
                    of Gauss. The history of the matter is interesting, and deserves to be more
                    generally known than it appears to be. In his earlier days, before his career in
                    life was determined, when he had to consider the possibility of his becoming a
                    teacher of mathematics, he drew up a paper in which he gave a philosophical
                    development of the elements of mathematics. It was probably in the course of
                    this discussion (about 1792) that he first came across the difficulty of the
                    parallel axiom. He arrived at the conclusion that geometry became a logically
                    consistent structure only after the parallel axiom was given as part of its
                    foundation; and he convinced himself that this axiom could not be proved,
                    although from experience (for example, from the sum of the angles of the
                    geodesic triangle Brocken, Hohenhagen, Inselberg) we know that it is at least
                    very approximately true. If, on the other hand, this axiom be not granted, there
                    follows another kind of geometry, which he developed to a considerable extent
                    and called the antieuclidian geometry.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>“In leisure hours now and then I have again been reflecting on a subject which
                    with me is now nearly forty years old; I mean the first principles of geometry;
                    I do not know if I have ever told you my views on that matter. Here too I have
                    carried many things to farther consolidation, and my conviction that we cannot
                    lay the foundation of geometry completely <hi rend="italic">a ιrriori</hi> has
                    become if possible firmer than before. Meantime it will be long before I bring
                    myself to work out my <hi rend="italic">very extensive</hi> researches on this
                    subject for publication, perhaps I shall never do so during my lifetime; for I
                    fear the outcry of the Boeotians, were I to speak out my views on the
                    question.”</p>
                <p>Bessel entered heartily into the ideas of Gauss, and urged him to publish them
                    regardless of the Boeotians. Concerning the generality of mathematicians in his
                    day, Gauss probably judged rightly, however, for his intimate correspondent
                    Schumacher was, as we learn from their correspondence in 1831, unable to follow
                    the new idea. One of the letters (Gauss to Schumacher, 12th July 1831) is of
                    great interest because it shows us that Gauss was then in full possession of the
                    most important propositions of what is now called hyperbolic geometry. In
                    particular he states that in hyperbolic space the circumference of a circle of
                    radius <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is τrA Q* _ <hi rend="italic subscript">
                    e</hi><hi rend="italic">~k</hi>), where <hi rend="italic">Ιc</hi> is a constant,
                    which we know from experience to be infinitely great compared with any length
                    that we can measure (supposing, he means, the space of our experience to be
                    hyperbolic), and which in Euclid’s geometry is infinite.</p>
                <p>Gauss never published these researches; and no traces of them seem to have been
                    found among his papers after his death. Our first knowledge of the hyperbolic
                    geometry dates from the publication of the works of ⅛Γ. Lobatschewsky and W.
                    Bolyai. Lobatschewsky's views were first published in a lecture before the
                    Faculty of Mathematics and Physics in Kasan, 12th February 1826. See Frischauf,
                    <hi rend="italic">Elemente der Absoluten Geometrie,</hi> Leipsic, 1876, page 33.
                    Speaking of a German edition of Lobatschewsky’s work, which he had seen
                    published at Berlin in 1840, Gauss says that he finds nothing in it which is
                    materially new to him, but that Lobatschewsky's method of development is
                    different from his own, and is a masterly performance carried out in the true
                    geometric spirit. The theory received its complement in the famous <hi
                    rend="italic">Habilitationsschrift</hi> of Riemann, in which the elliptic
                    geometry for the first time appears. Beltrami, Helmholtz, Cayley, Klein, and
                    others have greatly developed the subject; but it is unnecessary to pursue its
                    later history here, since all essential details will be found in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Measurement,</hi> vol. xv. p. 659. All that we need do is to
                    call the attention of those who busy themselves with mental philosophy to this
                    generalization of geometry, as one of the results of modern mathematical
                    research which they cannot afford to. overlook. (G. CH.)</p>
