                <p><label type="entry">PALMERSTON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Henry John Temple,
                    Viscount</hi></label>, (1784-1865), statesman, minister of foreign affairs, and
                    twice prime minister of England, was born at Broadlands, near Romsey, Hants, on
                    the 2Oth October 1784. The Irish branch of the Temple family, from which Lord
                    Palmerston descended, was very distantly related to the great English house of
                    the same name, which played so conspicuous a part in the politics of the 18th
                    century; but these Irish Temples were not without distinction. In the reign of
                    Elizabeth they had furnished a secretary to Sir Philip Sidney and to Essex. In
                    the reign of William and Mary Sir William Temple figured as one of the ablest
                    diplomatists of the age. From his younger brother, who was speaker of the Irish
                    House of Commons, Lord Palmerston descended; the son of the speaker was created
                    a peer of Ireland, March 12, 1722, and was succeeded by his grandson, the second
                    viscount, who married a Miss Mee, a lady celebrated for her beauty, who became
                    the mother of the subject of this notice. Lord and Lady Palmerston were persons
                    of great taste and fashion, who travelled several times in Italy with their
                    children. Their eldest son, Henry John, is mentioned by Lady Elliot in her
                    correspondence as a boy of singular vivacity and energy. These qualities adhered
                    to him through life, and he had scarcely left Harrow, at the age of eighteen,
                    when the death of his father (April 17, 1802) raised him to the Irish peerage,
                    and placed him at the head of his family. It was no doubt owing to his birth and
                    connexions, but still more to his own talents and character, that Lord
                    Palmerston was thrown at a very early age into the full stream of political and
                    official life. Before he was four-and twenty he had stood two contested
                    elections for the university of Cambridge, at which he was defeated, and he
                    entered parliament for a pocket-borough, Newtown, Isle of Wight, in June 1807.
                    Through the interest of his guardians Lord Malmesbury and Lord Chichester, the
                    duke of Portland made him one of the junior lords of the Admiralty on the
                    formation of his administration in 1807. A few months later he delivered his
                    maiden speech in the House of Commons in defence of the expedition against
                    Copenhagen, which he conceived to be justified by the known designs of Napoleon
                    on the Danish court. This speech was so successful that it marked him out as one
                    of the rising statesmen of the day, in so much that, when Perceval formed his
                    Government in 1809, he proposed to this young man of five and-twenty to take the
                    chancellorship of the exchequer, following apparently the examples of Pitt and
                    Lord Henry Petty, who had filled that office at about the same age. Lord
                    Palmerston, however, though extremely surprised and flattered by the proposal,
                    had the wisdom to refuse it, on the ground that he was totally ignorant of
                    finance, and had only once addressed the House of Commons. Nor did he allow the
                    offer of a seat in the cabinet to break his modest resolution. He contented
                    himself with the far less important office of secretary at war, charged
                    exclusively with the financial business of the army, without a seat in the
                    cabinet, and in this position he remained, singularly enough, without any signs
                    of an ambitious temperament or of great political abilities, for twenty years
                    (1809-1828). His administrative talents were confined within the limits of the
                    War Office, which he kept in perfect order, and his parliamentary speeches to
                    the annual statements in which he moved the army estimates of those eventful
                    years. During the whole of that period Lord Palmerston was chiefly known as a
                    man of fashion, and a subordinate minister without influence on the general
                    policy of the cabinets he served. Some of the most humorous poetical pieces in
                    the <hi rend="italic">New Whig Guide</hi> were from his pen, and he was entirely
                    devoted, like his friends Peel and Croker, to the Tory party of that day.</p>
                <p>The political opinions of Lord Palmerston at that time, and perhaps through life,
                    were those of the school of Pitt —not the effete Toryism of the Pitt clubs,
                    which he always treated with disdain, but the enlarged Conservative views of the
                    great minister himself, as represented after Pitt’s death by Canning. Lord
                    Palmerston never was a Whig, still less a Radical; he was a statesman of the old
                    English aristocratic type, liberal in his sentiments, favourable to the cause of
                    justice and the march of progress, but entirely opposed to the claims of
                    democratic government. Thus he supported from the first the cause of Catholic
                    emancipation, and he sympathized warmly with the constitutional party throughout
                    the world, but he was opposed to the extension of the franchise in England, and
                    he regarded the impulse of popular power as a force to be directed and
                    controlled rather than obeyed. So successfully did he practise the art of
                    governing a free people that he lived to be regarded as a popular minister,
                    though he had been for twenty years a member of a Tory Government, and never
                    materially altered his own opinions.</p>
                <p>In the later years of Lord Liverpool’s administration, after the death of Lord
                    Londonderry in 1822, strong dissensions existed in the cabinet. The Liberal
                    section of the Government was gaining ground. Canning became foreign minister
                    and leader of the House of Commons. Huskisson began to advocate and apply the
                    doctrines of free trade. Catholic emancipation was made an open question.
                    Although Lord Palmerston was not in the cabinet, he cordially supported the
                    measures of Canning and his friends. Upon the death of Lord Liverpool, Canning
                    was called to the head of affairs; the Tories, including Peel, withdrew their
                    support, and an alliance was formed between the Liberal members of the late
                    ministry and the Whigs. In this combination the chancellorship of the exchequer
                    was first offered to Lord Palmerston, who accepted it, but this appointment was
                    frustrated by the king’s intrigue with Herries, and Palmerston was content to
                    remain secretary at war with a seat in the cabinet, which he now entered for the
                    first time. The Canning administration ended in four months bv the death of its
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n211/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0211-0194"/> illustrious chief, and was succeeded by the
                    feeble ministry of Lord Goderich, which barely survived the year. But the
                    “Canningites,” as they were termed, remained, and the duke of Wellington
                    hastened to include Palmerston, Huskisson, Charles Grant, Lamb, and Dudley in
                    his Government. A dispute between the duke and Huskisson soon led to the
                    resignation of that minister, and his friends felt bound to share his fate. In
                    the spring of 1828 Palmerston found himself, for the first time in his life, in
                    opposition. From that moment he appears to have directed his attention closely
                    to foreign affairs; indeed he had already urged on the duke of Wellington a more
                    active interference in the affairs of Greece; he had made several visits to
                    Paris, where he foresaw with great accuracy the impending revolution; and on the
                    1st June 1829 he made a speech on foreign affairs of such excellence that never
                    but once in his long career did he surpass it. For it may here be remarked that
                    Lord Palmerston was no orator; his language was unstudied, and his delivery
                    somewhat embarrassed; but he generally found words to say the right thing at the
                    right time, and to address the House of Commons in the language best adapted to
                    the capacity and the temper of his audience. An attempt was made by the duke of
                    Wellington in September 1830 to induce Palmerston to re enter the cabinet, which
                    he refused to do without Lord Lansdowne and Lord Grey, and from that time
                    forward he may be said to have associated his political fortunes with those of
                    the Whig party. It was therefore natural that Lord Grey should place the
                    department of foreign affairs in his hands upon the formation of the great
                    ministry of 1830, and Palmerston entered with zeal on the duties of an office
                    over which he continued to exert his powerful influence, both in and out of
                    office, for twenty years.</p>
                <p>The revolution of July 1830 had just given a strong shock to the existing
                    settlement of Europe. The kingdom of the Netherlands was rent asunder by the
                    Belgian revolution; Portugal was the scene of civil war; the Spanish succession
                    was about to open and place an infant princess on the throne. Poland was in arms
                    against Russia, and the Northern powers formed a closer alliance, threatening to
                    the peace and the liberties of Europe. In presence of these varied dangers, Lord
                    Palmerston was prepared to act with spirit and resolution. The king of the
                    Netherlands had appealed to the powers who had placed him on the throne to
                    maintain his rights; and a conference assembled accordingly in London to -settle
                    the question, which involved the independence of Belgium and the security of
                    England. On the one hand, the Northern powers were anxious to defend the king of
                    Holland; on the other hand a party in France aspired to annex the Belgian
                    provinces. The policy of the British Government was a close alliance with
                    France, but an alliance based on the principle that no interests were to be
                    promoted at variance with the just rights of others, or which could give to any
                    other nation well-founded cause of jealousy. If the Northern powers supported
                    the king of Holland by force, they would encounter the resistance of France and
                    England united in arms; if France sought to annex Belgium she would forfeit the
                    alliance of England, and find herself opposed by the whole continent of Europe.
                    In the end the policy of England prevailed; numerous difficulties, both great
                    and small, were overcome by the conference; although on the verge of war, peace
                    was maintained; and Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg was placed upon the throne of
                    Belgium, which enjoyed for half a century the benefits of his enlightened rule,
                    followed with equal success by that of his son and successor. Upon the whole
                    this transaction may be regarded as the most important and most successful of
                    Lord Palmerston’s public life.</p>
                <p>Tn 1833 and 1834 the youthful queens Donna Maria of Portugal and Isabella of
                    Spain were the representatives and the hope of the constitutional party in those
                    countries, —assailed and hard pressed by their absolutist kinsmen Don Miguel and
                    Don Carlos, who were the representatives of the male line of succession. Lord
                    Palmerston conceived and executed the plan of a quadruple alliance of the
                    constitutional states of the West to serve as a counterpoise to the Northern
                    alliance. A treaty for the pacification of the Peninsula was signed in London on
                    the 22d April 1834; and, although the struggle was somewhat prolonged in Spain,
                    it accomplished its object. France, however, had been a reluctant party to this
                    treaty. She never executed her share in it with zeal or fidelity. Louis Philippe
                    was accused of favouring the Carlists underhand, and he positively refused to be
                    a party to direct interference in Spain. It is probable that the hesitation of
                    the French court on this question was one of the causes of the extreme personal
                    hostility Lord Palmerston never ceased to show towards the king of the French
                    down to the end of his life, if indeed that sentiment had not taken its origin
                    at a much earlier period. Nevertheless, at this same time (June 1834) Lord
                    Palmerston wrote that “Paris is the pivot of my foreign policy.” Μ. Thiers was
                    at that time in office. Unfortunately these differences, growing out of the
                    opposite policies of the two countries at the court of Madrid, increased in each
                    succeeding year; and a constant but sterile rivalry was kept up, which ended in
                    results more or less humiliating and injurious to both nations.</p>
                <p>The affairs of the East interested Lord Palmerston in the highest degree. During
                    the Greek War of Independence he had strenuously supported the claims of the
                    Hellenes against the Turks and the execution of the treaty of London. But from
                    1830 the defence of the Ottoman empire became one of the cardinal objects of his
                    policy. He believed in the regeneration of Turkey. “All that we hear,” he wrote
                    to Mr Bulwer, “about the decay of the Turkish empire, and its being a dead body
                    or a sapless trunk, and so forth, is pure unadulterated nonsense.” The two great
                    aims he had in view were to prevent the establishment of Russia on the Bosphorus
                    and the establishment of France on the Nile, and he regarded the maintenance of
                    the authority of the Porte as the chief barrier against both these aggressions.
                    Against Russia he had long maintained a suspicious and hostile attitude. He was
                    a party to the publication of the “Portfolio” in 1834, and to the mission of the
                    “Vixen” to force the blockade of Circassia about the same time. He regarded the
                    treaty of Unkiar Skelessi which Russia extorted from the Porte in 1832, when she
                    came to the relief of the sultan after the battle of Konieh, with great
                    jealousy; and, when the power of Mohammed Ali in Egypt appeared to threaten the
                    existence of the Ottoman dynasty, he succeeded in effecting a combination of all
                    the powers, who signed the celebrated collective note of 27th July 1839,
                    pledging them to maintain the independence and integrity of the Turkish empire
                    as a security for the peace of Europe. On two former occasions, in 1833 and in
                    1835, the policy of Lord Palmerston, who proposed to afford material aid to the
                    Porte against the pasha of Egypt, was overruled by the cabinet; and again, in
                    1839, when Baron Brunnow first proposed the active interference of Russia and
                    England, the offer was rejected. But in 1840 Lord Palmerston returned to the
                    charge and prevailed. The moment was critical, for Mohammed Ali had occupied
                    Syria and won the battle of Nezib against the Turkish forces, and on the 1st
                    July 1839 the sultan Mohammed expired. The Egyptian forces occupied Syria, and
                    threatened Turkey; and Lord Ponsonby, then British ambassador at Constantinople,
                    vehemently urged the necessity of crushing so <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n212/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0212-0195"/> formidable a rebellion against the Ottoman power.
                    But France, though her ambassador had signed the collective note in the previous
                    year, declined to be a party to measures of coercion against the pasha of Egypt.
                    Palmerston, irritated at her Egyptian policy, flung himself into the arms of the
                    Northern powers, and the treaty of the 15th July 1840 was signed in London
                    without the knowledge or concurrence of France. This measure was not taken
                    without great hesitation, and strong opposition on the part of several members
                    of the British cabinet. Lord Holland and Lord Clarendon and some other ministers
                    thought that, whatever might be the merits of the quarrel between the sultan and
                    the pasha, our interference was not worth the price we were paying for it—an
                    alliance with Russia and the rupture of our alliance with France; and the
                    Government was more than once on the point of dissolution. Lord Palmerston
                    himself declared in a letter to Lord Melbourne that he should quit the ministry
                    if his policy was not adopted; and he carried his point. His consummate
                    knowledge of details, his administrative ability, his impetuous will, and his
                    conviction that France could not declare war against the four great powers of
                    Europe prevailed over the resistance of an indolent premier and hesitating
                    colleagues. The operations were conducted with extraordinary promptitude, good
                    fortune, and success. The bombardment of Beirût, the fall of Acre, and the total
                    collapse of the boasted power of Mohammed Ali followed in rapid succession, and
                    before the close of the year Lord Palmerston’s policy, which had convulsed and
                    terrified Europe, was triumphant, and the author of it was regarded as one of
                    the most powerful statesmen of the age. At the same time, though acting with
                    Russia in the Levant, the British Government engaged in the affairs of
                    Afghanistan to defeat her intrigues in Central Asia, and a contest with China
                    was terminated by the conquest of Chusan, afterwards exchanged for the island of
                    Hong Kong. Seldom has Great Britain occupied a prouder position abroad, although
                    by a singular contrast the cabinet was in the last stage of decrepitude at home.
                    Within a few months Lord Melbourne’s administration came to an end, and Lord
                    Palmerston remained for five years out of office. The crisis was past, but the
                    change which took place by the substitution of Μ. Guizot for Μ. Thiers in
                    France, and of Lord Aberdeen for Lord Palmerston in England, was a fortunate
                    event for the peace of the world. Lord Palmerston had adopted the opinion that
                    peace with France was not to be relied on, and indeed that war between the two
                    countries was sooner or later inevitable. France was in his eyes a power likely
                    to become an enemy; and he encouraged the formation of an English party to
                    thwart her influence all over the world. Had he remained in office, the
                    exasperation caused by his Syrian policy and his harsh refusal to make the
                    slightest conciliatory concession to France, in spite of the efforts of his
                    colleagues, would probably have led to fresh quarrels, and the emperor Nicholas
                    would have achieved his main object, which was the complete rupture of the
                    Anglo-French alliance. Lord Aberdeen and Μ. Guizot inaugurated a different
                    policy; by mutual confidence and friendly offices they entirely succeeded in
                    restoring the most cordial understanding between, the two Governments, and the
                    irritation which Lord Palmerston had inflamed gradually subsided. During the
                    administration of Sir Robert Peel, Lord Palmerston led a retired life, but he
                    attacked with characteristic bitterness the Ashburton treaty with the United
                    States, which closed successfully some other questions he had long kept open. In
                    all these transactions, whilst full justice must be done to the force and
                    patriotic vigour which Lord Palmerston brought to bear on the questions he took
                    in hand, it was but too apparent that he imported into them an amount of
                    passion, of personal animosity, and imperious language which rendered him in the
                    eyes of the queen and of his colleagues a dangerous minister. On this ground,
                    when Lord John Russell attempted, in December 1845, to form a ministry, the
                    combination failed because Lord Grey refused to join a Government in which Lord
                    Palmerston should resume the direction of foreign affairs. A few months later,
                    however, this difficulty was surmounted; the Whigs returned to power, and
                    Palmerston to the foreign office, with a strong assurance that Lord John Russell
                    should exercise a strict control over his proceedings. A few days sufficed to
                    show how vain was this expectation. The French Government regarded the
                    appointment of Palmerston as a certain sign of renewed hostilities, and they
                    availed themselves of a despatch in which Palmerston had put forward the name of
                    a Coburg prince as a candidate for the hand of the young queen of Spain, as a
                    justification for a departure from the engagements entered into between Μ.
                    Guizot and Lord AberdeeU. However little the conduct of the French Government in
                    this transaction of the Spanish marriages can be vindicated, it is certain that
                    it originated in the belief that in Palmerston France had a restless and subtle
                    enemy. The efforts of the British minister to defeat the French marriages of the
                    Spanish princesses, by an appeal to the treaty of Utrecht and the other powers
                    of Europe, were wholly unsuccessful; France won the game, though with no small
                    loss of honourable reputation. Not long afterwards Sir Henry Bulwer was expelled
                    from the Peninsula for an attempt to lecture General Narvaez on his duties, and
                    for his notorious intrigues with the opposition; and in Paris the British
                    embassy became the centre of every species of attack on the king’s Government,
                    so that friendly diplomatic relations were temporarily interrupted with both
                    countries. No doubt the rupture of the Anglo-French alliance and the tension
                    existing between the two Governments contributed in some degree to the
                    catastrophe of 1848, which drove Louis Philippe from the throne, and overthrew
                    the constitutional monarchy in France; but Palmerston did not regret the
                    occurrence or foresee all its consequences.</p>
                <p>The revolution of 1848 spread like a conflagration through Europe, and shook
                    every throne on the Continent except those of Russia and Spain and Belgium.
                    Palmerston sympathized, or was supposed to sympathize, openly with the
                    revolutionary party abroad. No state was regarded by him with more aversion than
                    Austria. Prince Metternich he abhorred; and, with some inconsistency, after the
                    fall of Metternich he still pursued a policy of unrelenting hostility to his
                    successors. Yet his opposition to Austria was chiefly based upon her occupation
                    of great part of Italy and her Italian policy, for Palmerston maintained that
                    the existence of Austria as a great power north of the Alps was an essential
                    element in the system of Europe. Antipathies and sympathies had a large share in
                    the political views of Lord Palmerston, and his sympathies had ever been
                    passionately awakened by the cause of Italian independence. He knew the country;
                    he knew the language; and in London some of his closest friends were Italians,
                    actively engaged in the national cause. Hence he threw all the moral support he
                    could give into the Italian revolution. He supported the Sicilians against the
                    king of Naples, and even allowed arms to be sent them from the arsenal at
                    Woolwich; and, although he had endeavoured to restrain the king of Sardinia from
                    his rash attack on the superior forces of Austria, he obtained for him a
                    reduction of the penalty of defeat. Austria, weakened by the revolution, sent an
                    envoy to London to request the mediation of England, based on a large cession of
                    Italian territory; Lord Palmerston rejected the 4erms <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0213-0196"/> he might have obtained for Piedmont. Ere long the
                    reaction came; this straw-fire of revolution burnt itself out in a couple of
                    years. In Hungary the civil war, which had thundered at the gates of Vienna, was
                    brought to a close by Russian intervention. Prince Schwarzenberg assumed the
                    government of the empire with dictatorial power; and, in spite of what
                    Palmerston termed his “judicious bottleholding,” the movement he had encouraged
                    and applauded, but to which he could give no material aid, was everywhere
                    subdued. The British Government, or at least Palmerston as its representative,
                    was regarded with suspicion and resentment by every power in Europe, except the
                    French republic; and even that was shortly afterwards to be alienated by his
                    attack on Greece.</p>
                <p>This state of things was regarded with the utmost annoyance by the British court
                    and by most of the British ministers. Palmerston had on many occasions taken
                    important steps, without their knowledge, which they disapproved. Over the
                    foreign office he asserted and exercised an arbitrary dominion, which the feeble
                    efforts of the premier could not control. The queen and the prince consort did
                    not conceal their indignation at the position in which he had placed them with,
                    all the other courts of Europe. When Kossuth, the Hungarian leader, landed in
                    England, after having been rescued by Palmerston from the demands made for his
                    surrender, he proposed to receive this personage at Broadlands, a design which
                    was only prevented by a peremptory vote of the cabinet; and in 1850 he took
                    advantage of some very questionable claims on the Hellenic Government to
                    organize an attack on the little kingdom of Greece. Greece being a state under
                    the joint protection of three powers, Russia and France protested against this
                    outrage, and the French ambassador temporarily left London, which promptly led
                    to the termination of the affair. But it was taken up in parliament with great
                    warmth. After one of the most memorable debates of this century, Palmerston’s
                    policy was condemned by a deliberate vote of the House of Lords. The House of
                    Commons was moved by Roebuck to reverse the sentence, which it did by a majority
                    of forty-six, after having heard from Palmerston the most eloquent and powerful
                    speech ever delivered by him, in which he sought to vindicate, not only his
                    claims on the Greek Government for Don Pacifico, but his entire administration
                    of foreign affairs. It wäs in this speech, which lasted five hours, that
                    Palmerston made the well-known declaration that a British subject—“Civis Romanus
                    sum ”—ought everywhere to be protected by the strong arm of the British
                    Government against injustice and wrong. The entire Liberal party, from motives
                    of party allegiance and patriotism, supported the minister who uttered these
                    words. Even Sir Robert Peel, who opposed the resolution, said that the country
                    was proud of him. Yet notwithstanding this parliamentary triumph, there were not
                    a few of his own colleagues and supporters who condemned the spirit in which the
                    foreign relations of the crown were carried on; and in that same year the queen
                    addressed a minute to the prime minister in which Her Majesty recorded her
                    dissatisfaction at the manner in which Lord Palmerston evaded the obligation to
                    submit his measures for the royal sanction, as failing in sincerity to the
                    crown. This minute was communicated to Palmerston, -who did not resign upon it.
                    These various circumstances, and many more, had given rise to distrust and
                    uneasiness in the cabinet, and these feelings reached their climax when
                    Palmerston, on the occurrence of the <hi rend="italic">coup d’état</hi> by which
                    Louis Napoleon made himself master of France, expressed to the French ambassador
                    in London, without the concurrence of his colleagues, his personal approval of
                    that act of lawless violence. Upon this, Lord John Russell advised his dismissal
                    from office (December 1851). Palmerston speedily avenged himself by turning out
                    the Government on a Militia Bill; but, although he survived for many years, and
                    twice filled the highest office in the state, his career as foreign minister
                    ended for ever, and he returned to the foreign office no more. Indeed he assured
                    Lord Aberdeen, in 1853, that he did not wish to resume the seals of that
                    department. Notwithstanding the zeal and ability which he had invariably
                    displayed as foreign minister, it had long been felt by his colleagues that his
                    eager and frequent interference in the affairs of foreign countries, his
                    imperious temper, the extreme acerbity of his language abroad, of which there
                    are ample proofs in his published correspondence, and the evasions and artifices
                    he employed to carry his points at home rendered him a dangerous representative
                    of the foreign interests of the country. He accused every foreign statesman who
                    differed from him of “bully and swagger”; foreign statesmen in more polite
                    language imputed the same defects to him. The lesson of his dismissal from
                    office was not altogether lost upon him; and, although his great reputation was
                    chiefly earned as a foreign minister, it may be said that the last ten years of
                    his life, in which he filled other offices, were not the least useful or
                    dignified portion of his career.</p>
                <p>Upon the formation of the cabinet of 1853, which was composed by the junction of
                    the surviving followers of Sir Robert Peel with the Whigs, under the earl of
                    Aberdeen, Lord Palmerston accepted with the best possible grace the office of
                    secretary of state for the Home Office. He speedily overcame the slight
                    hesitation or reluctance he had expressed when the offer was first made to him,
                    on the ground that the views of Lord Aberdeen and Lord Clarendon on foreign
                    affairs had differed widely from his own; nor was he ever chargeable with the
                    slightest attempt to undermine that Government. At one moment he withdrew from
                    it, because Lord John Russell persisted in presenting a project of reform, which
                    appeared to him entirely out of season; and he advocated, with reason, measures
                    of greater energy on the approach of war, which might possibly, if they had been
                    adopted, have averted the contest with Russia. As the difficulties of the
                    Crimean campaign increased, it was not Lord Palmerston but Lord John Russell who
                    broke up the Government by refusing to meet Roebuck’s motion of inquiry.
                    Palmerston remained faithful and loyal to his colleagues in the hour of danger.
                    Upon the resignation of Lord Aberdeen and the duke of Newcastle, the general
                    sentiment of the House of Commons and the country called Palmerston to the head
                    of affairs, and he entered, on the 5th of February 1855, upon the high office
                    which he retained, with one short interval, to the day of his death. Palmerston
                    was in the seventy-first year of his life when he became prime minister of
                    England.</p>
                <p>A series of fortunate events followed his accession to power. In March 1855 the
                    death of the emperor Nicholas removed his chief antagonist. In September
                    Sebastopol was taken. The administration of the British army was reformed by a
                    consolidation of offices. In the following spring peace was signed in Paris.
                    Never since Pitt had a minister enjoyed a greater share of popularity and power,
                    and, unlike Pitt, Palmerston had the prestige of victory in war. He was assailed
                    in parliament by the eloquence of Gladstone, the sarcasms of Disraeli, and the
                    animosity of the Manchester Radicals, but the country was with him. The Liberals
                    applauded his spirit and his sympathy with the cause of liberty abroad; the
                    Conservatives knew that he would never lend himself to rash reforms and
                    democratic agitation at home. Defeated by a hostile combination of parties in
                    the House of Commons on the question of the Chinese War in 1857, he dissolved
                    the parliament and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n214/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0214-0197"/> appealed to the nation. The result was the utter
                    defeat of the extreme Radical party, and the return of a more compact Liberal
                    majority. The great events of the succeeding years, the Indian revolt and the
                    invasion of Italy by Napoleon III., belong rather to the general history of the
                    times than to the life of Palmerston; but it was fortunate that a strong and
                    able Government was at the head of affairs. Lord Derby’s second administration
                    of 1858 lasted but a single year, Palmerston having casually been defeated on a
                    measure for removing conspiracies to murder abroad from the class of
                    misdemeanour to that of felony, which was introduced in consequence of Orsini’s
                    attempt on the life of the emperor of the French. But in June 1859 Palmerston
                    returned to power, and it was on this occasion that he proposed to Cobden, one
                    of his most constant opponents, to take office; and, on the refusal of that
                    gentleman, Milner Gibson was appointed to the Board of Trade, although he had
                    been the prime mover of the defeat of the Government on the Conspiracy Bill.
                    Palmerston had learnt by experience that it was wiser to conciliate an opponent
                    than to attempt to crush him, and that the imperious tone he had sometimes
                    adopted in the House of Commons, and his supposed obsequiousness to the emperor
                    of the French, were the causes of the temporary reverse he ⅛ad sustained.
                    Although Palmerston approved the objects of the French invasion of Italy, in so
                    far as they went to establish Italian independence, the annexation of Savoy and
                    Nice to France was an incident which revived his old suspicions of the good
                    faith of the French emperor. A proposal was made to him to cede to Switzerland a
                    small portion of territory covering the canton of Geneva, but he rejected the
                    offer, saying, “We shall shame them out of it”; in this he was mistaken, and his
                    remonstrances found no support in Europe. About this time he expressed to the
                    duke of Somerset his conviction that Napoleon III. “had at the bottom of his
                    heart a deep and unextinguishable desire to humble and punish England,” and that
                    war with France was a contingency to be provided against. The unprotected
                    condition of the principal British fortresses and arsenals had long attracted
                    his attention, and he succeeded in inducing the House of Commons to vote nine
                    millions for the fortification of those important points.</p>
                <p>In 1856 the projects for cutting a navigable canal through the Isthmus of Suez
                    was brought forward by Μ. de Lesseps, and resisted by Palmerston with all the
                    weight he could bring to bear against it. He did not foresee the advantages to
                    be derived by British commerce from this great work, and he was strongly opposed
                    to the establishment of a powerful French company on the soil of Egypt. The
                    concession of land to the company was reduced by his intervention, but in other
                    respects the work proceeded and was accomplished. It may here be mentioned, as a
                    remarkable instance of his foresight, that Palmerston told Lord Malmesbury, on
                    his accession to the Foreign Office in 1858, that the chief reason of his
                    opposition to the canal was this :—he believed that, if the canal was made and
                    proved successful, Great Britain, as the first mercantile state, and that most
                    closely connected with the East, would be the power most interested in it; that
                    this country would therefore be drawn irresistibly into a more direct
                    interference in Egypt, which it was desirable to avoid, because England has
                    already enough upon her hands, and because our intervention might lead to a
                    rupture with France. He therefore preferred that no such line of communication
                    should be opened. Recent events have shown that there was much to be said for
                    this remarkable forecast, and that the mercantile advantages of the canal are to
                    some extent counterbalanced by the political difficulties to which it may give
                    rise.</p>
                <p>Upon the outbreak of the American civil war in 1861, Lord Palmerston acknowledged
                    that it was the duty of the British Government to stand aloof from the fray, but
                    his own opinion led him rather to desire than to avert the rupture of the Union,
                    which might have been the result of a refusal on the part of England and France
                    to recognize a blockade of the Southern ports, which was notoriously imperfect,
                    and extremely prejudicial to the interests of Europe. The cabinet was not of
                    this opinion, and, although the belligerent rights of the South were promptly
                    recognized, the neutrality of the Government was strictly observed. When,
                    however, the Southern envoys were taken by force from the “Trent,” a British
                    packet, Palmerston did not hesitate a moment to exact a full and complete
                    reparation for this gross infraction of international law, which President
                    Lincoln was wise enough to make. But the attitude and language of some members
                    of the British Government at that crisis, and the active operations of Southern
                    cruisers, some of which had been fitted out by private firms in British ports,
                    aroused a feeling of resentment amongst the American people which it took many
                    years to efface, and which was at last removed by an award extremely onerous to
                    England. The last transaction in which Palmerston engaged arose out of the
                    attack by the Germanic confederation, and its leading states Austria and
                    Prussia, on the kingdom of Denmark and the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein.
                    There was but one feeling in the British public and the nation as to the
                    dishonest character of that unprovoked aggression, and it was foreseen that
                    Austria would ere long have reason to repent her share in it. Palmerston
                    endeavoured to induce France and Russia to concur with England in maintaining
                    the treaty of London, which had guaranteed the integrity of the Danish
                    dominions. But those powers, for reasons of their own, stood aloof, and the
                    conference held in London in 1864 was without effect. A proposal to send the
                    British fleet into the Baltic was overruled, and the result was that Denmark was
                    left to her own resources against her formidable opponents. It may be
                    interesting to quote, as a specimen of Lord Palmerston’s clear and vigorous
                    style and insight, one of the last letters he ever wrote, for, though it relates
                    to the affair of Schleswig-Holstein, it embraces at a glance the politics of the
                    world.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">“My Dear Russell,</hi> —It was dishonest and unjust to
                    deprive Denmark of Sleswick and Holstein. It is another question how those two
                    duchies, when separated from Denmark, can be disposed of best for the interest
                    of Europe. I should say that, with that view, it is better that they should go
                    to increase the power of Prussia than that they should form another little state
                    to be added to the cluster of small bodies politic which encumber Germany, and
                    render it of less force than it ought to be in the general balance of power in
                    the world. Prussia is too weak as she now is ever to be honest or independent in
                    her action; and, with a view to the future, it is desirable that Germany, in the
                    aggregate, should be strong, in order to control those two ambitious and
                    aggressive powers, France and Russia, that press upon her west and east. As to
                    France, we know how restless and aggressive she is, and how ready to break loose
                    for Belgium, for the Rhine, for anything she would be likely to get without too
                    great an exertion. As to Russia, she will, in due time, become a power almost as
                    great as the old Roman empire. .She can become mistress of all Asia, except
                    British India, whenever she chooses to take it; and, when enlightened
                    arrangements shall have made her revenue proportioned to her territory, and
                    railways shall have abridged distances, her command of men will become enormous,
                    her pecuniary means gigantic, an&lt;l her power of transporting armies over
                    great distances most formidable. Germany ought to be strong in order to resist
                    Russian aggression, and a strong Prussia is essential to German strength.
                    Therefore, though I heartily condemn the whole of the proceedings of Austria and
                    Prussia about the duchies, I own that I should rather see them incorporated with
                    Prussia than converted into an additional asteroid in the system of Europe.
                    Yours sincerely, <hi rend="smallcaps">Palmerston.”</hi></p>

                    year of his age. His remains were laid in Westminster Abbey.</p>
                <p>Although there was much in the official life of Lord Palmerston which inspired
                    distrust and alarm to men of a less ardent and contentious temperament, it is
                    certain that his ambition was not selfish but patriotic, that he had a lofty
                    conception of the strength and the duties of England, that he was the
                    irreconcilable enemy of slavery, injustice, and oppression, and that he laboured
                    with inexhaustible energy for the dignity and security of the empire. In private
                    life his gaiety, his buoyancy, his high-breeding, made even his political
                    opponents forget their differences; and even the warmest altercations on public
                    affairs were merged in his large hospitality and cordial social relations. In
                    this respect he was aided with consummate ability by the tact and grace of Lady
                    Palmerston, the widow of Earl Cowper, whom he married at the close of 1839. She
                    devoted herself with enthusiasm to all her husband’s interests and pursuits, and
                    she made his house the most attractive centre of society in London, if not in
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of Lord Palmerston, by the late Lord Dalling, was
                    published in three volumes in 1870, which owes its chief merit to the selections
                    from the minister’s autobiographical diaries and private correspondence. The
                    work, however, ends at the year 1840, when more than half his ministerial career
                    remained untold. This biography was resumed and continued by Mr Evelyn Ashley in
                    1876, after the death of Lord Dalling; but the whole period from 1846 to 1865 is
                    compressed into two volumes, and no doubt materials are in existence, though
                    still unpublished, which will eventually supply a fuller account of the
                    important part played by this eminent statesman for sixty years in the affairs
                    of the British empire and of Europe.</p>
