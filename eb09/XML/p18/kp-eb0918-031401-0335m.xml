                    situated in 44° 48' N. lat. and 10° 20' E. long., 35$ miles by rail south-east
                    of Piacenza and 32{ north-west of Modena, in a fertile tract of the Lombard
                    plain within view of the Alps, and sheltered by the Apennines. From south to
                    north it is traversed by the channel of the Parma, crossed here by three
                    bridges; and from east to west for a distance of 6700 feet runs the line of the
                    Aemilian Way, by which ancient Parma was connected on the one hand with Ariminum
                    (Rimini), and on the other with Placentia (Piacenza) and Mediolanum (Milan). The
                    old ramparts and bastions (excluding the circuit of the citadel in the
                    southeast) make an enceinte of about 4$ miles, but the enclosed area is not all
                    occupied by streets and houses; there is an extensive “royal garden” or public
                    park in the north-west angle, as well as a botanical garden and public
                    promenades in the neighbourhood of the citadel, and various open spaces in other
                    parts. In the centre of the city the Aemilian Way widens out into the Piazza
                    Grande, a large and picturesque-looking square which contains the Palazzo del
                    Comune and a modern statue of Correggio, whose masterpieces form the chief
                    artistic attraction of Parma. The cathedral of the Assumption (originally St
                    Herculanus), erected between 1064 and 1074, and consecrated in 1106 by Pope
                    Paschal II., is a Romano-Byzantine building in the form of a Latin cross, 230
                    feet long by 84 feet wide. The west front, 94 feet high and 90 feet broad, is
                    relieved by three rows of semicircular arches, and has a central porch (there
                    were at one time three) supported by huge red marble lions sculptured by Bono da
                    Bisone. The walls and ceiling of the interior are covered with frescos; those of
                    the octagonal cupola representing the Assumption of the Virgin are by Correggio,
                    but much restored (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Correggio,</hi> vol. vi. p. 437).
                    The crypt contains the shrine of Bishop San Bernardino degli Uberti and the tomb
                    of Bartolommeo Prato—the former by Prospero Clementi of Reggio. To the
                    south-west of the cathedral stands the baptistery, designed by Benedètto
                    Antelami; it was commenced in 1196 and completed in 1281. The whole structure,
                    which has a height of 98 feet and a diameter of 76 feet, is composed of red and
                    grey Verona marble. Externally it is an irregular octagon, each face consisting
                    of a lower story with a semicircular arch (in three cases occupied by a portal),
                    four tiers of small columns supporting as many continuous architraves, and
                    forming open galleries, and above these a row of five engaged columns supporting
                    a series of pointed arches and a cornice. Internally it is a polygon of sixteen
                    unequal sides, and the cupola is supported by sixteen ribs, springing from the
                    same number of columns. In the centre is an octagonal font bearing date 1298. To
                    the east of the cathedral, and at no great distance, stands the church of San
                    Giovanni Evangelista, which was founded along with the Benedictine monastery in
                    981, but as a building dates from the 16th century, and has a façade erected by
                    Simone Moschino early in the 17 th. The frescos on the cupola representing the
                    vision of St John are by Correggio, and the arabesques on the vault of the nave
                    by Anselmi. Madonna della Steccata (Our Lady of the Palisade), a fine church in
                    the form of a Greek cross, erected between 1521 and 1539 after Zaccagni’s
                    designs, contains the tombs and monuments of many of the Bourbon and Farnese
                    dukes of Parma, and preserves among a rich variety of paintings Parmigiano’s
                    Moses Breaking the Tables of the Law and Anselmi’s Coronation of the Virgin. The
                    ducal palace, usually called La Pilotta, is a vast and irregular group of
                    buildings dating mainly from the 16th and 17th centuries; it now comprises the
                    academy of fine arts (1752) and its valuable picture gallery (Correggio’s St
                    Jerome and Madonna della Scodella), the schools of painting, sculpture, and
                    engraving, the archaeological museum (Trajan’s <hi rend="italic">Tabula</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Alimentaria</hi> and ruins from Velleia), and the great royal
                    library (with De Rossi’s Oriental MSS. and Zani’s collection of engravings,
                    Luther’s Hebrew Psalter and Bodoni’s types and matrices). The Teatro Farnese, a
                    remarkable wooden structure erected in 1618-19 from Aleotti d’Argenta’s designs,
                    and capable of containing 4500 persons, has long been in a very ruined
                    condition; the new theatre, opened in 1829, cost &lt;£80,000, and is celebrated
                    as one of the best in Europe for the clear conveyance of sound. The royal
                    university of Parma, founded in 1601 by Ranuccio I., and reconstituted by Philip
                    of Bourbon in 1768, had 217 students in 1881-82. Among the benevolent
                    institutions, in which the city is particularly rich, are a monte di pietá
                    dating from 1488 and a hospital for incurables founded in 1332. Leather,
                    silk-stuff for sieves, linen, hemp, and cotton stuffs, glass, crystal, and
                    earthenware, wax candles, cast-iron wares, and pianofortes are all manufactured
                    in or near the city; a very considerable trade is carried on in grain, cattle,
                    and the dairy produce of the district. The “grana” cheese known as Parmesan is
                    not now so well made at Parma as in some other parts of Italy—Lodi, for example.
                    The population in 1861 was 47,067 for the city and 47,428 for the commune; the
                    removal of the military and civil functionaries of the old duchy caused a
                    considerable decrease, and the figures for 1881 were only 44,492 and 45,217.</p>
                <p>The old Gallic town of Parma, which became a Roman colonia civium for 2000
                    colonists in 183 B. c., and after it had been plundered by Mark Antony’s
                    soldiers was recruited by Augustus, continued to be a place of importance till
                    the later times of the empire. Under Theodoric its walls were rebuilt. The
                    Greeks of the 6th century called it Chrysopolis or City of Gold, and this name
                    appears in the mediaeval chronicles as Grisopolis. In 872 Carloman granted the
                    city to bishop Widiboldus with the title of count. During the 11 th, 12th, and
                    13th centuries Parma had its full share of the Guelf and Ghibelline struggles,
                    and also carried on repeated hostilities with Borgo San Donnino and Piacenza. As
                    a republic its government was mainly in the hands of the Rossi, Pallavicino,
                    Correggio, and Sanvitale families. The fruitless siege of Parma in 1248 was the
                    last effort of the unfortunate Frederick II. In 1303 the city became a lordship
                    for Giberto da Correggio, who laid the basis of its territorial power by
                    conquering Reggio, Brescello, and Guastalla, and was made commander-in chief of
                    the Guelfs by Robert of Apulia. The Correggio family never managed to keep
                    possession of it for long, and in 1346 they sold it to the Visconti, and from
                    them it passed to the Sforza. Becoming subject to Pope Julius II. in 1512, Parma
                    remained (in spite of the French occupation from 1515 to 1521) a papal
                    possession till 1545, when Paul III. (Alexander Farnese) invested his son
                    Pierluigi with the duchies of Parma and Piacenza. There were eight dukes of
                    Parma of the Farnese line—Pierluigi (died 1547), Ottavio (1586), Alessandro
                    (1592), Ranuccio I. (1622), Odoardo (1646), Ranuccio II. (1694), Francesco
                    (1727), Antonio (1731). See <hi rend="smallcaps">Farnese,</hi> vol. ix. p. 36.
                    Antonio and Francesco both having died childless, the duchy passed to Charles of
                    Bourbon (Don Carlos), infante of Spain, who, becoming king of Naples in 1735,
                    surrendered Parma and Piacenza to Austria, but retained the artistic treasures
                    of the Farnese dynasty which he had removed from Parma to Naples. Spain
                    reconquered the duchies in the war of succession (1745); they were recovered by
                    Austria in 1746; and Maria Theresa again surrendered them to Don Philip, infante
                    of Spain, in 1748. Ferdinand, Philip’s son, who succeeded under Dutillot’s
                    regency in 1765, saw his states occupied by the revolutionary forces of France
                    in 1796, and had to purchase his life-interest with 6,000,000 lire and 25 of the
                    best paintings in Parma. On his death in 1802 the duchies were incorporated with
                    the French republic and his son Louis became “king of Etruria.” Parma was thus
                    governed for several years by Moreau de Saint-Méry and by Junot. At the congress
                    of Vienna, Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla were assigned to Marie Louise
                    (daughter of Francis I. of Austria and Napoleon’s second consort), and on her
                    death they passed in 1847 to Charles II. (son of Louis of Etruria and Marie
                    Louise, daughter of Charles IV., king of Spain). The new duke, unwilling to
                    yield to the wishes of his people for greater political liberty, was soon
                    compelled to take flight, and the duchy was for a time ruled by a provisional
                    Government and by Charles Albert of Sardinia; but in April 1849 Baron d’Aspre,
                    with 15,000 Austrians, took possession of Parma, and the ducal government was
                    restored under Austrian protection. Charles II. (who had in 1820 married
                    Theresa, daughter of Victor Emmanuel of Sardinia) abdicated in favour of his son
                    Charles III., March 14, 1849. On the <pb break="no"

                    Marie Louise (daughter of Ferdinand, prince of Artois and duke of Berry), became
                    regent for her son Robert. In 1860 his possessions were formally incorporated
                    with the new kingdom of Italy.</p>
                <p>The duchy of Parma in 1849 had an area of 2376 square miles, divided into five
                    provinces—Borgo San Donnino, Valditaro, Parma, Lunigiana Parmense, and Piacenza.
                    Its population in 1851 was 497,343. Under Marie Louise (1815-47) the territory
                    of Guastalla (50 square miles) formed part of the duchy, but it was transferred
                    in 1847 to Modena in exchange for the communes of Bagnone, Filattiera, &amp;c.,
                    which went to constitute the Lunigiana Parmense.</p>
                <p>Parma has given birth to Sforza Pallavicino, Mazzola (Parmigiano) the painter,
                    Antelami the architect, and Toschi the engraver. Guicciardini, the historian,
                    was governor of the city under Leo X.</p>
