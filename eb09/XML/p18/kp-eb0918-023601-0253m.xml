                    Septuagint chose the Greek form to translate the “garden” of Genesis ii.; other
                    Greek and Latin versions followed them, and thus “paradise” became the usual
                    ecclesiastical name for the garden of Eden, which has been spoken of under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Eden.</hi> Now, as Paradise in this sense was the residence of
                    man before he sinned, it was natural enough that theological speculation as to
                    the dwelling-place of the righteous, after death, or in the future glory, should
                    attach itself to the account given in Genesis of the original habitation of
                    righteous Adam, and borrow not only the name but in some measure also the
                    conception of paradise as there described. This took place in more than one way,
                    as we see from the Jewish apocalyptic literature, and especially from the book
                    of Enoch. Thus we find (1) the idea that the old Paradise still exists in a
                    secret part of the earth, and that Enoch, Elijah, and other elect and righteous
                    persons dwell there. This is the foundation of the doctrine of the earthly
                    paradise, which passed into Christianity—being supposed to find confirmation in
                    the New Testament, especially in Luke xxiii. 43. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >earthly</hi> paradise, as developed by Christian fancy, is the old garden of
                    Eden, which lay in the far East beyond the stream of Ocean, raised so high on a
                    triple terrace of mountain that the deluge did not touch it. It is the residence
                    of certain departed saints, and the pictures drawn of it are coloured with
                    classical reminiscences of Elysium and the Islands of the Blest. How these
                    outlines were filled up at different periods may be learned from Ephraem Syrus’s
                    poem on Paradise (4th century), from Cosmas Indicopleustes (6th century), from
                    the <hi rend="italic">Divina</hi><hi rend="italic">Commedia</hi> of Dante, and
                    other mediaeval sources. A more ideal conception is (2) that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">heavenly</hi> paradise. To the Hebrews ideal things represent
                    themselves as the heavenly counterparts of earthly things; ideals which God’s
                    people are to realize in the future are already existent in heaven; or even
                    things which have once been lost, but which are necessary to man’s true
                    happiness, are preserved in heaven. Thus the heavenly paradise was either a mere
                    figure for the good things, corresponding to those which Adam lost, which are
                    reserved in heaven for the righteous, or it was the heavenly archetype of which
                    the earthly paradise was a copy, or on a crasser way of thinking it was held
                    that the paradise which Adam lost had been actually transported to heaven. The
                    commonest form of the idea was perhaps that expressed in 4 Ezra and the Talmud,
                    by saying that paradise was created before the earth. This paradise is not
                    conceived as the place of the souls of all the righteous after death, but it is
                    inhabited by certain select persons—Enoch, Elijah, Moses, Ezra—who enjoy in it
                    the fellowship of the coming Messiah. After the last judgment, when the enemies
                    of Israel are cast into Gehenna, the righteous are raised to paradise, and there
                    behold the glory of God. Associated with such views as these, we find farther
                    the idea (3) that in the future glory paradise, or the heavenly Jerusalem, which
                    stood in paradise before the fall and was removed to heaven with it (Apoc.
                    Baruch), will be brought down from heaven to earth, that the tree of life will
                    be planted on Zion (Bk. Enoch, 4 Ezra). All these apocalyptic crudities, which
                    it is not necessary to follow into details, are really mechanical developments
                    of a legitimate, one may even say an inevitable, inference from the position
                    that the garden of Gen. ii. represents a state of ideal human felicity lost
                    through sin. For, if this be so, the future bliss of the redeemed must be
                    conceived as somehow analogous to the life of Eden, and a literal unimaginative
                    conception of this analogy, making no allowance for the difference between the
                    happiness of childhood, prior to experience of the everyday world, and the
                    happiness of a life which has conquered the world, must end in regarding the
                    future home of the blest as a mere reproduction of Eden. But the use of the word
                    paradise for the home of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n254/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0254-0237"/> the blessed does not necessarily imply so
                    mechanical a conception as we find in the Jewish apocalypses; to speak of the
                    future bliss at all, without the use of metaphysics, is possible only in the
                    form of poetical description, and for such description the story of the garden
                    of Eden supplied the necessary concrete elements, which the apocalyptists took
                    literally, while higher thinkers used them as symbols— and ordinary language,
                    perhaps, as mere conventional equivalents—for ineffable things. Thus the images
                    borrowed from Eden in such a prophecy as Isa. xi. are certainly not meant
                    literally, any more than the figure of the tree of life in the book of Proverbs.
                    So in the New Testament even Rev. ii. 7 is plainly figurative, and in Luke
                    xxiii. 43 paradise is simply the place of bliss. In 2 Cor. xii. 4 paradise is a
                    heavenly place where ineffable words were heard by Paul; but he himself does not
                    know whether he visited it in the body or out of the body.</p>

                    is, Garden of Eden. It is described in the Koran and by later theologians as a
                    place of all sensuous delights, where the righteous recline on couches in a fair
                    garden drinking the delicious beverage supplied by the fountain Tasnim and
                    waited on by damsels with great bright eyes (“Ηύτ,” Kor. lv. 72, hence our
                    “houri,” which is properly a Persian form). The expression “gardens of Firdaus”
                    (the Persian form of the word Paradise) occurs in Kor. xviii. 107, and is
                    interpreted as meaning the highest region of the Janna (Beidawi <hi
