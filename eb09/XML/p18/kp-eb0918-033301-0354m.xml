                    Antoinette Bégon. The Pascal family were Auvergnats by extraction as well as
                    residence, and they had for many generations held posts in the civil service.
                    They were ennobled by Louis XI. in 1478, but, as in many other cases, no attempt

                    >de.</hi> The earliest anecdote of Pascal is a singular story recorded by his
                    niece, Marguerite Perier (the heroine of the Holy Thorn miracle), of his being
                    bewitched, and freed from the spell by the witch with strange ceremonies. His
                    mother died when he was ab®ut four years old (the exact date is differently
                    stated), and left him with two sisters—Gilberte, who afterwards married Μ.
                    Perier, and Jacqueline. Both sisters are of importance in their brother’s
                    history, and both are said to have been beautiful and accomplished. When Pascal
                    was about seven years old, his mother having been already dead for some time,
                    Étienne Pascal the father gave up his official post at Clermont, and betook

                    for his own indulgence in scientific society. It does not appear that Blaise,
                    who went to no school, but was taught by his father, was at all forced, but
                    rather the contrary. Nevertheless he has a distinguished place in the story of
                    precocious children, and in the much more limited chapter of children whose
                    precocity has been followed by great performance at maturity, though he never
                    became what is called a learned man, perhaps did not know Greek, and was pretty
                    certainly indebted for most of his miscellaneous reading to Montaigne. How,
                    purposely kept from books, he worked out the more elementary problems of
                    geometry for himself; how at sixteen he wrote a treatise on conic sections which
                    Descartes refused to believe in except as the work of a master and not of a
                    student; how he wrote treatises on acoustics at twelve, and began elaborate
                    calculating machines when he was still á boy,—are things dwelt upon in all
                    biographies of him. In this notice his attainments in mathematical and physical
                    science, except those which have some special connexion with his life and
                    history, will be dealt with separately and later.</p>
                <p>The Pascal family, some years after settling in Paris, had to go through a period
                    of adversity. Étienne Pascal, on leaving Clermont, had bought certain of the
                    Hôtel de Ville <hi rend="italic">rentes,</hi> almost the only regular investment
                    open to Frenchmen at the time. Richelieu reduced the interest and the investors
                    protested, Pascal amongst them. But the great cardinal did not understand such
                    protests, and to escape the Bastille Pascal had to go into hiding. He was,
                    according to the story, restored to favour owing to the good acting and graceful
                    appearance of his daughter Jacqueline in a representation of Scudéry’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Amour</hi><hi rend="italic">Tyrannique</hi> before Richelieu.
                    Indeed Jacqueline, who was only fourteen, herself gives the account in a
                    pleasant letter which is extant, and which contains an allusion to her brother’s
                    mathematical prowess. Madame d’Aiguillon’s intervention in the matter was
                    perhaps as powerful as Jacqueline’s acting, and Richelieu not only relieved
                    Étienne Pascal from the necessity of keeping out of the way, but gave him (in
                    1641) the important and lucrative though somewhat troublesome intendancy of
                    Rouen. The family accordingly removed to the Norman capital, though Gilberte
                    Pascal shortly after, on her marriage, returned to Clermont. At Rouen they
                    became acquainted with Corneille, and Blaise Pascal pursued his studies with
                    such vehemence that he already showed signs of an injured constitution. Nothing,
                    however, of importance happened till the year 1646. Then Pascal the elder was
                    confined to the house by the consequences of an accident on the ice, and was
                    visited by certain gentlemen of the neighbourhood who had come under the
                    influence of St Cyran and the Jansenists. It does not appear that up to this
                    time the Pascal family had been contemners of religion, but they now eagerly
                    embraced the creed, or at least the attitude of Jansenism. One of the more
                    immediate results of this conversion has rather shocked some modern admirers of
                    Pascal, who forget that toleration, except of the Gallio kind, is an idea which
                    had no place in men’s minds in Pascal’s day. He came into contact with a
                    Capuchin known as Père St Ange, but whose real name was Forton, and who seems to
                    have entertained some speculative ideas on theological points which were not
                    strictly orthodox. Thereupon Pascal with some of his friends lodged an
                    information against the heretic with the representative of the archbishop of
                    Rouen. There seems to have been no lack of zeal about the accusers, but the
                    accused made no difficulty whatever in making profession of orthodoxy, and the
                    judge appears to have been by no means anxious to push the matter home. No doubt
                    Pascal was perfectly sincere, and like most of his contemporaries held the
                    opinion attributed to a great English nonconformist contemporary of his, that,
                    while it was very shocking that men who were in the right should not be
                    tolerated, it was almost equally shocking that men who were in the wrong should
                    be.</p>
                <p>His bodily health was at this time very far from satisfactory, and he appears to
                    have suffered, not merely from acute dyspepsia, but from a kind of paralysis. He
                    was, however, except when physicians positively forbade study, and probably
                    sometimes when they did so forbid, indefatigable in his mathematical work. In
                    1647 he published his <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles Expériences sur le Vide,</hi>
                    and in the next year the famous experiment with the barometer on the Puy de Dome
                    was carried out for him by his brother-in-law Perier, and repeated on a smaller
                    scale by himself at Paris, to which place by the end of 1647 he and his sister
                    Jacqueline had removed, to be followed shortly by their father. In a letter of
                    Jacqueline’s dated the 27th of September, an account of a visit paid by
                    Descartes to Pascal is given, which, like the other information on the relations
                    of the two, gives strong suspicion of mutual jealousy. Descartes, however, gave
                    Pascal the very sensible advice to stay in bed as long as he could (it may be
                    remembered that the philosopher himself never got up till eleven) and to take
                    plenty of beef tea. But the relations of Pascal with Descartes belong chiefly to
                    the scientific achievements of the former. He had, however, other relations,
                    both domestic and miscellaneous, which had nothing to do with science. As early
                    as May 1648 Jacqueline Pascal was strongly drawn to Port Royal, and her brother
                    frequently accompanied her to its church. She desired indeed to join the
                    convent, but her father, who at the date above mentioned returned to Paris with
                    the dignity of counsellor of state (his functions at Rouen having ceased),
                    disapproved of the plan, and took both brother and sister to Clermont. Pascal
                    stayed in Auvergne for the greater part of two years, but next to nothing is
                    known of what he did there. Fléchier, in his account of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Grands Jours</hi> at Clermont many years after, speaks of a “belle savante” in
                    whose company Pascal had frequently been—a trivial mention on which, as on many
                    other trivial points of scantily known lives, the most childish structures of
                    comment and conjecture have been based. It is sufficient to say that at this
                    time, despite the Rouen “conversion,” there is no evidence to show that Pascal
                    was in any way a recluse, an ascetic, or in short anything but a young man of
                    great intellectual promise and performance who was not indifferent to society,
                    but whose aptitude both for society and study was affected by weak health and
                    the horse-doctoring of the time. He, his sister, and their father returned to
                    Paris in the late autumn of 1650, and in September of the next year Étienne
                    Pascal died. Almost immediately afterwards Jacqueline fulfilled her purpose of
                    joining Port Royal— a proceeding which led to some soreness, finally healed,
                    between herself and her brother and sister as to the disposal of her property.
                    Perhaps this difference, but more probably the mere habitual use of the
                    well-known dialect of Port Royal, led Jacqueline to employ in reference to her
                    brother expressions which have led biographers into most unnecessary excursions
                    of fancy. For these they have seemed to find further warrant in similar phrases
                    used by the Periers, mother and daughter. It has been supposed that Pascal, from
                    1651 or earlier to the famous accident of 1654, lived a dissipated, extravagant,
                    worldly, luxurious (though admittedly not vicious) life with his friend the Duc
                    de Roannez and others. His <hi rend="italic">Discours sur les</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Passions de ΓAmour,</hi> a striking and characteristic piece, only
                    recently discovered and printed, has also been assigned to this period, and has
                    been supposed to indicate a hope <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0356-0335"/> less passion for Charlotte de Roannez, the duke’s
                    sister. It cannot be too decidedly said that all this is sheer romancing. The
                    extant letters of Pascal to the lady show no trace of any affection (stronger
                    than friendship) between them. As to Pascal’s worldly life, it might be thought
                    that only the completest ignorance of the usual dialect of the stricter
                    religious sects and societies (and it may be added of Port Royal in particular)
                    could induce any one to lay much stress on that. A phrase of Jacqueline’s about
                    the “horribles attaches” which bound her brother to the world may pair off with
                    hundreds of similar expressions from Bunyan downwards. It is, however, certain
                    that in the autumn of 1654 Pascal’s second “conversion” took place, and that it
                    was lasting. He betook himself at first to Port Royal, and began to live a
                    recluse and austere life there. Madame Perier simply says that Jacqueline
                    persuaded him to abandon the world. Jacqueline represents the retirement as the
                    final result of a long course of dissatisfaction with mundane life. But there
                    are certain anecdotic embellishments of the act which are too famous to be
                    passed over, though they are in part apocryphal. It seems that Pascal in driving
                    to Neuilly was run away with by the horses, and would have been plunged in the
                    river but that the traces fortunately broke. To this, which seems authentic, is
                    usually added the late and more than doubtful tradition (due to the Abbé
                    Boileau) that afterwards he used at times to see an imaginary precipice by his
                    bedside or at the foot of the chair on which he was sitting. Further, from
                    November 23, 1654, dates the singular document usually known as “Pascal’s
                    amulet,” a parchment slip which he wore constantly about him, and which bears
                    the date followed by some lines of incoherent and strongly mystical
                    devotion.</p>
                <p>But, whatever may have been the immediate cause of Pascal’s conversion and (for a
                    time) domestication at Port Royal, it certainly had no evil effect on his
                    intellectual or literary powers. Indeed, if he had been drowned at Neuilly he
                    would hardly be thought of now as anything but an extraordinarily gifted man of
                    science. It must also be noted that, though he lived much at Port Royal, and
                    partly at least observed its rule, he never actually became one of its famous
                    solitaries. But for what it did for him (and for a time his health as well as
                    his peace of mind seems to have been improved) he very soon paid the most ample
                    and remarkable return that any man of letters ever paid to any institution. At
                    the end of 1655 Arnauld, the chief light of Port Royal, was condemned by the
                    Sorbonne for a letter which he had published expressing doubt whether the famous
                    five propositions were to be found in Jansen, and, as much was made of this
                    condemnation, it was thought important by the Jansenist and Port Royal party
                    that steps should be taken to disabuse the popular mind on the whole
                    controversy. Arnauld would have undertaken the task himself, but his wiser
                    friends knew that his style was anything but popular, and overruled him. It is
                    said that he personally suggested to Pascal to try his hand, and that the first
                    of the famous <hi rend="italic">Provincial Letters</hi> (this familiar name, or
                    rather misnomer, is an abbreviation from the proper title of <hi rend="italic"

                    probably, in a day. It was printed on the 23d January 1656, and, being immensely
                    popular and successful, was followed by others to the number of eighteen, in
                    which not merely the special points at issue but the whole ethical and doctrinal
                    system of the Jesuits was pulled to pieces.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Provinciales</hi> Pascal, who it must be remembered
                    published under a strict incognito, denies that he belongs to Port Royal, and in
                    fact, though during the last years of his life he was wholly devoted to its
                    interests, he was never a regular resident there, and usually abode in his own
                    house at Paris. Shortly after the appearance of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Provinciales,</hi> on May 24, 1656, occurred the miracle of the Holy Thorn, a
                    fragment of the crown of Christ preserved at Port Royal, which cured the little
                    Marguerite Perier of a fistula lacrymalis. The Jesuits were much mortified by
                    this Jansenist miracle, which, as it was officially recognized, they could not
                    openly deny. Pascal and his friends rejoiced in proportion. But the details of
                    his later years after this incident are somewhat scanty, and as recorded by his
                    sister and niece they tell of increasing ill health, and of ascetic practices
                    and beliefs increasing still more. One curious incident, contrasting equally
                    with this state of things and with Pascal’s studious character and renown, is
                    what Madame Perier calls “l’affaire des carrosses,” a scheme of the Duc de
                    Roannez and others for running omnibuses in Paris, which was actually carried
                    out, of which Pascal was in some sort manager, and from which he derived some
                    profit. This, however, is an exception. Otherwise, for years before his death,
                    we hear only of acts of charity and of, as it seems to modern ideas, extravagant
                    asceticism. Thus Madame Perier tells us that he disliked to see her caress her
                    children, and would not allow the beauty of any woman to be talked of in his
                    presence. What may be called his last illness began as early as 1658, after
                    which year he never seems to have enjoyed even tolerable health, and as the
                    disease progressed it was attended with more and more pain, chiefly in the head.
                    In June 1662, having given up his own house to a poor family who were suffering
                    from small-pox, and being unwilling that his sister should expose herself to
                    infection, he went to her house to be nursed, and never afterwards left it. His
                    state was, it seems, mistaken by his physicians, who to the last maintained that
                    there was little danger— so much so that the offices of the church were long put
                    off. He was able, however, to receive the eucharist, and soon afterwards died in
                    convulsions on August 19th. A <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> examination was
                    held, which showed not only grave derangement in the stomach and other organs,
                    but a serious lesion of the brain.</p>
                <p>Eight years after Pascal’s death appeared, in a small volume, the book which has
                    given most trouble to all students of Pascal, and most pleasure to some of them.
                    It purported to be Pascal’s <hi rend="italic">Pensées,</hi> and a preface by his
                    nephew Perier gave the world to understand that these were fragments of a great
                    projected apology for Christianity which the author had in conversation with his
                    friends planned out years before. The editing of the book was peculiar. It was
                    submitted to a committee of influential Jansenists, with the Duc de Roannez at
                    their head, and, in addition, it bore the imprimatur of numerous unofficial
                    approvers who testified to its orthodoxy. It does not appear that there was much
                    suspicion of the garbling which had been practised,—garbling not unusual at the
                    time, and excused in this case by the fact of a lull in the troubles of Port
                    Royal and a great desire on the part of its friends to do nothing to disturb
                    that lull. But as a matter of fact no more entirely fictitious book ever issued
                    from the press. The fragments which it professed to give were in themselves
                    confused and incoherent enough, nor is it easy to believe that they all formed
                    part of any such single and coherent design as that referred to above. But the
                    editors omitted, altered, added, separated, combined, and so forth entirely at
                    their pleasure, actually making some changes which seem to have been thought
                    improvements of style. As an instance of their anxiety to avoid offence, it may
                    be noticed that they rejected, apparently as too outspoken, Madame Perier’s
                    invaluable life of her brother, which was written to accompany the second
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Pensées,</hi> but did not actually appear with
                    them till 1684.</p>

                <p>This rifacimento remained the standard text with a few unimportant additions for
                    nearly two centuries, except that by a truly comic revolution of public taste
                    Condorcet in 1776 published, after study of the original, which remained
                    accessible in manuscript, another garbling, conducted this time in the interests
                    of unorthodoxy. It was not till 1842 that Victor Cousin drew attention to the
                    absolutely untrustworthy condition of the text, nor till 1844 that Μ. Faugère
                    edited that text from the MS. in something like a condition of purity, though,
                    as subsequent editions have shown, not with absolute fidelity. But even in its
                    spurious condition the book had been recognized as remarkable and almost unique.
                    Its contents, as was to be expected, are of a very chaotic character—of a
                    character so chaotic indeed that the reader is almost at the mercy of the
                    arrangement, perforce an arbitrary arrangement, of the editors. But the subjects
                    dealt with concern more or less all the great problems of thought on what may be
                    called the theological side of metaphysics :— the sufficiency of reason, the
                    trustworthiness of experience, the admissibility of revelation, free will,
                    foreknowledge, and the rest. The peculiarly disjointed and fragmentary condition
                    of the sentiments expressed by Pascal aggravates the appearance of universal
                    doubt which is present in the <hi rend="italic">Pensées,</hi> just as the
                    completely unfinished condition, from the literary point of view, of the work
                    constantly causes slighter or graver doubts as to the actual meaning whibh the
                    author wished to express. Accordingly the <hi rend="italic">Pensées</hi> have
                    always been a favourite exploring ground, not to say a favourite field of
                    battle, to persons who take an interest in the problems. Speaking generally,
                    their tendency is towards the combating of scepticism by a deeper scepticism,
                    or, as Pascal himself calls it, Pyrrhonism, which occasionally goes the length
                    of denying the possibility of any natural theology. Pascal explains all the
                    contradictions and difficulties of human life and thought by the doctrine of the
                    fall, and relies on faith and revelation alone to justify each other. Comparison
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Pensées</hi> with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Provinciales</hi> is, considering the radical differences of state (the one
                    being a finished work deliberately issued from the master’s hands, the other not
                    even a rough draught, scarcely even “heads” or “outlines,” but a collection of
                    loose and uncorrected notes settled neither as to the exact form of each nor as
                    to the relation of each to any whole), impossible. But it may be said that no
                    one can properly perceive how great a man of letters Pascal was from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pensées</hi> alone, and that no one can perceive how deep if not
                    wide a thinker he was from the <hi rend="italic">Provinciales</hi> alone. An
                    absolute preference of either argues a certain onesidedness in the relative
                    estimate of matter and form. The wiser mind distinctly prefers both, and
                    recognizes that if either were lacking the greatness of Pascal would fail to be
                    perceived, or at least to be perceived fully.</p>
                <p>Excluding his scientific attainments, which, as has been noted above, will be the
                    subject of separate notice, Pascal presents himself for comment in two different
                    lights, the second of which is, if the expression be permitted, a composite one.
                    The first exhibits him as a man of letters, the second as a philosopher, a
                    theologian, and a man. If this last combination seems to be audacious or clumsy,
                    it can only be said that in hardly any thinker are theological thoughts, and
                    thoughts more strictly to be called philosophical or metaphysical, so
                    intimately, so inextricably blended as in Pascal, and that in none is the colour
                    of the theology and the philosophy more distinctly personal. This latter fact
                    adds to the difficulty of the problem; for, though Pascal has written not a
                    little, and though a vast amount has been written about him, it cannot be said
                    that his character as a man, not a writer, is very distinct.</p>
                <p>The accounts of his sister and niece have the defect of all hagiology (to use the
                    term with no disrespectful intention); they are obviously written rather with a
                    view to the ideas and the wishes of the writers than with a view to the actual
                    and absolute personality of the subject. Except from these interesting but
                    somewhat tainted sources, we know little or nothing about him. Hence conjecture,
                    or at least inference, must always enter largely into any estimate of Pascal,
                    except a purely literary one.</p>
                <p>On that side, fortunately, there is no possibility of doubt or difficulty to any
                    competent inquirer. The <hi rend="italic">Provincial Letters</hi> are the first
                    example of French prose which is at once considerable in bulk, varied and
                    important in matter, perfectly finished in form. They owe not a little to
                    Descartes, for Pascal’s indebtedness to his predecessor is unquestionable from
                    the literary side, whatever may be the case with the scientific. But Descartes
                    had had neither the opportunity, nor the desire, nor probably the power, to
                    write anything of the literary importance of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Provinciales.</hi> The unanimity of eulogy as to the style of this wonderful
                    book has sometimes tempted foreigners, who feel or affect to feel an inability
                    to judge for themselves, into a kind of scepticism for which there is absolutely
                    no ground. The first example of polite controversial irony since Lucian, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Provinciales</hi> have continued to be the best example of it
                    during more than two centuries in which the style has been sedulously practised,
                    and in which they have furnished a model to generation after generation without
                    being surpassed by any of the works to which they have shown the way. The
                    unfailing freshness and charm of the contrast between the importance, the
                    gravity, in some cases the dry and abstruse nature, of their subjects and the
                    lightness sometimes almost approaching levity in its special sense of the manner
                    in which these subjects are attacked is a triumph of literary art of which no
                    familiarity dims the splendour, and which no lapse of time, affecting as that
                    lapse has already done to a great extent the attraction of the subjects
                    themselves, can ever impair. The tools of phrase and diction by which this
                    triumph is achieved were not in all cases of Pascal’s invention—Descartes and
                    Corneille had been beforehand with him to some extent—but many of them were
                    actually new, and all were newly and more skilfully applied. Nor perhaps is this
                    literary art really less evident in the <hi rend="italic">Pensées,</hi> though
                    it is less clearly displayed, owing to the fragmentary or rather chaotic
                    condition of the work, and partly also to the fact that the subject here for
                    many readers and in many places claims attention almost to the disregard of the
                    form. The vividness and distinction of Pascal’s phrase, his singular faculty of
                    inserting in the gravest and most impassioned meditation what may be almost
                    called quips of thought and diction without any loss of dignity, the intense
                    earnestness of meaning weighting but not confusing the style, all appear here,
                    and some of them appear as they have no chance of appearing in at least the
                    earlier <hi rend="italic">Provinciales.</hi></p>
                <p>No such positive statements as these are, however, possible as to the substance
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Pensées</hi> and the attitude of their author towards
                    “les grands sujets.” In the space and circumstances of the present notice
                    nothing more can be attempted than a summary of the opinions hitherto advanced
                    on the subject, and an indication of the results which may seem most probable to
                    unprejudiced inquirers who possess a fair knowledge of and interest in the
                    problems concerned. Hitherto the widest differences have been manifested in the
                    estimate of Pascal’s opinions on the main questions of philosophy, theology, and
                    human conduct. He has been represented as a determined apologist of intellectual
                    orthodoxy animated by an almost fanatical “hatred of reason,” and possessed with
                    a purpose <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n358/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0358-0337"/> to overthrow the appeal to reason; as a sceptic
                    and pessimist of a far deeper dye than Montaigne, anxious chiefly to show how
                    any positive decision on matters beyond the range of experience is impossible;
                    as a nervous believer clinging to conclusions which his clearer and better sense
                    showed to be indefensible; as an almost ferocious ascetic and paradoxer
                    affecting the <hi rend="italic">credo quia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >impossibile</hi> in intellectual matters and the <hi rend="italic">odi
                    quia</hi><hi rend="italic">amabile</hi> in matters moral and sensuous; as a
                    wanderer in the regions of doubt and belief, alternately bringing a vast though
                    vague power of thought and an unequalled power of expression to the expression
                    of ideas incompatible and irreconcilable. In these as in all other matters the
                    first requisite seems to be to clear the mind of prepossession and commonplace.
                    It has already been hinted that far too much stress may be laid on the
                    description of Pascal by his family as a converted sinner, and it may be added
                    that at least as much stress has been laid on the other side of the notion of
                    him as of a clear-headed materialist and expert in positive science, who by
                    ill-health, overwork, and family influence was persuaded to adopt, half against
                    his will, supernaturalist opinions. An unbiassed study of the scanty facts of
                    his history, and of the tolerably abundant but scattered and chaotic facts of
                    his literary production, ought to enable any one to steer clear of these
                    exaggerations, while admitting at the same time that it is impossible to give a
                    complete and final account of his attitude towards the riddles of this world and
                    others. He certainly was no mere advocate of orthodoxy; he as certainly was no
                    mere victim of terror at scepticism; least of all was he a freethinker in
                    disguise. He appears, as far as can be judged from the fragments of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Pensées,</hi> to have seized much more firmly and fully than has
                    been usual for two centuries at least the central idea of the difference between
                    reason and religion. Where the difficulty rises respecting him is that most
                    thinkers since his day who have seen this difference with equal clearness have
                    advanced from it to the negative side, while he advanced to the positive. In
                    other words, most men since his day who have not been contented with a mere
                    concordat, have let religion go and contented themselves with reason. Pascal,
                    equally discontented with the concordat, held fast to religion and continued to
                    fight out the questions of difference with reason. The emotion, amounting to
                    passion, which he displays in conducting this campaign, and the superfluous
                    energy of his debate on numerous points which, for instance, such a man as
                    Berkeley was content to leave in the vague must be traced to temperament,
                    aggravated no doubt by his extreme intellectual activity, by ill health, and by
                    his identification comparatively late in life and under peculiar circumstances
                    with a militant and so to speak sectarian form of religious or ecclesiastical
                    belief. Surveying these positions, we shall not be astonished to find much that
                    is surprising and some things that are contradictory in Pascal’s utterances on
                    “les grands sujets.” But the very worst method that can be taken for dealing
                    with these contradictions is to assume, as his critics on one side too often do,
                    that so clever a man as Pascal could not possibly be a convinced acceptor of
                    dogmatic Christianity, or to assume, as too many of his critics on the other do,
                    that so pious and orthodox a man as Pascal could not entertain any doubts or see
                    any difficulties in reference to dogmatic Christianity. He had taken to the
                    serious contemplation of theological problems comparatively late; for the Rouen
                    escapade noted above is· merely a specimen of the kind of youthful intolerance
                    which counts for nothing when justly viewed. The influence exercised on him by
                    Montaigne is the one fact regarding him which has not been and can hardly be
                    exaggerated, and his well-known <hi rend="italic">Entretien</hi> with Sacy on
                    the subject (the restoration of which to its proper form is one of the most
                    valuable results of recent criticism) leaves no doubt possible as to the source
                    of his “Pyrrhonian” method. The atmosphere of somewhat heated devotion in which
                    he found himself when he retired to Port Royal must naturally count for
                    something in the direction and expression of his thoughts; his broken health for
                    something more. It is unfortunately usual with societies like Port Royal to
                    generate a kind of mist and mirage which deceives and distorts even the keenest
                    sight that looks through their eyes. But it is impossible for any one who takes
                    Pascal’s <hi rend="italic">Pensées</hi> simply as he finds them in connexion
                    with the facts of Pascal’s history to question his theological orthodoxy,
                    understanding by theological orthodoxy the acceptance of revelation and dogma;
                    it is equally impossible for any one in the same condition to declare him
                    absolutely content with dogma and revelation. Excursions into the field beyond
                    formularies were necessary to him, and he made them freely; but there is no
                    evidence that these excursions tempted him to remain outside, and it appears
                    particularly erroneous to take his celebrated “wager” thoughts (the argument
                    that, as another world and its liabilities, if accepted, imply no loss and much
                    possible gain, they should be accepted) as an evidence of weakened belief or a
                    descent from rational religion. It is of the essence of an active mind like
                    Pascal’s to explore and state all the arguments of whatever degree of goodness
                    which make for or make against the conclusion it is investigating, and this
                    certainly is neither the least obvious nor the weakest of the arguments which
                    must have presented themselves to him.</p>
                <p>In ecclesiastical questions as distinguished from theological Pascal appears to
                    have been an ardent Jansenist, adopting without very much discrimination the
                    standpoint of his friends and religious directors Sacy, Arnauld, Singlin, and
                    others. In one point he went beyond them, boldly disputing the infallibility of
                    the pope, and hinting not obscurely at the propriety of agitation against
                    erroneous papal decisions. The Jansenists as a body could not muster courage to
                    adopt this attitude. But it is not easy to discuss isolated points of this kind
                    here; indeed their discussion belongs more properly to the general subject of
                    Jansenism, and the history of Port Royal.</p>
                <p>To sum up, the interest and value of the <hi rend="italic">Pensées</hi> is
                    positively diminished if they are taken as gropin⅛s after self-satisfaction or
                    feeble attempts at freethinking. They are excursions into the great unknown made
                    with a full acknowledgment of the greatness of that unknown, but with no kind of
                    desire for something more known than the writer’s own standpoint. If to any one
                    else they communicate such a desire that is not Pascal’s fault; and, if it seems
                    to any one that without such a desire they could not have been indulged in, that
                    comes mainly from an alteration of mental attitude, and from a want of
                    familiarity with the mental attitude of Pascal’s own time. From the point of
                    view that belief and knowledge, based on experience or reasoning, are separate
                    domains with an unexplored sea between and round them, Pascal is perfectly
                    comprehensible, and he need not be taken as a deserter from one region to the
                    other. To those who hold that all intellectual exercise outside the sphere of
                    religion is impious, or that all intellectual exercise inside that sphere is
                    futile, he must remain an enigma.</p>
                <p>There are few writers who are more in need than Pascal of being fully and
                    competently edited. The chief nominally complete edition at present in existence

                    much to be preferred to any other, for the text is undisputed and the book
                    itself contains almost all the exegesis of its own contents necessary), Pascal
                    can be read only at a disadvantage. There are four chief editions of the true
                    <hi rend="italic">Pensées</hi>: that of Μ. Faugère (1844), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >editio princeps</hi>; that of Μ. Havet (1852, 1867, and 1881), on the whole the
                    best; that of Μ. Victor Rochet (1873), good, but arranged and edited with the
                    deliberate intention of making Pascal fn <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> st of
                    all an orthodox apologist; and that of Μ. Molinιer (1877-79), a carefully edited
                    and interesting text, the important corrections of which have been introduced
                    into Μ. Havet’s last edition. Unfortunately, none of these can be said to be
                    exclusively satisfactory. The minor works must chiefly be sought in Bossut or
                    reprints of him. Works on Pascal are innumerable: Sainte-Beuve’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Port Royal,</hi> Cousin's writings on Pascal and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Jacqueline Pascal,</hi> and the essays of the editors of the <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Pascal as Natural Philosopher and Mathematician.—</hi> Great as
                    is Pascal’s reputation as a philosopher and man of letters, it may be fairly
                    questioned whether his claim to be remembered by posterity as a mathematician
                    and physicist is not even greater. In his two former capacities all will admire
                    the forπi of his work, while some will question the value of his results; but in
                    his two latter capacities no one will dispute either. He was a great
                    mathematician in an age which produced Descartes, Fermat, Huygens, Wallis, and
                    Roberval. There are wonderful stories on record of his precocity in mathematical
                    learning, which is sufficiently established by the well-attested fact that he
                    had completed before he was sixteen years of age a work on the conic sections,
                    in which he had laid down a series of propositions, discovered by himself, of
                    such importance that they may be said to form the foundations of the modern
                    treatment of that subject. ’ Owing partly to the youth of the author, partly to
                    the difficulty in publishing scientific works in those days, and partly no doubt
                    to the continual struggle on his part to devote his mind to what appeared to his
                    conscience more important labour, this work (like many others by the same
                    master-hand) was never published. We know something of what it contained from a
                    report by Leibnitz, who had seen it in Paris, and from a résumé of its results
                    published in 1640 by Pascal himself, under the title <hi rend="italic">Essai
                    pour les Coniques.</hi> The method which he followed was that introduced by his
                    contemporary Desargues, viz., the transformation of geometrical figures by
                    conical or optical projection. In this way he established the famous theorem
                    that the intersections of the three pairs of opposite sides of a hexagon
                    inscribed in a conic are collinear. This proposition, which he called the mystie
                    hexagram, he made the keystone of his theory; from it alone he deduced more than
                    four hundred corollaries, embracing, according to his own account, the conics of
                    Apollonius, and other results innumerable.</p>
                <p>Pascal also distinguished himself by his skill in the infinitesimal calculus,
                    then in the embryonic form of Cavalieri’s method of indivisibles. The cycloid
                    was a famous curve in those days; it had been discussed by Galileo, Descartes,
                    Fermat, Roberval, and Torricelli, who had in turn exhausted their skill upon it.
                    Pascal solved the hitherto refractory problem of the general quadrature of the
                    cycloid, and proposed and solved a variety of others relating to the centre of
                    gravity of the curve and its segments, and to the volume and centre of gravity
                    of solids of revolution generated in various ways by means of it. He published a
                    number of these theorems without demonstration as a challenge to contemporary
                    mathematicians. Solutions were furnished by Wallis, Huygens, Wren, and others;
                    and Pascal published his own in the form of letters from Amos Dettonville (his
                    assumed name as challenger) to Μ. Cercavi. There has been some discussion as to
                    the fairness of the treatment accorded by Pascal to his rivals, but no question
                    of the fact that his initiative led to a great extension of our knowledge of the
                    properties of the cycloid, and indirectly hastened the progress of the
                    differential calculus.</p>
                <p>In yet another branch of pure mathematics Pascal ranks as a founder. The
                    mathematical theory of probability and the allied theory of the combinatorial
                    analysis were in effect created by the correspondence between Pascal and Fermat,
                    concerning certain questions as to the division of stakes in games of chance,
                    which had been propounded to the former by the gaming philosopher De Méré. A
                    complete account of this interesting correspondence would surpass our present
                    limits; but the reader may be referred to Todhunter’s <hi rend="italic">History
                    of the Theory of Probability</hi> (Cambridge and London, 1865) pp. 7-21. It
                    appears that Pascal contemplated publishing a treatise <hi rend="italic">De
                    Aleae</hi><hi rend="italic">Geometria;</hi> but all that actually appeared was a
                    fragment on the arithmetical triangle (“Properties of the Figurate Numbers”)
                    printed in 1654, but not published till 1665, after his death.</p>
                <p>Pascal’s work as a natural philosopher was not less remarkable than his
                    discoveries in pure mathematics. His experiments and his treatise (written 1653,
                    published 1662) on the equilibrium of fluids entitle him to rank with Galileo
                    and Stevinus as one of the founders of the science of hydrodynamics. The idea of
                    the pressure of the air and the invention of the instrument for measuring it
                    were both new when he made his famous experiment, showing that the height of the
                    mercury column in a barometer decreases when it is carried upwards through the
                    atmosphere. This experiment was made in the first place by himself in a tower at
                    Paris, and was afterwards carried out on a grand scale under his instructions by
                    his brother-in-law Perier on the Puy de Dôme in Auvergne. Its success greatly
                    helped to break down the old prejudices, and to bring home to the minds of
                    ordinary men the truth of the new ideas propounded by Galileo and
                    Torricelli.</p>
                <p>Whether we look at his pure mathematical or at his physical researches we receive
                    the same impression of Pascal; we see the strongest marks of a great original
                    genius creating new ideas, and seizing upon, mastering, and pursuing farther
                    everything that was fresh and unfamiliar in his time. After the lapse of more
                    than two hundred years, we can stil point to much in exact science that is
                    absolutely his; and we can indicate infinitely more which is due to his
                    inspiration. <hi rend="smallcaps">(g. ch.)</hi></p>
