                    has <hi rend="italic">palesy,</hi> and another old form of the word is <hi
                    rend="italic">parlesy.</hi></p></note> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Palsy,</hi> the
                    loss of the power of muscular action due to some interruption to the nervous
                    mechanism by means of which such action is excited (see “Nervous System” in <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Physiology).</hi> In its strict sense the term might include
                    the loss of the influence of the nervous system or any of the bodily functions,
                    the loss of common sensation or of any of the special senses; but other terms
                    have come to be associated with these latter conditions, and the word
                    “paralysis” in medical nomenclature is usually restricted to the loss or
                    impairment of voluntary muscular power. Paralysis is to be regarded rather as a
                    symptom than a disease <hi rend="italic">per se,</hi> and is generally connected
                    with some well-marked lesion of some portion of the nervous system. According to
                    the locality and extent of the nervous system affected, so will be the form and
                    character of the paralysis. It is usual to regard paralysis as depending on
                    disease either of the brain, of the spinal cord, or of the nerves distributed to
                    parts and organs; and hence the terms cerebral, spinal, and peripheral paralysis
                    respectively. The distribution of the paralytic condition may be very extensive,
                    tending to involve in greater or less measure all the functions of the body, as
                    in the general paralysis of the insane (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Insanity)</hi>;
                    or again, one half of the body may be affected, or one or more extremities, or
                    it may be only a certain group of muscles in a part supplied by a particular
                    nerve. Reference can be made here only to the more common varieties of
                    paralysis, and that merely in general terms.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Paralysis due to Brain Disease.—</hi> Of this by far the
                    most common form is palsy affecting one side of the body, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hemiplegia.</hi> It usually arises from disease of the hemisphere of the brain
                    opposite to the side of the body affected, such disease being in the form of
                    haemorrhage into the brain substance, or the occlusion of blood-vessels, and
                    consequent arrest of the blood supply to an area of the brain; or again it may
                    be due to the effect of an injury, or to a tumour or morbid growth in the
                    tissues of the brain. The character of the seizure and the amount of paralysis
                    vary according to the situation of the disease or injury, its extent, and its
                    sudden or gradual occurrence. The attack may come on as a fit of apoplexy, in
                    which the patient becomes suddenly unconscious, and loses completely the power
                    of motion of one side of the body; or a like result may arise more gradually and
                    without loss of consciousness. In either case of “complete” hemiplegia the
                    paralysis affects more or less the muscles of the tongue, face, trunk, and
                    extremities. Speech is thick and indistinct, and the tongue, when protruded,
                    points towards the paralysed side owing to the unopposed action of its muscles
                    on the unaffected side. The muscles of the face implicated are chiefly those of
                    mastication. The paralysed side hangs loose, and the corner of the mouth is
                    depressed, but the muscles closing the eye are as a rule unimpaired, so that the
                    eye can be shut, unlike what occurs in another form of facial paralysis (Bell’s
                    palsy). The muscles of respiration on the affected side, although weakened, are
                    seldom wholly paralysed, but those of the arm and leg are completely powerless.
                    Sensation may at the first be impaired, but as a rule returns soon, unless the
                    portion of the brain affected be that which is connected with this function.
                    Rigidity of the paralysed members is occasionally present as an early or a late
                    symptom. In many cases of even complete hemiplegia improvement takes place after
                    the lapse of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n273/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0273-0256"/> weeks or months, and is in general first
                    indicated by a return of motor power in the leg, that of the arm following at a
                    longer or shorter interval. Such recovery of movement is, however, in a large
                    proportion of cases only partial, and the side remains weakened. In such
                    instances the gait of the patient is characteristic. In walking he leans to the
                    sound side and swings round the affected limb from the hip, the foot scraping
                    the ground as it is raised and advanced. Besides this the evidence of the
                    “shock” is felt more or less upon the system generally, the patient rarely
                    (though occasionally) recovering his nervous stability. The paralysed parts
                    retain as a rule their electric contractility, but they are apt to suffer in
                    their nutrition both from disuse and also from certain degenerative changes
                    which the interruption of nervous influence is apt to exercise upon them.</p>
                <p>It is to be observed that in many instances the hemiplegia is only partial, and
                    instead of the symptoms of complete paralysis above described there exist in
                    varied combination only certain of them, their association depending on the
                    extent and locality of the lesion in the brain. Thus there may be impairment of
                    speech and some amount of facial paralysis, while the arm and leg may be
                    unaffected, or the paralysis may be present in one or both extremities of one
                    side while the other symptoms are absent. Further, the paralysis may be
                    incomplete throughout, and the whole of the side be weak, but not entirely
                    deprived of motor power. To partial paralysis of this latter description the
                    term “paresis” is applied.</p>
                <p>Besides hemiplegia, various other forms of paralysis may arise from cerebral
                    disease. Thus occasionally the paralysis is crossed, one side of the face and
                    the opposite side of the body being affected simultaneously. Or again, as is
                    frequently observed in the case of tumours of the brain, the paralysis may be
                    limited to the distribution of one of the cranial nerves, and may produce an
                    association of phenomena (such as squinting, drooping of the eyelid, and
                    impairment or loss of vision) which may enable the seat of the disease to be
                    accurately localized.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Paralysis due to Disease of the Spinal Cord.—</hi> Of
                    paralysis from this cause there are numerous varieties depending on the nature,
                    the site, and the extent of the disease. Some of the more important only can be
                    noticed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Paraplegia,</hi> paralysis of both lower extremities, including
                    usually the lower portion of the trunk, and occasionally also the upper
                    portion—indeed the whole parts below the seat of the disease in the spinal
                    cord—is a form of paralysis which is a not unfrequent result of injuries or
                    disease of the vertebral column; also of inflammation affecting the spinal cord
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(Myelitis,</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> y</hi><hi rend="italic">),</hi> as well as of haemorrhage or
                    morbid growths involving its substance. When due to disease, the lesion is
                    generally situated in the lower portion of the cord. The phenomena necessarily
                    vary in relation to the locality and the extent of the disease in the cord.
                    Thus, if in the affected area the posterior part of the cord, including the
                    posterior nerve roots, suffer, the function of sensation in the parts below is
                    impaired because the cord is unable to transmit the sensory impressions--from
                    the surface of the body to the brain. If on the other hand the anterior portion
                    of the cord and anterior nerves be affected, the motor impulses from the brain
                    cannot be conveyed to the muscles below the seat of the injury or disease, and
                    consequently their power of movement is abolished. In many forms of this
                    complaint, particularly in the case of injuries, the whole thickness of the cord
                    is involved, and both sensory and motor functions are arrested. Further, the
                    functions of the bladder and bowels are apt to suffer, and either spasm or
                    paralysis of these organs is the result. The nutrition of the paralysed parts
                    tends to become affected, and bed-sores and wasting of the muscles are common.
                    Occasionally, more especially in cases of injury, recovery takes place, but in
                    general this is incomplete, the power of walking being more or less impaired. On
                    the other hand the patient may linger on for years bedridden, and at last
                    succumb to exhaustion or to some intercurrent disease.</p>
                <p>A form of spinal paralysis, often showing itself as paraplegia, occasionally
                    occurs in children, and is termed—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Infantile or Essential Paralysis.—</hi> It is caused by an
                    inflammatory affection limited to the anterior portion of the grey matter of the
                    spinal cord throughout a greater or less extent, and affects therefore the
                    function of motion, leaving that of sensation unimpaired. This disease is most
                    common during the period of first dentition (although a similar affection is
                    sometimes observed in adults). The commencement may be insidious, or there may
                    be an acute febrile attack lasting for several days. In either case paralysis
                    comes on, at first very extensive, involving both upper and lower extremities,
                    but tending soon to become more limited and confined to one or other limb or
                    even to a group of muscles. The affected muscles lose their electric
                    contractility and are apt to waste. Hence limbs become shortened, shrivelled,
                    and useless, and deformities such as club foot may thus be readily produced. In
                    many instances fortunately recovery is complete, and the prospect of amendment
                    is all the greater if the muscles show any reaction to electricity. There is
                    throughout an absence of some of the more distressing of the phenomena of
                    paraplegia, such as disturbances of the bladder and bowels or extensive
                    bed-sores, and in general the health of the child does not materially
                    suffer.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Progressive Muscular Atrophy</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Wasting
                    Palsy</hi> is a disease usually occurring in early or middle' life. It is
                    characterized by the wasting of certain muscles or groups of muscles accompanied
                    with a corresponding weakness or paralysis of the affected parts, and is
                    believed to depend on a slow inflammatory change in the anterior cornua of the
                    grey matter of the spinal cord. It is insidious in its onset, and usually first
                    shows itself in the prominent muscular masses in the palm of the hand,
                    especially the ball of the thumb, which becomes wasted and deficient in power.
                    The other palmar muscles suffer in like manner, and as the disease advances the
                    muscles of the arm, shoulders, and trunk become implicated if they have not
                    themselves been the first to be attacked. The malady tends to spread
                    symmetrically, involving the corresponding parts of the opposite side of the
                    body in succession. It is slow in its progress, but, notwithstanding it may
                    occasionally undergo arrest, it tends to advance and involve more and more of
                    the muscles of the body until the sufferer is reduced to a condition of extreme
                    helplessness. Should some other ailment not be the cause of death, the fatal
                    result may be due to the disease extending so as to involve the muscles of
                    respiration.</p>
                <p>Another form of paralysis in certain respects resembling the last, and supposed
                    by some to be due to a similar cause, is <hi rend="italic">Pseudo hypertrophic
                    Paralysis,</hi> a condition occurring most frequently in male children, in whom
                    in such cases there exists at first a remarkable enlargement of certain muscles
                    or groups of muscles, followed sooner or later by wasting and paralysis. The
                    enlarged muscles are chiefly those of the calf and hips, and their abnormal size
                    is caused by an over-development of their connective tissue, and is therefore
                    not a true hypertrophy. The child acquires a peculiar attitude and gait. He
                    stands with his legs widely separated, his body arched forward, and in walking
                    assumes a rocking or waddling movement. Later on the enlarged muscles lose their
                    bulk, and at the same time become weakened in power, so that walking becomes
                    impossible, and the child is completely paralysed in the <pb break="no"

                    instances death takes place from some intercurrent disease before maturity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Paralysis</hi><hi rend="italic">Agitans</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Trembling Palsy</hi> is a peculiar form of paralysis characterized
                    chiefly by trembling movements in certain parts, tending to become more widely
                    diffused throughout the body. It is a disease of advanced life. The symptoms
                    come on somewhat insidiously, and first show themselves chiefly by involuntary
                    tremblings of the muscles of the fingers, hand, arm, or leg, which are
                    aggravated on making efforts or under excitement. These trembling movements
                    become more marked and more extensive with the advance of the disease, and along
                    with the tremors there generally occurs increasing weakness of the affected
                    muscles. This is very manifest in walking, the act being performed in a peculiar
                    tottering manner with the body bent forward. The trembling movements cease
                    during sleep. This disease is a chronic one, and is intractable to treatment,
                    but life may be prolonged for many years.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Glosso·labio·laryngeal Paralysis</hi> is a form of paralysis
                    affecting, as its name indicates, the functions of the tongue, lips, and larynx
                    (besides others), and depending upon disease of certain localities in the
                    medulla oblongata from which the nerves presiding over these functions arise.
                    The symptoms come on slowly, and are generally first manifested in some
                    difficulty of speech owing to impaired movements of the tongue. Associated with
                    this there is more or less difficulty in swallowing, owing to paralysis of the
                    muscles of the pharynx and soft palate, by which also the voice is rendered
                    nasal. With the advance of the disease the paralysis of the tongue becomes more
                    marked. It cannot be protruded, and frequently undergoes atrophy. Certain of the
                    facial muscles become implicated, especially those in the neighbourhood of the
                    mouth. The features become expressionless, the lips cannot be moved in speaking,
                    the mouth remains open, and the saliva flows abundantly. The muscles of the
                    larynx may also be involved in the paralysis. In the later stages of the malady
                    the power of speech is completely lost, the difficulty in swallowing increases
                    to a degree that threatens suffocation, the patient’s condition altogether is
                    one of great misery, which is in no way mitigated by the fact of his mental
                    power remaining unaffected. Complications connected with the respiratory or
                    circulatory functions, or disease affecting other parts of the nervous system
                    with which this complaint may be associated, often terminate the patient’s
                    sufferings, and in any case life is seldom prolonged beyond two or three
                    years.</p>

                    nerves, is of not unfrequent occurrence. The most common and important examples
                    of this condition can only be briefly referred to.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Facial Paralysis, BelΓs Palsy,</hi> are the terms applied to
                    paralysis involving the muscles of expression supplied by the seventh nerve. It
                    is unilateral, and generally occurs as the result of exposure of one side of the
                    head to a draught of cold air which sets up inflammation of the nerve as it
                    passes through the aqueductus Fallopii, but it may also be due to injury or
                    disease either affecting the nerve near the surface or deeper in the bony canals
                    through which it passes, or in the brain itself involving the nerve at its
                    origin. Here the paralysis is manifested by a marked change in the expression of
                    the face, the patient being unable to move the muscles of one side in such acts
                    as laughing, whistling, &lt;tc., or to close the eye on that side. The mouth is
                    drawn to the sound side, while, although the muscles of mastication are not
                    involved, the food in eating tends to lodge between the jaw and cheek on the
                    palsied side. Occasionally the sense of taste is impaired. In the ordinary cases
                    of this disease, such as those due to exposure, recovery usually takes place in
                    from two to six weeks, the improvement being first shown in the power of closing
                    the eye, which is soon followed by the disappearance of the other morbid
                    phenomena. When the paralysis proceeds from disease of the temporal bone, or
                    from tumours or growths in the brain, it is more apt to be permanent, and is in
                    many cases of serious import. Throughout there is no diminution of sensibility
                    in the paralysed muscles; but they early lose their reaction to faradization,
                    retaining that to galvanism.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lead Palsy</hi> is a not uncommon form of local paralysis. It
                    is due to the poisonous action of lead upon the system, and, like the other
                    phenomena of lead poisoning, affects chiefly workers in that metal (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Lead).</hi> The pathology of this disease is still unsettled,
                    but it is believed to depend upon the local effect of the lead upon the nerves
                    of the part rather than to any disease, at least in the first instance, of the
                    nerve centres. The paralysis in this case is as a rule confined to the muscles
                    of the forearm which extend the hand, and as they lose entirely their power the
                    hand cannot be raised when the arm is held out, which gives rise to the
                    condition termed “wrist drop.” The paralysis may come to affect other muscles of
                    the arms as well as certain of those of the legs and trunk, and along with the
                    paralysis there occurs wasting of the affected muscles and loss of their
                    electrical reactions. Occasionally in severe cases other nervous phenomena, such
                    as convulsions, delirium, &lt;fcc., may become superadded. The symptoms usually
                    disappear on the removal of the patient from the source of lead contamination,
                    along with the application of the treatment appropriate to poisoning with this
                    metal,—and all the more speedily if the case has not been of long duration and
                    the affected muscles have not undergone atrophic change.</p>
                <p>A form of peripheral paralysis not unlike the last occasionally results from
                    chronic alcoholism. The paralysis occurring after diphtheria, another example of
                    the peripheral variety, has been already referred to (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Diphtheria).</hi><hi rend="italic">Treatment.—</hi> It is impossible in a
                    general notice like the present to refer at any length to the treatment of
                    paralysis. The conditions of the disease in any particular case and its
                    associations are so manifold that they can only be fully understood and
                    appreciated by the medical expert under whose direction alone treatment can be
                    advantageously carried out. It may be stated generally, however, that, since
                    paralysed muscles tend to undergo certain degenerative changes (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pathology),</hi> it becomes an object in treatment to endeavour
                    to maintain as long as possible their molecular integrity. With this view, when
                    pain and other acute symptoms which may be present have ceased, the use of
                    nervine tonics such as iron, quinine, and strychnine, and the suitable dieting
                    of the patient, are the best constitutional remedies; while of local
                    applications frictions or massage, but more particularly the employment of
                    electricity, will be found of service, the latter agent often yielding markedly
                    beneficial results. (j. o. <hi rend="smallcaps">a.)</hi></p>
