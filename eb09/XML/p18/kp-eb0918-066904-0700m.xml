                    included areas of territory of varying extent. The empire of the Yncas and the
                    Spanish viceroyalty were not conterminous with the modern republic nor with each
                    other. In the present article the sections relating to physical geography and
                    the moral and material condition of the people will be confined to the limits of
                    the republic, while in the historical section there will necessarily be
                    references to events which took place beyond the existing limits of the
                    country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Extent.—</hi> The republic of Peru is situated between the

                    it includes regions with every variety of climate. It lies between the parallels
                    of 3° 2Γ S. and 19° 10' S. and between 68° and 81° 20' 45" W. long., and has an

                    -while the width ranges from 300 to 400 miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Boundaries.—</hi> The republic is bounded on the W. by the
                    Pacific Ocean, on the E. by Brazil and Bolivia, on the N. by Ecuador, and on the
                    S. by Chili. The northern boundary commences at the village of Santa Rosa, near
                    the southern shore of the Gulf of Guayaquil, whence it passes southwards to the
                    river Macara, a tributary of the Chira, which falls into the Pacific. It takes
                    the course of the Macara, up the ravine of Espindula, to its source in the
                    cordillera of Ayavaca; in the Amazonian basin it follows the river Cauches to
                    its junction with the Chinchipe, and the Chinchipe to the Marañon. The Maraπon
                    then forms the boundary until the first Brazilian town is reached at Tabatinga.
                    The frontier with Brazil was determined by article ii. of the treaty of San
                    Ildefonso in 1777. A treaty dated 23d October 1851 further settled the boundary,
                    which was fixed by the commissioners who explored the Yavari in 1866 and 1871.
                    It first follows the course of the Yavari from the point where it falls into the
                    Amazon, in 4° 13' 21" S., up to a point near its source in 7° Γ 17" S.; from
                    this it forms a straight line to a point in 6° 52' 15" S. on the left bank of
                    the Madeira, being half the distance between the mouth of the Mamoré and that of
                    the Madeira. This is the point where the frontiers of Peru, Brazil, and Bolivia
                    meet. The Peru-Bolivian frontier, within the basin of the Amazon, has not been
                    accurately defined. It follows the Madeira to the mouth of the Mamoré, then the
                    Beni and its tributary the Madidi to the junction of the latter with a stream
                    called the Pablo-bamba, ascending the ravine of the Pablo-bamba to the source of
                    that stream in the eastern Andes. The line then crosses the Andes in a straight
                    line southwards to the village of Conima on the shore of Lake Titicaca. Thence
                    it passes across the lake in another straight line to the isthmus of Yunguyo,
                    and thence to the mouth of the Desaguadero. From the Desaguadero the
                    frontier-takes a south-south-west direction to the source of the river Mauri,
                    and then, until the recent war with Chili, it ran south along the watershed of
                    the Maritime Cordillera to the source of the river Loa, which falls into the
                    Pacific. The southern boundary separating the Peruvian province of Tarapaca from
                    the Bolivian province of Atacama was formed by the ravine of Duende, south of
                    the Loa, to the coast of the Pacific in 22° 23' S. near Tocapilla. This part of
                    the frontier was carefully delineated in 1628, and the boundary marks are
                    recorded in a document which is still extant. But the Chilians conquered and in
                    1884 annexed the Peruvian province of Tarapaca.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Geography.—</hi> Peru is divided longitudinally into
                    three well-defined regions, the coast, the sierra, and the montaña. The coast,
                    extending from the base of the Maritime Cordillera to the Pacific Ocean,
                    consists of a sandy desert crossed at intervals by rivers, along the banks of
                    which there are fertile valleys. The sierra is the region of the Andes, and is
                    about 250 miles in width. It contains stupendous chains of mountains, elevated
                    plains and table-lands, warm and fertile valleys, and ravines. The montaña is
                    the region of tropical forests within the valley of the Amazon, and skirts the
                    eastern slopes of the Andes.</p>
                <p>The coast has been upraised from the ocean at no very distant geological epoch,
                    and is still nearly as destitute of vegetation as the African Sahara. It is,
                    however, watered by fifty streams which cross the desert at intervals. Half of
                    these have their origin in the summits of the Andes, and run with a permanent
                    supply of water into the ocean. The others, rising in the outer range, which
                    does not reach the snow-line and receives less moisture, carry a volume of water
                    to the sea during the rainy season, but for the rest of the year are nearly dry.
                    The absence of rain here is caused by the action of the lofty uplands of the
                    Andes on the trade-wind. The south-east trade-wind blows obliquely across the
                    Atlantic Ocean until it reaches Brazil. By this time it is heavily laden with
                    vapour, which it continues to bear along across the continent, depositing it and
                    supplying the sources of the Amazons and La Plata. Finally, the trade-wind
                    arrives at the snow-capped Andes, and here the last particle of moisture is
                    wrung from it that the very low temperature can extract. Coming to the summit of
                    that range, it rushes down as a cool and dry wind on the Pacific slopes beyond.
                    Meeting with no evaporating surface, and with no temperature colder than that to
                    which it is subjected on the mountain-tops, this wind reaches the ocean before
                    it becomes charged with fresh moisture. The constantly prevailing wind on the
                    Peruvian coast is from the south. From November to April there are usually
                    constant dryness, a clear sky, and considerable, though by no means-oppressive,
                    heat. From June to September the sky is obscured for weeks together by fog,
                    which is often accompanied by drizzling rain called “garua.” In 1877 the maximum
                    temperature at Lima was 78∣° Fahr, in February and the minimum 61J <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0</hi> Fahr, in July. At the time when it is hottest and
                    driest on the coast it is raining heavily in the Andes, and the rivers are full.
                    When the rivers are at their lowest, the “garua” prevails on the coast. The
                    climate of various parts of the coast is, however, modified by local
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>The deserts between the river-valleys vary in extent, the largest being upwards
                    of 70 miles across. On their western margin steep cliffs generally rise from the
                    sea, above which is the “tablazo” or plateau, in some places slightly
                    undulating, in others with ridges of considerable height rising out of it, the
                    whole apparently quite bare of vegetation. The surface is generally hard, but in
                    many places there are great accumulations of drifting sea-sand. The sand usually
                    forms isolated hillocks, called “medanos,” of a half-moon shape, having their
                    convex sides towards the trade-wind. They are from 10 to 20 feet high, with an
                    acute crest, the inner side perpendicular, the outer with a steep slope.
                    Sometimes, especially at early dawn, there is a musical noise in the desert,
                    like the sound of distant drums, which is caused by the eddying of grains of
                    sand in the heated atmosphere, on the crests of the “medanos.” Apparently the
                    deserts are destitute of all vegetation; yet three kinds of herbs exist, which
                    bury themselves deep in the earth, and survive long periods of drought. One is
                    an amar-anthaceous plant, whose stems ramify through the sandhills; the other
                    two are a <hi rend="italic">Martynia</hi> and an <hi rend="italic">Aniseia,</hi>
                    which maintain a subterranean existence during many years, and only produce
                    leafy stems in those rare seasons when sufficient moisture penetrates to the
                    roots. In a few hollows which are reached by moisture the trees of the desert
                    find support, the “algarrobo” <hi rend="italic">{Prosopis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >horrida),</hi> a low tree of very scraggy growth, the “vichaya” <hi
                    rend="italic">{Capparis crotonoides),</hi> and “zapote del perro” <hi
                    rend="italic">{C olicodendrum scabridum),</hi> mere shrubs. Far away towards the
                    first ascents to the Andes a tall branched cactus is met with, and there are <hi
                    rend="italic">Salicornias</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Salsolas</hi> near the
                    coast. But, when the mists set in, the low hills near the coast bordering the
                    deserts, which are called “lomas,” undergo a change as if by magic. A blooming
                    vegetation of wild flowers for a short time covers the barren hills. Near Lima
                    one of the low ranges is brightened by the beautiful yellow lily called
                    “amancaes” <hi rend="italic">{Ismene Amancaes).</hi> The other flowers of the
                    “lomas” are the “papita de San Juan” <hi rend="italic">{Begonia

                    >Solanum,</hi> and crucifers. But this carpet of flowers is very partially
                    distributed and lasts but a short time. Generally the deserts present a desolate
                    aspect, with no sign of a living creature or of vegetation. Only in the very
                    loftiest <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n702/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0702-0671"/> regions of the air the majestic condor or the
                    turkey buzzard may be seen floating lazily; perhaps a lizard will dart across
                    the path; and occasionally a distant line of mules or a solitary horseman seems
                    to shimmer weirdly in the refraction on the distant horizon.</p>
                <p>The valleys form a marvellous contrast to the surrounding desert. A great mass of
                    pale-green foliage is usually composed of the “algarrobo” trees, while the
                    course of the river is marked by lines or groups of palms, by fine old willows
                    <hi rend="italic">(Salix humboldtiana),</hi> fruit-gardens, and fields of
                    cotton, maize, sugar, and lucerne. In some valleys there are expanses of
                    sugar-cane, in others cotton, whilst in others vineyards and olive-yards
                    predominate. The woods of “algarrobo” are used for pasture, cattle and horses
                    greedily enjoying the pendulous yellow pods.</p>
                <p>For purposes of description the coast-region of Peru may be divided into six
                    sections, commencing from the north :—(1) the Piura region; (2) the Lambayeque
                    and Truxillo section; (3) the Santa valleys; (4) the section from Lima to Nasca;
                    (5) the Arequipa and Tacna section; (6) Tarapaca.</p>
                <p>(1) The great desert-region of Piura extends for nearly 200 miles from the Gulf
                    of Guayaquil to the borders of the Morrope valley, and is traversed by three
                    rivers—the Tumbez, Chira, and Piura, the two former receiving their waters from
                    the inner cordillera and breaking through the outer range. It is here that the
                    coast of South America extends farthest to the λvestward until it reaches Capes
                    Blanco and Pariña, and then turns southward to the Bay of Payta. The climate of
                    Piura is modified by the lower latitude, and also by the vicinity of the forests
                    of Guayaquil. Fog and “garua” are much less frequent than in the coast-region
                    farther south, while positive rain sometimes falls. At intervals of about ten
                    years there are occasional heavy showers of rain from February to April. (2) The
                    second section of the coast-region includes the valleys of the Morrope,
                    the*Chiclayo, and Lambayeque, the Sana, the Jequetepeque, the Chieama, Moche,
                    Viru, and Chao. With the intervening deserts this section extends over 200
                    miles. All these valleys, except Morrope and Chao, are watered by rivers which
                    have their sources far in the recesses of the mountains, and which furnish an
                    abundant supply in the season when irrigation is needed. (3) The third section,
                    also extending for 200 miles, contains the valleys of Santa, Nepeña, Casma,
                    Huarmey, Fortaleza, Pativilca, Supé, and Huaura. The river Santa, which rises in
                    the lake of Conococha, 12,907 feet above the sea, and has an entire length of
                    180 miles, is remarkable for its long course between the outer and central
                    ranges of the Andes, in a trough known as the “Callejon de Huaylas,” 100 miles
                    in length. It then breaks through in a deep gorge, and reaches the sea after a
                    course of 35 miles over the coast-belt, and after fertilizing a rich valley. The
                    Santa and Nepeña valleys are separated by a desert 8 leagues in width, on the
                    shores of which there is a good anchorage in the bay of Ferrol, where the port
                    of Chimbote is to be the terminus of a projected railway. The Nepeña, Casma,
                    Huarmey, Fortaleza, and Supé rivers rise on the slope of an outer range called
                    the Cordillera Negra, and are consequently dry during the great part of the
                    year. Wells are dug in their beds, and the fertility of the valleys is thus
                    maintained. The Pativilca (or Barranca) river and the Huaura break through the
                    outer range from their distant sources in the snowy cordillera, and have a
                    perennial supply of water. There are 9 leagues of desert between the Nepeña and
                    Casma, 16 between the Casma and Huarmey, and 18 between the Huarmey and
                    Fortaleza. The latter desert, much of which is loose sand, is called the “Pampa
                    de Mata Cavallos,” from the number of exhausted animals which die there. Between
                    the Supé and Pativilca is the desert called the “Pampa del Medio Mundo.” (4) The
                    next coast-section extends for over 300 miles from Chancay to Nasca, and
                    includes the rivers of Chancay or Lacha, of Carabayllo, Rimae, Lurin, Mala,
                    Cañete, Chincha, Pisco or Chunchanga, Yea, and Rio Grande. Here the maritime
                    range approaches the ocean, leaving a narrower strip of coast, but the fertile
                    valleys are closer and more numerous. Those of Carabayllo and Rimae are
                    connected, and the view from the Bay of Callao extends over a vast expanse of
                    fertile plain bounded by the Andes, with the white towers of Lima in a setting
                    of verdure. Lurin and Mala are smaller valleys, but the great vale of Cañete is
                    one green sheet of sugar-cane; and narrow strips of desert separate it from the
                    fertile plain of Chincha, and Chincha from the famous vineyards of Pisco. The
                    valleys of Yea, Palpa, San Xavier, and Nasca are rich and fertile, though they
                    do not extend to the sea; but between Nasca and Acari there is a desert 60 miles
                    in width. (5) The Arequipa and Tacna section extends over 350 miles, and
                    comprises the valleys of Acari, Atequipa, Atico, Ocoña, Maj es or Camana,
                    Quilca, with the interior valley of Arequipa, Tambo, Ylo or Moquegua, Ité or
                    Locumba, Sama, Tacna, and Azapa or Arica. Here the Maritime Cordillera recedes,
                    and the important valley of Arequipa, though on its western slope, is 7000 feet
                    above the sea, and 90 miles from the coast. Most of the rivers here have their
                    sources in the central range, and are well supplied with water. The
                    coast-valleys through which they flow, especially those of Majes and Locumba,
                    are famous for their vineyards, and in the valley of Tambo there are extensive
                    olive plantations. (6) The most southern coast-section is that of Tarapaca,
                    extending, between the cordillera and the Pacific, in a narrow strip from the
                    ravine of Camarones, south of Arica, to the former southern frontier of Peru.
                    Only two rivers reach the sea in Tarapaca, the Tiliviche in the north of the
                    province, and the Loa in the extreme south. The other streams are lost in the
                    desert soon after they issue from their ravines in the Andes. The reason of this
                    is that in Tarapaca there is an arid range of hills parallel with the sea-shore,
                    which is about 30 miles in width, and covered with sand and saline substances.
                    Between this coast-range and the Andes is the great plateau called the “Pampa de
                    Tamarugal,” from 3000 to 3500 feet above the sea, which is about 30 miles wide,
                    and extends the whole length of Tarapaca. This plateau is covered with sand, and
                    contains vast deposits of nitrate of soda. Here and there a few “tamarugas” or
                    acacia trees are met with, which give their name to the region.</p>
                <p>The coast of Peru has few protected anchorages, and the headlands are generally
                    abrupt and lofty. These and the few islands are frequented by myriads of
                    sea-birds, whence come the guano-deposits, the retention of ammonia and other
                    fertilizing properties being due to the absence of rain. The islets off the
                    coast are all barren and rocky.</p>
                <p>The most northern is Foca, in 5° 13' 30" S., near the coast to the south of
                    Payta. The islands of Lobos de Tierra and Lobos de Afuera (2), in 6° 27' 45" S.
                    and 6° 56' 45" S. respectively, are off the desert of Sechura, and contain
                    deposits of guano. The two Afuera islands are 60 and 36 miles from the coast at
                    the port of San José. The islets of Macabi, in 7° 49' 20" S., also have
                    guano-deposits, now nearly exhausted. The two islets of Guañape, surrounded by
                    many rocks, in 8° 34' S., contain rich deposits. Chao rises 450 feet above the
                    sea, off the coast, in 8° 46' 30" S. Corcobado is in 8° 57' S. La Viuda is off
                    the port of Casma, in 9° 23' 30" S.; and Tortuga is 2 miles distant to the
                    north. Santa Islet lies off the bay of Cosca, in 9° 1' 40", and the three high
                    rocks of Ferrol in 9° 8' 30" S. Farther south there is the group of islets and
                    rocks called Huaura, in 11° 27' S., the chief of which are El Pelado, Tambillo,
                    Chiquitana, Bravo, Quitacaizones, and Mazorque. The Hormigas are in 11° 4' S.
                    and 11° 58', and the Pescadores in 11° 47' S. The island of San Lorenzo, in 12°
                    4' S., is a lofty mass, 4⅛ miles long by 1 broad, forming the Bay of Callao; its
                    highest point is 1050 feet. Off its south-east end lies a small but lofty islet
                    called Fronton, and to the south-west are the Palomitas Rocks. Horadada Islet,
                    with a hole through it, is to the south of Callao Point. Off the valley of Lurin
                    are the Pachacaraac Islands, the most northern and largest being half a mile
                    long. The next, called San Francisco, is like a sugar-loaf, perfectly rounded at
                    the top. The others are mere rocks. Asia Island is farther south, 17 miles
                    north-west of Cerro Azul, and about a mile in circuit. Pisco Bay contains San
                    Gallan Island, high, with a bold cliff outline, 2⅜ miles long by 1 broad, the
                    Ballista Islets, and farther north the three famous Chincha Islands, whose vast
                    guanodeposits are now exhausted. South of the entrance to Pisco Bay is Zarate
                    Island, and farther south the white level islet of Santa Rosa. The Infiernillo
                    rock is quite black, about 50 feet high, in the form of a sugar-loaf, a mile
                    west of the Point of Santa Maria, which is near the mouth of the Yea river.
                    Alacran is a small islet off the lofty “morro” of Arica. A low island protects
                    the anchorage of Iquique on the coast of Tarapaca, and farther south are the
                    three islets of Patillos in 20° 46' 20" S., and the Pajaros, with guanodeposits,
                    in 22° 6' 4" S. All these rocks and islets are barren and uninhabitable, mere
                    outworks of the desert headlands.</p>
                <p>The more common sea-birds, which haunt the islets and headlands in countless
                    myriads, are the <hi rend="italic">Sula</hi><hi rend="italic">variegata</hi> or

                    the purpose of breathing their last, the wounded or aged being helped there by
                    their companions.</p>
                <p>The Maritime Cordillera, overhanging the Peruvian coast, contains a long line of
                    volcanic mountains, most of them inactive, but their presence is probably
                    connected with the frequent and severe earthquakes, especially in the southern
                    section of the coast. Since the year 1570 there have been seventy violently
                    destructive earthquakes recorded on the west coast of South America, but the
                    register is of course incomplete in its earlier part. The most terrible was that
                    of 1745, which destroyed Callao. There had been subterranean noises for some
                    days previously; the first shock was at 10.30 <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> on
                    28th October, and there were 220 shocks in the following twenty-four hours. The
                    town was overwhelmed by a vast wave, which rose 80 feet; and the shocks
                    continued until the following February. On 13th August 1868 an earthquake nearly
                    destroyed Arequipa, and great waves rolled in upon the ports of Arica and
                    Iquique. On 9th May 1877 nearly all the southern ports were overwhelmed. These
                    fearful catastrophes are in greatest force where there are volcanoes, whether
                    active or extinct, in the vicinity. That of 1877 had its origin in the volcanic
                    mountains near the frontier of Peru and Bolivia, and spent its chief fury near
                    its centre of origin, gradually working itself out as it went north. Usually the
                    line of disturbance is meridional and along the coast, but in some instances the
                    line takes a seaward direction at an angle with the mountain-chains.</p>
                <p>The most important part of Peru is the region of the cordilleras of the Andes
                    divided into “puna” or lofty uninhabited wilderness, and “sierra” or inhabitable
                    mountain slopes and valleys. This great mountain-system, running south-east to
                    north-west with the line of the coast, consists of three chains or cordilleras.
                    The two chains which run parallel, and near each other on the western side, are
                    of identical origin, and have been separated by the action of water during many
                    centuries. On these chains are the volcanoes and many thermal springs. The
                    narrow space between them is for the most part, but not always, a cold and lofty
                    region known as the “puna,” containing alpine lakes,—the sources of the
                    coast-rivers. The great eastern chain, rising from the basin of the Amazon and
                    forming the inner wall of the system, is of distinct origin. These three chains
                    are called the Maritime Cordillera, the Central Cordillera, and the Andes. Paz
                    Soldan and other Peruvian geographers give the name of Andes, <hi rend="italic"
                    >par excellence,</hi> to the eastern cordillera.</p>
                <p>The Peruvian Maritime Cordillera contains a regular chain of volcanic peaks
                    overlooking the coast-region of Tarapaca, which attain a height of 16,000 to
                    18,000 feet. Chief among them are the snowy peak of Lirima over the ravine of
                    Tarapaca, the volcano of Isluga overhanging Camiña, the unmeasured peak of
                    Sehama, and Tacora near the Bolivian frontier. In rear of Moquegua there is a
                    group of volcanic peaks, clustering round those of Ubinas and Huaynaputina. A
                    great eruption of Huaynaputina commenced on 15th February 1600 and continued
                    until the 28th. An incessant rain of fine white sand was poured over the
                    surrounding country for a distance of 40 miles, accompanied by a mighty
                    subterraneous roaring sound. But generally these volcanoes are quiescent.
                    Farther north the Misti volcano rises over the city of Arequipa in a perfect
                    cone to a height of over 18,000 feet, and near its base are the hot sulphur and
                    iron springs of Yura. As the maritime chain advances northward it fully
                    maintains its elevation. The peak of Sarasara, in Parinacochas (Ayacucho), is
                    19,500 feet above the sea, and in the mountains above Lima the passes attain a
                    height of more than 15,000. In latitude 10° S. the maritime chain separates into
                    two branches, which run parallel to each other for 100 miles, enclosing the
                    remarkable ravine or Callejon de Huaylas,—the eastern or main branch being known
                    as the Cordillera Nevada and the western as the Cordillera Negra. On the Nevada
                    the peak of Huascan reaches a height of 22,000 feet, according to the
                    trigonometrical measurement of the railway engineer Hindle. The Huandoy peak,
                    above Carhuaz, reaches to 21,088 feet; the Hualcan peak, overhanging the town of
                    Yungay, is 19,945 feet high; and most of the peaks in this part of the chain
                    reach a height of 19,000 feet. During the rainy season, from October to May, the
                    sky is generally clear at dawn, and the magnificent snowy peaks, with
                    sharply-defined outlines, stand out in lovely contrast to the deep-blue
                    background. But as the day advances the clouds collect, and the whole is
                    shrouded in a dense veil. In most parts of the Peruvian Andes the line of
                    perpetual snow is at 16,400 feet above the sea; but on the Cordillera Nevada,
                    above the Callejon de Huaylas, it sinks to 15,400 feet. This greater cold is
                    obviously caused by the intervention of the Cordillera Negra, which intercepts
                    the warmth from the coast. As this lower chain does not reach the snow-line, the
                    streams rising from it are very scantily supplied with water, while the Santa,
                    Pativilca, and other coast-rivers which break through it from sources in the
                    snowy chain have a greater volume from the melted snows. At the point where the
                    river Santa breaks through the Cordillera Negra that range begins to subside,
                    while the Maritime Cordillera continues as one chain to and beyond the frontier
                    of Ecuador.</p>
                <p>The Central Cordillera is the true water-parting of the system. No river, except
                    the Marañon, breaks through it either to the east or west, while more than
                    twenty coaststreams rise on its slopes and force their way through the maritime
                    chain. The Central Cordillera consists mainly of crystalline and volcanic rocks,
                    on each side of which are aqueous, in great part Jurassic, strata thrown up
                    almost vertically. In 14° 30' S. lat. the central chain is connected with the
                    Eastern Andes by the transverse mountain-knot of Vilcañota, the peak of that
                    name being 17,500 feet above the sea. The great inland basin of Lake Titicaca is
                    thus formed. The central chain continues to run parallel with the Maritime
                    Cordillera until, at Cerro Pasco, another transverse knot connects it with the
                    Andes in 10° 30' S. lat. It then continues northward, separating the basins of
                    the Marañon and Huallaga; and at the northern frontier of Peru it is at length
                    broken through by the Marañon flowing to the eastward.</p>
                <p>The Eastern Andes is a magnificent range in the southern part of Peru, of
                    Silurian formation, with talcose and clay slates, many quartz veins, and
                    eruptions of granitic rocks. Mr Forbes says that the peaks of Illampu (21,470
                    feet) and Illimani (21,040 feet) in Bolivia are Silurian and fossiliferous to
                    their summits. The eastern range is cut through by six rivers in Peru, namely,
                    the Marañon and Huallaga, the Perene, Mantaro, Apurimac, Vilcamayu, and
                    Paucartambo, the last five being tributaries of the Ucayali. The range of the
                    Andes in south Peru has a high plateau to the west and the vast plains of the
                    Amazonian basin to the east. The whole range is highly auriferous, and the
                    thickness of the strata is not less than 10,000 feet. It is nowhere disturbed by
                    volcanic eruptions, except at the very edge of the formation near Lake Titicaca,
                    and in this respect it differs essentially from the Maritime Cordillera. To the
                    eastward numerous spurs extend for varying distances into the great plain of the
                    Amazons. It is here that the majestic beauty of the Andean scenery is fully
                    realized; masses of dark mountains rise for thousands of feet, with their bases
                    washed by foaming torrents and their <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n704/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0704-0673"/> summits terminating in sharp peaks or serrated
                    ridges; the lower slopes are covered with dense vegetation; and everywhere there
                    is flowing water in cascades or rushing torrents, the condensed moisture of the
                    trade-winds hurrying back to the Atlantic. The Andes lose their majestic height
                    to the northward; and beyond Cerro Pasco the eastern chain sinks into a lower
                    range between the Huallaga and Ucayali. But throughout the length of Peru the
                    three ranges are clearly defined.</p>
                <p>For purposes of description the sierra of Peru may be conveniently divided into
                    four sections, each embracing portions of all three ranges. The first, from the
                    north, comprises the upper basins of the Marañon and the Huallaga, and is 350
                    miles long by 100 broad. The second extends from the Knot of Cerro Pasco to
                    Ayacucho, about 200 miles, including the Lake of Ghinchay-cocha and the basin of
                    the river Xauxa. The third or Cuzco section extends 250 miles to the Knot of
                    Vilcañota with the basins of the Pampas, Apurimac, Vilcamayu, and Paucartambo.
                    The fourth is the basin of Lake Titicaca, about 150 miles in length and
                    breadth.</p>
                <p>The Lake of Chinchay-cocha, in the second section, is 36 miles long by 7 miles
                    broad, and 13,000 feet above the sea. Its marshy banks are overgrown with reeds
                    and inhabited by numerous waterfowl. From this lake the river Xauxa flows
                    southwards through a populous valley for 150 miles before entering the forests.
                    Lake Titicaca, in the fourth or most southern section, is about 80 miles long by
                    40 broad, the frontier of Bolivia passing across it diagonally. It is 12,545
                    feet above the sea by the railroad-levels. The drainage is carried off
                    southwards by the river Desaguadero to the great swampy Lake of Aullagas in the
                    south of Bolivia, while it is fed by streams from the Andes and the Central
                    Cordillera. The largest is the Ramiz, formed by the two streams of Pucara and
                    Azangaro, both coming from the Knot of Vilcañota to the north. The Suchiz,
                    formed by the Cavanilla and Lam pa streams, falls into the lake on the
                    north-west side, as well as the Yllpa and Ylave. Much of the water flows out by
                    the Desaguadero, but a great proportion is taken up by evaporation in the dry
                    season from April to September. The waters are gradually receding under the
                    combined influence of evaporation ami the sediment brought down by the rivers.
                    The deepest part of the lake is on the Bolivian side; in other parts it is very
                    shoaly, and along the shore there are many acres of tall reeds. The principal
                    islands are Titicaca and Coati (at the south end near the peninsula of
                    Copacabana), Campanaria (9 miles from the east shore), Soto, and Esteves. There
                    are two other lakes in the Collao, as the elevated region round Titicaca is
                    called. Lake Arapa, a few miles from the northern shore of Titicaca, is 30 miles
                    in circumference. Lake Umayo is on higher ground to the westward. The lake in
                    Peru which is third in size is that of Parinacochas on the coast watershed, near
                    the foot of the snowy peak of Sarasara. It is 12 miles long by 6 broad, but has
                    never been visited and described by any modern traveller. The smaller alpine
                    lakes, often forming the sources of rivers, are numerous.</p>
                <p>The great rivers of the sierra are the Marañon, rising in the Lake of Lauricocha
                    and flowing northward in a deep gorge between the Maritime and Central
                    Cordilleras for 350 miles, when it forces its way through the mountains at the
                    famous Pon go de Mause riche and enters the Amazonian plain. The Huallaga rises
                    north of Cerro Pasco, and, passing Huanuco, flows northwards on the other side
                    of the Central Cordillera for 300 miles. It breaks through the range at the
                    Pongo de Chasuta and falls into the Marañon. The other great rivers are
                    tributaries of the Ucayali. The Pozuzu, flowing eastward from the Knot of Cerro
                    Pasco, joins the Pachitea, which is the most northern important affluent of the
                    Ucayali. The Xauxa, becoming afterwards the Mantaro, receives the drainage of
                    Xauxa, Huancavelica, and Ayacucho. The southern valleys of this part of the
                    sierra furnish streams which form the main rivers of Pampas, Pachachaca, and
                    Apurimac. These, uniting with the Mantaro, form the Ene, and the Ene and Perene
                    (which drains the province of Tambo) form the Tambo. The classic river of
                    Vilcamayu rises on the Knot of Vilcañota, flows north through a lovely valley,
                    receives the Yanatilde and Paucartambo on its right bank, and, uniting with the
                    Tambo, forms the Ucayali. Most of these main streams flow through profound
                    gorges in a tropical climate, while the upper slopes yield products of the
                    temperate zone, and the plateaus above are cold and bleak, affording only
                    pasture and the hardiest cereals.</p>
                <p>The great variety of elevation within the sierra produces vegetation belonging to
                    every zone. There is a tropical flora in the deep gorges, higher up a
                    sub-tropical, then a temperate, then a sub-arctic flora. In ascending from the
                    coast-valleys there is first an arid range, where the great-branched cacti rear
                    themselves up among the rocks. Farther inland, where the rains are more
                    plentiful, is the native home of the potato. Here also are other plants with
                    edible roots—the “oca” <hi rend="italic">{Oxalis</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    height of 12,000 feet round the shores of Lake Titicaca. The temperate valleys
                    of the sierra yield fruits of many kinds. Those indigenous to the country are
                    the delicious “chirimoyas,” “paltas” or alligator pears, the “paccay,” a species
                    of <hi rend="italic">Inga,</hi> the “lucma,” and the “granadilla” or fruit of
                    the passionflower. Vineyards and sugar-cane yield crops in the warmer ravines;
                    the sub-tropical valleys are famous for splendid crops of maize; wheat and
                    barley thrive on the mountain slopes; and at heights from 7000 to 13,000 feet
                    there are crops of “quinua” <hi rend="italic">{Chenopodium Quinua).</hi> In the
                    loftiest regions the pasture chiefly consists of a coarse grass <hi
                    rend="italic">{Stipa Ychu),</hi> of which the llamas eat the upper blades while
                    the sheep browse on the tender shoots beneath. There are also two kinds of
                    shrubby plants, a thorny <hi rend="italic">Composita</hi> called “ccanlli” and
                    another called “tola,” which is a resinous <hi rend="italic">Baccharis,</hi> and
                    is used for fuel.</p>
                <p>The animals which specially belong to the Peruvian Andes are the domestic llamas
                    and alpacas and the wild vicuñas. There are deer, called “taruco” <hi
                    rend="italic">{Cervus</hi><hi rend="italic">antisensis),</hi> the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,,</hi> viscacha, <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi> a large

                    white muzzle, when driven by hunger, wander into the loftier regions. The
                    largest bird is the condor, and there is another bird of the vulture tribe, with
                    a black and white wing feather, formerly used by the Yncas in their head-dress,
                    called the “coraquenque” or “alcamari.” The “pito” is a brown speckled creeper
                    which flutters about the rocks. There is a little bird, the size of a starling,
                    with brown back striped with black, and white breast, which the Indians call
                    “ynca-hualpa”; it utters a monotonous sound at each hour of the night. A
                    partridge called “yutu” frequents the long grass. On the lakes there is a very
                    handsome goose, with white body and dark-green wings shading into violet, called
                    “huachua,” two kinds of ibis, a large gull <hi rend="italic">{Larus
                    serranus),</hi> frequenting the alpine lakes in flocks, flamingoes called
                    “parihuana,” ducks, and water-hens. Many pretty little finches fly about the
                    maize-fields and fruit-gardens, and a little· green parakeet is met with as high
                    as 12,000 feet above the sea.</p>
                <p>The third division of Peru is the region of the tropical forests, at the base of
                    the Andes, and within the basin of the Amazons. It is traversed by great
                    navigable rivers. The Marañon, having burst through the defile of the Pongo de
                    Mauseriche, and the Huallaga through that of Chasuta, enter the forests and
                    unite after separate courses of about 600 and 400 miles, the united flood then
                    flowing eastward to the Brazilian frontier. After 150 miles it is joined by the
                    Ucayali, a great navigable river with a course of 600 miles. The country between
                    the Huallaga and the Ucayali, traversed by the eastern cordillera, is called the
                    Pampa del Sacramento. The forests drained by the Marañon, Huallaga, and Ucayali
                    form the northern portion of the Peruvian montaña. The southern half of the
                    montaña is watered by streams flowing from the Eastern Andes, which go to form
                    the river Madre de Dios or Amaru-mayu, the principal branch of the river Beni,
                    which falls into the Madeira. The region of the Peruvian montaña, which is 800
                    miles long from the Marañon to the Bolivian frontier, is naturally divided into
                    two sections, the subtropical forests in the ravines and on the eastern slopes
                    of the Andes and the dense tropical forests in the Amazonian plain. The
                    sub-tropical section is important from the value of its products, and
                    interesting from the grandeur and beauty of its scenery. Long spurs run off from
                    the Andes, gradually decreasing in elevation, and it is sometimes a distance of
                    60 or 80 miles before they finally subside into the vast forest-covered plains
                    of the Amazon basin. Numerous rivers flow through the valleys between these
                    spurs, which are the native home of the quinine-yielding chinchona trees. The
                    most valuable species, called <hi rend="italic">C. Calisaya,</hi> is found in
                    the forests of Caravaya in south Peru and in those of Bolivia. The species
                    between Caravaya and the head-waters of the Huallaga yield very little of the
                    febrifuge alkaloid. But the forests of Huanuco and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n705/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0705-0674"/> Huamalies abound in species yielding the grey
                    bark of commerce, which is rich in chinchonine, an alkaloid efficacious as a
                    febrifuge, though inferior to quinine. With the chinchona trees grow many kinds
                    of <hi rend="italic">Melastomaceae,</hi> especially the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lasiandra,</hi> with masses of purple flowers, tree-ferns, and palms. In the
                    warm valleys there are large plantations of coca <hi rend="italic">(Erythroxylon
                    Coca),</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Cuca</hi> (see vol. vi. p. 684), the annual
                    produce of which is stated at 15,000,000 ìb. The other products of these warm
                    valleys are most excellent coffee, cocoa, sugar, tropical fruits of all kinds,
                    and gold in great abundance. In the vast untrodden forests farther east there
                    are timber trees of many kinds, incense trees, a great wealth of india-rubber
                    trees of the <hi rend="italic">Hevea</hi> genus, numerous varieties of beautiful
                    palms, sarsaparilla, vanilla, ipecacuanha, and copaiba. The abundant and varied
                    fauna is the same as that of the Brazilian forests.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The earliest reliable enumeration of the
                    people of Peru was made in 1793, when there were 617,700 Indians, 241,225
                    mestizos (Indian and white), 136,311 Spaniards, 40,337 negro slaves, and 41,404
                    mulattos, giving a total of 1,076,977 souls, without counting the wild Indians
                    of the montaña. The ecclesiastics numbered 5496, including 1260 nuns. This tells
                    a sad story of depopulation since the fall of the Yncas, to which the abandoned
                    terraces on the mountain-sides, once highly cultivated, bear silent testimony.
                    In 1862 the population was officially estimated at 2,487,716. The latest census
                    was taken in 1876 with much care. The result was 2,673,075 souls (males
                    1,352,151, females 1,320,924); of these 57 percent, were Indians, 23 per cent,
                    mestizos, and 20 per cent, of Spanish descent, negroes, Chinese, and foreigners;
                    so that Peru is still the country of the Ynca people.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Political Divisions.—</hi> The empire of the Yncaswas divided
                    into four main divisions, Chinchay-suyu to the north of Cuzco, Anti-suyu to the
                    east, Colla-suyu to the south, and Cunti-suyu to the west, the whole empire
                    being called Ttahuantin-suyu, or the four governments. Each was ruled by a
                    viceroy, under whom were the “huaranca-camayocs,”or officers ruling over
                    thousands, and inferior officers, in regular order, over 500, 100, 50, and 10
                    men. All disorders and irregularities were checked by the periodical visits of
                    the “tucuyricocs” or inspectors. The Spanish conquest threw this complicated
                    system out of gear. In 1569 the governor, Lope Garcia de Castro, divided Peru
                    into “corregimientos” under officers named “corregidors,” of whom there were 77,
                    each in direct communication with the Government at Lima. An important
                    administrative reform was made in 1784, when Peru was divided into 7
                    “intendencias,” each under an officer called an “intendente.” These
                    “intendencias” included about 6 of the old “corregimientos,” which were called
                    “partidos,” under officers named “sub-delegados.” Thus the number of officers
                    reporting direct to Lima was reduced from 77 to 7, a great improvement. The
                    republic adopted the same system, calling the “intendencias” “departments” under
                    a prefect, and the “partidos” “provinces” under a sub-prefect. Peru is divided
                    into 18 departments, 2 littoral provinces, and what is called the constitutional
                    province of Callao. The departments contain 95 provinces. The Government
                    recognizes 65 cities, 70 towns, 1337 smaller towns, 641 villages, 40 hamlets on
                    the sea-coast, and 600 in the rural districts. The departments (going from north
                    to south) are :—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Towns and Seaports.—</hi> The principal towns on the coast,
                    except Payta, Callao, and Arica, are always some distance from the seashore. San
                    Miguel de Piura, founded by Pizarro in 1532, is on the river of the same name.
                    The towns in all parts of Peru are built on the same plan where the ground will
                    allow of it, in squares or “quadras,” with the streets at right angles, and a
                    quadrangular open space or “plaza,” one side being occupied by the principal
                    church, near the centre. The church usually has an ornamental façade in the
                    Renaissance style, with two towers. The houses on the coast are flat-roofed,
                    with folding doors to the street, leading to a court or “patio,” with rooms
                    opening on it. Piura is a town of this class. Farther south are the cities of
                    Lambayeque, Chiclayo, and Sana. Truxillo, founded by Pizarro in 1535, is of more
                    importance. It is of oval shape, and was surrounded by walls with fifteen
                    bastions, built in 1686, which have recently been demolished. Besides the
                    cathedral, seat of a bishopric founded in 1609, there are three churches, and
                    formerly four monasteries and a Jesuit college. Truxillo is the most important
                    city north of Lima.</p>
                <p>To the north of Lima there are five principal ports and thirteen smaller ones.
                    Payta has a good anchorage and exports the cotton of the Chira and Piura
                    valleys, the anchorages of Tumbez to the north and Sechura to the south being
                    subsidiary to it. Pimentel is the port for the valleys of Lambayeque and
                    Chiclayo, and Eten for that of Ferreñafe, the older port of San José having been
                    abandoned as more dangerous. Pacasmayo, also a precarious anchorage, is the port
                    which taps the rich valley of Jequetepeque. Farther south Malabrigo is the port
                    for the valley of Chicama. Huanchaco was formerly the port for Truxillo, but
                    Salaverry, a few miles to the south, has been substituted as affording a safer
                    anchorage. Santiago de Chao and Guañape in the Viru district are lesser ports,
                    the latter being resorted to by ships loading with guano at the adjacent
                    islands. Chimbote, in the bay of Ferrol, has a good anchorage, and is important
                    as the principal outlet for the Santa valley and the department of Ancachs.
                    Farther south are the lesser ports of Santa, Samanco, Casma, Huarmey, Supé,
                    Huacho, Chancay, and Ancon.</p>
                <p>Lima, the capital (see vol. xiv. p. 644), according to the census of 1876, had a
                    population of 100,046, of whom 33,020 were of European descent, 23,010
                    half-castes, 19,630 Indians, 15,378 foreigners, and 9008 negroes. South of Lima
                    are the cities of Chincha and Yea, with the principal seaport of Pisco, whence
                    the wines and spirits of the adjacent valleys are exported. The small ports of
                    Cerro Azul and Tambo Mora export the sugars of the Cañete and Chincha valleys.
                    Farther south the exposed port of Chala, with a bad anchorage, is used for the
                    valley of Acari and the province of Parinacochas in the mountains. South-east of
                    Yea are the charming agricultural towns of Palpa and Nasca. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Akequipa</hi> (see vol. ii. p. 484), the most important coast-city south of
                    Lima, was founded by Pizarro in 1536. South of Arequipa is the littoral province
                    of Moquegua, with a pleasant town, the centre of a vine-growing industry. The
                    cities of Tacna, Arica, and Iquique are in the Chilian province of Tarapaca. The
                    ports of Arequipa were formerly Quilca, then Islay, and now Moliendo. Ylo and
                    Pacocha, in the same bay, are the ports of Moquegua; Saña, under the lofty
                    headland of the same name, is a port where landing is impossible except in
                    “balsas,” and it is little used. Arica was a very important port before the
                    Chilian invasion, as through it passed all the trade to Bolivia. Iquique and
                    Pisagua are the chief ports of Tarapaca, the others being Junin, Mexillones,
                    Molle, Chucumata, Patillos.</p>
                <p>In the sierra there is the same regularity in intention in laying out the plan of
                    the towns, but it is often interfered <pb break="no"

                    High-pitched red tiled roofs take the place of the flat roofs of the coast. The
                    upper stories often recede, leaving wide corridors under the overhanging eaves,
                    and in the “plazas” there are frequently covered arcades. Fruit-gardens and
                    fields waving with lucerne and barley encircle the towns, and there is almost
                    always a background of mountain-ranges. The principal interior towns in the
                    north of Peru are Caxamarca, Huaraz, Huanuco, Cerro Pasco, the centre of the
                    great silver-mining industry, 13,200 feet above the sea, Tarma, and Xauxa.
                    Huancavelica owed its existence to the famous quicksilver mine. Ayacucho,
                    formerly Guamanga, founded by Pizarro in 1539, is a charming abode amidst lovely
                    scenery. Between Ayacucho and Cuzco are the pleasant towns of Andahuaylas and
                    Abancay. Cuzco (see vol. vi. p. 744), the centre of Peru, the old capital of the
                    Yncas, lies at the foot of the famous hill of Sacsahuaman. South of Cuzco are
                    many delightful places in the vale of Vilcamayu, and the towns in the Collao,
                    the chief being Puno on the shore of Lake Titicaca.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.—</hi> The resources of Peru consist of its mineral
                    wealth, its flocks, yielding valuable wool, its crops, and the products of its
                    virgin-forests. Silver-mines extend along the whole length of the cordilleras
                    from Hualgayoc to Puno. The mines are worked here and there, the great centre of
                    this industry being at Cerro Pasco, where 1,427,592 ounces of silver were
                    produced in 1877. The value of the silver exported from Peru in that year was
                    £575,000, of copper £330,000; of gold there is no return. The exportation of
                    guano from the Chincha Islands began in 1846 and continued until 1872. Between
                    1853 and 1872 there were 8,000,000 tons shipped from these islands. The deposits
                    on the Guañape Islands were first worked in 1869, and from that year to 1871 as
                    many as 838,853 tons were shipped,—460,000 tons remaining. On the three Macabi
                    Islands there were 400,000 tons of guano in 1872, and large deposits on the
                    Lobos Islands. But the most important discoveries of guanodeposits, since the
                    exhaustion of the Chincha Islands, have been on the coast of Tarapaca. In 1876
                    the quantity at Pabellon de Pica was calculated at 350,000 tons, at Punta de
                    Lobos 200,000 tons, at Huanillos 1,000,000 tons (buried under huge boulders of
                    rock), at Chipana 250,000 tons. The total quantity of guano on islands north of
                    Lima may be 600,000 tons, and on the coast of Tarapaca 1,800,000 tons.</p>
                <p>Since 1830 nitrate of soda has been exported from the southern ports of Peru, the
                    deposits being found on the western side of the Pampa de Tamarugal in Tarapaca.
                    This region contains sufficient nitrate for the supply of Europe for ages. From
                    1830 to 1850 the export from Iquique amounted to 239,860 tons; in 1875 the
                    annual export reached its maximum (326,869 tons).</p>
                <p>The sugar cultivation in the coast-valleys is a great source of wealth. In 1877
                    the yield was estimated at 85,000 tons, valued at £1,360,000; of this quantity
                    63,370 tons went to Great Britain. Cotton, an indigenous product of the
                    coast-valleys, is next in importance to sugar, the estates being worked with
                    intelligence and a due outlay of capital. The cultivation of the vine is also a
                    profitable industry,—a well-known spirit and excellent wine being made in the
                    valleys of Pisco and Yea, and in the districts of Majes and Moquegua. Rice-crops
                    are raised at Ferreñafe; olives are grown largely in the Tambo valley; and the
                    silk-worm and cochineal insect have been successfully cultivated. In the sierra
                    large quantities of wheat, barley, and potatoes are raised, and millions of
                    pounds of alpaca and sheep’s-wool are exported. From the forests of the montaña
                    come chinchona bark, coca, coffee of the finest quality, cocoa, india-rubber,
                    and some medicinal roots.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communication.—</hi> Several railroads have been constructed of
                    late years to connect the coast-towns and valleys with their seaports. That from
                    Payta to Piura, contracted for in 1872, is 63 miles long; one from the port of
                    Pimentel to Chiclayo and Lambayeque has a length of 45 miles. There are 50 miles
                    of railway from Eten to Ferreñafe, 93 from Pacasmayo to Magdalena, 25 from
                    Malabrigo to Ascope and the Chicama valley, 85 from Salaverry to Truxillo, 172
                    from Chimbote to Huaraz (only 52 finished). Several short lines radiate from
                    Lima. A line from Pisco to Yea is 48. miles long, from Moliendo to Arequipa 107,
                    from Ylo to Moquegua 63 miles, from Arica to Tacna 39 miles; and there are
                    railroads in Tarapaca connecting the nitrate-works with the ports of Pisagua,
                    Iquique, and Patillos. At Cerro Pasco a short line, begun in 1869, connects the
                    silver-mines with the town. A railroad was commenced in 1870, from Callao and
                    Lima, across the western and central cordilleras to Oroya, 12,178 feet above the
                    sea in the valley of Xauxa, a distance of 136 miles. It ascends the valley of
                    the Rimae, rising nearly 5000 feet in the first 46 miles. It then threads
                    intricate gorges of the Andes, along the edges of precipices and over deep
                    chasms. It tunnels the Andes at a height of 15,645 feet. There are sixty-three
                    tunnels, and the bridge of Verrugas spans a chasm 580 feet wide, resting on
                    three piers, the centre one being 252 feet high, made of hollow wrought-iron.
                    This great work is completed (1884) as far as Chicla, a distance of 86∣ miles.
                    Another railroad across the Andes connects Arequipa with Puno on the shores of
                    Lake Titicaca. The summit is crossed in a cutting only 6 feet deep, 14,660 feet
                    above the sea. The first locomotive reached Puno on 1st January 1874. The line
                    is 232 miles long, and is to be prolonged to Cuzco. The cost of the Oroya line
                    has been £4,625,887, and of the Arequipa and Puno line £4,346,659.</p>
                <p>Two steamers were launched on Lake Titicaca in March 1874, which carry the
                    traffic from Bolivia to Puno. Extensive harbourworks have been completed at
                    Callao since 1870; and iron piers have been constructed at other ports. Steam
                    communication connects the Peruvian ports on the Huallaga and Marañon with the
                    Brazilian line at Tabatinga.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education and Literature.—</hi> Universities and collegeswere
                    founded in Peru very soon after the conquest, and there was intellectual
                    progress both among the Indians and the families of Spanish descent. The
                    university of San Marcos at Lima is the most ancient in the New World, having
                    been created by order of Charles V. in 1551. The college of San Carlos was
                    founded in 1770, and the school of medicine in 1792. At Cuzco the university of
                    San Antonio Abad was founded in 1598, and the college of San Geronimo at
                    Arequipa in 1616. Since the independence there has been very considerable
                    intellectual and educational progress in the country. There is a university of
                    the first rank at Lima, 5 lesser universities, 33 colleges for boys and 18 for
                    girls, 1578 schools for boys and 729 for girls, besides private schools. The
                    most prolific author in Spanish times was Dr Pedro de Peralta y Barnuevo, author
                    of an epic poem called <hi rend="italic">Lima Fundada</hi> and many other works.
                    Towards the latter end of the last century scientific studies began to receive
                    attention in Peru. Μ. Godin, a member of the French commission for measuring an
                    arc of the meridian near Quito, became professor of mathematics at San Marcos in
                    1750; and the botanical expeditions sent out from Spain gave further zest to
                    scientific research. Dr Gabriel Moreno (died 1809), a native of Huamantanga in
                    the Maritime Cordillera, studied under Dr Jussieu, and became an eminent
                    botanist. Don Hipolito Unanue, born at Arica in 1755, wrote an important work on
                    the climate of Lima and contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Mercurio
                    Peruano.</hi> This periodical was commenced in 1791 at Lima, the contributors
                    forming a society called “Amantes del Pais,” and it was completed in eleven
                    volumes. It contains many valuable articles on history, topography, botany,
                    mining, commerce, and statistics. An ephemeris and guide to Peru was commenced
                    by the learned geographer Dr Cosme Bueno, and continued by Dr Unanue, who
                    brought out his guides at Lima from 1793 to 1798. In 1794 a nautical school was
                    founded at Lima, with Andres Baleato as instructor and Pedro Alvarez as teacher
                    of the use of instruments. Baleato also constructed a map of Peru. A list of
                    Peruvian authors in viceregal times occupies a long chapter in the life of St

                    earlier history of Peru has been written in three volumes by Sebastian Lorente;
                    Mariano Rivero has ably discussed its antiquities; and Manuel Fuentes has edited
                    six interesting volumes of memoirs written by Spanish viceroys. But the most
                    valuable and important historical work by a modern Peruvian is undoubtedly
                    General Mendiburu’s <hi rend="italic">Diccionario Historico-Biografico del

                    critical discernment of a high order, which has certainly secured for its
                    accomplished author a permanent place in the history of literature. As laborious
                    historical students, Don José Toribio Polo, the author of an ecclesiastical
                    history of Peruvian dioceses, and Don Enrique Torres Saldamando, the historian
                    of the Jesuits in Peru, have great merit. Among good local annalists may be
                    mentioned Juan Gilberto Valdivia, who has written a history of Arequipa, and Pio

                    independence; and Dr Francisco de Paula Vijil (died 1875), orator and statesman

                    the <hi rend="italic">Estadistiea de Lima,</hi> has also written a manual of
                    parliamentary practice.</p>
                <p>On the whole, Peruvian literature since the independence has attained to highest
                    merit in the walks of poetry and romance. The Guayaquil author Olmedo, who wrote
                    the famous ode on the victory of Junin, and the Limenians Felipe Pardo and
                    Manuel Segura are names λvell known wherever the Spanish language is spoken.
                    Pardo, as well as Segura, wrote in a satirical vein. Both died between 1860 and
                    1870. The comedies of Segura on the customs of Lima society, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Un</hi><hi rend="italic">Paseo</hi><hi rend="italic">a
                    Amancaes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">La Saya ιj Manto,</hi> have no equal in the
                    dramatic literature of Spanish America and few in that of modern Spain. From
                    1848 date the first poetical efforts of Arnaldo Marquez, Manuel Nicolas
                    Corpancho, Adolfo Garcia, Clemente Althaus, Pedro Paz Soldan (better known under
                    his <hi rend="italic">novi de plume</hi> of “Juan de Arona”), Carlos Augusto
                    Salaverry, a son of the ill-fated general, Luis Benjamin Cisneros, Trinidad
                    Fernandez, Constantino Carrasco, Narciso Arestegui, José Antonio Lavalie,
                    Ricardo Palma, and Numa Pompilio Llona. Marquez is undoubtedly the most correct
                    in diction and the most richly endowed with imaginative sentiment among Peruvian
                    poets of the present generation. Corpancho was a dramatist of the romantic
                    school and author of a bright little volume of poems entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brevas.</hi> He perished in a shipwreck off the coast of Mexico when barely
                    thirty years old. Adolfo Garcia is the poet of most robust and vigorous thought,
                    and he has written much, but only one volume of his select poems has been
                    published (Havre, 1870). Among other productions of great merit this book
                    contains a sonnet to Bolivar, which is one of the most beautiful that has
                    appeared from the muse of Peru. Althaus (d. 1880) was a poet, imaginative,
                    tender, elegant, and very careful as regards rhythm and diction. Paz Soldan, a
                    good classical scholar, has published three volumes of poems. Salaverry is one
                    of Peru’s best lyrical poets; and the novels of Cisneros, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Julia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Edgardo,</hi> have secured him a
                    lasting reputation. Fernandez and Carrasco were two poets of merit who died very
                    young. The principal work of Carrasco was his metrical version of the Quichua
                    drama of <hi rend="italic">Ollantay.</hi> Lavalle and Arestegui are chiefly
                    known as novelists. Palma has published three books of poetry, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Armonias, Verbos</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Gemndos,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pasionañas.</hi> Since 1870 he has devoted
                    his great literary powers to writing the historical traditions of Peru in prose,
                    of which six volumes have already appeared. They display great research, and are
                    written in a graceful and agreeable style. Palma is a member of the Spanish
                    Academy, a distinction shared, among Peruvian poets, with Felipe Pardo. The
                    collected poems of Llona have recently been published; his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canto de la Vida</hi> is highly spoken of for its depth of thought and elegance
                    of diction.</p>
                <p>Peruvians have not neglected their early history and the study of the literature
                    and language of the Yncas. Several have followed in the footsteps of Rivero.
                    José Sebastian Barranca, the naturalist and antiquary, and Gavino Pacheco
                    Zegarra, a native of Cuzco, have published translations of the ancient Ynca
                    drama of <hi rend="italic">Ollantay.</hi></p>
                <p>Among Peruvian naturalists since the independence the most distinguished have
                    been Rivero, the geologist and mineralogist, and his friend and colleague
                    Nicolas de Pierola, author of <hi rend="italic">Memorial de Ciencias</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Naturales.</hi> Dr Cayetano Heredia, rector of the college of
                    medicine in Lima from 1845 to his death in 1861, was an ardent patron of medical
                    science. His successor, Dr Miguel de los Rios, has followed in his footsteps;
                    and since 1856 many valuable contributions have been published by Peruvian
                    physicians in the <hi rend="italic">Gaeeta</hi><hi rend="italic">Medica</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Linιa.</hi></p>
                <p>The most prominent publicists of Peru have been Mariategui, Vijil, Reynaldo and
                    Cesareo Chacal tana, Ricardo Heredia, José Casimiro Ulloa, Toribio Pacheco, and
                    Luciano Cisneros.</p>
                <p>The Peruvian priesthood, though justly accused of tyranny in their relations with
                    the Indians in early times, and of immorality in many instances, can point to
                    numerous learned and upright prelates, to devoted parish priests, to
                    noble-minded teachers and ardent patriots, in their body. Founded in 1541, and
                    raised to archiépiscopal rank in 1545, the see of Lima has been ruled by
                    twenty-three prelates. The first was a Dominican friar, Dr Geronimo de Loaysa
                    (1542-1575), who was more a politician than a priest. But the second, Dr Toribio
                    Mogrovejo (1581-1606), devoted himself to the welfare of his flock, and died in
                    the odour of sanctity, being finally canonized as St Toribio. Since the
                    independence, Archbishop Luna Pizarro has added lustre to the see by his
                    learning and ability. The bishopric of Cuzco was founded by Pope Paul HI. in
                    1537, and has had twenty-seven prelates. Among them, Dr Gorrichategui (1771-76)
                    was an excellent Quichua scholar and preacher and a devoted friend of the
                    oppressed Indians; Dr Moscoso y Peralta (1777-89) was a prelate of consummate
                    virtue and learning. The bishoprics of Arequipa, Guamanga (Ayacucho), and
                    Truxillo λvere created in 1609. The missionary bishopric of Maynas or
                    Chachapoyas was founded in 1802, those of Huanuco and Puno in recent times. The
                    Jesuits were once very powerful and wealthy in Peru, and both Jesuits and
                    Franciscans, while working at their calling as missionaries, achieved much
                    valuable geographical work on the rivers and in the forests of the montaña.
                    Since the independence the religious orders have been gradually suppressed, yet
                    monks as well as priests were in the front rank in advocating the cause of
                    liberty. The ecclesiastical seminary at Lima, founded by St Toribio in 1601, was
                    removed to part of the monastery of San Francisco in 1859, where it still
                    flourishes, and where youths intended for holy orders are educated. The priests
                    occupy a very important position in the social system, and much of the teaching
                    is in their hands. Such men as Luna Pizarro and Vijil have performed their
                    duties in a singularly faithful and enlightened spirit. Unfortunately there is
                    still deplorable laxity among parish priests, though there are many noble
                    exceptions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Inhabitants.—</hi> The early inhabitants of Peru originally
                    consisted of several distinct nations, subdivided into many tribes, which were
                    eventually combined in the empire of the Yncas. The principal race was that of
                    the imperial Yncas themselves, inhabiting the two central sections of the
                    sierra, from the Knot of Cerro Pasco to that of Vilcañota, a distance of 380
                    miles. Here nature has worked on her grandest and most imposing scale. The
                    scenery is magnificent, the products of every zone are collected in the valleys
                    and on the mountain-sides; but the difficulties in the way of advancing
                    civilization, caused by the obstacles of nature, are such as to tax man’s
                    ingenuity to the utmost. A country like this was well adapted for the cradle of
                    an imperial race. Six nations originally peopled this central
                    mountain-region—the Yncas in the valley of the Vilcamayu and surrounding
                    plateaus, the Canas round the sources of the Apurimac, the Quichuas along the
                    upper courses of the Pachachaca and the Apurimac, the Chancas, a very warlike
                    people, from Guamanga to the Apurimac, the Huancas in the valley of the Xauxa,
                    and the Rucanas round the summits and on the slopes of the Maritime Cordillera.
                    These six nations were divided into “ayllus” or tribes, the most distinct of
                    which were the still famous Morochucos and Yquichanos, brave mountaineers of the
                    Chanca nation. There are reasons for believing that these nations once spoke
                    different languages, especially the Chancas, but, excepting a few words imbedded
                    in the general language of the Yncas, they are now lost.</p>
                <p>In the basin of Lake Titicaca there was another race, anciently called Colla, but
                    now better known as Aymara. Their language survives, and, though closely allied
                    grammatically, the vocabulary differs from that of the Yncas. Within the Colla
                    region, but differing from the rest of the inhabitants both in language and
                    physical appearance, there was a savage tribe called Urus, inhabiting the
                    reed-beds and islands in the southern part of Lake Titicaca. In the region north
                    of the Knot of Cerro Pasco comprising the basin of the Marañon there were many
                    warlike tribes speaking a language which the Yncas called Chinchaysuyu. The most
                    important of these tribes were the Conchucos, Huamachucos, and Ayahuecas far to
                    the north.</p>
                <p>The Peruvian coast appears originally to have been inhabited by a diminutive race
                    of fishermen called Changos, a gentle and hospitable people, never exceeding 5
                    feet in height, with flat noses. They fished in boats made of inflated
                    seal-skins, lived in seal-skin huts, and slept on heaps of dried seaweed.
                    Vestiges of this early race may be traced in the far south, as well as at Eten,
                    Morrope, and Catacaos in the north. The later and more civilized coastpeople
                    were a very different and an extremely interesting race. They appear to have
                    formed distinct communities in the different valleys each under a chief, of whom
                    the most civilized and powerful was the Chimu, who ruled over the five valleys
                    of Pativilca, Huarmey, Santa, Viru, and Moche, where Truxillo now stands. The
                    subjects of this prince made great advances in civilization, and his vast
                    palaces near Truxillo now form extensive ruins. The irrigation works of this
                    coast-people were most elaborate; every acre of cultivable ground was brought
                    under cultivation, and water was conveyed at high levels from great distances.
                    The Yncas called these people Yuncas, but they have entirely passed away, giving
                    place to the negroes and Chinese labourers who now swarm in the coastvalleys.
                    There is no dictionary of the Yunca language, but there is a grammar and a short
                    list of words written in 1644, before it had entirely ceased to be spoken.</p>
                <p>The Ynca or Quichua tribes of the Andes of Peru average a height of 5 feet to 5
                    feet 6 inches. They are of slender build, but with well-knit muscular frames,
                    and are capable of enduring great fatigue. Their complexions are of a fresh
                    olive-colour, skin very smooth and soft, beardless, hair straight and black, the
                    nose aquiline. They are good cultivators, and excel as shepherds by reason of
                    their patience and kindness to animals. They are naturally gentle, most
                    affectionate to their families, with an intense love of home; but at the same
                    time they are enduring and brave. The Aymaras are more thick-set than the Yncas,
                    and their chief phy <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n708/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0708-0677"/> sical peculiarity is that the thigh, instead of
                    being longer, is rather shorter than the leg. The whole build is admirably
                    adapted for mountain-climbing.</p>
                <p>The policy of the Yncas was to enforce the use of their language, called by the
                    earliest Spanish grammarian “Quichua,” among all the conquered tribes. Hence its
                    very general use throughout the mountainous part of Peru, the only differences
                    being the survival of words in some of the districts from the language or
                    dialect that was superseded. Quichua was the language of a people far advanced
                    in civilization; it was assiduously cultivated by learned men for several
                    centuries; not only songs but elaborate dramas and rituals were composed in it;
                    and it is still the language of the majority of the people of Peru. Aymara,
                    which is a closelý-allied tongue, is spoken along the shores of Lake
                    Titicaca.</p>
                <p>The wild Indians of the montaña, except a few tribes on the skirts of the Andes,
                    do not belong to the Peruvian family. They are part of the great Tupi group of
                    nations, and belong to the region of the Amazons. On the banks of the Huallaga
                    are the Cocomas, Cholones, Panos, and Motilones; and on the Ucayali the wild
                    tribes of the Cashibos, Capahuanas, Remos, Amajuacas, and Mayorunas. The
                    Conibos, Pirros, Sencis, Setebos, and Shipibos are peaceful traders. The Antis
                    or Campas form a large and important tribe on the upper course of the Ucayali,
                    with probably a large share of Ynca blood in their veins. The savage Indians on
                    the tributaries of the Beni are called Chunchos. It is, however, to another
                    family of the American race that the tribes of the Amazons mainly belong.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Cyclopean ruins of vast edifices, apparently
                    never completed, exist at Tiahuanaco near the southern shore of Lake Titicaca.
                    Remains of a similar character are found at Huaraz in the north of Peru, and at
                    Cuzco, Ollantay - tambo, and Huiñaque between Huaraz and Tiahuanaco. These works
                    appear to have been erected by powerful sovereigns with unlimited command of
                    labour, possibly with the object of giving employment to subjugated people,
                    while feeding the vanity or pleasing the taste of the conqueror. Their
                    unfinished state seems to indicate the break-up of the Government which
                    conceived them and which must have held sway over the whole of Peru, and the
                    occurrence of Aymara words, especially in the names of places over the whole
                    area, points to an Aymara origin for this lost and prehistoric empire. It is
                    certain that for ages afterwards the country was again broken up into many
                    separate nations and tribes. Then the most civilized and most powerful people,
                    the Yncas of Cuzco and the Vilcamayu, began slowly to build up and cement
                    together a later and more civilized empire. This great work, which probably
                    occupied five centuries, was just completed when the Spaniards discovered Peru.
                    The history of Ynca civilization has yet to be written. Oui’ knowledge even of
                    the Spanish writers who collected information at the time of the conquest is
                    still very incomplete. Much that is essential for a correct appreciation of this
                    interesting subject is still inedited and in manuscript. But, to comprehend it,
                    a knowledge is also necessary of the people, of their country and languages.
                    Without such qualifications for the task, the numerous traditions, customs, and
                    beliefs cannot be understood nor assigned to the particular epochs and
                    nationalities to which each belonged. With our existing imperfect knowledge the
                    subject cannot be adequately treated without a detailed and critical examination
                    of conflicting evidence which would be foreign to the purpose of the present
                    article.</p>
                <p>The great Ynca Huayna Ccapac died in 1527, the year when Pizarro first appeared
                    on the coast. His consolidated empire extended from the river Ancasmayu north of
                    Quito to the river Maule in the south of Chili. The Yncas had an elaborate
                    system of state-worship, with a ritual, and frequently recurring festivals.
                    History and tradition were preserved by the bards, and dramas were enacted
                    before the sovereign and his court. Roads with posthouses at intervals were made
                    over the wildest mountain-ranges and the bleakest deserts for hundreds of miles.
                    A well-considered system of land-tenure and of colonization provided for the
                    wants of all classes of the people. The administrative details of government
                    were minutely and carefully organized, and accurate statistics were kept by
                    means of the “quipus” or system of knots. The edifices displayed marvellous
                    building skill, and their workmanship is unsurpassed. The world has nothing to
                    show, in the way of stonecutting and fitting, to equal the skill and accuracy
                    displayed in the Ynca structures of Cuzco. As workers in metals and as potters
                    they displayed infinite variety of design, though not of a high order, while as
                    cultivators and engineers they in all respects excelled their European
                    conquerors.</p>
                <p>The story of the conquest has been told by Prescott and Helps, who give ample
                    references to original authorities; it will be sufficient here to enumerate the
                    dates of the leading events. On 10th March 1526 the contract for the conquest of
                    Peru was signed by Almagro and Luque, Gaspar de Espinosa supplying the funds. In
                    1527 Francisco Pizarro, after enduring fearful hardships, first reached the
                    coast of Peru at Tumbez. In the following year he went to Spain, and on 26th
                    July 1529 the capitulation with the crown for the conquest of Peru was executed.
                    Pizarro sailed from San Lucar with his brothers in January 1530, and landed at
                    Tumbez in 1532. The civil war between Huascar and Atahualpa, the sons of Huayna
                    Ccapac, had been fought out in the meanwhile, and the victorious Atahualpa was
                    at Caxamarca on his way from Quito to Cuzco. On 15th November 1532 Francisco
                    Pizarro with his little army entered Caxamarca and in February 1533 his
                    colleague Almagro arrived with reinforcements. The murder of the Ynca Atahualpa
                    was perpetrated on 29th August 1533, and on 15th November Pizarro entered Cuzco.
                    He allowed the rightful heir to the empire, Manco the legitimate son of Huayna
                    Ccapac, to be solemnly crowned on 24th March 1534. Almagro then undertook an
                    expedition to Chili, and Pizarro founded the city of Lima on 18th January 1535.
                    In the following year the Yncas made a brave attempt to expel the invaders, and
                    closely besieged the Spaniards in Cuzco during February and March. But Almagro,
                    returning from Chili, raised the siege on 18th April 1537. Immediately
                    afterwards the dispute arose between the Pizarros and Almagro as to the limits
                    of their respective jurisdictions. An interview took place at Mala, on the
                    sea-coast, on 13th November 1537, which led to no result, and Almagro was
                    finally defeated in the battle of Las Salinas near Cuzco on 26th April 1538. His
                    execution followed. His adherents recognized his young half-caste son, a gallant
                    and noble youth generally known as Almagro the Lad, as his successor. Bitterly
                    discontented, they conspired at Lima and assassinated Pizarro on 26th June 1541.
                    Meanwhile Vaca de Castro had been sent out by the emperor, and on hearing of the
                    murder of Pizarro he assumed the title of governor of Peru. On 16th September
                    1542 he defeated the army of Almagro the Lad in the battle of Chupas near
                    Guamanga. The ill-fated boy was beheaded at Cuzco.</p>
                <p>Charles V. enacted the code known as the “New Laws” in 1542. “Encomiendas,” or
                    grants of estates on which the inhabitants were bound to pay tribute and give
                    personal service to the grantee, were to pass to the crown on the death of the
                    actual holder; a fixed sum was to be assessed as tribute; and forced personal
                    service was forbidden. Blasco Nunez de Vela was sent out, as first viceroy of
                    Peru, to enforce the “New Laws.” Their promulgation aroused a storm among the
                    conquerors. Gonzalo Pizarro rose in rebellion, and entered Lima on 28th October
                    1544. The viceroy fled to Quito, but was followed, defeated, and killed at the
                    battle of Anaquito on 18th January 1546. The “New Laws” were weakly revoked, and
                    Pedro de la Gasca, as first president of the Audiencia (court of justice) of
                    Peru, was sent out to restore order. He arrived in 1547, and on 8th April 1548
                    he routed the followers of Gonzalo Pizarro on the plain of Xaquixaguana near
                    Cuzco. Gonzalo was executed on the field. La Gasca made a redistribution of
                    “encomiendas” to the loyal conquerors, which caused great discontent, and left
                    Peru before his scheme was made public in January 1550. Ou 23d September 1551
                    Don Antonio de Mendoza arrived as second viceroy, but died at Lima in the
                    following July. The country was then ruled by the judges of the Audiencia, and a
                    formidable insurrection broke out, headed by Fraucisco Hernandez Giron, with the
                    object of maintaining the right of the conquerors to exact forced service from
                    the Indians. In May 1554 Giron defeated the army of the judges at Chuquinga, but
                    he was hopelessly routed at Pucara on 11th October 1554, captured, and on 7th
                    December executed at Lima. Don Andres Hurtado de Mendoza, marquis of Cañete,
                    entered Lima as third viceroy of Peru on 6th July 1555, and ruled with an iron
                    hand for six years. He at length brought the turbulent conquerors to their
                    knees. All the leaders in former disturbances were put on board a ship at Callao
                    and sent to Spain. Corregidors, or governors of districts, were ordered to try
                    summarily and execute every turbulent person within their jurisdictions. All
                    unemployed persons were sent on distant expeditions, and moderate “encomiendas”
                    were granted to a few deserving officers. The previous anarchy was thus
                    completely stamped out. At the same time the viceroy wisely came to an agreement
                    with Sayri Tupac, the son and successor of the Ynca Manco, and granted him a
                    pension. He took great care to supply the natives with priests of good conduct,
                    and promoted measures for the establishment of schools and the foundation of
                    towns in the different provinces. The cultivation of wheat, vines, and olives,
                    and European domestic animals were introduced. The next viceroy was the Conde de
                    Nieva (1561-64). His successor, the licentiate Lope Garcia de Castro, who only
                    had the title of governor, ruled from 1564 to 1569. From this time there was a
                    succession of viceroys until 1824. The viceroys were chief magistrates, but they
                    were not supreme. In legal matters they had to consult the Audiencia of judges,
                    in finance the Tribunal de Cuentas, in other branches of administration the
                    Juntas de Gobierno and de Guerra.</p>
                <p>Don Francisco de Toledo, the second son of the count of Oropesa, entered Lima as
                    viceroy on 26th November 1569. Fearing that the little court of the Ynca Tupac
                    Amaru (who had succeeded his brother Sayri Tupac) might become a formidable
                    focus of rebellion, he sent troops to seize the young prince, and unjustly
                    beheaded the last of the Yncas in the square of Cuzco in the year 1571. After a
                    minute personal inspection of every province in Peru, he, with the experienced
                    aid of the learned Polo de Ondegardo <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n709/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0709-0678"/> and the judge Matienza, established the system
                    under which the native population of Peru was ruled for the two succeeding
                    centuries; and future viceroys referred to him as the great master of
                    statesmanship who was their guide, and to his ordinances as their acknowledged
                    text-book. His <hi rend="italic">Libro</hi><hi rend="italic">de Tasos</hi> fixed
                    the tribute to be paid by the Indians, exempting all men under eighteen and over
                    fifty. He found it necessary, in order to secure efficient government, to revert
                    in some measure to the system of the Yncas. The people were to be directly
                    governed by their native chiefs, whose duty was to collect the tribute and
                    exercise magisterial functions. The chiefs or “curacas” had subordinate native
                    officials under them called “pichca-pachacas” over 500 men, and “pachacas” over
                    100 men. The office of curaca (or “cacique ”) was made hereditary, and its
                    possessor enjoyed several privileges. Many curacas were descended from the
                    imperial family of the Yncas, or from great nobles of the Yncarial court. In
                    addition to the tribute, which was in accordance with native usage, there was
                    the “mita,” or forced labour in mines, farms, and manufactories. Toledo enacted
                    that one-seventh of the male population of a village should be subject to
                    conscription for this service, but they were to be paid, and were not to be
                    taken beyond a specified distance from their homes.</p>
                <p>In their legislation the Spanish kings and viceroys showed a desire to protect
                    the people from tyranny, but they were unable to prevent the rapacity and
                    laλvlessness of distant officials. The country was depopulated by the illegal
                    methods of enforcing the mita, and an air of sadness and desolation spread over
                    the land. Toledo was succeeded in 1581 by Don Martin Henriquez, who died at Lima
                    two years afterwards. The subsequent history of the viceroyalty is well worthy
                    of detailed attention by students of history in all countries possessing a
                    colonial empire. The Spanish colonies suffered from the strict system of
                    monopoly and protection, which was only slightly relaxed by the later Bourbon
                    kings, and from the arbitrary proceedings of the Inquisition. Between 1581 and
                    1776 as many as fifty-nine heretics were burned at Lima, and there were
                    twenty-nine “autos,” but the Inquisition affected Europeans rather than natives,
                    for the Indians, as catechumens, were exempted from its terrors. The curacas
                    sorrowfully watched the gradual extinction of their people by the operation of
                    the mita, protesting from time to time against the exactions and cruelty of the
                    Spaniards. Λt length a descendant of the Yncas, who assumed the name of Tupac
                    Amaru, rose in rebellion in 1780. The insurrection lasted until July 1783, and
                    the cruel executions which followed its suppression failed to daunt the people.
                    The death of Tupac Amaru shook the power of Spain and made it totter to its
                    fall. From that time both Indians and Peruvians of Spanish descent began to
                    think for themselves, and to entertain ideas of liberty and progress. Tupac
                    Amaru was followed by Dr Pedro José Chavez de la Rosa, the Spanish bishop of
                    Arequipa, and Dr Toribio Rodriguez de Mendoza, rector of the university of San
                    Carlos at Lima, whose pupils, among whom were the future republican statesmen
                    Drs Luna Pizarro and Vijil, became ardent advocates of reform. When, on 3d
                    August 1814, Mateo Garcia Pumacagua, a Peruvian chief, raised the cry of
                    independence at Cuzco, he was joined by many Peruvians of Spanish descent, but
                    was defeated in the battle of Umachiri (12th March 1815), taken, and executed.
                    At the same time the youthful and enthusiastic poet Melgar suffered death in the
                    cause of his country.</p>
                <p>Peru was the centre of Spanish power, and the viceroy had his military strength
                    concentrated at Lima. Consequently the more distant provinces, such as Chili and
                    Buenos Ayres, were able to throw off the yoke first. But the destruction of the
                    viceroy’s power was essential to their continued independent existence. The
                    conquest of the Peruvian coast must always depend on the command of the sea. A
                    fleet of armed ships was fitted out at Valparaiso in Chili, under the command of
                    Lord Cochrane and officered by Englishmen. It convoyed an army of Argentine
                    troops, with some Chilians, under the command of the Argentine general San
                    Martin, which landed on the coast of Peru in September 1820. San Martin was
                    enthusiastically received, and the independence of Peru was proclaimed at Lima
                    on his entrance, after the viceroy had withdrawn (28th July 1821). On 20th
                    September 1822 San Martin resigned the protectorate, with which he had been
                    invested, saying that the “presence of a fortunate soldier is dangerous to a
                    newly-constituted state,” and on the same day the first congress of Peru became
                    the sovereign power of the state. After a short period of government by a
                    committee of three, the congress elected Don José de la Riva Aguero to be first
                    president of Peru on 26th February 1823. He displayed great energy and capacity
                    as an administrator, but the aid of the Colombians under Bolivar was sought, and
                    the native ruler was unwisely deposed. Bolivar arrived at Lima on 1st September
                    1823, and began to organize an army to attack the Spanish viceroy in the
                    interior. On 6th August 1824 the cavalry action of Junin was fought with the
                    Spanish general Canterac near the shores of the lake of Chinchay-cocha. It was
                    Avon by a gallant charge of the Peruvians under Colonel Suarez at the critical
                    moment. Soon afterwards Bolivar left the army to proceed to the coast, and the
                    final battle of Ayacucho (9th December 1824) with the viceroy and the whole
                    Spanish power was fought by his second in command, General Sucre. The Spaniards
                    were completely defeated. The viceroy and all his officers were taken prisoners,
                    and Spanish power in Peru came to an end.</p>
                <p>General Bolivar now showed that he was actuated by personal ambition; he
                    intrigued to impose a constitution on Peru, with himself as president for life.
                    He failed, and left the country on 3d September 1826, followed by all the
                    Colombian troops in March 1827. General Lamar, who commanded the Peruvians at
                    Ayacucho, was elected president of Peru on 24th August 1827, but was deposed,
                    after waging a brief but disastrous war with Colombia, on 7th June 1829. General
                    Gamarra, who had been in the Spanish service, and was chief of the staff in the
                    patriot army at Ayacucho, was elected third president on 31st August 1829.</p>
                <p>For fifteen years, from 1829 to 1844, Peru was painfully feeling her way to a
                    right use of independence. The officers who fought at Ayacucho, and to whom the
                    country felt natural gratitude, were all-powerful, and they had not learned to
                    settle political differences in any other way than by the sword. From 1837 to
                    1839 there was a lawless and unprincipled intervention on the part of Chili
                    which increased the confusion. Three men, during that period of probation, won a
                    prominent place in their country’s history, Generals Gamarra, Salaverry, and
                    Santa Cruz. Gamarra, born at Cuzco in 1785, never accommodated himself to
                    constitutional usages; too often he made his own will the law; but he attached
                    to himself many loyal and devoted friends, and, with all his faults, which were
                    mainly faults of ignorance, he loved his country and sought its welfare
                    according to his lights. Salaverry was a very different character. Born at Lima
                    in 1806, of pure Basque descent, he joined the patriot army before he was
                    fifteen and displayed his audacious valour in many a hard-fought battle. Feeling
                    strongly the necessity that Peru had for repose, and the guilt of civil
                    dissension, he wrote patriotic poems which became very popular. Yet he too could
                    only see a remedy in violence. He seized the supreme power, and perished by an
                    iniquitous sentence on 18th February 1836.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    ability and for nearly three years (1836-39) realized his lifelong dream of a

                    history is not confined to the hostilities of these military rulers. Three
                    constitutions were framed, in 1828, 1833, and 1839. There were lawyers,
                    statesmen, and orators who could defend the rights and liberties of the people.
                    On 7th November 1832 Dr Vijil, the deputy for Tacna, rose in his place in
                    congress and denounced the unconstitutional acts of President Gamarra in a
                    memorable speech of great eloquence. Nor should a much humbler name ever be
                    omitted in writing the history of republican Peru. Juan Rios, a private soldier,
                    was sentry at the door of congress when Gamarra illegally sent his troops to
                    disperse the members. He defended his post against two companies, and fell
                    mortally wounded.</p>
                <p>In 1844 General Ramon Castilla restored peace to Peru, and was elected
                    constitutional president on 20th April 1845. Ten years of peace and increasing
                    prosperity followed. In 1849 the regular payment of the interest of the public
                    debt was commenced, steam communication was established along the Pacific coast,
                    and a railroad was made from Lima to Callao. After a regular term of office of
                    six years of peace and moral and material progress Castilla resigned, and
                    General Echenique was elected president. But the proceedings of Echenique’s
                    government in connexion with the consolidation of the internal debt were
                    disapproved by the nation, and, after hostilities which lasted for six months,
                    Castilla returned to power in January 1855. From December 1856 to March 1858 he
                    had to contend with and subdue a local insurrection headed by General Vivanco,
                    but, with these two exceptions, there was peace in Pera from 1844 to 1879, a
                    period of thirty-five years. The existing constitution was framed in 1856, and
                    revised by a commission in 1860. Slavery and the Indian tribute were abolished;
                    by its provisions the president is elected for four years, and there are two
                    vice-presidents. The congress consists of a senate and chamber of deputies. The
                    senators are elected by departments and the deputies by the people, every 30,000
                    inhabitants having a representative. When congress is not sitting there is a
                    permanent commission of the legislature, elected at the end of each session, and
                    consisting of seven senators and eight deputies. The chamber of deputies may
                    accuse the president of infractions of the constitution and the senate passes
                    judgment. The president appoints the prefects of departments and sub-prefects of
                    provinces; the prefects nominate the governors of districts. In each province
                    there is a judge; a superior court of justice sits at the capital of each
                    department; and there is <pb break="no"

                    retired at the end of his term of office in 1862, and died in 1868. On 2d August
                    1868 Colonel Balta was elected president. Before his time the public debt had
                    been moderate, amounting to £4,491,042, and the interest had been regularly paid
                    since 1849. But Balta’s government increased it to £49,000,000, the payment of
                    the interest of which from the ordinary revenues was simply impossible. The
                    creditors, as security, had the whole of the guano and nitrate deposits assigned
                    to them. With the vast sum thus raised President Balta commenced the execution
                    of public works, principally railroads on a gigantic scale. His period of office
                    was signalized by the opening of an international exhibition at Lima. He was
                    succeeded (2d August 1872) by Don Manuel Pardo, an honest and enlightened
                    statesman, who did all in his power to retrieve the country from the financial
                    difficulty into which it had been brought by the reckless policy of his
                    predecessor, but the conditions were not capable of solution. He regulated the
                    Chinese immigration to the coast-valleys, which, from 1860 to 1872, had amounted
                    to 58,606. He paid great attention to statistics, promoted the advance of
                    education, and encouraged literature. He was the best president Peru has ever
                    known, and his death in 1878 was a public calamity. On 2d August 1876 General
                    Prado was elected, and his term of office saw the commencement of that calamity
                    which has since overwhelmed his country.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>On 5th April 1879 the republic of Chili declared war upon Peru, the alleged
                    pretext being that Peru had made an offensive treaty, directed against Chili,
                    with Bolivia, a country with which Chili had a dispute; but the publication of
                    the text of this treaty made known the fact that it was strictly defensive and
                    contained no just cause of war. The true object of Chili was the conquest of the
                    rich Peruvian province of Tarapaca, the appropriation of its valuable guano and
                    nitrate deposits, and the spoliation of the rest of the Peruvian coast.</p>
                <p>After the capture of the “Huascar” off Point Angamos on 8th October 1879 by two
                    Chilian ironclads and four other vessels, the Peruvian coast was at the mercy of
                    the invaders, and Tarapaca, surrounded by trackless deserts, yet open to the
                    sea, though bravely defended for some time by the Peruvian army, fell into the
                    hands of the enemy after the hotly-contested battle of Tarapaca on 17th November
                    1879.</p>
                <p>Chili then landed an army farther north, and on 26th May 1880 the battle of Tacna
                    was fought, followed by the capture of the port of Arica on 7th June. In these
                    combats the Peruvians lost 147 officers alone. The possession of the sea enabled
                    the Chilian ships to desolate the whole coast; and, the Peruvian army having
                    been almost annihilated, only a force of volunteers and raw recruits could be
                    assembled for the defence of the capital. After the two desperately-contested
                    battles of Chorrillos and Miraflores on the 13th and 15th of January 1881, Lima
                    was entered on the 17th, and was not evacuated by the invaders until 22d October
                    1883. During that period General Caceres, the hero of the defence, carried on a
                    gallant but unequal struggle in the sierra. At last a provisional Government,
                    under General Iglesias, signed a treaty with the Chilians on 20th October 1883,
                    by which the province of Tarapaca was ceded to the conquerors, Tacna and Arica
                    were to be occupied by the Chilians for ten years, and then a vote by
                    plebiscitum is to decide whether they are to belong to Peru or Chili; and there
                    are clauses respecting the sales of guano; while all rights to the nitrate
                    deposits, which are hypothecated to the creditors of Peru, have been
                    appropriated by the Chilian conquerors. This most disastrous war has brought
                    ruin and misery on the country, and has thrown Peru back for many years. The
                    country contains the elements of recovery, but it will be a work of time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bibliography.—</hi> The history of Ynca civilization is to be
                    found in works contemporaneous with the conquest or written in the succeeding
                    century, in the native literature, and in the modern descriptions of ruins and
                    other remains. The highest authority is Pedro de Cieza de Leon, whose <hi
                    rend="italic">Chronicle,</hi> which bears the stamp of impartiality, accuracy,
                    and intelligence, was written within twenty years of the conquest (Eng. tr. of
                    parts i. and ii. by the Hakluyt Society, 1864, 1883). The valuable writings of
                    the learned lawyer Polo de Ondegardo, which discuss the polity and
                    administrative rule of the Yncas, have been edited in Spanish, and one of his
                    interesting reports has been translated and issued by the Hakluyt Society.
                    Cristoval de Molina, the priest of the hospital of Cuzco, lias described the
                    rites, ceremonies, and ritual of the Yncas in great detail; he wrote in 1580,
                    but his manuscript was not translated and issued (by the Hakluyt Society) until
                    1873. It has since been ably edited in Spanish, at Madrid. Miguel Balboa, who
                    was in the country from 1566 to 1586, wrote an excellent historical work, which
                    is translated into French in the series of Μ. Temaux Coinpans. The <hi

                    is a work of considerable repute, first published in 1590. An English version,
                    which originally appeared in 1604, was reprinted and edited for the Hakluyt
                    Society in 1880. The famous commentaries of Garcilasso de la Vega were published
                    in 1609; and the first part, relating to the Yncas, was translated and issued by
                    the Hakluyt Society in 1869. The <hi rend="italic">Suma</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    valuable of the earlier authorities, as the author was an excellent scholar,
                    well acquainted with the Ynca language, and a citizen of Cuzco. But most of his
                    work is lost. The remainder was edited in Spanish by Señor Espada in 1880. The
                    works of Avila, Arriaga, and Ramos give accounts of local superstitions and
                    beliefs soon after the conquest. In the 17th century valuable labours on Ynca
                    history were given out by Fernando Montesinos, whose work was translated into
                    French in the Ternaux Compans edition, and by a native named Juan de Santa Cruz
                    Salcamayhua. The latter curious narrative has been edited in Spanish recently,
                    and issued in a translated form by the Hakluyt Society. General accounts of Ynca
                    civilization have been written by Robertson, Prescott, and Helps, none of whom,
                    however, were acquainted with more than a portion of these authorities, or with
                    the native languages, and none had been in the country. A valuable modern work
                    on Peruvian antiquities is the <hi rend="italic">Antiguedades Peruanas,</hi> by
                    Don Mariano Rivero, published at&lt;Vienna in 1851, and translated into English
                    at New York. Markham’s <hi rend="italic">Cuzco and Lima</hi> (1855) contains the
                    results of a personal visit to the coast and to the ruins in and round Cuzco.
                    D’Orbigny has described the ruins near Lake Titicaca; but the best modern work
                    treating of architectural remains throughout Peru, as they may be seen now, is
                    E. G. Squier’s <hi rend="italic">Peru</hi> (1877). <hi rend="italic">Pérou et

                    and literature of the Yncas have been treated of by Rivero, who gives a list of
                    earlier grammars and vocabularies; in the Quichua grammar and dictionary, and
                    the translation of the drama of <hi rend="italic">ollantay,i&gt;y</hi> Markham;

                <p>The career of Pizarro and the conquest of Peru are recounted in the general
                    histories of Herrera and Gomara, and in Garcilasso de la Vega (part ii.). The
                    best accounts of the first part of the conquest are by Francisco de Xeres, the
                    conqueror’s secretary, and by Hernando Pizarro. Both have been translated into
                    English and issued by the Hakluyt Society. The narrative of Pedro Pizarro has
                    only recently been edited at Madrid, and, as the author was one of the
                    conquerors and an eye-witness, it is very important. Agustin de Zarate, who was
                    employed in Peru very soon after the conquest, wrote a history which is
                    valuable, especially the latter portion relating to events of which he was an
                    eye-witness. The history of the Quito war by Cieza de Leon remained in
                    manuscript until 1877, when it was admirably edited by Señor Espada. These
                    authorities (excepting the last) were made use of by Robertson, Prescott, and
                    Helps. But none of the three brings the narrative down to the conclusion of the
                    civil wars in Peru and the settlement of the country. An account of the last
                    rebellion, led by Francisco Hernandez Giron, and of the final settlement, is
                    given by the Palencian Diego Fernandez in his history of Peru (Seville, 1571).
                    There is no translation of this work. There is no history of the colonial
                    period; there are, however, abundant materials for it in the laws and
                    ordinances, in the detailed reports of successive viceroys, in the histories of
                    religious orders, and in innumerable memoirs, biographies, and reports both
                    printed and in manuscript. Stevenson, in his narrative (3 vols., 1823), gives
                    some account of the last years of viceregal government. A mass of documents
                    relating to the great rebellion of the Ynca Tupac Amaru was published by Don
                    Pedro de Angelis at Buenos Ayres in 1836. The work of Don Gregorio Funes, dean
                    of Cordova, published in 1817, contains further information, and the diary of
                    the governor of La Paz, while besieged by the Indians, will be found in Temple’s

                    by Markham. The events which led to the final achievement of Peruvian
                    independence have been traced out in an interesting work by Don Benjamin Vicuña
                    Mackenna, entitled <hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de la Independencia del Peru,</hi> 1809-1819 (Lima, 1860). The
                    events of the war of independence are narrated by the Spaniards Garcia Camba and
                    Terrazas, and in English in the charming <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of General

                    volumes published in 1858 and signed “Pruvonena," in the lives of Lamar by
                    Villaran, of Salaverry by Bilbao, and in the history of the campaign of Yungay
                    by Placencia. The works of Colonel Espinosa, especially his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diccionario Repub-licano,</hi> and of Dr Vijil are also important. Histories of
                    the war between Peru and Chili have been hurriedly published by two Chilians,
                    Diego Barros Arana and Vicuña Mackenna. The former is a mere partisan production
                    of no value as a history. The latter, though prejudiced, is honestly written,
                    and is useful as containing many original documents. Another history will be
                    written by Paz Soldan; and meanwhile narratives have been published in English
                    by Markham, and in Italian by Caivano.</p>
                <p>The most valuable geographical and topographical works on Peru are by Peruvians,
                    including the writings of Cosme Bueno and Unanue, articles in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mercurio Peruano,</hi> and the works already mentioned of Dr Paz
                    Soldan. Some papers by Haenke, Miller, Bollaert, Raimondi, Pentland, and Markham
                    will be found in the <hi rend="italic">Journals</hi> of the Royal Geographical
                    Society. But the most important of all is the great official work by Don Antonio
                    Raimondi, three volumes of which have already appeared, besides the same
                    author’s geographical account of the department of Ancachs. The natural history
                    of Peru has been described in the German works of Dr Von Tschudi, and briefly in
                    the English translation of his travels (1847). The first great work on Peruvian
                    botany was the <hi rend="italic">Flora Peruviana</hi> by Riuz and Pavon,
                    followed by the <hi rend="italic">Chloris</hi><hi rend="italic">Andina of
                    Dr</hi> weddell, which forms two volumes of the great work of Castelnau. In his
                    <hi rend="italic">Quinologie</hi> weddell describes the quinine-yielding
                    chinchona trees of Peru and Bolivia, and further information on the chinchona
                    genus, as well as on coca cultivation, Cuzco maize, and quinoa, will be found in
                    Markham’s <hi rend="italic">Peruvian Bark</hi> (1880). Besides the works already
                    mentioned, Dr A. Smith published a book giving useful information respecting the
                    climate of Lima and other parts of Peru entitled <hi rend="italic">Peru as it
                    is</hi> (1839); and there are some other books of travel of no special value.
