                    >(Juncus).</hi> For all that, palms have always had great interest, not only for
                    botanists, but also for the general public, in the latter case by reason of the
                    historical and legendary interest connected with them no less than from their
                    beauty and economic value. The order <hi rend="italic">Palmaceae</hi> is
                    characterized among monocotyledonous plants by the presence of a stem very
                    frequently unbranched, and bearing a tuft of leaves at the extremity only, or
                    with the leaves scattered, these leaves, often gigantic in size, being usually
                    firm in texture and branching in a pinnate or palmate fashion. The flowers are
                    borne on simple or branching spikes, very generally protected by a spathe or
                    spathes, and each consists typically of a perianth of six greenish, somewhat
                    inconspicuous segments in two rows, with six stamens, a pistil of 1-3 carpels,
                    each with a single ovule and a succulent or dry fruit never dehiscent (figs. 1,
                    2). The seed consists almost exclusively of perisperm or albumen in a cavity in
                    which is lodged the relatively very minute embryo (fig. 3). These are the
                    general characteristics by which this very well-defined order may be
                    discriminated, but, in a group containing considerably more than a thousand
                    species, dispersed widely and at different elevations throughout the tropics of
                    both hemispheres, with stragglers in subtropical and even in warm temperate
                    regions, it may well be imagined that deviations from the general plan of
                    structure occur with some frequency. As the characteristic appearances of palms
                    depend to a large extent upon these modifications, some of the more important
                    among them may briefly be noticed.</p>
                <p>Taking the stem first, we may mention that it is in very many palms relatively
                    tall, erect, unbranched, regularly cylindrical, or dilated below so as to form
                    an elongated cone, either smooth, or covered with the projecting remnants of the
                    former leaves, or marked with circular scars indicating the position of those
                    leaves which have now fallen away. In other cases the stem is very slender,
                    short, erect, prostrate, or scandent by means of formidable hooked prickles
                    which, by enabling the plant to support itself on the branches of neighbouring
                    trees, also permit the stem to grow to a very great length and so to expose the
                    foliage to the light and air above the tree-tops of the dense forests these
                    palms grow in, as in the genus <hi rend="italic">Calamus.</hi> In some few
                    instances the trunk, or that portion of it which is above ground, is so short
                    that the plant is in a loose way called “stemless” or “acaulescent,” as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Geonoma,</hi> and as happens sometimes in the solitary species
                    found in a wild state in Europe, <hi rend="italic">Chamaerops</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">humilis.</hi> In many species the trunk is covered over with a
                    dense network of stiff fibres, often compacted together at the free ends into
                    spines. This fibrous material, which is so valuable for cordage, consists of the
                    fibrous tissue of the leaf-stalk, which in these cases persists after the decay
                    of the softer portions. It is very characteristic of some palms to produce from
                    the base of the stem a series of adventitious roots which gradually thrust
                    themselves into the soil and serve to steady the tree and prevent <pb break="no"

                    of some species, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Calamus,</hi>
                    is a rhizome, or root-stock, lengthening in a more or less horizontal manner by
                    the development of the terminal bud, and sending up lateral branches like
                    suckers from the root-stock, which form dense thickets of cane-like stems. The
                    branching of the stem above ground is unusual, except in the case of the Doum
                    Palm of Egypt <hi rend="italic">(Hyphsene</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi> and, when
                    present, is probably the result of some injury to the terminal bud at the top of
                    the stem, in consequence of which buds sprout out from below the apex.</p>
                <p>The internal structure of the stem does not differ fundamentally from that of a
                    typical mo nocotyledonous stem, the taller, harder trunks owing their hardness
                    not only to the fibrous or woody skeleton but also to the fact that, as growth
                    goes on, the originally soft cellular tissue through which the fibres run
                    becomes hardened by the deposit of woody matter within the cells, so that
                    ultimately the cellular portions become as hard as the woody fibrous matters
                    proper.</p>
                <p>The leaves of palms are either arranged at more or less distant intervals along
                    the stem, as in the canes <hi rend="italic">(Calamus,</hi> &lt;fcc.), or are
                    approximated in tufts at the end of the stem, thus forming those noble crowns of
                    foliage which are so closely associated with the general idea of a palm. In the
                    young condition, while still unfolded, these leaves, with the succulent end of
                    the stem from which they arise, form “the cabbage,” which in some species is
                    highly esteemed as an article of food.</p>
                <p>The adult leaf very generally presents a sheathing base tapering upwards into the
                    stalk or petiole, and this again bearing the lamina or blade. The sheath and the
                    petiole are very often provided with stout spines; and when, in course of time,
                    the upper parts of the leaf decay and fall off the base of the leaf-stalk and
                    sheath often remain, either entirely or in their fibrous portions only, which
                    latter constitute the investment to the stem already mentioned. In size the
                    leaves vary within very wide limits, some being only a few inches in extent,
                    while those of the noble <hi rend="italic">Caryota</hi> may be measured in tens
                    of feet. In form the leaves of palms are very rarely simple; usually they are
                    more or less divided, sometimes, as in <hi rend="italic">Caryota,</hi> extremely
                    so. In <hi rend="italic">Geonoma</hi><hi rend="italic">Verschaff</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">eltia,</hi> and some others, the leaf splits into two divisions at
                    the apex and not elsewhere; but more usually the leaves branch regularly in a
                    palmate fashion as in the fan-palms <hi rend="italic">Latania,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Chamaerops,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sabal,</hi> &lt;fcc., or in a
                    pinnate fashion as in <hi rend="italic">Areca, Kentia, Calamus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> ⅛lo,.</hi> The form of the segments is generally more
                    or less linear, but a very distinct appearance is given by the broad
                    wedge-shaped leaflets of such palms as <hi rend="italic">Caryota,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Martinezia,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Mauritia.</hi> These forms
                    run one into another by transitional gradations; and even in the same palm the
                    form of the leaf is often very different at different stages of its growth, so
                    that it is a difficult matter to name correctly seedling or juvenile palms in
                    the condition in which we generally meet with them in the nurseries, or even to
                    foresee what the future development of the plant is likely to be. Like the other
                    parts of the plant, the leaves are sometimes invested with hairs or spines; and,
                    in some instances,, as in the magnificent <hi rend="italic">Ceroxylon
                    andicola,</hi> the under surface is of a glaucous white or bluish colour.</p>
                <p>The inflorescence of palms consists generally of a fleshy spike like that of an
                    <hi rend="italic">Arum,</hi> either simple or much branched, studded with
                    numerous, sometimes extremely numerous, flowers, and enveloped by one or more
                    sheathing bracts called “spathes.” These parts may be small, or they may attain
                    relatively enormous dimensions, hanging down from amid the crown of foliage like
                    huge tresses, and adding greatly to the noble effect of the leaves.</p>
                <p>As to the individual flowers, they are usually small, greenish, and
                    insignificant; their general structure has beeh mentioned already. Modifications
                    from the typical structure arise from differences of texture, and specially from
                    suppression of parts, in consequence of which the flowers are very generally
                    unisexual (figs. 1, 2), though the flowers of the two sexes are generally
                    produced on the same tree (monoecious), not indeed always in the same season,
                    for a tree in one year may produce all male flowers and in the next all female
                    flowers. Sometimes the flowers are modified by an increase in the number of
                    parts; thus the usually six stamens may be represented by 12 to 24 or even by
                    hundreds. The carpels are usually three in number, and more or less combined;
                    but they may be free, and their number may be reduced to two or even one. In any
                    case each carpel contains but a single ovule.</p>
                <p>Owing to the sexual arrangements before mentioned, the pollen has to be
                    transported by the agency cf the wind or of insects to the female flowers. This
                    is facilitated sometimes by the elastic movements of the stamens and anthers,
                    which liberate the pollen so freely at certain times that travellers speak of
                    the date-palms of Egypt <hi rend="italic">(Phoenix dactylifera)</hi> being at
                    daybreak hidden in a mist of pollen grains. In other cases fertilization is
                    effected by the agency of man, who removes the male flowers and scatters the
                    pollen over the fruit-bearing trees. This practice has been followed from time
                    immemorial; and it afforded one of the earliest and most irrefragable proofs by
                    means of which the sexuality of plants was finally established. The fruit which
                    results from this process of fertilization is various: sometimes, as in the
                    common date, it is a berry with a fleshy rind enclosing a hard stony kernel, the
                    true seed; sometimes it is a kind of drupe as in the cocoa-nut, <hi
                    rend="italic">Cocos nucifera,</hi> where the fibrous central portion investing
                    the hard shell corresponds to the fleshy portion of a plum or cherry, while the
                    shell or nut corresponds to the stone of stone-fruits, the seed being the
                    kernel. Sometimes, as in the species of <hi rend="italic">Sagus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Raphia,</hi> &amp;c., the fruit is covered with hard, pointed,
                    reflexed shining scales, which give it a very remarkable appearance.</p>
                <p>The seed varies in size, but always consists of a mass of perisperm, in which is
                    imbedded a relatively very minute embryo (fig. 3). The hard stone of the date is
                    the perisperm, the white flesh of the cocoa-nut is the same substance in a
                    softer condition; the so-called “vegetable ivory” is derived from the perisperm
                    of <hi rend="italic">Phytelephas.</hi></p>
                <p>Hooker, who in his recent revision of the genera follows the work of his
                    predecessors Martius, Wendland, and Drude, enumerates about one hundred and
                    thirty-two genera of the order ranged under five tribes, distinguished by the
                    nature of the foliage, the sexual conditions of the flower, the seed umbilicate
                    or not, the position of the raphe, &amp;c. Other characters serving to
                    distinguish the minor groups are afforded by the habit, the position of the
                    spathes, the “aestivation” of the flower, the nature of the stigma, the ovary,
                    fruit, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to overestimate the utility of palms. They furnish food,
                    shelter, clothing, timber, fuel, building materials, sticks, fibre, paper,
                    starch, sugar, oil, wax, wine, tannin, dyeing materials, resin, and a host of
                    minor products, which render them most valuable to the natives and to tropical
                    agriculturists. The Cocoa-nut Palm, <hi rend="italic">Cocos</hi><hi

                    yielded by the date, the staple food of some districts of northern Africa. The
                    cocoa-nut is a source of wealth to its possessors, and many of the species are
                    valued for their “cabbage”; but, as this is the terminal bud whose removal
                    causes the destruction of the tree, this is a wasteful article of diet unless
                    care be taken by judicious planting to avert the annihilation of the supplies.
                    The famous “coco de mer,” or double cocoa nut, whose floating nuts might have
                    suggested the twin steamboats, and are the objects of so many legends and
                    superstitions, is known to science as <hi rend="italic">Lodoicea Sechel-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">larum.</hi> The tree is peculiar to the Seychelles, where it is
                    used for many useful purposes. Its fruit is like a huge plum, containing a stone
                    or nut like two cocoa-nuts (in their husks) united together. These illustrations
                    must suffice to indicate the numerous economic uses of palms.</p>
                <p>The only species that can be cultivated in the open air in England, and then only
                    under exceptionally favourable circumstances, are the European Fan-Palm, <hi

                    such as <hi rend="italic">Rhaρis</hi><hi rend="italic">flabelliformis,</hi><hi

                    the dry and often gas-laden atmosphere of living rooms. Many species are now
                    cultivated for the special purpose of the decoration of apartments, particularly
                    the very beautiful <hi rend="italic">Cocos Weddelliana.</hi> But, to gain
                    anything like an idea of the magnitude and majestic character of palms, a visit
                    to such establishments as the palm stoves at Kew, Edinburgh, or Chatsworth is
                    necessary. In some instances, as in the famous Talipot Palm, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Borassus flabelliformis,</hi> the tree does not flower till it has arrived at
                    an advanced age and acquired a large stature, and, having produced its flowers,
