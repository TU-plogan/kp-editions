                    the realm, viz., the Lords Spiritual, the Lords Temporal, and the Commons.</p>

                <p>An inquiry into the early growth and later development of this powerful
                    institution presents at once an interesting historical study and profound'
                    political instruction. Its great antiquity, its continuous but ever-changing
                    life, and the social and political causes which have shaped its present
                    constitution and authority are themes which can never fail to attract the
                    historian and the statesman; while speculations regarding its future course
                    concern the destinies of the British empire.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Anglo-Saxon Polity.—</hi> The origin of parliament is to be
                    traced to Anglo-Saxon times. The Angles, Saxons, and other Teutonic races who
                    conquered Britain brought to their new homes their own laws and customs, their
                    settled framework of society, their kinship, their village communities, and a
                    certain rude representation in local affairs. And we find in the Anglo-Saxon
                    polity, as developed during their rule in England, all the constituent parts of
                    parliament. In their own lands they had chiefs and leaders, but no kings. But
                    conquest and territorial settlement were followed by the assumption of royal
                    dignities; and the victorious chiefs were accepted by their followers as kings.
                    They were quick to assume the traditional attributes of royalty. A direct
                    descent from their god Woden, and hereditary right, at once clothed them with a
                    halo of glory and with supreme power; and, when the pagan deity was deposed, the
                    king received consecration from a Christian archbishop, and was invested with
                    sacred attributes as “the Lord’s anointed.” But the Saxon monarch was a
                    patriarchal king of limited authority, who acted in concert with his people;
                    and, though his succession was hereditary, in his own family, his direct
                    descendant was liable to be passed over in favour of a worthier heir. Such a
                    ruler was a fitting precursor of a line of constitutional kings, who in later
                    times were to govern with the advice and consent of a free parliament.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, any council approaching the constitution of a House of Lords was of
                    slow growth. Anglo-Saxon society, indeed, was not without an aristocracy. The
                    highest in rank were aethelings—generally, if not exclusively, sons and brothers
                    of the king. The ealdorman, originally a high officer, having the executive
                    government of a shire, and a seat in the king’s witan, became hereditary in
                    certain families, and eventually attained the dignity of an earl. But centuries
                    were to pass before the English nobility was to assume its modern character and
                    denominations. At the -head of each village was an eorl, the chief of the
                    freemen, or ceorls—their leader in war and patron in peace. The king’s gesiths
                    and thegns formed another privileged class. Admitted to offices in the king’s
                    household and councils, and enriched by grants of land, they gradually formed a
                    feudal nobility.</p>
                <p>The revival of the Christian church, under the Anglo-Saxon rule, created another
                    order of rulers and councillors, destined to take a leading part in the
                    government of the state. The archbishops and bishops, having spiritual authority
                    in their own dioceses, and exercising much local influence in temporal affairs,
                    were also members of the national council, or witenagemót, and by their greater
                    learning and capacity were not long in acquiring a leading part in the councils
                    of the realm. Ecclesiastical councils were also held, comprising bishops,
                    abbots, and clergy, in which we observe the origin of convocation. The abbots,
                    thus associated with the bishops, also found a place with them in the
                    witenagemót. By these several orders, summoned to advise the king in affairs of
                    state, was formed a council of magnates—to be developed, in course of time, into
                    an Upper Chamber, or House of Lords.</p>
                <p>The rise of the commons, as a political power in the national councils, was of
                    yet slower development; but in the Anglo-Saxon moots may be discerned the first
                    germs of popular government in England. In the town-moot the assembled freemen
                    and cultivators of the “folk-lands” regulated the civil affairs of their own
                    township, tithing, village, or parish. In the burgh-moot the inhabitants
                    administered their municipal business, under the presidency of a reeve. The
                    hundred-moot assumed a more representative character, comprising the reeve and a
                    selected number of freemen from the several townships and burghs within the
                    hundred. The shire-moot, or shire-gemót, was an assembly yet more important. An
                    ealdorman was its president, and exercised a jurisdiction over a shire, or
                    district comprising several hundreds. Attended by a reeve and four freemen from
                    every hundred, it assumed a distinctly representative character. Its members, if
                    not elected by the popular voice, were, in some fashion, deputed to act on
                    behalf of those whose interests they had come to guard. The shire-moot was also
                    the general folk-moot of the tribe, assembled in arms, to whom their leaders
                    referred the decision of questions of peace and war.</p>
                <p>Superior to these local institutions was the witenagemót, or assembly of wise
                    men, with whom the king took counsel in legislation and the government of the
                    state. This national council was the true beginning of the parliament of
                    England. Such a council was originally held in each of the kingdoms commonly
                    known as the Heptarchy; and after their union in a single realm, under King
                    Edgar, the witenagemót became the deliberative and legislative assembly, or
                    parliament, of the extended estate.</p>
                <p>The witenagemót made laws, imposed taxes, concluded treaties, advised the king as
                    to the disposal of public lands and the appointment and removal of officers of
                    state, and even assumed to elect and depose the king himself. The king had now
                    attained to greater power, and more royal dignities and prerogatives. He was
                    unquestionably the chief power in the witenagemót; but the laws were already
                    promulgated, as in later times, as having been agreed to with the advice and
                    consent of the witan. The witan also exercised jurisdiction as a supreme court.
                    These ancient customs present further examples of the continuity of English
                    constitutional forms.</p>
                <p>The constitution of the witenagemót, however, was necessarily less popular than
                    that of the local moots in the hundred or the shire. The king himself was
                    generally present; and at his summons came prelates, abbots, ealdormen, the
                    king’s gesiths and thegns, officers of state and of the royal household, and
                    leading tenants in chief of lands held from the crown. Crowds sometimes attended
                    the meetings of the witan, and shouted their acclamations of approval or
                    dissent; and, so far, the popular voice was associated with its deliberations;
                    but it was at a distance from all but the inhabitants of the place in which it
                    was assembled, and until a system of representation had slowly grown up there
                    could be no further admission of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n324/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0324-0303"/> people to its deliberations. In the town-moot the
                    whole body of freemen and cultivators of the folk-lands met freely under a
                    spreading oak, or on the village green; in the hundred-moot, or shire-gemót,
                    deputies from neighbouring communities could readily find a place; but all was
                    changed in the wider council of a kingdom. When there were many kingdoms,
                    distance obstructed any general gathering of the commons; and in the wider area
                    of England such a gathering became impossible. Centuries were yet to pass before
                    this obstacle was to be overcome by representation; but, in the meantime, the
                    local institutions of the Anglo-Saxons were not without their influence upon the
                    central council. The self-government of a free people informed the bishops,
                    ealdormen, ceorls, and thegns who dwelt among them of their interests and needs,
                    their sufferings and their wrongs; and, while the popular forces were increasing
                    with an advancing society, they grew more potential in the councils of their
                    rulers. Some writers, naturally sympathizing with every tradition of English
                    liberty, have discovered proofs of an earlier representation; but popular
                    franchises are now too firmly established to need support from doubtful traces
                    of antiquity.</p>
                <p>Another circumstance must not be overlooked in estimating the political influence
                    of the people in Anglo-Saxon times. For five centuries the country was convulsed
                    with incessant wars—wars with the Britons, whom the invaders were driving from
                    their homes, wars between the several kingdoms, wars with the Welsh, wars with
                    the Picts, wars with the Danes. How could the people continue to assert their
                    civil rights amid the clash of arms and a frequent change of masters? The
                    warrior-kings and their armed followers were rulers in the land which they had
                    conquered.</p>
                <p>At the same time the unsettled condition of the country repressed the social
                    advancement of its people. Agriculture could not prosper when the farm of the
                    husbandman too often became a battlefield. Trade could not be extended without
                    security to property and industry. Under such conditions the great body of the
                    people continued as peasants, handicraftsmen, and slaves. The time had not yet
                    come when they could make their voice heard in the councils of the state.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Norman Conquest.—</hi> The Anglo-Saxon polity was suddenly
                    overthrown by the Norman Conquest. A stern foreign king had seized the crown,
                    and was prepared to rule his conquered realm by the sword. He brought with him
                    the absolutist principles of Continental rulers, and the advanced feudal system
                    of France and Normandy. Feudalism had been slowly gaining ground under the Saxon
                    kings, and now it was firmly established as a military organization. William the
                    Conqueror at once rewarded his warlike barons and followers with enormous grants
                    of land. The Saxon landowners and peasants were despoiled, and the invaders
                    settled in their homesteads. The king claimed the broad lands of England as his
                    own, by right of conquest; and when he allowed his warriors to share the spoil
                    he attached the strict condition of military service in return for every grant
                    of land. An effective army of occupation of all ranks was thus quartered upon
                    every province throughout the realm. England was held by the sword; a foreign
                    king, foreign nobles, and a foreign soldiery were in possession of the soil, and
                    swore fealty to their master, from whom they held it. Saxon bishops were
                    deposed, and foreign prelates appointed to rule over the English Church. Instead
                    of calling a national witenagemót, the king took counsel with the officers of
                    his state and household, the bishops, abbots, earls, barons, and knights by whom
                    he was pleased to surround himself. Some of the forms of a national council were
                    indeed maintained, and its counsel and consent were proclaimed in the making of
                    laws; but, in truth, the king was absolute.</p>
                <p>Such a revolution seemed fatal to the liberties and ancient customs of Saxon
                    England. What power could withstand the harsh conqueror? But the indestructible
                    elements of English society prevailed over the sword. The king grasped, in his
                    own hands, the higher administration and judicature of the realm; but he
                    continued the old local courts of the hundred and the shire, which had been the
                    basis of Saxon freedom. The Norman polity was otherwise destined to favour the
                    liberties of the people, through agencies which had been designed to crush them.
                    The powerful nobles, whom William and his successors exalted, became formidable
                    rivals of the crown itself; while ambitious barons were in their turn held in
                    check by a jealous and exacting church. The ruling powers, if combined, would
                    have reduced the people to slavery; but their divisions proved a continual
                    source of weakness. In the meantime the strong rule of the Normans, bitter as it
                    was to Englishmen, repressed intestine wars and the disorders of a divided
                    realm. Civil justice was fairly administered. When the spoils of the conquerors
                    had been secured, the rights of property were protected, industry and trade were
                    left free, and the occupation of the soil by foreigners drove numbers of
                    landowners and freemen into the towns, where they prospered as merchants,
                    traders, and artificers, and collected thriving populations of townsmen.
                    Meanwhile, foreign rulers having brought England into closer relations with the
                    Continent, its commerce was extended to distant lands, ports and shipping were
                    encouraged, and English traders were at once enriched and enlightened. Hence new
                    classes of society were growing, who were eventually to become the commons of
                    England.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Crown, the Barons, the Church, and the People.—</hi> While
                    these social changes were steadily advancing, the barons were already preparing
                    the way for the assertion of popular rights. Ambitious, turbulent, and grasping,
                    they were constantly at issue with the crown. Enjoying vast estates and great
                    commands, and sharing with the prelates the government of the state, as members
                    of the king’s council, they were ever ready to raise the standard of revolt. The
                    king could always count upon barons faithful to his cause, but he also appealed
                    for aid to the church and the people. The baronage was thus broken by
                    insurrections, and decimated by civil wars, while the value of popular alliances
                    was revealed. The power of the people was ever increasing, while their
                    oppressors were being struck down. The population of the country was still
                    Saxon; they had been subdued, but had not been driven forth from the land, like
                    the Britons in former invasions. The English language was still the common
                    speech of the people; and Norman blood was being mingled with the broader stream
                    of Saxon life. A continuous nationality was thus preserved, and was outgrowing
                    the foreign element.</p>
                <p>The crown was weakened by disputed successions and foreign wars, and the baronage
                    by the blood-stained fields of civil warfare; while both in turn looked to the
                    people in their troubles. Meanwhile the church was struggling, alike against the
                    crown and the barons, in defence of its ecclesiastical privileges and temporal
                    possessions. Its clergy were brought by their spiritual ministrations into close
                    relations with the people, and their culture contributed to the intellectual
                    growth of English society. When William Rufus was threatened by his armed
                    barons, he took counsel with Archbishop Lanfranc, and promised good laws and
                    justice to the people. His promises were broken; but, like later charters, as
                    lightly set aside, they <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n325/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0325-0304"/> were a recognition of the political rights of the
                    people. By the charter of Henry I. restoring to the people the laws of Edward
                    the Confessor, the continuity of English institutions was acknowledged; and this
                    concession was also proclaimed through Archbishop Anselm, the church and the
                    people being again associated with the crown against the barons. And throughout
                    his reign the clergy and the English people were cordially united in support of
                    the crown. In the anarchic reign of Stephen—also distinguished by its futile
                    charters—the clergy were driven into opposition to the king, while his
                    oppressions alienated the people. Henry II. commenced his reign with another
                    charter, which may be taken as a profession of good intentions on the part of
                    the new king. So strong-willed a king, who could cripple his too powerful
                    nobles, and forge shackles for the church, was not predisposed to extend the
                    liberties of his people; but they supported him loyally in his critical
                    struggles; and his vigorous reforms in the administrative, judicial, and
                    financial organization of his realm promoted the prosperity and political
                    influence of the commons. At the same time the barons created in this and the
                    two previous reigns, being no longer exclusively Norman in blood and connexion,
                    associated themselves more readily with the interests and sympathies of the
                    people. Under Richard I. the principle of representation was somewhat advanced,
                    but it was confined to the assessment and collection of taxes in the different
                    shires.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Great Charter.—</hi> It was under King John that the
                    greatest progress was made in national liberties. The loss of Normandy served to
                    draw the baronage closer to the English people; and the king soon united all the
                    forces of the realm against him. He outraged the church, the barons, and the
                    people. He could no longer play one class against another; and they combined to
                    extort the Great Charter of .their liberties at Runnymede. It was there ordained
                    that no scutage or aid, except the three regular feudal aids, should be imposed,
                    save by the common council of the realm. To this council the archbishops,
                    bishops, abbots, earls, and greater barons were to be summoned personally by the
                    king’s letters, and tenants in chief by a general writ through the sheriff. The
                    summons was required to appoint a certain place, to give forty days’ notice at
                    least, and to state the cause of meeting. At length we seem to reach some
                    approach to modern usage.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Growth of the Commons.—</hi> The improved administration of
                    successive kings had tended to enlarge the powers of the crown. But one hundred
                    and fifty years had now passed since the Conquest, and great advances had been
                    made in the condition of the people, and more particularly in the population,
                    wealth, and self-government of towns. Many had obtained royal charters, elected
                    their own magistrates, and enjoyed various commercial privileges. They were
                    already a power in the state, which was soon to be more distinctly
                    recognized.</p>
                <p>The charter of King John was again promulgated under Henry III., for the sake of
                    a subsidy; and henceforth the commons learned.to insist upon the redress of
                    grievances in return for a grant of money. This reign was memorable in the
                    history of parliament. Again the king was in conflict with his barons, who
                    rebelled against his gross misgovernment of the realm. Simon de Montfort, earl
                    of Leicester, was a patriot, in advance of his age, and fought for the English
                    people as well as for his own order. The barons, indeed, were doubtful allies of
                    the popular cause, and leaned to the king rather than to Simon. But the towns,
                    the clergy, the universities, and large bodies of the commonalty rallied round
                    him, and he overthrew the king and his followers at Lewes. He was now master of
                    the realm, and proclaimed a new constitution. Kings had made promises, and
                    granted illusory charters; but the rebel earl called an English parliament into
                    being. Churchmen were on his side, and a few barons; but his main reliance was
                    upon the commons. He summoned to a national council, or parliament, bishops,
                    abbots, earls, and barons, together with two knights from every shire and two
                    burgesses from every borough. Knights had been sum. moned to former councils;
                    but never until now had representatives from the towns been invited to sit with
                    bishops, barons, and knights of the shire.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Edward I. parliament assumed substantially its present form of
                    king, lords, and commons. The irregular and unauthorized scheme of Simon de
                    Montfort was fully adopted in 1295, when the king himself summoned to a
                    parliament two knights from every shire, elected by the freeholders at the shire
                    court, and two burgesses from every city, borough, and leading town. The rebel
                    earl had enlarged the basis of the national council; and, to secure popular
                    support, the politic king accepted it as a convenient instrument of taxation.
                    The knights and freeholders had increased in numbers and wealth; and the towns,
                    continually advancing in population, trade, and com merce, had become valuable
                    contributors to the revenue of the state. The grant of subsidies to the crown,
                    by the assembled baronage and representatives of the shires and towns, was a
                    legal and comprehensive impost upon the entire realm.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Secession of the Clergy.—</hi> It formed part of Edward’s
                    policy to embrace the clergy in his scheme for the representation of all orders
                    and classes of his subjects. They were summoned to attend the parliament of 1295
                    and succeeding parliaments of his reign, and their form of summons has been
                    continued until the present time; but the clergy resolutely held aloof from the
                    national council, and insisted upon voting their subsidies in their own
                    convocations of Canterbury and York. The bishops retained their high place among
                    the earls and barons, but the clergy sacrificed to ecclesiastical jealousies the
                    privilege of sharing in the political councils of the state. As yet, indeed,
                    this privilege seemed little more than the voting of subsidies, but it was soon
                    to embrace the redress of grievances and the framing of laws for the general
                    welfare of the realm. This great power they forfeited; and who shall say how it
                    might have been wielded, in the interests of the church, and in the legislation
                    of their country! They could not have withstood the Reformation; they would have
                    been forced to yield to the power of the crown and the heated resolution of the
                    laity; but they might have saved a large share of the endowments of the church,
                    and perhaps have modified the doctrines and formularies of the reformed
                    establishment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Peluctance of the Commons to Attend.—</hi> Meanwhile the
                    commons, unconscious of their future power, took their humble place in the great
                    council of the realm. The knights of the shire, as lesser barons, or landowners
                    of good social standing, could sit beside the magnates of the land without
                    constraint; but modest traders from the towns were overawed by the power and
                    dignity of their new associates. They knew that they were summoned for no other
                    purpose than the taxing of themselves and their fellow townsmen; their
                    attendance was irksome; it interrupted their own business; and their journeys
                    exposed them to many hardships and dangers. It is not surprising that they
                    should have shrunk from the exercise of so doubtful a privilege. Considerable
                    numbers absented themselves from a thankless service; and their constituents,
                    far from exacting the attendance of their members, as in modern times, begrudged
                    the sorry stipend of 2s. a day, paid to their representatives while on duty, and
                    strove to evade the burden imposed upon them by the crown. Some <pb break="no"

                    which they had not yet 1earned to value. Nor, in truth, did the representation
                    of towns at this period afford much protection to the rights and interests of
                    the peop1e. Towns were enfranchised at the will or caprice of the crown and the
                    sheriffs; they could be excluded at pleasure; and the least show of independence
                    would be followed by the omission of another writ of summons. But the principle
                    of representation, once established, was to be developed with the expansion of
                    society; and the despised burgesses of Edward I., not having seceded, like the
                    clergy, were destined to become a potential class in the parliaments of
                    England.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sitting of Parliament at Westminster.—</hi> Another
                    constitutional change during this reign was the summoning of parliament to
                    Westminster instead of to various towns in different parts of the country. This
                    custom invested parliament with the character of a settled institution, and
                    constituted it a high court for the hearing of petitions and the redress*of
                    grievances. The growth of its judicature, as a court of appeal, was also
                    favoured by the fixity of its place of meeting.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Authority of Parliament recognized by Law.—</hi> Great was the
                    power of the crown, and the king himself was bold and statesmanlike; but the
                    union of classes against him proved too strong for prerogative. In 1297, having
                    outraged the church, the barons, and the commons by illegal exactions, he was
                    forced to confirm the Great Charter and the Charter of Forests, with further
                    securities against the taxation of the people without their consent, and, in
                    return, obtained timely subsidies from the parliament.</p>
                <p>Henceforth the financial necessities of a succession of kings ensured the
                    frequent assembling of parliaments. Nor were they long contented with the humble
                    function of voting subsidies, but boldly insisted on the redress of grievances
                    and further securities for national liberties. In 1322 it was declared by
                    statute 15th Edward II. that “the matters to be established for the estate of
                    the king and of his heirs, and for the estate of the realm and of the people,
                    should be treated, accorded, and established in parliament, by the king, and by
                    the assent of the prelates, earls, and barons, and the commonalty of the realm,
                    according as had been before accustomed.” The constitutional powers of
                    parliament as a legislature were here amply recognized,—not by royal charter, or
                    by the occasional exercise of prerogative, but by an authoritative statute. And
                    these powers were soon to be exercised in a striking form. Already parliament
                    had established the principle that the redress of grievances should have
                    precedence of the grant of subsidies; it had maintained the right of approving
                    councillors of the crown, and punishing them for the abuse of their powers; and
                    in 1327 the king himself was finally deposed, and the succession of his son,
                    Edward III., declared by parliament.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Union of Knights of the Shire and Burgesses.—</hi> At this
                    period the constitution of parliament was also settling down to its later and
                    permanent shape. Hitherto the different orders or estates had deliberated
                    separately, and agreed upon their several grants to the crown. The knights of
                    the shire were naturally drawn, by social ties and class interests, into
                    alliance with the barons; but at length they joined the citizens and burgesses,
                    and in the first parliament of Edward III. they are found sitting together as
                    “the Commons.”</p>
                <p>This may be taken as the turning point in the political history of England. If
                    all the landowners of the country had become united as an order of nobles, they
                    might have proved too strong for the development of national liberties, while
                    the union of the country gentlemen with the burgesses formed an estate of the
                    realm, which was destined to prevail over all other powers. The withdrawal of
                    the clergy, who would probably have been led by the bishops to take part with
                    themselves and the barons, further strengthened the united commons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Increasing Influence of Parliament.—</hi> The reign of Edward
                    III. witnessed further advances in the authority of parliament, and changes in
                    its constitution. The king, being in continual need of subsidies, was forced to
                    summon parliament every year, and in order to encourage its liberality he
                    frequently sought its advice upon the most important issues of peace or war, and
                    readily entertained the petitions of the commons praying for the redress of
                    grievances. During this reign also, the advice and consent of the commons, as
                    well as of the lords spiritual and temporal, was regularly recorded in the
                    enacting part of every statute.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Separation of the Two Houses.—</hi> But a more important event
                    is to be assigned to this reign,—the formal separation of parliament into the
                    two Houses of Lords and Commons. There is no evidence—nor is it probable—that
                    the different estates ever voted together as a single assembly. It appears from
                    the Rolls of Parliament that in the early part of this reign, the causes of
                    summons having been declared to the assembled estates, the three estates
                    deliberated separately, but afterwards delivered a collective answer to the
                    king. While their deliberations were short, they could be conducted apart, in
                    the same chamber; but, in course of time, it was found convenient for the
                    commons to have a chamber of their own, and they adjourned their sittings to the
                    chapter-house of the abbot of Westminster, where they continued to be held after
                    the more formal and permanent separation had taken place. The date of this event
                    is not clearly established, but is generally assigned to the 17th Edward
                    III.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Commons as Petitioners.—</hi> Parliament had now assumed
                    its present outward form. But it was far from enjoying the authority which it
                    acquired in later times. The crown was still paramount; the small body of earls
                    and barons—not exceeding forty—were connected with the royal family, or in the
                    service of the king, or under his influence; the prelates, once distinguished by
                    their independence, were now seekers of royal favour; and the commons, though
                    often able to extort concessions in return for their contributions to the royal
                    exchequer, as yet held an inferior position among the estates of the realm.
                    Instead of enjoying an equal share in the framing of laws, they appeared before
                    the king in the humble guise of petitioners. Their petitions, together with the
                    king’s answers, were recorded in the Rolls of Parliament; but it was not until
                    the parliament had been discharged from attendance that statutes were framed by
                    the judges, and entered on the statute rolls. Under such conditions legislation
                    was, in truth, the prerogative of the crown rather than of parliament.
                    Enactments were often found in the statutes at variance with the petitions and
                    royal answers, and neither prayed for by the commons nor assented to by the
                    lords. In vain the commons protested against so grave an abuse of royal
                    authority; but the same practice was continued during this and succeeding
                    reigns. Henry V., in the second year of his reign, promised “that nothing should
                    be enacted to the petitions of the commons, contrary to their asking, whereby
                    they should be bound without their assent”; but, so long as the old method of
                    framing laws was adhered to, there could be no security against abuse; and it
                    was not until the reign of Henry VI. that the introduction of the more regular
                    system of legislating by bill and statute ensured the thorough agreement of all
                    the estates in the several provisions of every statute.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Increasing Boldness of the Commons.—</hi> The commons, however,
                    notwithstanding these and other discouragements, were constantly growing bolder
                    in the assertion of their rights. They now ventured to brave the displeasure of
                    the king, without seeking to shelter themselves behind powerful barons, upon
                    whose forwardness in the national cause they could not reckon. Notably in 1376
                    their stout Speaker, Peter de la Warr, inveighed, in their name, against the
                    gross mismanagement of the war, impeached ministers of the realm, complained of
                    the heavy burdens under which the people suffered, and even demanded that a true
                    account should be rendered of the public expenditure. The brave Speaker was cast
                    into prison, and a new parliament was summoned which speedily reversed the
                    resolutions of the last. But the death of the king changed the aspect of
                    affairs. Another parliament was called, when it was found that the spirit of the
                    commons was not subdued. Peter de la Warr was released from prison, and again
                    elected to the chair. The demands of the former parliament were reiterated with
                    greater boldness and persistence, the evil councillors of the late reign were
                    driven out, and it was conceded that the principal officers of state should be
                    appointed and removed, during the minority of Richard ∏., upon the advice of the
                    lords. The commons also insisted upon the annual assembling of parliament under
                    the stringent provisions of a binding law. They claimed the right, not only of
                    voting subsidies, but of appropriating them, and of examining public accounts.
                    They inquired into public abuses, and impeached ministers of the crown. Even the
                    king himself was deposed by the parliament. Thus during this reign all the great
                    powers of parliament were asserted and exercised. The foreign wars of Henry IV.
                    and Henry V., by continuing the financial necessities of the crown, maintained
                    for a _while the powers which parliament had acquired by the struggles of
                    centuries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Relapse of Parliamentary Influence.—</hi> But a period of civil
                    wars and disputed successions was now at hand, which checked the further
                    development of parliamentary liberties. The effective power of a political
                    institution is determined, not by assertions of authority, nor even by its legal
                    recognition, but by the external forces by which it is supported, controlled, or
                    overborne. With the close of the Wars of the Roses the life of parliament seems
                    to have well-nigh expired.</p>
                <p>To this constitutional relapse various causes contributed at the same period. The
                    crown had recovered its absolute supremacy. The powerful baronage had been
                    decimated on the battlefield and the scaffold; and vast estates had been
                    confiscated to the crown. Kings had no longer any dread of their prowess as
                    defenders of their own order or party, or as leaders of the people. The royal
                    treasury had been enriched by their ruin; while the close of a long succession
                    of wars with France and Scotland relieved it of that continual drain which had
                    reduced the crown to an unwelcome dependence upon parliament. Not only were the
                    fortunes of the baronage laid low, but feudalism was also dying out in England
                    as on the Continent. It was no longer a force which could control the crown; and
                    it was being further weakened by changes in the art of war. The mailed horseman,
                    the battle-axe and cross-bow of burgher and yeoman, could not cope with the
                    cannon and arquebus of the royal army.</p>
                <p>In earlier times the church had often stood forth against the domination of
                    kings, but now it was in passive submission to the throne. The prelates were
                    attracted to the court, and sought the highest offices of state; the inferior
                    clergy had long been losing their influence over the laity by their ignorance
                    and want of moral elevation, at a period of increasing enlightenment; while the
                    church at large was weakened by schisms and a wider freedom of thought. Hence
                    the church, like the baronage, had ceased to be a check upon the crown.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile what had become of the ever-growing power of the commons <hi
                    rend="italic">ì</hi> It is true they had lost their stalwart leaders, the armed
                    barons and outspoken prelates, but they had themselves advanced in numbers,
                    riches, and enlightenment; they had overspread the land as knights and
                    freeholders, or dwelt in populous towns enriched by merchandise. Why could they
                    not find leaders of their own? Because they had lost the liberal franchises of
                    an earlier age. All freeholders, or suitors present at the county court, were
                    formerly entitled to vote for a knight of the shire; but in the eighth year of
                    Henry VI. (1430) an Act was passed (c. 37) by which this right was confined to
                    40s. freeholders, resident in the county. Large numbers of electors were thus
                    disfranchised. In the view of parliament they were “of no value,” and complaints
                    had been made that they were under the <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> influence of
                    the nobles and greater landowners; but a popular element had been withdrawn from
                    the county representation, and the restricted franchise cannot have impaired the
                    influence of the nobles.</p>
                <p>As for the cities and boroughs, they had virtually renounced their electoral
                    privileges. As we have seen, they had never valued them very highly; and now by
                    royal charters, or by the usurpation of small self-elected bodies of burgesses,
                    the choice of members had fallen into the hands of town councils and
                    neighbouring landowners. The anomalous system of close and nomination boroughs,
                    which had arisen thus early in our history, was suffered to continue without a
                    check for four centuries, as a notorious blot upon our free constitution.</p>
                <p>All these changes exalted the prerogatives of the crown. Amid the clash of arms
                    and the strife of hostile parties, the voice of parliament had been stifled;
                    and, when peace was restored, a powerful king could dispense with an assembly
                    which might prove troublesome, and from whom he rarely needed help. Hence for a
                    period of two hundred years, from the reign of Henry VI. to that of Elizabeth,
                    the free parliaments of England were in abeyance. The institution retained its
                    form and constituent parts; its rights and privileges were theoretically
                    recognized, but its freedom and national character were little more than
                    shadows.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Three Estates of the Realm.—</hi> This check in the
                    fortunes of parliament affords a fitting occasion for examining the composition
                    of each of the three estates of the realm.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lords Spiritual and Temporal.—</hi> The archbishops and bishops
                    had held an eminent position in the councils of Saxon and Norman kings, and many
                    priors and abbots were from time to time associated with them as lords
                    spiritual, until the suppression of the monasteries by Henry VIII. They
                    generally outnumbered their brethren, the temporal peers, who sat with them in
                    the same assembly.</p>
                <p>The lords temporal comprised several dignities. Of these the baron, though now
                    the lowest in rank, was the most ancient. The title was familiar in Saxon times,
                    but it was not until after the Norman Conquest that it was invested with a
                    distinct feudal dignity. Next in antiquity was the earl, whose official title
                    was known to Danes and Saxons, and who after the Conquest obtained a dignity
                    equivalent to that of count in foreign states. The highest dignity, that of
                    duke, was not created until Edward IΠ. conferred it upon his son, Edward the
                    Black Prince. The rank of marquis was first created by Richard II., with
                    precedence after a duke. It was in the reign of Henry VI. that the rank of
                    viscount was created, to be placed <pb break="no"

                    no new dignity has been invented, and the peerage consists of the five dignities
                    of duke, marquis, earl, viscount, and baron. During the 15th century the number
                    of temporal peers summoned to parliament rarely exceeded fifty, and no more than
                    twenty-nine received writs of summons to the first parliament of Henry VII.
                    There were only fifty-nine at the death of Queen Elizabeth. At the accession of
                    William III. this number had been increased to about one hundred and fifty.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Life Peerages.—</hi> The several orders of the peerage are
                    alike distinguished by the hereditary character of their dignities. Some life
                    peerages, indeed, were created between the reigns of Richard II. and Henry VI.,
                    and several ladies had received life peerages between the reigns of Charles II.
                    and George II. The highest authorities had also held that the creation of life
                    peerages was within the prerogative of the crown. But four hundred years had
                    elapsed since the creation of a life peer, entitled to sit in , parliament, when
                    Queen Victoria was advised to create Sir James Parke, lately an eminent judge, a
                    baron for life, under the title of Lord Wensleydale. The object of this
                    deviation from the accustomed practice was to strengthen the judicature of the
                    House of Lords, without unduly enlarging the numbers of the peerage. But the
                    lords at once took exception to this act of the crown, and, holding that a
                    prerogative so long disused could not be revived, in derogation of the
                    hereditary character of the peerage, resolved that Lord Wensleydale was not
                    entitled by his letters patent, and writ of summons, to sit and vote in
                    parliament. His lordship accordingly received a new patent, and took his seat as
                    an hereditary peer. But the necessity of some such expedient for improving the
                    appellate jurisdiction of the House of Lords could not be contested; and in 1876
                    three lords of appeal in ordinary were constituted by statute, enjoying the rank
                    of baron for life, and the right of sitting and voting in the House of Lords so
                    long as they continue in office.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Commons.—</hi> The commons formed a more numerous body. In
                    the reign of Edward I. there were about 275 members, in that of Edward III. 250,
                    and in that of Henry VI. 300. In the reign of Henry VIII. parliament added 27
                    members for Wales and 4 for the county and city of Chester, and in the reign of
                    Charles II. 4 for the county and city of Durham. Between the reigns of Henry
                    VIII. and Charles II. 130 members were also added by royal charter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Parliament under Henry VIII.—</hi> To resume the history of
                    parliament at a later period, let us glance at the reign of Henry VIII. Never
                    had the power of the crown been greater than when this king succeeded to the
                    throne, and never had a more imperious will been displayed by any king of
                    England. Parliament was at his feet to do his bidding, and the Reformation
                    enormously increased his power. He had become a pope to the bishops; the old
                    nobles who had resisted his will had perished in the field or on the scaffold;
                    the new nobles were his creatures; and he had the vast wealth of the church in
                    his hands as largesses to his adherents. Such was the dependence of parliament
                    upon the crown and its advisers during the Reformation period that in less than
                    thirty years four vital changes were decreed in the national faith. Each of the
                    successive reigns inaugurated a new religion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Queen Elizabeth and her Parliaments.—</hi> With the reign of
                    Elizabeth commenced a new era in the life of parliament. She had received the
                    royal prerogatives unimpaired, and her hand was strong enough to wield them. But
                    in the long interval since Edward IV. the entire framework of English society
                    had been changed; it was a new England that the queen was called upon to govern.
                    The coarse barons of feudal times had been succeeded by English country
                    gentlemen, beyond the influence of the court, and identified with all the
                    interests and sympathies of their country neighbours. From this class were
                    chosen nearly all the knights of the shire, and a considerable proportion of the
                    members for cities and boroughs. They were generally distinguished by a manly
                    independence, and were prepared to uphold the rights and privileges of
                    parliament and the interests of their constituents. A change no less remarkable
                    had occurred in other classes of society. The country was peopled with yeomen
                    and farmers, far superior to the cultivators of the soil in feudal times; and
                    the towns and seaports had grown into important centres of commerce and
                    manufactures. Advances not less striking had been made in the enlightenment and
                    culture of society. But, above all, recent religious revolutions had awakened a
                    spirit of thought and inquiry, by no means confined to questions of faith. The
                    Puritans, hostile to the church, and jealous of every semblance of Catholic
                    revival, were embittered against the state, which was identified, in their eyes,
                    with many ecclesiastical enormities; and their stubborn temper was destined to
                    become a strong motive force in restoring the authority of parliament.</p>
                <p>The parliaments of Elizabeth, though rarely summoned, displayed an unaccustomed
                    spirit. They discussed the succession to the crown, the marriage of the queen,
                    and ecclesiastical abuses; they upheld the privileges of the commons, and their
                    right to advise the crown upon all matters of state; and they condemned the
                    grant of monopolies. The bold words of the Wentworths and Yelvertons were such
                    as had not been heard before in parliament. The conflicts between Elizabeth and
                    the commons marked the revival of the independence of parliament, and
                    foreshadowed graver troubles at no distant period.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Conflicts of James I. with the Commons.—</hi> James I., with
                    short-sighted pedantry, provoked a succession of conflicts with the commons, in
                    which abuses of prerogative were stoutly resisted and the rights and privileges
                    of parliament resolutely asserted. The “remonstrance” of 1610 and the
                    “protestation” of 1621 would have taught a politic ruler that the commons could
                    no longer be trifled with; but those lessons were lost upon James and upon his
                    ill-fated son.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Charles I. and the Commonwealth.—</hi> The momentous struggles
                    between Charles I. and his parliaments cannot be followed in this place. The
                    earlier parliaments of this reign fairly represented the earnest and temperate
                    judgment of the country. They were determined to obtain the redress of
                    grievances, and to restrain undue prerogatives; but there was no taint of
                    disloyalty to the crown; there were no dreams of revolution. But the contest at
                    length became embittered, until there was no issue but the arbitrament of the
                    sword. The civil war and the commonwealth, however memorable in the history of
                    England, are beyond the range of this narrative. But this period proved the
                    supreme power of the commons, when supported by popular forces. Everything gave
                    way before them. They raised victorious armies in the field, they overthrew the
                    church and the House of Lords, and they brought the king himself to the
                    scaffold. It also displayed the impotence of a parliament which has lost the
                    confidence of the country, or is overborne by mobs, by an army, or by the strong
                    will of a dictator.</p>

                    fierce political passions that we trace the origin of political agitation, as an

                    country was then aroused by passionate exhortations from the pulpit and in the
                    press. No less than thirty thousand political <pb break="no"

                    been preserved. Petitions to parliament were multiplied in order to strengthen
                    the hands of the popular leaders. Clamorous meetings were held to stimulate or
                    overawe parliament. Such methods, restrained after the Restoration, have been
                    revived in later times, and now form part of the acknowledged system of
                    parliamentary government.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Parliament after the Restoration. —</hi> On the restoration of
                    Charles II. parliament was at once restored to its old constitution, and its
                    sittings were revived as if they had suffered no interruption. No outward change
                    had been effected by the late revolution; but that a stronger spirit of
                    resistance to abuses of prerogative had been aroused was soon to be disclosed in
                    the deposition of James II. and the “glorious revolution” of 1688. At this time
                    the full rights of parliament were explicitly declared, and securities taken for
                    the maintenance of public liberties. The theory of a constitutional monarchy and
                    a free parliament was established; but after two revolutions it is curious to
                    observe the indirect methods by which the commons were henceforth kept in
                    subjection to the crown and the territorial aristocracy. The representation had
                    long become an illusion. The knights of the shire were the nominees of nobles
                    and great landowners; the borough members were returned by the crown, by noble
                    patrons, or close corporations; even the representation of cities, with greater
                    pretensions to independence, was controlled by bribery. Nor were rulers content
                    with their control of the representation, but, after the Restoration, the
                    infamous system of bribing the members themselves became a recognized instrument
                    of administration. The country gentlemen were not less attached to the
                    principles of rational liberty than their fathers, and would have resisted
                    further encroachments of prerogative; but they were satisfied with the
                    Revolution settlement and the remedial laws of William III., and no new issue
                    had yet arisen to awaken opposition. Accordingly, they ranged themselves with
                    one or other of the political parties into which parliament was now beginning to
                    be divided, and bore their part in the more measured strifes of the 18th
                    century. From the Revolution till the reign of George III. the effective power
                    of the state was wielded by the crown, the church, and the territorial
                    aristocracy; but the influence of public opinion since the stirring events of
                    the 17th century had greatly increased. Both parties were constrained to defer
                    to it; and, notwithstanding the flagrant defects in the representation,
                    parliament generally kept itself in accord with the general sentiments of the
                    country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Union of Scotland. —</hi> On the union of Scotland in 1707,
                    important changes were made in the constitution of parliament. The House of
                    Lords was reinforced by the addition of sixteen peers, representing the peerage
                    of Scotland, and elected every parliament; and the Scottish peers, as a body,
                    were admitted to all the privileges of peerage, except the right of sitting in
                    parliament, or upon the trial of peers. No prerogative, however, was given to
                    the crown to create new peerages after the Union; and, while they are
                    distinguished by their antiquity, their number is consequently decreasing. To
                    the House of Commons were assigned forty-five members, representing the shires
                    and burghs of Scotland.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Parliamènt under George III.—</hi> With the reign of George
                    III. there opened a new period in the history of parliament. Agitation in its

                    associations, the free use of the right of petition, and a turbulent spirit
                    among the people seriously changed the relations of parliament to the country.
                    And the publication of debates, which was fully established in 1771, at once
                    increased the direct responsibility of parliament to the people, and ultimately
                    brought about other results, to which we shall presently advert.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Union of Ireland.—</hi> In this reign another important change
                    was effected in the constitution of parliament. Upon the union with Ireland, in
                    1801, four Irish bishops were added to the lords spiritual, who sat by rotation
                    of sessions, and represented the episcopal body of the Church of Ireland. But
                    those bishops were deprived of their seats in parliament in 1869, on the
                    disestablishment of the Church of Ireland. Twenty-eight representative peers,
                    elected for life by the peerage of Ireland, were admitted to the House of Lords.
                    All the Irish peers were also entitled to the privilege of peerage. In two
                    particulars the Irish peerage was treated in a different manner from the peerage
                    of Scotland. The crown was empowered to create a new Irish peerage whenever
                    three Irish peerages in existence at the time of the Union have become extinct,
                    or when the number of Irish peers, exclusive of those holding peerages of the
                    United Kingdom, has been reduced to one hundred. And, further, Irish peers were
                    permitted to sit in the House of Commons for any place in Great Britain,
                    forfeiting, however, the privilege of peerage while sitting in the Lower House.
                    The expediency of both these provisions has often been called in question.</p>
                <p>At the same time one hundred representatives of Ireland were added to the House
                    of Commons. This addition raised the number of members to six hundred and
                    fifty-eight. Parliament now became the parliament of the United Kingdom, and
                    high hopes were entertained of a salutary fusion of diverse nationalities into a
                    single assembly; but these hopes have scarcely been realized, and the relations
                    of the Irish people to Great Britain and the imperial government continue to be
                    a source of the gravest embarrassment and danger.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Schemes for Improving the Representation.—</hi> By the union of
                    Scotland and Ireland, the electoral abuses of those countries were combined with
                    those of England. Notwithstanding a defective representation, however,
                    parliament generally sustained its position as fairly embodying the political
                    sentiments of its time. Public opinion had been awakened, and could not safely
                    be ignored by any party in the state. Under a narrow and corrupt electoral
                    system, the ablest men in the country found an entrance into the House of
                    Commons; and their rivalry and ambition ensured the acceptance of popular
                    principles and the passing of many remedial measures. As society expanded, and
                    new classes were called into existence, the pressure of public opinion upon the
                    legislature was assuming a more decisive character. The grave defects of the
                    representation were notorious, and some minor electoral abuses had been from
                    time to time corrected. But the fundamental evils,— nomination boroughs, limited
                    rights of election, the sale of seats in parliament, the prevalence of bribery,
                    and the enormous expense of elections,—though constantly exposed, long held
                    their ground against all assailants. So far back as 1770 Lord Chatham had
                    denounced these flagrant abuses. “Before the end of this century,” he said,
                    “either the parliament will reform itself from within, or be reformed with a
                    vengeance from without.” In 1782, and again in 1783 and 1785, his distinguished
                    son, William Pitt, condemned the abuses of the representation, and proposed
                    schemes of parliamentary reform. In 1793 Mr Grey (afterwards Earl Grey)
                    submitted a motion on the same subject; but the excesses of the French
                    Revolution, political troubles at home, and exhausting wars abroad discouraged
                    the supporters of reform for many years. Under more favourable conditions the
                    question assumed greater proportions. Lord John Russell especially distinguished
                    himself in 1820, and in several succeeding years, <pb break="no"

                    schemes of reform. His efforts were assisted by the scandalous disclosures of
                    bribery at Grampound, Penryn, and East Retford. All moderate proposals were
                    rejected; but the concurrence of a dissolution, on the death of George IV., with
                    the French Revolution of 1830, and an ill-timed declaration of the duke of
                    Wellington that the representation was perfect and could not be improved,
                    suddenly precipitated the memorable crisis of parliamentary reform. It now fell
                    to the lot of Earl Grey, as premier, to be the leader in a cause which he had
                    espoused in his early youth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Reform Acts of</hi> 1832.—The result of the memorable
                    struggle which ensued may be briefly told. By the Reform Acts of 1832 the
                    representation of the United Kingdom was reconstructed. In England, fifty-six
                    nomination boroughs returning one hundred and eleven members were disfranchised;
                    thirty boroughs were each deprived of one member, and Weymouth and Melcombe
                    Regis, which had returned four members, were now reduced to two. Means were thus
                    found for the enfranchisement of populous places. Twenty-two large towns,
                    including metropolitan districts, became entitled to return two members, and
                    twenty less considerable towns acquired the right of returning one member each.
                    The number of county members was increased from ninety-four to one hundred and
                    fifty-nine, the larger counties being divided for the purposes of
                    representation.</p>
                <p>The elective franchise was also placed upon a new basis. In the boroughs a £10
                    household suffrage was substituted for the narrow and unequal franchises which
                    had sprung up,—the rights of freemen, in corporate towns, being alone respected.
                    In the counties, copyholders and leaseholders for terms of years, and tenants at
                    will paying a rent of £50 a year, were added to the 40s. freeholders.</p>
                <p>By the Scottish Reform Act, the number of members representing Scotland was
                    increased from forty-five, as arranged at the Union, to fifty-three, of whom
                    thirty were assigned to counties and twenty-three to cities and boroughs. In
                    counties the franchise was conferred upon owners of property of £10 a year, and
                    certain classes of leaseholders; in burghs, upon £10 householders, as in
                    England.</p>
                <p>By the Irish Reform Act, no boroughs, however small, were disfranchised; but the
                    franchise was given to £10 householders, and county constituencies were
                    enlarged. These franchises, however, were extended in 1850, when an £8 household
                    suffrage was given to the boroughs, and additions were made to the county
                    franchises. The hundred members assigned to that country at the Union were
                    increased to one hundred and five. Notwithstanding these various changes,
                    however, the total number of the House of Commons was still maintained at
                    658.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Reformed Parliament.—</hi> The legislature was now brought
                    into closer relations with the people, reflected their opinions, and was
                    sensitive to the pressure of popular forces. The immediate effects of this new
                    spirit were perceptible in the increased legislative activity of the reformed
                    parliament, its vigorous grappling with old abuses, and its preference of the
                    public welfare to the narrower interests of classes. But, signal as was the
                    regeneration of parliament, several electoral evils still needed correction.
                    Strenuous efforts were made, with indifferent success, to overcome bribery and
                    corruption, and proposals were often ineffectually made to restrain the undue
                    influence of landlords and employers of labour by the ballot; improvements were
                    made in the registration and polling of electors, and the property qualification
                    of members was abolished. Complaints were also urged that the middle classes had
                    been admitted to power, while the working classes were excluded from the late
                    scheme of enfranchisement. Twenty years after the settlement of 1832, its
                    revision was seriously approached.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Later Measures of Reform.—</hi> In 1852, and again in 1854,
                    Lord John Russell introduced further measures of reform; but constitutional
                    changes were discouraged by the Russian war. In 1859 Lord Derby’s Conservative
                    government proposed another scheme of reform, which was defeated; and in 1860
                    Lord John Russell brought in another Bill, which was not proceeded with; and the
                    question of reform continued in abeyance until after the death of Lord
                    Palmerston. Earl Russell, who succeeded him as premier, was prompt to redeem
                    former pledges, and hastened to submit to a new parliament, in 1866, another
                    scheme of reform. This measure, and the ministry by whom it was promoted, were
                    overthrown by a combination of the Conservative opposition and the memorable
                    “cave” of members of the Liberal party. But the popular sentiment in favour of
                    reform, which had for some years been inert, was suddenly aroused by the defeat
                    of a Liberal ministry, and the triumph of the party opposed to reform. Lord
                    Derby and his colleagues were now constrained to undertake the settlement of
                    this embarrassing question; and by a strange concurrence of political events and
                    party tactics, a scheme far more democratic than that of the Liberal Government
                    was accepted by the same parliament, under the auspices of a Conservative
                    ministry.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Reform Acts of</hi> 1867-68.—By the English Reform Act of
                    1867, four corrupt boroughs were disfranchised, and thirty-eight boroughs
                    returning two members were henceforth to return one only. A third member was
                    given to Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, and Leeds; a second member to
                    Merthyr Tydfil and Salford; the Tower Hamlets were divided into two boroughs,
                    each returning two members; and ten new boroughs were created, returning one
                    member each, with the exception of Chelsea, to which two were assigned. By these
                    changes twenty-six seats were taken from boroughs, while a member was given to
                    the university of London. But before this Act came into operation, seven other
                    English boroughs were disfranchised by the Scottish Reform Act of 1868, these
                    seats being given to Scotland. Thirteen new divisions of counties were erected,
                    to which twenty-five members were assigned. In counties, the franchise of
                    copyholders and leaseholders was reduced from £10 to £5, and the occupation
                    franchise from £50 to £12. In boroughs the franchise was extended to all
                    occupiers of dwelling-houses rated to the poor-rates, and to lodgers occupying
                    lodgings of the annual value of £10 unfurnished.</p>
                <p>By the Scottish Reform Act of 1868, the number of members representing Scotland
                    was increased from fifty-three to sixty,—three new members being given to the
                    shires, two to the universities, and two to cities and burghs. The county
                    franchise was extended to owners of lands and heritages of £5 yearly value, and
                    to occupiers of the rateable value of £14; and the burgh franchise to all
                    occupiers of dwelling-houses paying rates, and to tenants of lodgings of £10
                    annual value unfurnished.</p>
                <p>By the Irish Reform Act of 1868, no change was made in the number of members nor
                    in the distribution of seats; but the boroughs of Sligo and Cashel, already
                    disfranchised, were still left without representation. The county franchise was
                    left unchanged; but the borough franchise was extended to occupiers of houses
                    rated at £4, and of lodgings of the annual value of £10 unfurnished.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Present Position of Parliamentary Reform.—</hi> That these
                    changes in the representation—especially the household suffrage in boroughs—were
                    a notable advance upon the reforms of 1832, in the direction of democracy,
                    cannot be questioned. The enlarged constituencies speedily overthrew the
                    ministry to whom these measures were due; and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0331-0310"/> the new parliament further extended the recent
                    scheme of reform, by granting to electors the protection of the ballot, for
                    which advanced reformers had contended since 1832. Nor was the representation,
                    as lately determined, long suffered to continue without question. First, it was
                    proposed, in 1872, by Mr Trevelyan, to extend the household franchise to
                    counties, and this proposal found favour in the country and in the House of
                    Commons; but, the Conservative party having been restored to power in 1874, no
                    measure of that character could be promoted with any prospect of success. At the
                    dissolution in 1880 a more general revision of the representation was advocated
                    by leading members of the Liberal party, who were soon restored to power; and
                    further measures of reform are now under the consideration of parliament.
                    Meanwhile, trenchant enactments have been made in restraint of corrupt
                    practices, and for reducing the excessive cost of elections.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Relations of the Commons to the Crown and the Lords.—</hi>
                    Having brought this rapid sketch of the history and constitution of parliament
                    to a close, a few remarks may be offered as to the relations of the House of
                    Commons to the crown, the House of Lords, and the people. Prior to the reign of
                    Charles I. the condition of society was such as naturally to subordinate the
                    Commons to the crown and the Lords. After the Revolution of 1688, society had so
                    far advanced that, under a free representation, the Commons might have striven
                    with both upon equal terms. But, as by far the greater part of the
                    representation was in the hands of the king and the territorial nobles, the
                    large constitutional powers of the Commons were held safely in check. Since
                    1832, when the representation became a reality, a corresponding authority has
                    been asserted by the Commons. For several years, indeed, by reason of the
                    weakness of the Liberal party, the Lords were able successfully to resist the
                    Commons upon many important .occasions; but it was soon acknowledged that they
                    must yield whenever a decisive majority of the Commons, supported by public
                    opinion, insisted upon the passing of any measure, however repugnant to the
                    sentiments of the Upper House. And it became a political axiom that the Commons
                    alone determined the fate of ministries, and the policy of the state. The
                    relations of the two Houses, however, can only be understood in connexion with
                    the action of political parties. The Lords may be said, generally, to represent
                    the opinions prevalent before 1832, while, during the greater part of the period
                    since that time, the Commons, under leaders of the Liberal party, have
                    represented the progressive views of a later generation. Hence, under Liberal
                    administrations, the two Houses have been in frequent conflict; under
                    Conservative administrations they have been brought into general agreement, the
                    electors having supported the party which commanded a majority in both Houses.
                    In the conflict of parties, the ultimate appeal is to the country. But as the
                    representation of the people is further extended, an accord between the two
                    Houses will be more difficult, while the power of resistance on the part of the
                    Lords will be proportionately weakened.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Severe Pressure upon the House of Commons.—</hi> The House of
                    Commons having thus become the centre of political power, it has been impelled
                    to extraordinary activity. The legislation of the last fifty years affords the
                    only example in history of so wide a reconstruction of institutions, and so bold
                    a redress of grievances, having been accomplished without a revolution. But this
                    prodigious work, of which the main burthen has rested upon the Commons, has
                    formed only a part of their labours. The voting of supplies for the public
                    service, and financial policy, are their exclusive province, and offer unbounded
                    opportunities for debate. They have also assumed a large share of executive
                    power. Every act of administration is open to question, controversy, and
                    censure. Matters of executive policy—foreign, colonial, and domestic—are eagerly
                    discussed in this numerous and excited assembly. Nor are discussions mainly
                    directed to such important topics. The close connexion of the Commons with the
                    people, the publicity of debates, the rapidity of communications with all parts
                    of the world, and the activity of the press, have made the floor of that House
                    the popular platform of the country. On that arena are discussed every
                    conceivable grievance, complaint, opinion, project, or delusion. Subjects the
                    most trivial are forced upon the attention of the House, by means of questions
                    and incidental debates; and after weary sittings, such as no other deliberative
                    assembly has ever been willing to endure, matters of the first importance fail
                    to obtain a hearing. These difficulties were apparent in the first reformed
                    parliaments after 1832; and they have since been aggravated so seriously as to
                    threaten the character and competency of the most powerful branch of the
                    legislature.</p>
                <p>Such difficulties, grave enough in themselves, have lately assumed more dangerous
                    proportions under the pernicious tactics of obstruction. The liberal
                    opportunities provided, by the rules of the House, for free discussion have been
                    perverted and abused; and the effective power of the House has often been held
                    in check, and sometimes nearly paralysed. Already some partial remedies have
                    been applied to this acknowledged evil, but further measures are still needed
                    for facilitating the action of parliament. It were strange, indeed, if the House
                    of Commons, having attained pre-eminence in the legislature, should now prove
                    unequal to the responsibilities of its freedom and its power. The methods of
                    earlier times, and other political conditions, will assuredly be reviewed, and
                    adapted to the multiplied obligations of an assembly whose fruitful labours are
                    essential to the welfare of tho country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Powers and Privileges of Parliament.</hi></p>
                <p>Such being the history and constitutional character of parliament, this survey
                    would be incomplete without a more detailed view of the powers and privileges of
                    each of its constituent parts, and of its ordinary proceedings.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Prerogatives of the Crown.—</hi> The crown, pre-eminent in rank
                    and dignity, is also the legal source of parliamentary authority. The Queen
                    virtually appoints the Lords Spiritual, and all the peerages of the Lords
                    Temporal have been created by herself or her predecessors. Thus the entire House
                    of Lords is the creation of the crown. The Queen summons parliament to meet, and
                    prescribes the time and place of its meeting, prorogues and dissolves it, and
                    commands the issue of writs for the election of members of the House of Commons.
                    By several statutes, beginning with the 4th Edward III. c. 14, the annual
                    meeting of parliament had been ordained; but these statutes, continually
                    disregarded, were virtually repealed in the reigns of Charles II. and William
                    and Mary (16 Ch. II., 31; 6 &amp; 7 Will, and Mary, 32). The present statute law
                    merely exacts the meeting of parliament once in ’ three years; but the annual
                    voting of supplies has long since superseded obsoleto statutes. When parliament
                    is assembled, it cannot proceed to business until the Queen has declared the
                    causes of summons, in person or by commission. Other prerogatives of the crown,
                    in connexion with parliament, will be noticed in reference to the proceedings of
                    the two Houses.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Powers of the House of Lords.—</hi> The House of Lords, which
                    at present consists of about five hundred and twenty members, is distinguished
                    by peculiar dignities, privileges, and jurisdictions. Peers individually enjoy
                    the rank and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n332/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0332-0311"/> precedence of their several dignities, and are
                    hereditary councillors of the crown. Collectively with the Lords Spiritual they
                    form a permanent council of the crown; and, when assembled in parliament, they
                    form the highest court of judicature in the realm, and are a co-equal branch of
                    the legislature, without whose consent no laws can be made. Their judicature is
                    of various kinds, viz., for the trial of peers; for determining claims of
                    peerage and offices of honour, under references from the crown <hi rend="italic"
                    >; for</hi> the trial of controverted elections of Scotch and Irish peers; for
                    the final determination of appeals from courts in England, Scotland, and
                    Ireland; and, lastly, for the trial of impeachments.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Powers of the House of Commons.—</hi> The House of Commons also
                    has its own peculiar privileges and jurisdictions. Above all, it has the
                    paramount right of originating the imposition of all taxes, and the granting of
                    supplies for the service of the state. It has also enjoyed, from early times,
                    the right of determining all matters concerning the election of its own members,
                    and their right to sit and vote in parliament. This right, however, has been
                    greatly abridged, as, in 1868, the trial of controverted elections was
                    transferred to the courts of law; but its jurisdiction in matters of election,
                    not otherwise provided for by statute, is still retained intact. As part of this
                    j urisdiction, the House directs the Speaker to issue warrants to the clerk of
                    the crown to make out new writs for the election of members to fill up such
                    vacancies as occur during the sitting of parliament.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Privileges of Parliament.—</hi> Both Houses are in the
                    enjoyment of certain privileges, designed to maintain their authority,
                    independence, and dignity. These privileges are founded mainly upon the law and
                    custom of parliament, while some have been confirmed, and others abridged or
                    abrogated by statute. The Lords rely entirely upon their inherent right, as
                    having “a place and voice in parliament ”; but, by a custom dating from the 6th
                    Henry VIII., the Commons lay claim, by humble petition to the crown at the
                    commencement of every parliament, “to their ancient and undoubted rights and
                    privileges.” Each House has its separate rights and jurisdictions; but
                    privileges properly so-called, being founded upon the law and custom of
                    parliament, are common to both Houses. Each House adjudges whether any breach of
                    privilege has been committed, and punishes offenders by censure or commitment.
                    This right of commitment is incontestably established, and it extends to the
                    protection of officers of the House, lawfully and properly executing its orders,
                    who are also empowered to call in the assistance of the civil power. The causes
                    of such commitments cannot be inquired into by courts of law, nor can prisoners
                    be admitted to bail. Breaches of privilege may be summarized as disobedience to
                    any orders or rules of the House, indignities offered to its character or
                    proceedings, assaults, insults, or libels upon members, or interference with
                    officers of the House in discharge of their duty, or tampering with witnesses.
                    Such offences are dealt with as contempts, according to the circumstances of the
                    respective cases, of which numerous precedents are to be found in the journals
                    of both Houses. The Lords may imprison for a fixed period, and impose fines; the
                    Commons can only imprison generally, the commitment being concluded by the
                    prorogation, and have long discontinued the imposition of fines.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Freedom of Speech.—</hi> Freedom of speech has been one •of the
                    most cherished privileges of parliament from early times. Constantly asserted,
                    and often violated, it was finally declared by the Bill of Rights “that the
                    freedom of speech, and debates and proceedings in parliament, ought not to be
                    impeached or questioned in any court or place out of parliament.” Such a
                    privilege is essential to the independence of parliament, and to the protection
                    of members in discharge of their duties. But, while it protects members from
                    molestation elsewhere, it leaves them open to censure or other punishment by the
                    House itself, whenever they abuse their privilege and transgress the rules of
                    orderly debate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Freedom from Arrest.—</hi> Freedom from arrest is a privilege
                    of the highest antiquity. It was formerly of extended scope, but has been
                    reduced, by later legislation, within very narrow limits. Formerly not only the
                    persons of members but their goods were protected, and their privilege extended
                    to their servants. At present members are themselves free from arrest, but
                    otherwise they are liable to all the processes of the courts. If arrested, they
                    will be immediately discharged, upon motion in the court whence the process
                    issued. Peers and peeresses are, by the privilege of peerage, free from arrest
                    at all times. Members of the House of Commons are free only for forty days after
                    prorogation and forty days before the next appointed meeting; but prorogations
                    are so arranged as to ensure a continuance of the privilege. Formerly, even
                    suits against members were stayed, but this offensive privilege has been
                    abolished by statute. Exemption from attending as witnesses upon subpoena, once
                    an acknowledged privilege, is no longer insisted upon; but immunity from service
                    upon juries is at once an ancient privilege and a statutory right. The privilege
                    of freedom from arrest is limited to civil causes, and has not been suffered to
                    exempt members from the operation of the criminal law, nor even from commitments
                    for contempt by other courts. But, whenever the freedom of a member is so
                    interfered with, the courts are required immediately to inform the House of the
                    causes of his commitment. Witnesses, suitors, counsel, and agents in attendance
                    upon parliament are protected from arrest and molestation, and from the
                    consequences of statements made by them, or other proceedings in the conduct of
                    their cases.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Conflicts between Privilege and Law.—</hi> As both Houses, in
                    enforcing their privileges, are obliged to commit offenders or otherwise
                    interfere with the liberty of the subject, the exercise of these privileges has
                    naturally been called in question before the courts. Each House is the sole
                    judge of its own privileges; but the courts are bound to administer the law,
                    and, where law and privilege have seemed to be at variance, a conflict of
                    jurisdiction has arisen between parliament and the courts. Many interesting
                    controversies have arisen upon such occasions; but of late years privilege has
                    been so carefully restrained within the proper limits of the law, and the courts
                    have so amply recognized the authority of parliament, that unseemly conflicts of
                    jurisdiction have been averted.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Parliamentary Procedure.</hi></p>
                <p>We may now present a general outline of the proceedings of parliament during the
                    transaction of its multifarious business.</p>
                <p>On the day appointed by royal proclamation for the meeting of a new parliament,
                    both Houses assemble in their respective chambers, when the Lords Commissioners
                    for opening the parliament summon the Commons to the bar, by the gentleman usher
                    of the black rod, to hear the commission read. The Lord Chancellor then states
                    that, when the members of both Houses shall be sworn, Her Majesty will declare
                    the causes of her calling this parliament; and, it being necessary that a
                    Speaker of the House of Commons shall be first chosen, the Commons are directed
                    to proceed to the appointment of a Speaker, and to present him, on the following
                    day, for Her Majesty’s royal approbation. The Commons at once withdraw to their
                    own He use and proceed to the election of their Speaker. The next day the
                    Speaker-elect proceeds, with the House to the House of Lords, and, on receiving
                    the royal approbation, lays claim, in the accustomed form, on <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n333/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0333-0312"/> behalf of the Commons, “to their ancient and
                    undoubted rights and privileges.” The Speaker, now fully confirmed, returns to
                    the House of Commons, and, after repeating his acknowledgments, reminds the
                    House that the first thing to be done is to take and subscribe the oath required
                    by law. Having first taken the oath himself, he is followed by other members,
                    who come to the table to be sworn. The swearing of members in both Houses
                    proceeds from day to day, until the greater number have taken the oath, or
                    affirmation, when the causes of summons are declared by Her Majesty in person,
                    or by commission, in “the Queen’s speech.” This speech being considered in both
                    Houses, an address in answer is agreed to, which is presented to Her Majesty by
                    the whole House, or by “the lords with white staves” in one House and privy
                    councillors in the other.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sittings of Both Houses.—</hi> The real business of the session
                    now commences: the committees of supply and ways and means are set up; bills are
                    introduced; motions are made; committees are appointed; and both Houses are, at
                    once, in full activity. The Lord Chancellor presides over the deliberations of
                    the Lords, and the Speaker over those of the Commons. A quorum of the House of
                    Lords, including the Chancellor, is three; that of the House of Commons,
                    including the Speaker, is forty. If forty members cannot be assembled at 4
                    o’clock, the House is at once adjourned; and so also if it be found, at a later
                    hour, that less than that number are present. The Lords usually met at 5
                    o’clock, but have recently changed that hour to a quarter past 4. The usual hour
                    for the meeting of the Commons is a quarter before 4, except on Wednesdays, when
                    the House meets at 12 and adjourns at 6, and on other morning sittings from 2
                    till 7. In both Houses accommodation is provided for strangers and reporters,
                    and there are separate galleries for ladies.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Questions put from the Chair. —</hi> Every matter is
                    determined, in both Houses, upon questions put from the chair, and resolved in
                    the affirmative or negative, or otherwise disposed of by the withdrawal of the
                    motion, by amendments, by the adjournment of the House, by reading the orders of
                    the day, or by the previous question. Notices are required to be given of
                    original motions; and the different stages of bills, and other matters appointed
                    for consideration by the House, stand as orders of the day. Certain days in the
                    week are appointed for notices of motions and orders of the day respectively;
                    and on Monday and Thursday Government orders of the day have precedence.
                    Questions of privilege are allowed precedence of all the business on any day;
                    but this rule, being liable to grave abuses, is guarded by strict limitations.
                    Debate arises when a question has been proposed from the chair; and at the close
                    of the debate the question is put, with or without amendment, as the case may
                    be, and is determined, when necessary, by a division. No question or bill,
                    substantially the same as one upon which the judgment of the House has already
                    been given, may be again proposed during the same session.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rules of Debate.—</hi> Members claim to be heard in debate by
                    rising in their places. When more than one member rises at the same time, in the
                    Lords the member who is to speak is called by the House, in the Commons by the
                    Speaker. Every member, when called, is bound to speak to the question before the
                    House; and calls to order for irrelevance, or for referring to other matters
                    which have been disposed of, or which stand for consideration on other days, are
                    very frequent. A member may speak once only to any question, except to explain,
                    or upon a point of order, or to reply when a member has himself submitted a
                    motion to the House, or when an amendment has been moved which constitutes a new
                    question. He may not refer to past debates, nor to debates in the other House;
                    nor may he refer to any other member by name, or use offensive and disorderly
                    language against the Queen, either House of Parliament, or other members.
                    Members offending against any of the rules of debate are called to order by the
                    Speaker, or the attention of the chair is directed tothe breach of order by
                    another member. Order is generally enforced by the authority of the chair; but
                    in extreme cases, and especially when obstruction is being practised, the
                    offending member is named by the Speaker, and suspended by an order of the
                    House, or otherwise punished at the discretion of the House. And, when a debate
                    has been unduly prolonged, the House may order it to be closed, but under such
                    conditions and restrictions that this power can rarely be exercised. The rules
                    to be observed by members in the House during a debate are such as to ensure the
                    order and decoram becoming a deliberative assembly.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Divisions.—</hi> Atthe conclusion of a debate, unless themotion
                    be withdrawn, or the question (on being put from the chair) be agreed to, or
                    negatived, the House proceeds to a division, which effects the twofold purpose
                    of ascertaining the numbers supporting and opposing the question, and of
                    recording the names of members voting on either side. On each side of the House
                    is a division lobby; and in the Lords the “contents” and in the Commons the
                    “ayes" are directed to go to the right, and the “not contents” or “noes” to the
                    left. The former pass into the right lobby, at the back of the speaker’s chair,
                    and return to the House through the bar; the latter pass into the left lobby, at
                    the bar, and return at the back of the chair. The opposing parties are thus kept
                    entirely clear of one another. In each lobby there are two members acting as
                    tellers, who count the members as they pass, and two division clerks who take
                    down their names. After the division, the four tellers advance to the table, and
                    the numbers are reported by one of the tellers for the majority. In case of an
                    equality of numbers, in the Lords the question is negatived in virtue of the
                    ancient rule “semper praesumitur pro negante”; in the Commons the Speaker gives
                    the casting vote.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Committees of the l·Vhole House.—</hi> For the sake of
                    convenience in the transaction of business, there are several kinds of
                    committees. Of these the most important is a committee of the whole House,
                    which, as it consists of the entire body of members, can scarcely be accounted a
                    committee. It is presided over by a chairman, who sits in the clerk’s chair at
                    the table, the mace, which represents the authority of the House itself, being
                    for the time placed under the table. In this committee are discussed the several
                    provisions of bills, resolutions, and other matters requiring the consideration
                    of details. To facilitate discussion, members are allowed to speak any number of
                    times to the same question; otherwise the proceedings are similar to those of
                    the House itself. In the Lords, the chair is taken by the chairman of
                    committees; and in the Commons by the chairman of the committee of ways and
                    means, or in his absence by any other member. The quorum of such a committee is
                    the same as that of the House itself. It reports from time to time to the House,
                    but has no power of adjournment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Grand and Standing Committees.—</hi> In the House of Commons
                    there were formerly four grand committees, viz., for religion, for grievances,
                    for courts of justice, and for trade. They were founded upon the valuable
                    principle of a distribution of labours among several bodies of members; but,
                    having fallen into disuse, they were discontinued in 1832. The ancient committee
                    of privileges, in which “all who come are to have voices,” is still appointed at
                    the commencement of every session, but is rarely called into action, as it has
                    been found more convenient to appoint a select committee to inquire into any
                    question of privilege as it arises. In 1882 a partial revival of grand
                    committees was effected by the appointment of two standing committees for the
                    consideration of bills relating to law and courts of justice and to trade; and
                    there is reasonable ground for hoping that this system may be widely extended,
                    so as to lighten the labours of the House, and facilitate the arduous work of
                    legislation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Select Committees.—</hi> In select committees both Houses find
                    the means of delegating inquiries, and the consideration of other matters, which
                    could not be undertaken by the whole House. The reports of such committees have
                    formed the groundwork of many important measures; and bills are often referred
                    to them which receive a fuller examination than could be expected in a committee
                    of the whole House. Power is given to such committees, when required, to send
                    for persons, papers, and records. In the Lords the power of examining witnesses
                    upon oath has always been exercised, but it was not until 1871 that the same
                    power was extended to the Commons, by statute.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communications between the Two Houses.—</hi> In the course of
                    the proceedings of parliament, frequent communications between the two Houses
                    become necessary. Of these the most usual and convenient form is that of a
                    message. Formerly the Lords sent a message by two judges, or two masters in
                    chancery, and the Commons by a deputation of their own membeι <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> s; but since 1855 messages have been taken from one
                    House to the other by one of the clerks at the table. A more formal
                    communication is effected by a conference, in reference to amendments to bills
                    or other matters; but this proceeding has been in great measure superseded by
                    the more simple form of a message. The two Houses are also occasionally brought
                    into communication by means of joint committees and of select committees
                    communicating with each other.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communications between the Crown and Parliament.—</hi>
                    Communications, in various forms, are also conducted between the crown and both
                    Houses of Parliament. Of these the most important are those in which the Queen,
                    in person or by commission, is present in the House of Lords, to open or
                    prorogue parliament, or to give the royal assent to bills. Her Majesty is then
                    in direct communication with the three estates of the realm, assembled in the
                    same chamber. The Queen also sends messages to both Houses under the royal sign
                    manual, when all the members are uncovered. Verbal messages are also sent, and
                    the Queen’s pleasure, or royal recommendation or consent to bills, or other
                    matters, signified through a minister of the crown or a privy councillor.
                    Messages under the sign manual are acknowledged by addresses, except where
                    grants of money are proposed, in which case no address is presented by the
                    Commons, who acknowledge them by making provision accordingly.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n334/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0334-0313"/>
                <p>Both Houses approach the crown, sometimes by joint addresses, but usually by
                    separate addresses from each House. Such addresses are presented to Her Majesty,
                    either by the whole House, or by the lords with white staves in one House and by
                    privy councillors in the other. Her Majesty answers, in person, addresses
                    presented by the whole. House; but, when presented otherwise, an answer is
                    brought by one of the lords with white staves, or by one of the privy
                    councillors, by whom the address has been presented. Resolutions of either House
                    are also sometimes directed to be laid before Her Majesty; and messages of
                    congratulation or condolence are sent to other members of the royal family.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Passing of Public Bills.—</hi> The passing of bills forms
                    the most considerable part of the business of parliament; but a brief notice
                    will suffice to explain the methods of procedure. These are substantially the
                    same in both Houses; but the privileges of the Commons, in regard to supply and
                    taxation, require that all bills imposing a charge upon the people should
                    originate in that House. On the other hand, the Lords claim that bills for
                    restoration of honours or in blood, or relating to their own privileges and
                    jurisdiction, should commence in their House. An act of grace, or general
                    pardon, originates with the crown, and is read once only in both Houses. Bills
                    are divided into public and private; but here the former only are referred to.
                    In the Lords any peer is entitled to present a bill, but in the Commons a member
                    is required to obtain the previous leave of the House to bring in the bill; and,
                    in the case of bills relating to religion, trade, grants of public money, or
                    charges upon the subject, a preliminary committee is necessary before such leave
                    will be given. A bill, when presented, is read a first time, and ordered to be
                    printed; and a day is appointed for the second reading. At this latter stage,
                    the principle of the bill is discussed; and, if disapproved of by an adverse
                    vote, the bill is lost and cannot be renewed during the same session. If
                    approved of, it is usually committed to a committee of the whole House, where
                    every provision is open to debate and amendment. When the bill has been fully
                    considered it is reported to the House, with or without amendments, and is ready
                    to pass through its remaining stages. Sometimes, however, the bill is referred
                    to a select committee before it is committed to a committee of the whole
                    House.</p>
                <p>By recent standing orders of the Commons, bills relating to law and courts of
                    justice and to trade may be committed to standing committees, specially
                    constituted, instead of to a committee of the whole House. When a bill has been
                    reported from a committee of the whole House, or from a standing committee, with
                    amendments, the bill, as amended, is ordered to be considered on a future day,
                    when further amendments may be made, or the bill may be recommitted. The next
                    and last stage is the third reading, when the principle of the measure, and its
                    amended provisions, are open to review. Even at this stage the bill may be lost;
                    but if the third reading be agreed to, it is at once passed and sent to the
                    other House. There it is open to the like discussions and amendments, and may be
                    rejected. If returned without amendment, the bill merely awaits the royal
                    assent; but if returned with amendments, such amendments· must be agreed to, or
                    otherwise adjusted, by mutual concessions, by the two Houses, before it can be
                    submitted for the royal assent; and in case of ultimate disagreement the bill is
                    lost. The royal assent consummates the work of legislation, and converts the
                    bill into an Act of Parliament.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Petitions. —</hi> Both Houses are approached by the people by
                    means of petitions, of which prodigious numbers are presented to the House of
                    Commons every session. They are referred to the committee on public petitions,
                    under whose directions they are classified, analysed, and the number of
                    signatures counted; and, when necessary, the petitions are printed <hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">extenso.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Parliamentary Papers.—</hi> Another source of information is found in
                    parliamentary papers. These are of various kinds. The greater part are obtained
                    either by a direct order of the House itself, or by an address to the crown for
                    documents relating to matters in λvhich the prerogatives of the crown are
                    concerned. Other papers, relating to foreign and colonial affairs and other
                    public matters, are presented to both Houses by command of Her Majesty. Again,
                    many papers are annually presented, in pursuance of Acts of Parliament. In the
                    House of Commons, these various printed documents occupy from eighty to one
                    hundred volumes every year.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Granting of Supplies.—</hi> The exclusive right of the
                    Commons to grant supplies, and to originate all measures of taxation, imposes a
                    very onerous service upon that House. This is mainly performed by two committees
                    of the whole House,—the Committee of Supply, and the Committee of Ways and
                    Means. The former deals with all the estimates for the public service presented
                    to the House by command of Her Majesty; and the latter votes out of the
                    Consolidated Fund such sums as are necessary to meet the supplies already
                    granted, and originates all taxes for the service of the year. It is here that
                    the annual financial statement of the chancellor of the exchequer, commonly
                    known as “the Budget,” is delivered. The resolutions of these committees are
                    reported to the House, and, when agreed to, form the foundation of bills, to be
                    passed by both Houses, anil submitted for the royal assent; and towards the
                    close of the session an Appropriation Act is passed, applying all the grants for
                    the service of the year.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Elections. —</hi> The extensive jurisdiction of the Commons in
                    matters of election, already referred to, formerly occupied a considerable share
                    of their time, but its exercise has now been contracted within narrow limits.
                    Whenever a vacancy occurs during the continuance of a parliament, a warrant for
                    a new writ is issued by the Speaker, by order of the House during the session,
                    and in pursuance of statutes during the recess. The causes of vacancies are the
                    death of a member, his being called to the House of Peers, his acceptance of an
                    office from the crown, or his bankruptcy. When any doubt arises as to the issue
                    of a writ, it is usual to appoint a committee to inquire into the circumstances
                    of the case; and during the recess the Speaker may reserve doubtful cases for
                    the determination of the House.</p>
                <p>Controverted elections had been originally tried by select committees, afterwards
                    by the committee of privileges and elections, and ultimately by the whole House,
                    with scandalous partiality, but under the Grenville Act of 1770, and other later
                    Acts, by select committees, so constituted as to form a more judicial tribunal.
                    The influence of party bias, however, too obviously prevailed until 1839, when
                    Sir Robert Peel introduced an improved system of nomination, which distinctly
                    raised the character of election committees; but a tribunal constituted of
                    political partisans, however chosen, was still open to jealousy and suspicion,
                    and at length, in 1868, the trial of election petitions was transferred to
                    judges of the superior courts, to whose determination the House gives effect, by
                    the issue of new writs, or otherwise. The House, however, still retains and
                    exercises its jurisdiction in all cases not relegated, by statute, to the
                    judges.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Impeachments and Trial of Peers.—</hi> Other forms of
                    parliamentary judicature still remain to be mentioned. Upon impeachments by the
                    Commons, the Lords exercise the highest criminal judicature known to the law;
                    but the occasions upon which it has been brought into action have been so rare,
                    in modern times, that its procedure need not be dwelt upon. Another judicature
                    is that of the trial of peers by the House of Lords. And, lastly, by a bill of
                    attainder, the entire parliament is called to sit in judgment upon
                    offenders.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Private Bill Legislation.—</hi> One other important function of
                    parliament remains to be noticed,—that of private bill legislation. Here the
                    duties of parliament are partly legislative and partly judicial. Public
                    interests are promoted, and private rights secured. The vast industrial
                    undertakings of the country—canals, docks, harbours, railways, waterworks, and
                    the lighting and improvement of towns—have thus been sanctioned, at a cost far
                    exceeding the amount of the national debt, while the rights of property have
                    been jealously guarded. This whole jurisdiction has been regulated by special
                    standing orders, and by elaborate arrangements for the nomination of capable and
                    impartial committees. A prodigious legislative work has been accomplished,—but
                    under conditions most costly to the promoters and opponents of private bills,
                    and involving a serious addition to the onerous labours of members of
                    parliament. Means have already been found, by general Acts and provisional
                    orders, to lighten the pressure of private bill legislation; and further
                    expedients will, doubtless, be devised for the relief of parliament from a
                    branch of business which is scarcely compatible with the engagements of members
                    in the weightier affairs of state.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Varied Functions of Parliament.—</hi> Such are the vast and
                    varied functions of the imperial parliament,—to legislate for an empire, to
                    control the executive government, to hear the complaints of the people, and to
                    redress their grievances. To be equal to its high jurisdiction, it needs the
                    guidance of accomplished statesmen, wisdom and patriotism in its members, and an
                    organization which shall make fruitful the talents, the practical knowledge and
                    experience, of the ablest men of their generation. Its history is bright with
                    records of eloquence, of statesmanship, of wise legislation, and of generous
                    sympathy with the people; and that its future greatness may be worthy of its
                    past glories is the earnest hope of every good citizen.</p>
