                    except in terms of infamy, was the son of Thomas Dyckwoode <hi rend="italic"
                    >alias</hi> Peters, by Martha, daughter of John Freffry of Fowey, Cornwall, and
                    was baptized in Fowey parish church 29th June 1598. His parents were in good
                    circumstances, and they sent him to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took
                    the degree of B.A. in 1616 and Μ. A. in 1622. About the latter date he was
                    licensed by Dr George Montaigne, bishop of London, to the lectureship at St
                    Sepulchre’s, London, but his first definite post in the church was at Rotterdam
                    (1623-32), as colleague of William Ames, whom he much admired, and who died “in
                    his bosom.” In October 1635 he emigrated to Boston in New England, and in the
                    following year became the minister of the first church at Salem in
                    Massachusetts. His abilities soon gave him a prominent place in all the civil
                    and ecclesiastical affairs of the colony, and in 1641 his reputation was so
                    great that he was sent to England as the best guardian of the colony’s interests
                    at home. His shrewd judgment, his ready wit, and his zeal for the cause of the
                    Parliament endeared him to the army and its leaders; he accompanied Fairfax and
                    Cromwell on their campaigns, and described their achievements in numerous
                    letters to the House of Commons. To the adherents of the vanquished cause Hugh
                    Peters always lent his good offices. He was desirous that Laud should be
                    banished, and not executed. It was through his influence that Juxon was
                    permitted to attend Charles after his condemnation, and his acts of kindness to
                    some of the Royalist clergy are mentioned in Walker’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sufferings of the Clergy.</hi> Through the favour of the Protector he filled
                    several important offices. He was one of the twenty-one persons appointed to
                    consider the abuses of the national laws; he was a judge for granting probates
                    of wills, and a trier for licensing candidates to the ministry. At the
                    Restoration he was seized and imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he
                    composed his affecting tract, “A Dying Father’s Last Legacy to an Only Child.”
                    His trial as a regicide took place on 13th October 1660, and he was, of course,
                    condemned to death. Four days later he was drawn on a sledge to Charing Cross
                    and there hanged and quartered, his head being set on a pole on London Bridge.
                    Hugh Peters suffered his cruel death without any sign of wavering. For many
                    years after his death the grossest charges against his memory were circulated in
                    catchpenny pamphlets by his enemies, and his name was held up to general
                    execration; but it is clear that these accusations are but the creation of party
                    malice. He was twice married; his first wife was Elizabeth, said to have been
                    the daughter of Thomas Cooke of Pebmarsh, Essex, and the widow of Edmund Read,
                    who died at Wickford in the same county November 1623. She died about 1640, and
                    he subsequently married Deliverance Sheffield, the mother of his only child,
                    Elizabeth Peters. The writings of Hugh Peters and the publications, in print and
                    manuscript, relating to his life are described in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliotheca Cornubiensis.</hi> He pleaded, in opposition to Prynne and others,
                    for the admission of the Jews into England. The chief blot on his fame is his
                    advocacy of the burning of the records.</p>
