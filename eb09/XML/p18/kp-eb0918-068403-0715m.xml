                    life, which is antithetical to the estimate designated by the term (a much older
                    one) “Optimism.” Both terms have a general as well as a special application. In
                    their non-technical usage they denote a composite and ill-defined attitude of
                    mind which gives preponderating importance to the good or to the evil, to the
                    joys or to the sorrows, respectively, in the course of experience. The optimist
                    sees everything in <hi rend="italic">couleur</hi><hi rend="italic">de rose;</hi>
                    the pessimist always turns up the seamy side of things. But in their special and
                    technical employment, optimism and pessimism denote specific theories elaborated
                    by philosophers,— the former to show that the world is the work of an author of
                    infinite goodness and wisdom, and is, all things considered, conducive to the
                    happiness of its sentient life: the latter, that existence, when summed up, has
                    an <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n716/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0716-0685"/> enormous surplus of pain over pleasure, and that
                    man in particular, recognizing this fact, can find real good only by abnegation
                    and self-sacrifice. As a speculative theory optimism is chiefly associated with
                    the <hi rend="italic">Theodicee</hi> of Leibnitz (1710), while pessimism is the
                    work of Schopenhauer <hi rend="italic">(Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Welt
                    als</hi><hi rend="italic">Wille</hi><hi rend="italic">und VorStellung</hi><hi

                    >(^Philosophie des Unbewussten,</hi> 1st ed. 1869). In either case, however, the
                    modern doctrines have their predecessors. The Stoics and the Neoplatonists were
                    earlier labourers in the cause of optimism, in their attempt to exhibit the
                    adaptations in nature for the welfare of its supreme product man. And in the
                    metaphysical dogmas of Brahmanism, as well as in the practical philosophy of the
                    Buddhists, the creed of the modern pessimist, that the world is vanity and life
                    only sorrow, is found preluded with startling sameness of tone.</p>
                <p>Though later as a philosophical creed in the European world, pessimism is far
                    earlier than optimism as a mood of feeling in mankind at large. The ordinary
                    human being, so long as he is engrossed with action and identified with his
                    immediate present, is neither optimist nor pessimist. But in proportion as
                    reflexion awakens—as the fulness of life and vigour of will give place to the
                    exhaustion of age or to brooding thoughtfulness—there comes a sense of doubt as
                    to the value of the aims on which energy is spent and as to the issue of the
                    struggle with nature. It is failure that excites meditation: the obvious
                    disproportion between desire and attainment impresses the poet and thinker, as
                    they scan the page of human life, with the predominant darkness of the record.
                    The complaint is heard from every land and in every language that the days of
                    man are few and evil, that the best lot of all is not to be born at all, and
                    next in order is the fate of those cut off by early death. Even the great king
                    himself (says Socrates in the <hi rend="italic">Apology,</hi> xxxii.), far less
                    any private man, as he reviews the course of his past life, cannot point to any
                    better or happier time than a night of dreamless sleep; and Byron bids us—</p>
                <p>“Count o’er the joys thine hours have seen, Count o’er thy days from anguish
                    free, And know, whatever thou hast been,</p>
                <p>Tis something better not to be.”</p>
                <p>In a religious form this pessimism appears as a belief that man is a creature at
                    the mercy of more potent agents, to whom his wishes and fears are of slight
                    importance. Called into existence by instrumentalities over which he has no
                    control, he is involved in a lifelong conflict with forces, natural and
                    supernatural, which work out their inevitable issues with utter indifference to
                    his weal or woe. The wheels of the universe are deaf to the cry of human hearts.
                    There is a hopeless sense of inequality in the struggle between the petty
                    self-centred will of man and the capricious and irresistible forces of
                    nature.</p>
                <p>This natural and instinctive pessimism is contemporaneous with the non-theistic
                    religions of the world,—with all the forms of nature-worship, from the grossest
                    and most trivial polytheism to the abstruses! schemes of naturalistic pantheism.
                    In such a state of belief man tries to obtain relief from the burden of troubles
                    in various ways. There is first of all the vulgar method of adulation and
                    sacrifice. The powers of the unknown which lie ready to thwart the plans of man,
                    and which he conceives in the likeness of beings with vaster forces but with
                    passions and susceptibilities like his own, may be bribed by gifts or placated
                    by flattery. Hence the common practices of superstitious worship. A second means
                    of escape from the burden of life is given by what may be called Epicureanism.
                    While not denying the divine, it explains away the gods of popular religion, and
                    at the same time rejects the attempt to transform the idea of necessary
                    connexion from a principle for the explanation of phenomena into a controlling
                    agency at the summit of the universe. Within the limits fixed by his natural
                    conditions it represents man as free to work out his own welfare without
                    interference from superior powers. But it is forced to admit that the happiness
                    which man can obtain is after all only negative,—all pleasure is but the
                    withdrawal of pain, and the utmost range of pleasure lies in varying the methods
                    of such deliverance. Epicureanism is pessimistic; but it is an egoistic
                    pessimism which is content to aim at the maximum of painlessness for the
                    individual, and which ignores the metaphysics of universal pain and of universal
                    relief from that pain.</p>
                <p>The third method of relief from the troubles of existence has a closer analogy
                    with the pessimism of modern times. It is the Buddhism of the East. Buddhism,
                    whatever be the uncertainty attaching to its founder’s personal story, is to all
                    intents a shoot which has been cut off from the main tree of Brahmanism. Its
                    theory rests on the metaphysics of the Brahmanical schools; its scheme of life
                    is one out of the many phases of Hindu asceticism. Buddhism left the parent
                    stock of Hindu religion at a time when the metaphysicians had carried up the
                    polytheism of their country into a unified pantheism, when the philosophy of the
                    Upanishads had worked up the comparatively rude theology of the Vedic hymns into
                    a compact doctrine. The fundamental dogma presented by this system is the
                    contrast between the true self or permanent reality of the world and the changes
                    and plurality of the phenomenal scene in which men live or seem to live. On the
                    one hand is Brahma, or Atman: from one side, the universe, the All, and
                    everything,—from another, the true self, the Ego, the absolute, whose name is
                    the No, No, because no words can describe him, the very reality of reality. On
                    the other hand is the world of growth and decay, of sorrow and death,—the world,
                    as it was subsequently called, of illusion, Máyá, where the semblance of firm
                    reality is deceitfully assumed, by the phantoms of creation. And as in the
                    universe, so is the contrast in the human soul. There is the unredeemed soul,
                    which desire and action (the will <hi rend="italic">in posse</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">in esse)</hi> hold fast in the bonds of changeable existence, in
                    the mutations of metempsychosis; there is also the redeemed soul, which by
                    ascetic virtues, by renunciation of domestic ties, by the continued practice of
                    selfdenial and mortification, has found its way from the world of illusory
                    semblances to its true and abiding self.</p>
                <p>It is on some such conception of the world, in which over against Brahma in his
                    eternal quiet there stands man suffering and yearning for relief, that Buddhism
                    ultimately reposes. But, while the speculative theories of the Brahmans put in
                    the foreground the august mystery of the All-one, Buddha starts from the other
                    side of the picture, from the actual experience of life. The four truths of
                    Buddhism, which are the foundation of its religious creed and the recurring
                    burden of its teachings, leave the metaphysical basis out of sight. All life is
                    sorrow, says the first: birth, age, disease, death, is sorrow; and the cause of
                    this sorrow, adds the second truth, is the thirst which leads from birth to
                    birth,—the thirst for pleasures, for existence, for power. The third is, that
                    sorrow can only be removed by the complete annihilation of desire; and the
                    fourth prescribes the means of word and act forming the eight parts of the way
                    which frees from sorrow. The practical need is everything; the theoretical
                    basis, the Brahma, which the orthodox schools presented as the sole reality, is
                    so completely lost sight of that the modern critics are at variance with each
                    other as to how far the goal of Buddhist endeavour can be described as anything
                    positive. That all life is pain is the one perpetual refrain of Buddhism. The
                    search for pleasure is vain and ends in increased misery. But the true Buddhist
                    does not allow the per <pb break="no"

                    perpetuate, a feeling of melancholy. It only urges him to have compassion on his
                    suffering brothers, and to look forward joyously to the goal of release which he
                    has set before himself.</p>
                <p>For further details reference may be made to the article on <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Buddhism.</hi> It is enough to say here that the chief point of Buddhist theory
                    is to see in all apparent being only a process of becoming: events happen,
                    nothing is; the only permanence can be but the law of their occurrence. The
                    cosmic philosophy of Buddha is like that of Heraclitus. “All things flow ·
                    nothing abides”; only this flux of everything serves to emphasize the fact that
                    the happiness of man is thereby rendered vain. The end which Buddha seeks is the
                    redemption of man from this toilsome world of birth and death. It is not
                    absorption in the unity of Brahma, not felicity in a higher and better world. It
                    is, to cast off the conditions which trammel existence, the consciousness which
                    leads to desire and action, the body and all its appurtenances; it is, to attain
                    death in life, to have so mortified flesh and spirit that the individual can no
                    longer be in the ordinary sense said to exist. He has obtained, when so
                    perfected, what is called Nirvána, “the land of peace where transitoriness finds
                    rest.”</p>
                <p>Before discussing the development of this pessimistic ethics in modern days, it
                    remains to notice a fourth issue from the evil that is in the world. This view
                    of life and of the universe is specially connected with Hebrew monotheism and
                    its later developments in Mohammedan as well as Christian doctrine under the
                    potent stimulus of Greek philosophy. It is in the belief of a moral God—a good
                    and wise creator and governor of the universe—that the optimistic problem and
                    theory finds its chief origin. When the idea of God has been purged of its
                    naturalism and identified with the ideal of wisdom, goodness, and justice, there
                    soon arises for thinking minds the necessity of a “théodicée,”—a justification
                    of providence. Can the evil and misery found upon earth, the disproportion
                    between merit and recompense, be explained on the hypothesis of a wise and
                    beneficent ruler in heaven <hi rend="italic">Ί</hi><hi rend="italic">One of</hi>
                    the most familiar and typical instances of such a feeling is given by the book
                    of Job. In the later times of Israel, when the vigour of creative faith was
                    undermined by a criticål spirit, born of bitter fates and foreign influences,
                    voices were heard, like those of the writer of Ecclesiastes, giving utterance to
                    pessimistic doubt. The story of Job is another and more edifying presentation of
                    the same theme. How, it is asked, can the misfortunes of the just man be
                    harmonized with the idea of a righteous God? Is suffering the penalty of sin,
                    and must virtue be always paid its wages in pleasure?</p>
                <p>The difficulty, it is evident, arises with the perception of the antagonism
                    between the natural and the moral, and implies a desire to bridge over the gulf
                    between them. With the gradually deepening conviction that the central principle
                    of the universe is a moral principle, the need is felt for explaining the
                    immorality (so to speak) of the natural laws, for reconciling the unconditional
                    imperative of the word of duty with the indifference to right and wrong
                    displayed in the facts of life. Sometimes we are referred for answer to another
                    world, which shall compensate for the mistakes of the present. At other times it
                    is suggested that physical evil has the function of a moral discipline, that
                    suffering teaches nobility, that misfortunes are blessings in disguise.</p>
                <p>The optimism of Leibnitz is of a different cast, and goes more boldly to face the
                    real difficulty of the situation. It argues against the common estimate of moral
                    and physical evil, and seeks to reduce them both to little more than privations
                    of good,—to mere absence of good, to a defect rather than a blemish, to what is
                    called metaphysical evil. The world, it is admitted, is far from perfect, but it
                    is as good as it could be made if all the good which it contains was to be
                    realized. Like everything else, it is not free from the defects of its
                    qualities. It is, we may be sure, the best of possible worlds. But this is far
                    from saying that it is a good world. Ignorant as we are of the limits of what is
                    possible, it is not for us to say that the quality of the best, under the given
                    circumstances, is at all distinguishable from what is really very bad. The
                    defence of theism which Leibnitz thus undertook against the sceptical
                    suggestions of Bayle is only the common argument that the work must be judged as
                    a whole, that it is unfair to pronounce judgment on an isolated event or thing
                    apart from the question how it is affected by its interdependence. But,
                    unfortunately, in the case before us, in the problem of the universe, we do not
                    know the whole, and can only grope our way tentatively from point to point,
                    feebly endeavouring to forecast the plan of the total structure.</p>
                <p>But Leibnitz goes farther than this assertion of interconnexion or adaptation. It
                    is the ultimate assumption of his argument that the forces of the universe are
                    in the hands of a perfectly wise intelligence, that, as in man there is a
                    rational power of initiation and guidance, so in the world as a macrocosm there
                    is a primal reason which governs its movements and co-ordinates them to a
                    desirable end. The actual phases of existence only carry out in palpable shape
                    and successive or simultaneous manifestations an ideal or rational plan, which
                    is their original and sufficient reason. The world at large is somewhat of a
                    machine, or a congeries of machines, which run down according to their own
                    internal and innate conditions of existence; but these machines are wound up by
                    one supreme machinist, who has predetermined the aim and object of their
                    combined movements. Thus the doctrine of the pre-established harmony, while on
                    the one hand it is an apotheosis of logic by the emphasis it lays on the
                    necessary causal interdependence of the several partial movements, is on the
                    other hand, by its principle of sufficient reason—the <hi rend="italic">principe
                    du meilleur</hi> or <hi rend="italic">de convenance</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    a doctrine of teleology, whereby an ideal principle of design interpolates the
                    contingent and subordinates necessity to freedom. The world is not a mere group
                    of causes and effects governed by the logic of contradiction and identity; over
                    and above the necessitarian logic is a mind which looks behind and before, and
                    combines all events, not recklessly or necessarily, but in the bands of
                    reciprocal subservience to the greatest good of which they admit.</p>
                <p>In this argument Leibnitz is open to the criticism of Kant, that he has passed
                    from a legitimate conception presiding over the synthesis of phenomena to the
                    illegitimate idea of a self-subsistent and personal principle, which, far from
                    being a mere ideal of complete synthesis, itself creates and predetermines that
                    synthesis. To the logical scientist the phenomena are merely connected by a
                    formal unity; to the theist like Leibnitz this unity is identified with a
                    cosmical mind, an intelligent power which regulates the evolution of things and
                    subordinates them all to the fulfilment of its original plan. Leibnitz thus
                    manipulates two ideas, the logical and the religious, as if they were
                    interchangeable, though in reality they lie in different planes. The reason
                    which at one time is treated as an abstract principle of self-consistency is at
                    another time clothed in the concrete mental life associated with it under its
                    human aspects. Mere reason, says Aristotle, can initiate no change; it neither
                    chooses nor commands, but simply asserts. But human reason is always in the
                    long-run wrapped up with some aim, is always (in the technical sense) practical,
                    and only for moments of abstraction ever merely theoretical. Thus the reason in
                    the universe was <pb break="no"

                    anthropomorphically after the pattern of human personality.</p>
                <p>The optimism of Leibnitz found its well-sounding but somewhat misleading phrase
                    that all is for the best in this best of possible worlds bitterly satirized in
                    Voltaire’s <hi rend="italic">Candide,</hi> and painfully commented upon by the
                    earthquake of Lisbon. But the real object of the Frenchman’s wit was the baser
                    optimism of the age which sheltered its vulgar features under the mask of the
                    Leibnitian <hi rend="italic">Theodicee.</hi> An easy-going generation had
                    settled down in the pleasing faith that their barns were filled with good things
                    for many years, and that they might eat, drink, and be merry. The creed found in
                    England a prophet of solemn pomp in Pope, whose <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                    Man</hi> has fixed in pregnant lines the main half-truths of the Leibnitian
                    theory, which the poet had probably learned from Bolingbroke. The same optimism
                    appears in Shaftesbury (“’Tis good which is predominant ”), and shows its
                    presence in Paley. Some opposition to the current eudaemonism is found in the
                    well-weighed and all but sceptical judgments pronounced by Butler, as well as in
                    the cynical pessimism that tried to raise its voice in Mandeville. But the great
                    instance against the comfortable view of life is the striking passage which Hume
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Dialogues concerning Natural Religion</hi> has put in
                    the mouth of Demea, beginning “The whole earth, believe me, Philo, is cursed and
                    polluted. A perpetual war is kindled amongst all living creatures,” &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In Germany, under the head of Natural Theology, the ordinary optimism flourished
                    amain. The whole range of creation was ransacked to show how well man had been
                    provided for by God. The poetry of Brockes (the translator of Pope) is full of
                    the theme,—the laudation of the many gifts we owe to Providence, of the
                    multifarious uses to which each animal and plant can be put. It is an
                    anthropocentric optimism which thus makes man’s welfare the main end of the
                    creation, and which, above all, finds that welfare in what we eat and drink and
                    wherewithal we are clothed. The good which Leibnitz had spoken of was understood
                    as material prosperity, comfort, happiness. God’s goodness was measured by the
                    amount of worldly wellbeing which He bestows upon us.</p>
                <p>The great Kant, as late as 1759, when he printed a short sketch <hi rend="italic"
                    >On Optimism,</hi> was still inclined to keep terms with this base caricature of
                    a great theory, and spoke with full agreement of that theory itself. But here as
                    elsewhere Hume’s influence was potent upon him, and in a paper published in 1791
                    <hi rend="italic">(On the Failure of all Philosophical Attempts in
                    Theodicy)</hi> he had altered his tone. Our intelligence, he argues, is
                    absolutely powerless to discover the proportion in which the world, at least as
                    known to us in experience, stands to the supreme wisdom. And to the grounds
                    adduced to prove that the pleasures of life far exceed its pains his reply is:
                    take a man of sound mind, who has lived long enough and thought enough on the
                    value of life to be able to form a judgment on the subject, and ask him whether
                    he would like to play out the game of life once more (not on the same terms,
                    but) on any terms he pleases, be it only in this terrestrial world of ours, and
                    not in fairy land. In one direction indeed Kant may be called optimist (or at
                    least meliorist),-in his belief in the ample possibilities of moral and
                    political improvement, and in his enthusiastic hopes for the cessation of some
                    chief causes of human misery.</p>
                <p>But in one way Kant had laid the axe to the chief root of optimism. That root is
                    the utilitarian or eudaemonistic theory of conduct,—the theory which seeks to
                    explain morality away into a sort of magnified selfishness, and regards the
                    authority of moral rules as due to their origin in counsels of prudence. The
                    moral law, said Kant, is the one clear utterance of the Absolute. And the lesson
                    thus taught bore fruit. At first indeed idealism with its optimistic
                    interpretations returned. The double-faced dictum of Hegel, that the real is the
                    rational and the rational the real, was often understood to justify the
                    principle that, whatever is, is right. The net of Hegelian thought seemed to
                    grasp everything; everything fell as it were naturally into its place, and
                    seemed to be justified by the symmetry of its position in the logical evolution.
                    For in idealism we find the true home of optimism. The world as experienced in
                    sense and feeling is full of discords and defects, and the more we abstract each
                    part of the whole into its “beggarly elements,” the greater seems the weakness
                    and the triviality. But, when we rise in thought to the contemplation of the
                    unity and order, these real discords pale before the spectacle of ideal harmony.
                    The formal symmetry carries the day. The corpse may be hideous and yet the
                    theory of the anatomist has its beauty. The sorrows of the hero do not make
                    impossible the pleasure of the spectator in the drama. Just as the hardships
                    long ago endured are sweet to remembrance, so the individual sufferings are lost
                    in the conception of the universal ends they subserved. The real pain is
                    compatible with a formal pleasure; reason can find commendable and good what is
                    torment to flesh and blood.</p>
                <p>But, while the life-work of Hegel had been to show that at bottom the principle
                    of being and the principle of thought were the same, that nature and history
                    were the incarnations of reason, the succeeding philosophy of Schopenhauer
                    reverted to the distinction of Kant, which it emphasized, between thought and
                    existence. Schopenhauer dethroned reason and claimed to have discovered the real
                    root of that being which we know as an idea. This root of existence is what he
                    called Will. The source of the reality which we cognize—the secret essence which
                    is objectified in the forms of the universe as it presents itself to our
                    conceptions—is Will. By this Will he meant a blind but irresistible effort to
                    exist, a craving of inexpugnable strength towards life and objective being, an
                    unconscious lusting after the pleasure of manifesting itself as something acting
                    here and now. It is something less than Will, as <hi rend="italic">we</hi> know
                    will, and yet something more than force. Under every known kind of actions and
                    phenomena in space-and-time— phenomena, known by their reciprocal
                    relations—there is an unknown but felt something, an endless, aimless, limitless
                    struggle to be upraised into the light of existence. This ultimate basis of
                    will-force we must assume as the fact presupposed by all specific causal
                    explanations. But in its generic basis the Will has no definite aim · it is the
                    will to be everything in general and nothing in particular,— the will to be, to
                    do, to act. End or purpose supervenes only with the rise of consciousness.
                    Intelligence comes forward at first as a mere organ in the service of the Will;
                    it is only a means for the preservation of the individual and the species. It is
                    observable first in the animal, where the purely instinctive stimuli fail to
                    procure sufficient material for subsistence, where the food has to be selected,
                    and the motions of the animal are accordingly dependent on motives, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> on conceptions of objects to be attained. It is this
                    need which occasions the development of the brain; with the brain intelligence
                    rises upon the scene; and thus the world now comes to see itself, not in its
                    reality, but in its phenomenal objectification, as the realm of causes and
                    effects in the element of space and time. This conscious knowledge, which at
                    first consists merely in momentary and individual perceptions, attains higher
                    powers, as abstract and general reason, by the aid of speech.</p>
                <p>Now intelligence, which originally came with the formation of brain-tissue as a
                    mere tool of the Will in the more complex forms of its objectification, may rise
                    at length, according to Schopenhauer, to be the liberator of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n719/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0719-0688"/> human race from the restless tyrant which works
                    in them now, as it erewhile brought them to the birth. For, firstly, knowledge
                    in its own character emancipates; it lets its possessor know that he suffers and
                    why he suffers. Such is the first prerogative of reason. But, secondly, in the
                    occasional intervals when the storm of Will is laid to rest, the mind, instead
                    of striving in the interests of practical intelligence to detect the causal
                    relations of things, can concentrate itself exclusively on a single isolated
                    object. A transformation is thus accomplished whereby the object, ceasing to be
                    a mere particular, becomes the type-idea, the . eternal form, the generic and
                    adequate embodiment of Will in a special grade; while, on the other hand, the
                    individual who has become absorbed in such contemplation is no longer a mere
                    individual, but has become the “willless, painless, timeless subject of
                    knowledge.” It is this power of rising above the prosaic requirements which
                    science gratifies, of seeing the permanent and one reality in the dependent and
                    disunited phenomena of the particulars, which what we call Art imitates by
                    production. The artist produces the eternal types which the blind Will only
                    realizes in many imperfect and particular adumbrations; he conquers nature by
                    fixing in a single image the traits which constitute the true and permanent
                    meaning confusedly presented by her in many exemplars. For the mind which can
                    see that idea in the natural forms, or which beholds it in the works of art, for
                    him who contemplates without reference to the Will, “the wheel of Ixion stands
                    still; freed from the prison-house of blind desire, he enjoys the sabbath of
                    aesthetic beatitude.”</p>
                <p>But the relief obtained in art is only for blessed moments. Perennial consolation
                    can be found only in the ethical life, and in an ethics of asceticism and
                    self-sacrifice. True life begins only when λve have learnt that happiness is
                    impossible by means of gratifying the cravings of desire. Each satisfaction of
                    the will is only a starting-point for fresh effort; the achievement of the
                    desired object suggests a new want. “Alles Leben ist Leiden.” At every point
                    desires are thwarted; even when they gain their end the satisfaction is merely
                    negative. The weary Titan of humanity knows no repose; his feeble pleasures are
                    drops in a sea of pain. Thus the central principle of pessimism asserts that in
                    the order of nature, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> so long as the will to live
                    remains unbroken, happiness in the true sense is impossible. Life as life
                    necessarily involves misery. No doubt the man of the λvorld may turn round and
                    declare that notwithstanding this he means to gather the rose without the thorn.
                    Undismayed by the analysis of the consequences involved in will, he affirms the
                    will to life. Adopting the principles of the Cyrenaic hedonists, he closes his
                    eyes to far-reaching eventualities and lives in the moment; he.turns life in
                    every portion into art; he revels in the inspiring sense of action without care
                    for past obligations and future anxieties. It is otherwise with the man who has
                    surveyed all the issues of things, who looks at the net result of life as a
                    whole and in all individuals. For him it is a duty to deny and abjure this will
                    to life. He must, in other words, renounce the works of egoism and of injustice.
                    He must see through the illusion of the <hi rend="italic">principium,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">indwiduationis,</hi> must recognize that his very self, his will,
                    is identical in essence with every creature, even with the suffering. When he
                    has done this, and is in love and sympathy with all around him, “the veil of
                    Maya” has for him become transparent. In every way he proceeds (over and above
                    cultivating in active love compassion for others) to deny the exercise of the
                    will to life in his individual case, in his own body. He will, above all,
                    according to Schopenhauer, perpetually keep the vow of chastity; he will by
                    fasting and penance so mortify his body that the will to life shall be utterly
                    broken in him.</p>
                <p>“And,” adds Schopenhauer (§67), “I think I may assume that along with the highest
                    manifestation of will the feebler counterpart of it in the animal kingdom would
                    also disappear.” Man, by ascetic mortification of the will, and by sanctity of
                    beneficence, becomes the redeemer even of the rest of the animated creation.</p>
                <p>The contrast between nature and grace, between the physical and the moral, the
                    life of the flesh and the life of the spirit, stands out in these outlines as
                    the central doctrine of pessimism. It is in essentials the same doctrine which
                    was preached by Buddha, which is put into the mouth of Socrates in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Phaedo</hi> (philosophy is a rehearsal of death: <hi rend="italic"
                    >pcλiτηpa</hi><hi rend="italic">θανάτον)</hi>; it is the doctrine which stands
                    indelible in the early archives of Christianity, and was proclaimed as the
                    better and more excellent way by myriads of the noblest Christian teachers for
                    more than ten centuries of the church. The pessimistic ethics of Schopenhauer
                    casts aside the feeble compromises by which it is alternately asserted that
                    morality makes for happiness and happiness is morality; it rejects the
                    postulates by which Kant tried to lighten for human nature the burden of
                    imperative duty; it goes behind the social sanctions which see in good conduct
                    acts subservient to the good of a human community. In pessimistic ethics—and the
                    pessimism of Schopenhauer has essentially an ethical aim—we have the wreck left
                    on the wastes of time by Hegelianism. Hegelianism had taught, or seemed to
                    teach, that God was in the beginning by Himself as a Logos, or self-evolving
                    idea, which uttered itself in the unconscious forms of nature, till in the
                    conscious spirit of man He gradually realized Himself in moral and intellectual
                    life, in art and religion. Schopenhauer stripped this cycle of its first period.
                    There was no idea, no logical machinery, at the basis of things; nature began
                    out of a blind impulse; and it was only in man’s intelligence that the vague
                    longing of the heaving world knew itself to be. But that intelligence has for
                    its supreme aim—not, as in Hegel, to enter into and carry on the great process
                    which is the absolute, but—to deny its creator and. annihilate the principle of
                    being. The world of Will, in its process of objectification, has thus given
                    birth to a child which in the fulness of time will destroy the womb that bore
                    it.</p>
                <p>It will be apparent that in Schopenhauer’s system we can distinguish two
                    parts,—the first, the doctrine of the positivity of pain, and that life is
                    always and only pain: the second, the ethical condemnation of the principle of
                    such a world, and the method for correcting the evil which it had introduced. In
                    the latter lies his chief and characteristic achievement,—in what we may call
                    his metaphysic of ethics. Man by morality (ascetical morality) is to be the
                    redeemer of the world. In this conviction Schopenhauer shows himself the
                    descendant of the metaphysical systems of the past, which find in man the key to
                    the mystery of the universe. It is a strange and a weary way of redemption which
                    he delineates; the cross is heavier than humanity seems able to bear. Yet the
                    suggestion to deliver ourselves shows that the old belief in human spontaneity,
                    in the primacy of the moral principle, in the possibility of noble deeds and of
                    a victory over egoism, was still vigorous in his mind. Another pessimism
                    neglects this ethical element altogether. To this ignoble pessimism man is in
                    truth only an animal like the rest, and the distinction on which he prides
                    himself—his moral nature—is but a confused and illusory product of simpler
                    animal experiences. He has knowledge of wider range, it is true; but knowledge
                    is powerless to change his nature. His acts in every case are necessarily
                    determined; his fancied freedom is found on examination to be no whit more
                    spontaneous than the fall of the unsupported stone. The necessitarianism of
                    evolution did away with the independ <pb break="no"

                    conventional stereotyping of natural symbols, with forgetfulness and
                    misinterpretation of their meaning and applications.</p>
                <p>To an age so minded the consolations of pessimism sounded faint and unreal. They
                    had lost the old <hi rend="italic">πoι&gt; &lt;ττω,</hi> —the optimistic creed
                    that man was the undisputed head of creation. They saw themselves no longer a
                    select race, favourites of God, but as engaged in the struggle for life with
                    thousands of other species. The rôle of saviour of the world was not for them.
                    And so, turning a deaf ear to the high words of Schopenhauer, they sought easier
                    consolations in the common and casual pursuits and pleasures in the world; they
                    determined to make the best of this vale of tears,—even in Pandemonium there
                    might be shady spots and cool retreats. A few spirits who had drunk more deeply
                    at the wells of suffering, and who were alike without the mental energy of
                    Schopenhauer and the comfortable inconstancy of the mass of men, could not rise
                    beyond the ever-present sense of the emptiness and infelicity of life. There are
                    many such types in literature; but perhaps no more perfect expression has been
                    given to the strange abysmal melancholy of a withered life than by the Italian
                    poet-scholar Leopardi. At one time dallying lovingly with the idea of death, at
                    another finding only deception and illusion in love, liberty, progress, and all
                    human ideals, and almost always with irony, bitterness, and hopelessness living
                    in the sense of an inexorable destiny, a malign nature, which calmly motions man
                    to destruction, Leopardi presents pessimism in its naked terrors. For him there
                    are no consolations, either base or noble. Man is at the mercy of a pitiless
                    nature; he must endure a thousand deaths daily. This mood of Leopardi’s, however
                    he himself protested against the suggestion, was unquestionably to a main extent
                    due to the tremendous disproportion in which his mental and aesthetic nature
                    stood to the circumstances of his life, and not a little to the general
                    political condition of his country.</p>
                <p>When the first edition of Schopenhauer’s great work appeared in 1819 it did not
                    attract much immediate attention. Pessimism was in the air: the Romantic school
                    in Germany, and especially Heine and Lenau, Byron in England, and Chateaubriand
                    in France,—not to mention many other names,—all in their several ways gave
                    expression to the “Weltschmerz.” Yet it was not till 1844 that a second and much
                    enlarged edition of the work appeared, followed by a third in 1859. By this time
                    the doctrines of Schopenhauer had found many enthusiastic followers, and a flood
                    of literary works poured from the press in criticism or support of them. With
                    the year 1866 the title “Pessimism” began to show itself in books which discuss
                    his views. And in 1869 appeared the <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of the
                    Unconscious,</hi> by E. von Hartmann. The popularity of this work was enormous.
                    In the ten years which elapsed between its publication and that of Hartmann’s
                    next systematic work <hi rend="italic">(The Phenomenology of the Moral
                    Consciousness)</hi> it had -run through eight editions. The lesser works of
                    Hartmann, his articles in reviews, the pamphlets by friends and opponents during
                    the last fifteen years, are truly named legion. The question “Is life worth
                    living?” has become a question of the day, to which the problems of socialism,
                    liberalism, and religion contribute their quota. The novels of Turgenieff and
                    Sacher-Masoch are full of the ideas of Schopenhauer’s pessimism.</p>
                <p>Hartmann’s first work was written when its author was twenty-five. It bears
                    traces of the paradox and exaggeration which sometimes go with youthful talent,
                    and occasionally pays the tribute of imitation to the naturalistic pruriency and
                    sensationalism of the contemporary novel. The style is cumbersome and
                    pretentious. And yet its popularity proves that its author has the faculty of
                    directing with no unskilful or incompetent hand the vague and incoherent
                    tendencies of the cultivated masses. The world which has lost hold of, and
                    perhaps broken with, the faith of its fathers is on the look-out for a
                    “Weltanschauung”; it wants to know the metaphysical inferences to be gathered
                    from the recent advances of scientific theory. Not merely had Darwinism, as may
                    be seen from the character of Häckel’s <hi rend="italic">Natural History of
                    Creation,</hi> caught the public ear more widely in Germany than in England, but
                    the deductions from its principles had been carried to far greater lengths. Amid
                    the decay of distinctively Christian beliefs, and even of theism, the doctrine
                    of pessimism attracted a sort of religious fervour. The prevalent sense of
                    dissatisfaction and baffled endeavour was met by a theory that the principle of
                    the universe was radically perverse, and could not be amended. And, if it be
                    urged that it is difficult to believe in the genuineness of a pessimism when its
                    professors take their ease and mirthfully jeer the stranger who expected to find
                    people not clad in soft raiment nor dwelling in kings’ houses, it may be replied
                    that pessimism is not the only temporizing creed. The moral indignation <hi
                    rend="italic">(Entrüstungs-Pessimismus)</hi> of a Carlyle or a Juvenal, which
                    pours its vials of scorn on the selfish meanness of mankind, and the churchly
                    exhibition of the sores and frailties of human flesh and blood in which books
                    like the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Contemptu</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mundi</hi> of Innocent III. revel, alike overshoot their mark and
                    leave the world unconvinced of its nothingness.</p>
                <p>It is out of place here to enter into any lengthened exposition of Hartmann’s
                    metaphysics. This world, according to him, is the work of an Unconscious, a
                    being which is at once will and intelligence,—a will urging to be and to do
                    somewhat and an intelligence which adapts means to ends. But the will is only
                    instinct, and the intelligence is the unconscious reason which guides the
                    somnambulist or the clairvoyant. Thus there is wisdom in the frame of the world,
                    but the original resolution to exist was the work of a blind will. Reason did
                    not prompt the initial act, yet at every movement towards existence an
                    unconscious reason effectively correlates the elements into united action. The
                    various individuals seem indeed to be acting of themselves: they pursue aims of
                    their own; but they are only puppets in the hand of nature, the unconscious
                    intelligence and will. <hi rend="italic">Apparently,</hi> there are many agents,
                    each in some degree independent; <hi rend="italic">really,</hi> there is only
                    one source of action, the union of will and idea in instinctive adaptation and
                    unwitting design.</p>
                <p>With man at length consciousness awakes, and the possibility is laid for a new
                    relation between the two elements in the universal principle. Knowledge,
                    however, is not an end in itself; it is not enough to know the process of the
                    world. The consciousness which is generated at length by the unconscious reason
                    out of the workings of will has its function marked out for it beforehand by its
                    unconscious author. Its final purpose is to revoke the effects of that
                    irrational step by which the unconscious will in its eagerness to exist dragged
                    the idea with it in its service. The hour of vengeance may come some day. The
                    intelligence which has become conscious in man may at length induce his will to
                    take the backward step, to retire into non-existence even as it erewhile rose
                    into existence. In that day when the force of will has been mainly accumulated
                    in the province where intelligence prevails, it is probable that a successful
                    act of suppression of the will to life on the part of human reason would entail
                    the utter prostration and annihilation of the will to life throughout the
                    universe. By the act of its intelligent portion, in which the major part both of
                    the cosmical will and intelligence has been gradually accumulated, the world, as
                    a whole, will commit suicide.</p>

                <p>But Hartmann is not merely a metaphysician; he proposes to supply inductive proof
                    for his propositions. The question of the preponderance of pleasure or pain in
                    the world is to be worked out by observation of facts and summation of figures.
                    So far differing from Schopenhauer, he admits the positivity of pleasure, but
                    maintains nevertheless that pleasure and pain are representable by quantities of
                    the same denomination, prefaced respectively by the <hi rend="italic">plus</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">minus</hi> sign. When the accounts of debt and credit are
                    drawn out, it appears that the balance is enormously on the side of pain. To him
                    who has once perceived the surplus of pain it is an obvious duty to extinguish
                    the source whence sprang the unmitigated evil. Yet mankind in the past has
                    shrunk from the acceptance of this conclusion, and sought refuge in three
                    successive illusions: (1) the naive illusion of the natural mind that happiness
                    is to be found in this present world; (2) the illusion that happiness, though a
                    failure here, will be realized in the world beyond the grave; (3) the illusion
                    which puts its hopes on the amelioration of humanity in the future history of
                    the world. One after another these illusions are shown to be vanity. A little
                    taste of pleasure, amid the insipidity and bitterness of life, is snatched by a
                    select few from the consolations of art and science. But at last, as wisdom
                    grows and the hopeless monotony of grief is more acutely felt by the race,
                    humanity will rise up boldly to the last great act of despairing suicide, and
                    reduce the unconscious to its primeval nullity.</p>
                <p>If we pass from this grandiose drama of the birth and destruction of the universe
                    to consider the ethical doctrine which Hartmann supposes himself to base upon
                    his metaphysical theory, we find ourselves on safer ground. For, apart from the
                    method by which he reaches it, his moral principle is not very different from
                    the general view on such subjects. The basis of morality in his theory is the
                    relation of the individual consciousness to the Absolute in which consists its
                    true being. It is in this ultimate identity of the individual with the
                    A1l-one—not merely in the preservation of his phenomenal welfare, or of the
                    welfare of the society he belongs to, or the furtherance of some one ideal
                    good—that the obligation to be moral is to be sought. On the other hand, there
                    is nowhere in the universe a surplus of pleasure; and therefore the moral agent
                    cannot either here or elsewhere look for happiness in a positive sense as the
                    reward of his virtue. Egoism of every range—from the more materialistic to the
                    more religious pleasures—is incompatible with genuine virtue. The aim of
                    morality is the redemption of the whole world from the evil into which its
                    initial act has plunged it. And in this act of redemption—the result of which
                    will not be joy, but rest, the quietude of the universe—man by his intelligence
                    and will is the main worker, the fellow-worker of the Absolute; it is by him
                    that God works out the redemption of himself and of the universe. “Real
                    existence,” so closes the <hi rend="italic">Phenomenology of the Moral
                    Consciousness,</hi> “is the incarnation of the Godhead; the world-process is the
                    story of the Passion of the God who has become flesh, and at the same time the
                    way to the redemption of Him who is crucified in the flesh; but morality is the
                    co-operation towards shortening this way of suffering and redemption.”</p>
                <p>It would be vain to criticize in detail these speculations, out of which a few
                    principal points have been adduced, and which, besides being in themselves
                    vague, are pliable in the hands of their author. But a few remarks may be made
                    on some main issues involved in the dispute. It may be admitted in the first
                    place that the doctrine of the origin of existence in an a-logical principle is
                    but an extravagant way of stating that the intelligence when it awakes to
                    consciousness finds itself in presence of another world of nature and custom
                    which seems irrational and antagonistic —a world which is outside of us and
                    seems to mock our puny individual efforts for its improvement. Secondly, it may
                    be admitted that there is no evidence for the thesis that the world was intended
                    to suit the convenience of man, or of any species whatever. As a matter of fact,
                    there is abundance of misery in the world. But, quite apart from the
                    reducibility of the amount by the application of intelligent means, it seems
                    certain that no attempt to draw up a balance-sheet of absolute cosmic misery or
                    happiness is ever likely to be successful. It is as irrational to pronounce this
                    to be the worst of all possible worlds as the best. The superlatives employed in
                    the terms “optimism” and “pessimism” betray a passionate estimate of things.
                    Life, one has said, would be tolerable but for its pleasures. Even those who,
                    like Leopardi, have declared themselves in love with death, show, by still
                    electing to live, that life has something not measurable by pleasures, yet
                    chosen even amid mental tortures and extreme ill-health. As Aristotle said long
                    ago, we are not unbiassed judges <hi rend="italic">in re</hi> Pleasure <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Pain. Thirdly, if it were worth while, it might be urged
                    that the main terms of the pessimists are extremely vague. The “Will” and the
                    “Unconscious” cannot be tied down to a definite meaning without losing their
                    power; the contrast between the positivity and negativity of pleasure and pain
                    shows an ignorance of logic; and, above all, the habit of transferring the terms
                    of religion to express what are supposed to be analogous ideas in pessimistic
                    metaphysics is misleading.</p>
                <p>The pessimistic theories of modern times are in part a commendable protest
                    against the common compromises which slur over the antithesis between the moral
                    and the natural. They show tolerably conclusively that the world is not a
                    felicific institution, and that he who makes happiness the aim of his life is on
                    the wrong tack. But, when they proceed to dogmatize that existence has a root of
                    bitterness and life is a burden of pain, they fall into the common error of
                    exaggerating a statement relatively true into an absolute principle. You cannot
                    tell if life is worth living, so long as life is held to be the sum or
                    difference of pains and pleasures. If pains and pleasures were only and always
                    such, the argument might be admitted; if they were permanent real entities, not
                    liable to be transformed into each other, not constantly associated in the same
                    act, it might be possible to treat them as ultimate and irreversible standards
                    for our estimate of life and the guidance of our conduct. If pleasure and pain
                    are unequally and unfairly distributed, it is probable that this is a fault
                    which human agency can cure to an unspeakable degree, quite without the
                    desperate remedy of self-torture or cosmic suicide. If pessimism can teach the
                    world that the highest reward of virtue is self-respect, and that there is no
                    pleasure available anywhere to bribe us to be good, it has done well. It has
                    also done well if it points out the barriers to happiness in this world, so long
                    as these barriers prevent true life and can be removed by wise methods. But in
                    the meanwhile, till the burden of existence has become universally unbearable,
                    it may be well to remember that we shall be as likely to benefit the Absolute by
                    doing our work well as by macerating ourselves, and that the sum of existence is
                    a big thing, of which it were rash to predicate either that it is altogether and
                    supremely good or altogether and supremely bad.</p>
                <p>The works on pessimism have been numerous lately. Most of them, however, deal
                    with it mainly in connexion with the two German philosophers, and of these
                    several treat exclusively of the special metaphysical and psychological
