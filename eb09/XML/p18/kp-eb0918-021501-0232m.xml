                    been given elsewhere (vol. vii. p. 412). To speak of the Western drama
                    onljζ&gt;there is no intrinsic difference between the Roman <hi rend="italic"
                    >pantomimus</hi> and the modern “ballet of action,” except that the latter is
                    accompanied by instrumental music only, and that the personages appearing in it
                    are not usually masked. The English “dumb-show,” though fulfilling a special
                    purpose of its own, was likewise in the true sense of the word pantomimic. On
                    the other hand, the modern pantomime, as the word is still used, more especially
                    in connexion with the English stage, signifies a dramatic entertainment in which
                    the action is carried on with the help of spectacle, music, and dancing, and in
                    which the performance is partly carried on by certam conventional characters,
                    originally derived from Italian “masked. comedy,” itself an adaptation of the
                    <hi rend="italic">fabulae</hi><hi rend="italic">Atellanx</hi> of ancient Italy.
                    Were it not for this addition, it would be difficult to define modern pantomime
                    so as to distinguish it from the mask, and the least rational of English
                    dramatic species would have to be regarded as essentially identical with another
                    to which in its later development our dramatic literature owes some of its
                    choicest fruit (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Drama,</hi> vol. vii.).</p>
                <p>As a matter of course, no fixed date can be assigned to the birth of modern
                    pantomime. The contributory elements which it contains had very soon in varying
                    proportions and manifold combinations introduced themselves into the modern
                    drama as it had been called into life by the Renaissance. In Italy the
                    transition was almost imperceptible from the pastoral drama to the opera; on the
                    Spanish stage ballets with allegorical figures and military spectacles were
                    known already towards the close of the 16th century; in France ballets were
                    introduced in the days of Mary de’ Medici, and the popularity of the opera was
                    fully established in the earlier part of the reign of Louis XIV. Meanwhile, in
                    the previous century the improvised Italian comedy <hi rend="italic">(commedia
                    dell’ arte)</hi> had crossed the Alps with its merry company of characters,
                    partly borrowed from, masked comedy, though also largely corresponding to the
                    favourite types of regular comedy both ancient and modern, and including
                    Pantalone, with Arlecchino, among other varieties of <hi rend="italic"
                    >zanni.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Whether the
                    traditional costume of the ancient Roman <hi rend="italic">mimi—</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">centunculus</hi> or variegated harlequin’s jacket, the shaven
                    head, the sooty face, and the unshod feet—had before this been known among the
                    provincials, may be left undecided.</p></note> Readers of Molière are aware of
                    the influence of the Italian players upon the progress of French comedy, and
                    upon the works of its incomparable master. In other countries, where the
                    favourite types of Italian popular comedy had been less generally seen or were
                    unknown, popular comic figures such as the English fools and clowns, the German
                    <hi rend="italic">Hanswurst,</hi> or the Dutch <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pickelhering,</hi> were ready to renew themselves in any and every fashion
                    which preserved to them the gross salt favoured by their patrons. Indeed in
                    Germany, where the term pantomime was not used, a rude form of dramatic
                    buffoonery, corresponding to the coarser sides of the modern English species
                    so-called, long flourished, and threw back for centuries the progress of the
                    regular drama. After being at last suppressed, it found a commendable substitute
                    in the modern <hi rend="italic">Zauberposse,</hi> the more genial Vienna
                    counterpart of the Paris <hi rend="italic">féerie.</hi></p>
                <p>In England, where the mask was only quite exceptionally revived after the
                    Restoration, the love of spectacle and other frivolous allurements was at first
                    mainly met by the various forms of dramatic entertainment which went by the name
                    of “opera.” In the preface to <hi rend="italic">Albion and Albanius</hi> (1685),
                    Dryden gives a definition of opera which would fairly apply to modern
                    extravaganza, or to modern pantomime with the harlequinade left out.
                    Character-dancing was, however, at the same time largely introduced into regular
                    comedy; and, as the theatres vied with one another in seeking <hi rend="italic"
                    >quocunque</hi><hi rend="italic">modo</hi> to gain the favour of the public, the
                    English stage was fully prepared for the innovation which awaited it. Curiously
                    enough, the long-lived but cumbrous growth called pantomime in England owes its
                    immediate origin to the beginnings of a dramatic species which has artistically
                    furnished congenial delight to nearly two centuries of Frenchmen. Of the early
                    history of <hi rend="italic">vaudeville</hi> it must here suffice to say that
                    the unprivileged actors at the fairs, who had borrowed some of the favourite
                    character-types of Italian popular comedy, after eluding prohibitions against
                    the use by them of dialogue and song, were at last allowed to set up a comic
                    opera of their own. About the second quarter of the 18th century, before these
                    performers were incorporated with the Italians, the light kind of dramatic
                    entertainment combining pantomime proper with dialogue and song enjoyed high
                    favour with the French and their visitors during this period of peace. The <hi
                    rend="italic">vaudeville</hi> was cultivated by Le Sage and other writers of
                    mark, though it did not conquer an enduring place in dramatic literature till
                    rather later, when it had, moreover, been completely nationalized by the
                    extension of the Italian types.</p>
                <p>It was this popular species of entertainment which, under the name of pantomime,
                    was transplanted to England before in France it had attained to any fixed form,
                    or could claim for its productions any place in dramatic literature. Colley
                    Cibber mentions as the first example, followed by “that Succession of monstrous
                    Medlies,” a piece on the story of Mars and Venus, which was still in dumb-show;
                    for he describes it as “form’d into a connected Presentation of Dances in
                    Character, wherein the Passions were so happily expressed, and the whole Story
                    so intelligibly told, by a mute Narration of Gesture only, that even thinking
                    Spectators allow’d it both a pleasing and a rational Entertainment.” There is
                    nothing to show that Harlequin and his companions figured in this piece.
                    Geneste, who has no record of it, dates the period when such entertainments
                    first came into vogue in England about 1723. In that year the pantomime of <hi
                    rend="italic">Harlequin Dr Faustus</hi> had been produced at Drury Lane,—its
                    author being John Thurmond, a dancing master, who afterwards (in 1727) published
                    a grotesque entertainment called <hi rend="italic">The Miser, or Wagner and
                    Abericock</hi> (a copy of this is in the Dyce Library). Hereupon, in December
                    1723, John Rich (1681-1781), then lessee of the theatre in Lincoln’s Inn <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n233/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0233-0216"/> Fields, produced there as a rival pantomime <hi
                    rend="italic">The. Necromancer, or History of Dr Faustus,</hi> no doubt, says
                    Geneste, “gotten up with superior splendour." He had as early as 1717 been
                    connected with the production of a piece called <hi rend="italic">Harlequin
                    Executed,</hi> and there seem traces of similar entertainments as far back as
                    the year 1700. But it was the inspiriting influence of French example, and the
                    keen rivalry between the London houses, which in 1723 really established
                    pantomime on the English stage. Rich was at the time fighting a difficult battle
                    against Drury Lane, and his pantomimes at Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and afterwards
                    at Covent Garden, were extraordinarily successful. He was himself an inimitable
                    harlequin, and from Garrick’s lines in his honour it appears that his acting
                    consisted of “frolic gestures” without words. The favourite Drury Lane harlequin
                    was Pinkethman (Pope’s “poor Pinky”); readers of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Tatler</hi> (No. 188) will remember the ironical nicety with which his merits
                    are weighed against those of his competitor Bullock at the other house. Colley
                    Cibber, when described by Pope as “mounting the wind on grinning dragons,”
                    briskly denied having in his own person or otherwise encouraged such fooleries;
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Apology,</hi> however, he enters into an elaborate
                    defence of himself for having allowed himself to be forced into countenancing
                    the “gin-shops of the stage,” pleading that he was justified by necessity, as
                    Henry IV. was in changing his religion. Another butt of Pope’s, Lewis Theobald,
                    was himself the author of more than one pantomime; their titles already run in
                    the familiar fashion, <hi rend="italic">e.g., A Dramatick Entertainment, call'd
                    Harlequin a Sorcerer, with the loves of Pluto and Proserpine</hi> (1725; the
                    “book of the words,” as it may be called, is in the Dyce Library). In another
                    early pantomime (also in the Dyce Library) called <hi rend="italic">Perseus and
                    Andromeda, τυith the Rape of Colombine, or The Flying Lovers,</hi> there are
                    five “interludes, three serious and two comic.” This is precisely in the manner
                    of Fielding’s dramatic squib against pantomimes, <hi rend="italic">Tumble-down
                    Dick, or Phaeton in the Suds,</hi> first acted in 1744, and ironically dedicated
                    to “Mr John Lun,” the name that Rich chose to assume as harlequin. It is a
                    capital bit of burlesque, which seems to have been directly suggested by
                    Pritchard’s <hi rend="italic">Fall of Phaeton,</hi> produced in 1736.</p>
                <p>There seems no need to pursue further the history of English pantomime. “Things
                    of this nature are above criticism,” as Mr Machine the “composer” of <hi
                    rend="italic">Phaeton</hi> says in Fielding’s piece. The attempt was made more
                    than once to free the stage from the incubus of entertainments to which the
                    public persisted in flocking; in vain Colley Cibber at first laid down the rule
                    of never giving a pantomime together with a good play; in vain his son
                    Theophilus after him advised the return of part of the entrance money to those
                    who would leave the house before the pantomime began. “It may be questioned,”
                    says the chronicler, “if there was a demand for the return of £20 in ten yeaYs.”
                    Pantomime carried everything before it when there were several theatres in
                    London, and a dearth of high dramatic talent prevailed in all; and, allowing for
                    occasional counter-attractions of a not very dissimilar nature, pantomime
                    continued to flourish after the Licensing Act of 1737 had restricted the number
                    of London playhouses, and after Garrick’s star had risen on the theatrical
                    horizon. He was himself obliged to satisfy the public appetite, and to disoblige
                    the admirers of his art, in deference to the drama’s most imperious patrons—the
                    public at large.</p>
                <p>It should be noted that in France an attempt was made by <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Noverre (⅛.v.)</hi> to restore pantomime proper to the stage as an independent
                    species, by treating mythological subjects seriously in artificial ballets. This
                    attempt, which of course could not prove permanently successful, met in England
                    also with great applause. In an anonymous tract of the year 1789 in the Dyce
                    Library, attributed by Dyce to Archdeacon Nares (the author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Glossary),</hi> Noverre’s pantomime or ballet <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cupid and Psyche</hi> is commended as of very extraordinary merit in the choice
                    and execution of the subject. It seems to have been without words. The writer of
                    the tract states that “very lately the serious pantomime has made a new advance
                    in this country, and has gained establishment in an English theatre;” but he
                    leaves it an open question whether the grand ballet of <hi rend="italic">Medea
                    and Jason</hi> (apparently produced a few years earlier, for a burlesque on the
                    subject came out in 1781) was the first complete performance of the kind
                    produced in England. He also notes <hi rend="italic">The Death of Captain
                    Cook,</hi> adapted from the Parisian stage, as possessing considerable dramatic
                    merit, and exhibiting “a pleasing picture of savage customs and manners.” To
                    conclude, the chief difference between the earlier and later forms of English
                    pantomime seems to lie in the fact that in the earlier Harlequin pervaded the
                    action, appearing in the comic scenes which alternated throughout the piece with
                    the serious which formed the backbone of the story. Columbine (originally in
                    Italian comedy Harlequin’s daughter) was generally a village maiden courted by
                    her adventurous lover, whom village constables pursued, thus performing the
                    laborious part of the policeman of the modern harlequinade. The brilliant scenic
                    effects were of course accumulated, instead of upon the transformation scene,
                    upon the last scene of all, which in modern pantomime follows upon the shadowy
                    chase of the characters called the <hi rend="italic">rally.</hi> The commanding
                    influence of the clown, to whom pantaloon is attached as friend, flatterer, and
                    foil, seems to be of comparatively modern growth; the most famous of his craft
                    was undoubtedly Joseph Grimaldi (1779-1837), of whom Charles Dickens in his
                    youth edited a biography. His memory is above all connected with the famous
                    pantomime of <hi rend="italic">Mother Goose,</hi> produced at Covent Garden in
                    1806. It boots not to enumerate favourites of later days; the type of Christmas
                    pantomime cherished by a generation now passing away has been preserved from
                    oblivion in Thackeray’s <hi rend="italic">Sketches and Travels in London.</hi>
                    The species still maintains its hold over sections of the grown-up public, and,
                    though now only cultivated in a few of the leading London theatres, appears at
                    Christmas 1883-84, according to professional statistics, to have multiplied
                    itself in the capital alone by thirteen examples.</p>
