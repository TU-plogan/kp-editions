                    which followed on the accession of Nerva. Their relative value consists in the
                    truth, freedom, and power with which they expressed the better spirit of their
                    time, commented on its vices and follies, and described the actual personages,
                    the prevailing types of character, and the fashions and pursuits—the “quicquid
                    agunt homines ”—by which it was marked. Of these four representatives of the
                    most distinctly national branch of Roman literature—Lucilius, Horace, Persius,
                    and Juvenal—Persius is the least important. He is indeed inferior to none of
                    them in the purity and sincerity with which he expresses ⅛e best spirit of his
                    age; but he was inferior in literary originality and vigour to Lucilius, in
                    literary art to Horace and Juvenal,—less powerful in his denunciation of evil
                    than Lucilius and Juvenal, less searching in his criticism than Horace,—less
                    true to life in his delineation of men and manners than the two earlier
                    satirists, less powerful in his effects than the latest among them. This
                    inferiority is to be ascribed partly to the circumstances of his age. Its
                    literature was more artificial, and also more opposed to the true principles of
                    art, than that of any other stage in the development of Roman letters. The
                    generation which succeeded the Augustan age—the generation which lived <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n691/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0691-0662"/> under Tiberius, Gaius, and Claudius—had not the
                    genius to originate a literature of its own nor the sense of security which
                    would enable it to perpetuate the literary accomplishment of the preceding age.
                    No period between the Ciceronian era and the reign of Hadrian was so
                    unproductive. The accession of the young emperor, in whom were ultimately
                    realized the worst vices of the tyrant along with the most despicable weaknesses
                    of the <hi rend="italic">litterateur</hi> and <hi rend="italic">artiste—</hi>
                    “scenicus ille” is the term of contempt applied to him in Tacitus—gave a fresh
                    impulse to that fashion of versemaking which Horace remarked as almost universal
                    among his educated contemporaries, and which was stimulated by the rhetorical
                    education of the day. But the writers of the Neronian age had neither the genius
                    nor the true sense of art which distinguished the Ciceronian and Augustan ages,
                    nor had they acquired the cultivated appreciation and good taste of the later
                    Flavian era, nor were they animated by that sense of recovered freedom of speech
                    and thought which gave to Roman literature its two last great representatives.
                    The writing of the Neronian age was, for the most part, a crude and ambitious
                    effort to produce sensational effects by rhetorical emphasis. Of its
                    representatives four can still be read with a certain though by no means an
                    unmixed pleasure,—Seneca, Lucan, Petronius, and Persius. Of these Persius had
                    least of the true literary gift. He had neither the smooth and fluent elegance
                    of Seneca, the “ingenium amoenum et auribus illius temporis accommodatum”
                    attributed to him by Tacitus, nor the rhetorical passion of Lucan, nor the
                    cynical realism and power of representation which enabled Petronius to originate
                    a new form of literature. Persius could not have become a satirist of the type
                    of Petronius or of Martial: he could not have treated human degradation in a
                    spirit of cynical sympathy or of amused tolerance. On the other hand earnest
                    satire directed against its legitimate objects, the emperor and his favourites,
                    could not at such a time express itself openly. “Pone Tigellinum” is an
                    expressive reminder that it was safer to write sickly sentimentalism about
                    “Phyllis and Hypsipyle” than to assume the rôle of Lucilius.</p>
                <p>But apart from the influence of his time and the natural limitations of his
                    genius, the personal circumstances of Persius were unfavourable to success in
                    the branch of literature to which he devoted himself. The shortness of his life
                    and the retirement in which it was spent, his studious tastes, his delicate
                    health, and that which is most admirable in him, his exceptional moral purity,
                    all contributed to keep him ignorant of that world which it is the business of a
                    satirist to know. Lucilius, Horace, Petronius, Martial, Juvenal, were all men of
                    the world, who knew the life of their day by close personal contact with it, and
                    had no need to imagine it through the medium of impressions received from
                    literature, or situations invented as themes for rhetorical exercises. Some
                    aspects of his time, such as the outward signs of literary affectation and
                    effeminacy, did come within the range of Persius’s observation, and these he
                    describes with no want of the pungency, “Italum acetum,” characteristic of his
                    race. But from any intimate knowledge, even through the medium of conversation,
                    of the vices and vulgarities from which Petronius lifts the curtain he was
                    debarred by the purity alike of his moral instincts and of his taste. Thus his
                    satire, while able to lash “the sickly morals” of his time (“pallentes radere
                    mores ”) in fervid generalities, cannot perform the more important function of
                    probing them through living examples.</p>
                <p>But Roman satire had another function besides the representation and criticism of
                    men and manners. More than any other branch of literature it was the expression
                    of the writer’s own nature and convictions. The frank sincerity with which these
                    were expressed was a great cause of the personal hold which Lucilius had on his
                    readers; it is still one of the secrets of the personal charm of Horace. The
                    sympathy with which Persius was read in the early days of Christianity and the
                    enthusiasm which many readers have felt for him in modern times are mainly due
                    to the impression of character which he produces. But he is to be regarded
                    further, not as an isolated specimen of purity in an impure age, but as an
                    important -witness of that undercurrent of moral and spiritual sentiment which
                    gathered force as a protest against the corruption and tyranny of the first
                    century of the empire. The consciousness of moral evil which became intensified
                    during that period is very apparent when we compare the spirit of Cicero and
                    Horace, men in their own day seriously concerned with questions of conduct, with
                    that of Tacitus and Juvenal. This great inward change was stimulated and
                    directed by the teaching of Stoicism; and it was in the reign of Nero that
                    Stoicism gained its chief ascendency over educated men, and supplanted among the
                    adherents of the republic the fashionable Epicureanism of the days of Lucretius
                    and Horace. Of the Stoical spirit of that time, represented also by Seneca and
                    Lucan, Persius is the purest representative. His chief claim to consideration
                    is, not that he is a great poet, satirist, or humorist, or even an agreeable
                    writer, but that he is one of the earliest, and, amongst classical writers, one
                    of the most sincere preachers of a pure personal morality based on a spiritual
                    conception of religion.</p>
                <p>The impression of him produced by his writings is confirmed by the accounts
                    transmitted of his life, for which we are indebted to the contemporary
                    grammarian, Valerius Probus of Berytus. Written when the impression left by him
                    was fresh on the memory of his friends, it may be accepted as trustworthy in
                    regard both of outward facts and of the sentiments which he inspired.</p>
                <p>Well born and well connected, and the inheritor of a good estate, Persius lived
                    the uneventful life of a student, and was chiefly remarkable for his affection
                    for his friends, his teachers, and his family. He was a native of Etruria, a
                    district which contributed less than any other in Italy to the literary
                    distinction of Rome. And it is noticeable that, while Persius has all the
                    characteristic moral fervour of the more serious Roman writers, he shows less,
                    compared with those who have an important place in the national literature, of
                    that sensuous vivacity and susceptibility to beauty in art and nature with which
                    the purely Italian race was preeminently endowed. He was born at Volaterrae in
                    the year 34 A.D., and received his early education there. His father died when
                    he was six years of age, and his mother, Fulvia Sisennia, whose latter name by
                    its termination is indicative of an Etruscan stock, married a second time and
                    was soon again left a widow. In one of the satires he speaks of the eagerness
                    with which his father used to bring his friends to listen to his recitation of
                    the dying speech of Cato. It is not likely that at the age of six he could have
                    been so far advanced in his rhetorical education, and perhaps, though he uses
                    the word “pater,” this reminiscence, which is told not without satirical
                    colouring, may be a testimony to the interest which his stepfather took in
                    watching his progress. The nature of the lesson—“morituri verba Catonis”—is
                    suggestive of an early direction towards Stoicism given in his teaching; but by
                    what he tells us of his way of shirking his lessons and of his healthy
                    preference of play to work, he seems to have done what he could to escape the
                    doom of becoming a precocious prodigy. He was taken at the age of twelve to
                    Rome, and continued his education under the two most famous grammarians and
                    rhetoricians of the day, Remmius Palaemon and Virginius Flavus. The decisive
                    influence of his life was his friendship with the Stoic philosopher, Annaeus
                    Cornutus, whose <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n692/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0692-0663"/> pupil he became on assuming the “toga virilis” at
                    the age of sixteen. To the charm of this man’s conversation and teaching Persius
                    attributes his escape from the temptations to a life of pleasure, to which
                    youths of good position and fortune were exposed at Rome. Besides his friendship
                    with Cornutus, he enjoyed during ten years of his life the intimate friendship
                    of Thrasea Paetus, the noblest specimen of Stoicism which the Roman world
                    produced in the first century of the empire. This intimacy was probably due, in
                    the first place, to the relationship of Persius to the younger Arria, the wife
                    of Thrasea. Though a much younger man, he gained so completely the affection of
                    Thrasea that he often went with him as the companion of his travels. The
                    knowledge that he was an intimate member of the circle of Thrasea and Helvidius
                    gives an additional interest to the opinions of Persius on literature and
                    conduct, and also to the indications of his attitude towards the reigning power.
                    He was introduced also to Seneca, but was not much attracted by his genius. The
                    influence of Thrasea may have had something to do with this want of sympathy.
                    The true Stoic, who “kept as holidays the birthdays of the two Brutuses and of
                    Cassius,” was not likely to have been among the admirers of the apologist for
                    parricide.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cf. “Ergo non

                    >Ann.,</hi> xiv. 11).</p></note></p>
                <p>He was also intimate with some of the younger poets of the time, especially with
                    Caesius Bassus, to whom he addresses his sixth satire. He was acquainted with
                    his younger and more famous contemporary, Lucan, who is said, with the generous
                    impulses which seemed to have been mixed with the fatal weaknesses of his
                    character, to have been carried away by great enthusiasm when he first heard
                    Persius reciting some of his verses. His biographer tells us that the impulse to
                    writing satire was derived from reading a book of Lucilius. He was evidently a
                    diligent student both of him and of Horace. He himself justifies his adoption of
                    this mode of writing by his natural tendency to satiric criticism,—“sum
                    petulanti splene cachinno.” But his satire shows as little of the humorous
                    amusement in contemplating the comedy of life, which is one of the motives of
                    the satire of Horace, as of the fierce indignation which the tragic spectacle of
                    its crimes produced in Juvenal. We should rather be inclined to conclude that,
                    as his Stoicism was a protest against the vices and tyranny of the time, so his
                    adoption of that masculine national form of literature which took its subjects
                    from the actual experience of Roman life was a protest against the effeminate
                    style and exotic themes which were then fashionable with the social class to
                    which he belonged.</p>
                <p>There is no trace in his writings of any participation in the active interests of
                    public or professional life. More than any other Roman writer, except perhaps
                    Lucretius, he chose the “secretum iter et fallentis semita vitae” (the flowery
                    path that winds by stealth). But his life, if apparently much happier, was not
                    enriched by the fulness of contemplative interest and of delight in nature which
                    lightened up the gloom of the older poet. His latest satire, addressed to his
                    friend Caesius Bassus, is written from the port of Luna on the Gulf of Genoa;
                    but, while celebrating the mildness of its winter climate, grateful to him as an
                    invalid, he is silent about the charm of its natural beauty. He died at the age
                    of twenty-eight, on one of his own estates on the Via Appia, within eight miles
                    of Rome. His satires were revised by Cornutus, and edited at his own request by
                    Caesius Bassus. The former is said to have alteréd into a vague generality an
                    expression reflecting on the poetical gifts of Nero, a subject as dangerous to
                    deal with as his vices and tyranny. Dying in the year 62 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> Persius did not witness the worst crimes of that reign, and escaped
                    the fate which awaited Seneca, Lucan, and Thrasea.</p>
                <p>His character is thus summed up by his biographer. “He was of a most gentle
                    disposition, of maidenly modesty, handsome in person, and marked by exemplary
                    affection towards his mother, sister, and aunt. He lived soberly and chastely.”
                    The characteristic of “virginalis pudicitia” it is natural to associate with the
                    pure family atmosphere in which he lived; and the existence of cultivated women
                    who could exercise such an influence is a warning not to judge Roman society,
                    even in its worst time, altogether from the representation of Juvenal. The
                    letters of Pliny amply confirm the belief that the world was not all so bad as
                    it appears in that representation. The tone of the biographer as well as his
                    explicit statements attest the warm affection which Persius inspired in his
                    lifetime. Mere asceticism unaccompanied by other graces of character cannot
                    account for this sentiment of affection; and the Roman world had a keen eye to
                    detect insincere professions of austerity. But, while there are many signs of
                    inexperience of life and much forced and artificial writing in Persius, there is
                    in the expression of his deepest convictions an unmistakable ring of
                    genuineness. He seems to love virtue without effort, because his nature finds in
                    the love and practice of virtue the secret of happiness. There is also in the
                    personal addresses to his friends, as in that to Macrinus, a tone of genial
                    sympathy with the innocent enjoyments of life. In the expression of affection
                    for those whom he loved no ancient writer is so cordial and single-minded,
                    except one, as much separated from him by the licence of his life as by the
                    force of his genius, who also died in early youth, the ardent true-hearted poet
                    of Verona.</p>
                <p>Persius is said to have written slowly and seldom, and, though he seems to have
                    composed, probably before he devoted himself to satire, a tragedy on a Roman
                    subject, an account in verse of some of his travels, and some lines on the elder
                    Arria (none of which were ever given to the world), the only result of his
                    literary activity is the short book of six satires which we now possess. The
                    contrast between the small amount of his contributions to literature and the
                    reputation which he enjoyed is noticed by two ancient writers, who indicate
                    their appreciation of his value, Quintilian and Martial. The satires are not
                    only fewer in number than those of Horace and Juvenal, but they are for the most
                    part shorter. Only one of them, the first, fulfils the proper function of satire
                    by representing any phase of the life of the time and pointing its moral. It
                    exposes by personal sketches and representative imitations the fashionable taste
                    in poetry, and marks its connexion with the luxury and effeminacy of the age.
                    The satire was believed in ancient times to be aimed at the emperor; and this is
                    confirmed, not only by the tradition of the substitution by Cornutus of the
                    vague generality “quis non” for the pointed “Mida rex,” but also by the parody
                    “Torva Mimalloneis implerunt cornua bombis,” &amp;e., which is in keeping with
                    the account we have in Tacitus and other writers of the style of the emperor’s
                    compositions. In an age abounding in informers it would have been dangerous to
                    have published or even to have read before a circle of friends a more direct
                    comment; but the attitude of Persius towards the absolute ruler of the day may
                    be inferred from other references in the satires, as from the passage iii. 35,
                    beginning “Magne pater divum”; and again at iv. 20, in the words, “Ast ego
                    Dinomaches,” we may suspect a protest against the degradation of the Roman world
                    in submitting to be governed by the son of Agrippina. Even in the abstinence
                    from one single word of compliment to the ruling power we enjoy an agreeable
                    contrast to the time-serving of Seneca and the adulation of Lucan.</p>
                <p>While the first satire is, like most of those of Lucilius, Horace, and Juvenal,
                    essentially representative, and has its motive in the desire to paint in satiric
                    colours a prevailing fashion and some of the actual personages or types of
                    character of the day, all the rest are essentially didactic and have their
                    motive in the desire to enforce and illustrate some lesson of morality or tenet
                    of Stoicism. The second is an admirable sermon on prayer, and illustrates by
                    examples that union of worldliness and covetousness with religious faith and
                    practice which has not been absolutely confined to Paganism. The third is aimed
                    at the exposure and correction of the weakness of character which, in spite of
                    good resolutions, succumbs to the attacks of sloth and pleasure. The fourth,
                    suggested by the first <hi rend="italic">Alcibiades of</hi> Plato, though
                    perhaps also written with covert reference to one whose “Greek levity” may have
                    prompted him to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n693/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0693-0664"/> pose as a Roman Alcibiades, is directed against
                    the arrogant claims of a sensual youth to deal, on the ground of his hereditary
                    distinction, with affairs of state and to govern men. The fifth, the most
                    elaborate of all, illustrates the Stoical doctrine of the difference between
                    true and false freedom, and shows the power of avarice, luxury, the passion of
                    love, ambition, and superstition to make men slaves. It is the same subject as
                    that which Horace treats in the third satire of the second book; but it is
                    treated with neither the irony nor the direct knowledge of life which Horace
                    applies to it. The last satire is chiefly devoted to a subject which played a
                    large part in the satire of Horace and Lucilius,—the proper use of money. In all
                    these latter pieces the subjects are the commonplaces of satire and moral
                    disquisition, illustrated rather by new versions of old characters than by
                    pictures of the living men and women of the day. Though he expresses admiration
                    for the spirit of Lucilius and the old comedy, he seems to keep clear of all
                    personality and detraction. He professes “ingenuo culpam defigere ludo,” and,
                    whatever may be thought of his humour, he at least always writes in the spirit
                    of a gentleman. So far as there is real contact with life in his satires, it is
                    with the vanity and weakness of the class to which he himself belonged that he
                    shows familiarity. Other sketches, however, show original observation, as that
                    of the provincial aedile, of the brawny centurion who laughs at all
                    philosophers, and, the most elaborate of all, that of the man torn asunder by
                    his avarice and his love of luxury, λvho shrinks from the hard roughing of a
                    sea-voyage, to which he is prompted by his cupidity (i. 129, ii. 76-87, V.
                    141-150).</p>
                <p>In point of form he aims at reproducing the dialogue of the old “satura,” to
                    which Horace finally adhered. But for the dramatic vivacity of ordinary speech
                    he substitutes the curt questions and answers of Stoical disquisition. This is a
                    great source of the obscurity of his writing. Some of his satires take the form
                    of a familiar epistle, but in them also there is a large intermixture of
                    dialogue. In style, while he protests against other modes of affectation, he
                    cannot escape the perverse fashion of forced and exaggerated expression. While
                    disclaiming imaginative inspiration and avoiding poetical ornament, he falls
                    into the opposite extreme of excessive realism, and disguises his plain meaning
                    under contortions of metaphor, taken from the forge, the potter’s wheel, the
                    carpenter’s rule, the baker’s oven, &amp;c. He is fond, too, of the realism of
                    physical expression to denote states of mind and feeling, such as “fibra,”
                    “pulpa,” “gluto,” &amp;c.; and this tendency, combined perhaps with the wish to
                    imitate Lucilius, has led him occasionally to disfigure the purity of his pages
                    with unnecessary coarseness. It is only rarely, and when he is at his best, that
                    we are not conscious of a constant strain to express his meaning with
                    unnecessary emphasis. Though single phrases of forcible condensation can be
                    quoted from him, yet almost every period and paragraph seems to have been made
                    harsh and obscure with the purpose of arresting attention. In the pictures which
                    he draws from life, as in that of the reciting poet in the first satire, he
                    strives by minuteness and exaggeration of detail to produce a strong sensational
                    impression; and this is still more observable in those numerous cases where he
                    distorts and caricatures the temperate and truthful effects of Horace’s
                    sketches. No Latin writer is less natural. His works have engaged the industry
                    of many commentators both in ancient and modern times. None could claim less the
                    praise which Martial claims for his own, of “pleasing grammarians without
                    needing the aid of their interpretation.”</p>
                <p>It is not, accordingly, among writers but among moralists that he holds a high
                    place. Among the professors of Stoicism some were better writers, others were
                    greater men; no one was purer in all his instincts, more sincere in all his
                    nature, or inspired with a more genuine enthusiasm for virtue. It is when he
                    gives expression to this enthusiasm and to his single-hearted affection for his
                    friends that he is able for a few lines to write with simple force and with
                    impassioned earnestness. Such lines as these—</p>
                <p>“Compositum ius fasque animae, sanctosque recessus Mentis, et incoctum generoso
                    pectus honesto” (ii. 73, 74);</p>
                <p>“Quid sumus et quidnam victuri gignimur . . . . . . quem te deus esse</p>
                <p>Jussit et humana qua parte locatus es in re” (iii. 66-72), &amp;c.; are in a
                    strain more in accordance with the best modern ideas of man’s highest duty and
                    his true position in the world than anything to be found in the other satirists
                    of Rome. The aim of Lucilius was to make men good citizens. He judged their life
                    by, the standard of public virtue and utility. The aim of Horace’s satire was to
                    make men happier in themselves and more agreeable in their intercourse with one
                    another. He judged them by the standard of good sense, good feeling, and good
                    manners. The aim of Juvenal—so far as it was sincere—was to raise human life
                    from the degradation into which it had fallen. The standard by which he judged
                    the men of his day was that of the manliness and dignity realized in the best
                    ages of the republic. The aim of Persius was to make men live in accordance with
                    the dictates of a pure conscience. His standard was that ideal of human conduct
                    which has arisen out of the aspirations and convictions of an enlightened
                    theism.</p>
                <p>The best recent editions of Persius are those of 0. Jahn and of Professor
                    Conington. The edition of Mr Pretor is also to be named. All of these contain,
                    in their introductions, important contributions to the critical estimate of
                    Persius. An excellent account of his life, character, and writings is to be
                    found in Martha’s Les Moralistes Romains, and an interesting, though somewhat
                    disparaging, criticism of him as a writer is contained in Nisard’s Poëtes Latins
                    de la Decadence. (W. Y. S.)</p>
