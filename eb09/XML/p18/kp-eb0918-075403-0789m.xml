                    special pleasure in making himself thoroughly familiar with Virgil. At the same
                    time he was diligent in his scientific pursuits preparatory to the medical
                    profession he intended to follow, and, although the botany and other branches he
                    made himself familiar with were never actually turned to account in the business
                    of life, his acquired knowledge gave him material for literary purposes. But,
                    over and above these studies, Philips was a careful and critical reader of the
                    English poets that fell in with his tastes, and devoted much time to Chaucer,
                    Spenser, and Milton. When he began to write, the influence of the two former
                    told to some extent on his diction, and he was so enamoured of the strenuous
                    movement and the resonant harmonies of Milton’s blank verse that he adapted the
                    form of all his original English writings to that supreme model. Were it for
                    nothing else, John Philips will be remembered as the first to have a genuine
                    literary appreciation of Milton. He was well known in his college for
                    scholarship, taste, and literary resource long before publishing any of his
                    writings, but the appearance of <hi rend="italic">The Splendid Shilling,</hi>
                    about the year 1703, at once brought him under the favourable notice of critics
                    and readers of poetry. The <hi rend="italic">Tatler</hi> (No. 250) hailed the
                    poet as the writer of “the best burlesque poem in the British language,” nor
                    will the modern reader care to detract much from this verdict, even granting
                    that the model and the imitation, mutually constituting a great revelation to
                    the literary dictators of the period, would cause them considerable surprise.
                    Philips in this poem showed the dexterous ease that comes of long study and
                    perfect familiarity, combined with fertility of resource and humorous ingenuity
                    of application. One important result of the work was the interested notice of
                    the earl of Oxford and Lord Bolingbroke. The poet went to London, and <pb

                    which he did in his favourite manner, but without conspicuous success. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Blenheim,</hi> published in 1705, lacks, of course, the element of
                    burlesque, and it is difficult to resist the impression that the poet must have
                    felt himself restrained and hampered by the stern necessity of being seriously
                    sublime. A year later (1706) Philips published, in two books, his didactic poem
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Cyder,</hi> which is his most ambitious work and is
                    written in imitation of Virgil’s <hi rend="italic">Georgies.</hi> While there is
                    no denying the poet’s admirable familiarity with his original, or his skilful
                    employment of the Miltonic blank verse, or the sustained energy and grace of
                    some of the episodes in the second part, or even his intimate knowledge of the
                    minute details connected with the management of fruit, it cannot be said that
                    the work is a notable contribution to English poetry. It is streaked with
                    genius, but, like the Latin <hi rend="italic">Ode to St John</hi> (and, for that
                    matter, the author’s other works as well), it is little more than the expression
                    of a poetical scholar feeling his way outwards into life. Philips never got
                    beyond the enjoyment of his pipe and his study, both of which figure prominently
                    in all his poems. He was meditating a still further work on the Last Day, when
                    he was cut off by consumption, in 1708, at the early age of thirty-two. His
                    friend Edmund Smith, himself a distinguished scholar and poet, wrote an elegy on
                    the occasion, which Johnson says “justice must place among the best elegies
                    which our language can show.” Philips was buried at Hereford, and a monument to
                    his memory, with an inscription from the pen of Atterbury, was erected between
                    those of Chaucer and Drayton in Westminster Abbey.</p>
