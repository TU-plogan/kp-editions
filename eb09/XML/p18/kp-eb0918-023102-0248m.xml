                <p><label type="entry">PAPYRUS</label>, the paper reed, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyperus Papyrus</hi> of Linnaeus, was in ancient times widely cultivated in the
                    Delta of Egypt, where it was used for various purposes, and especially as a
                    writing material. As, however, the plant is now extinct in Lower Egypt, it is
                    believed that it was not indigenous there, but was probably introduced from
                    Nubia, where it is found at the present time, as well as in Abyssinia.
                    Theophrastus <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Plant.,</hi> iv. 10) adds that it likewise
                    grew in Syria; and, according to Pliny, it was also a native plant of the Niger
                    and Euphrates. From one of its ancient Egyptian names, <hi rend="italic"
                    >P-apu,</hi> was derived its Greek title 7rατrυpos, Lat. <hi rend="italic"
                    >papyrus.</hi> By Herodotus it is always called <hi rend="italic">βυβλoς,</hi> a
                    word which was apparently also of Egyptian origin. The first accurate
                    description of the plant is given by Theophrastus, from whom we learn that it
                    grew in shallows of 2 cubits (about 3 feet) or less, its main root being of the
                    thickness of a man’s wrist, and 10 cubits in length. From this root, which lay
                    horizontally, smaller roots pushed down into the mud, and the stem of the plant
                    sprang up to the height of 4 cubits, being triangular and tapering in form. The
                    tufted head or umbel is likened by Pliny to a thyrsus.</p>
                <p>The various uses to which the papyrus plant was applied are also enumerated by
                    Theophrastus. Of the head nothing could be made but garlands for the shrines of
                    the gods; but the wood of the root was employed in the manufacture of different
                    utensils as well as for fuel. Of the stem of the plant were made boats, sails,
                    mats, cloth, cords, and, above all, writing material (τά <hi rend="italic"
                    >βιβλία).</hi> The pith was also a common article of food, and was eaten both
                    cooked and in its natural state. Herodotus too notices its consumption as food
                    (ii. 92), and incidentally mentions that it provided the material of which the
                    priests’ sandals were made (ii. 37). He likewise refers to the use of byblus as
                    tow for caulking the seams of ships; and the statement of Theophrastus that King
                    Antigonus made the rigging of his fleet of the same material is illustrated by
                    the ship’s cable, <hi rend="italic">oπλov βvβλιvov,</hi> wherewith the doors
                    were fastened when Ulysses slew the suitors in his hall <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Odyss.,</hi> xxi. 390). That the plant was itself used also as the principal
                    material in the construction of light skiffs suitable for the navigation of the
                    pools and shallows of the Nile, and even of the river itself, is shown by
                    sculptures of the period of the fourth dynasty, in which men are represented in
                    the act of building a boat with stems cut from a neighbouring plantation of
                    papyrus (Lepsius, <hi rend="italic">Denkm.,</hi> ii. 12). It is to boats of this
                    description that Isaiah probably refers in the “vessels of bulrushes upon the
                    waters” (xviii. 2). If the Hebrew gome (**pi) also is to be identified with the
                    Egyptian papyrus, something may be said in favour of the tradition that the
                    bulrushes <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n249/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0249-0232"/> of which the ark was composed in which the infant
                    Moses was laid, in the flags by the river’s brink, were in fact the latter
                    plant. Ancient authors have likewise referred to the adaptation of the papyrus
                    to other domestic purposes, both culinary and medicinal. But it seems hardly
                    credible that the <hi rend="italic">Cyperus Papyrus</hi> could alone have
                    sufficed for the many uses to which it is said to have been applied. Wilkinson
                    has pointed out <hi rend="italic">(Anc. Egyptians,</hi> ii. 121) that, the
                    cultivation of this variety being limited to certain districts, where, moreover,
                    it was a monopoly of the Government, it cannot have been employed for so many
                    purposes; and we may therefore conclude that several plants of the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyperus</hi> were comprehended under the head of byblus or
                    papyrus—an opinion which is supported by the words of Strabo, who mentions both
                    inferior and superior qualities. The <hi rend="italic">Cyperus dives</hi> is
                    still grown in Egypt, and is used to this day for many of the purposes named by
                    ancient writers.</p>
                <p>The widespread use of papyrus as a writing material throughout the ancient world
                    is attested by early writers, and by documents and sculptures. In addition to
                    the names of the plant, which were also applied to the material, the latter was
                    also known as χάρτας, <hi rend="italic">charta.</hi> Papyrus rolls are
                    represented in ancient Egyptian wall-paintings; and extant examples of the rolls
                    themselves are sufficiently numerous. The most ancient of these, known, from the
                    name of its former owner, as the Prisse papyrus, and now preserved at Paris,
                    contains a work composed in the reign of a king of the fifth dynasty, and is
                    computed to be itself of the age of upwards of 2000 years <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> The papyri discovered in Egypt have generally been found in tombs,
                    and in the hands, or swathed with the bodies, of mummies. The ritual of the
                    dead, which in its entirety or in an abridged form was buried with every person
                    of consequence from the eighteenth dynasty to the Roman period, is most
                    frequently the subject. And, besides the ritual and religious rolls, there are
                    the hieratic, civil and literary, documents, and the demotic and enchorial
                    papyri, relating generally to sales of property. Coptic papyri usually contain
                    Biblical or religious tracts or monastic deeds.</p>
                <p>The early use of papyrus among the Greeks is proved by the reference of Herodotus
                    (v. 58) to its introduction among the lonians. An inscription of 407 B.c.
                    records the sale of two sheets (χάρται δυο) at Athens, for two drachmas and four
                    obols. Greek papyri have been found in Egypt of great importance both for their
                    palaeographical and literary worth. The first instalment which came to light, as
                    late as the year 1778, consisted of some fifty rolls, which were discovered in
                    the neighbourhood of Memphis; but all, with one single exception, were
                    carelessly destroyed. More fortunate were the documents found near the Serapeum
                    of Memphis, and connected with that temple; and further discoveries of valuable
                    texts of Homer, Hyperides, and other classical writers have rewarded later
                    searches (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Palaeography).</hi> The numerous rolls found
                    in the ruins of Herculaneum generally contain the less interesting works of
                    writers of the Epicurean school.</p>
                <p>Papyrus also made its way into Italy, but at how early a period there is nothing
                    to show. Under the empire its use must have been extensive, for not only was it
                    required for the production of books, but it was also universally employed for
                    domestic purposes, correspondence, and legal documents. So indispensable did it
                    become that it is reported that in the reign of Tiberius the scarcity and
                    dearness of the material, caused by a failure of the papyrus crop, nearly
                    brought on a riot (Pliny, <hi rend="italic">N.</hi><hi rend="italic">II.</hi>,
                    xiii. 13).</p>
                <p>The account which Pliny (A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi rend="italic"
                    >H.,</hi> xiii. 11-13) has transmitted to us of the manufacture of the writing
                    material from the papyrus plant should be taken strictly to refer to the process
                    followed in his own time; but, with some differences in details, the same
                    general method of treatment had doubtlessly been practised from time immemorial.
                    His text, however, is so confused, both from obscurity of style and from
                    corruptions in the MSS., that there is much difference of opinion as to the
                    meaning of many words and phrases employed in his narrative, and their
                    application in particular points of detail. In one important particular,
                    however, affecting the primary construction of the material, there can no longer
                    be any doubt. The old idea that it was made from layers or pellicules growing
                    between the rind and a central stalk has been abandoned, as it has been proved
                    that the plant, like other reeds, contains only a cellular pith within the rind.
                    The stem was in fact cut into longitudinal strips for the purpose of being
                    converted into the writing material, those from the centre of the plant being
                    the broadest and most valuable. The strips <hi rend="italic">(philyrae),</hi>
                    which were cut with a sharp knife or some such instrument, were laid on a board
                    side by side to the required width, thus forming a layer <hi rend="italic"
                    >(scheda),</hi> across which another layer of shorter strips was laid at right
                    angles. The two layers thus “woven ”—Pliny uses the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >texere</hi> in describing this part of the process—formed a sheet <hi
                    rend="italic">(plagula,</hi> or net), which was then soaked in water of the
                    Nile. The mention of a particular water has caused trouble to the commentators.
                    Some have supposed that certain chemical properties of which the Nile water was
                    possessed acted as a glue or cement to cause the two layers to adhere; others,
                    with more reason, that glutinous matter contained in the material itself was
                    solved by the action of water, whether from the Nile or any other source; and
                    others again read in Pliny’s words an implication that a paste was actually
                    used. Be this as it may, the sheet was finally pressed and dried in the sun. Any
                    roughness was levelled by polishing with ivory or a smooth shell. But the
                    material was also subject to other defects, such as moisture lurking between the
                    layers, which might be detected by strokes of the mallet; spots or stains; and
                    spongy strips <hi rend="italic">(taeniae),</hi> in which the ink would run and
                    spoil the sheet. When such faults occurred, the papyrus must be re-made. To form
                    a roll the sheets were joined together with paste (glue being too hard), but not
                    more than twenty sheets in a roll <hi rend="italic">(scapus).</hi> As, however,
                    there are still extant rolls consisting of more than the prescribed number of
                    sheets, either the reading of <hi rend="italic">vicenae</hi> is corrupt, or the
                    number was not constant in all times. The best sheet formed the first or outside
                    sheet of the roll, and the others were joined on in order of quality, so that
                    the worst sheets were in the centre of the roll. This arrangement was adopted,
                    not for the purpose of fraudulently selling bad material under cover of the
                    better exterior, but in order that the outside of the roll should be composed of
                    that which would best stand wear and tear. Besides, in case of the entire roll
                    not being filled with the text, the unused and inferior sheets at the end could
                    be better spared, and so might be cut off.</p>
                <p>The different kinds of papyrus writing material and their dimensions are also
                    enumerated by Pliny. The best quality, formed from the middle and broadest
                    strips of the plant, was originally named <hi rend="italic">hieratica,</hi> but
                    afterwards, in flattery of the emperor Augustus, it was called, after him, <hi
                    rend="italic">Augzιsta</hi>; and the <hi rend="italic">charta Livia,</hi> or
                    second quality, was so named in honour of his wife. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >hieratica</hi> thus descended to the third rank. The first two were 13 digiti,
                    or about 9⅜ inches in width; the <hi rend="italic">hieratica,</hi> 11 digiti or
                    8 inches. Next came the <hi rend="italic">charta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >amphitheatrica,</hi> named after the principal place of its manufacture, the
                    amphitheatre of Alexandria, of 9 αigiti or 6⅜ inches wide. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >charta Fanniana</hi> appears to have been a kind of papyrus worked up from the
                    <hi rend="italic">amphitheatrica,</hi> which by flattening and other methods was
                    increased in width by an inch, in the factory of a certain Fannius at Rome. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Saitica,</hi> which took its name from the city of Sais, and
                    was probably of 8 digiti or 5∣ inches, was of a common description. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Taeniotica,</hi> named apparently from the place of its
                    manufacture, a tongue of land (ταi∣dα) near Alexandria, was sold by weight, and
                    was of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n250/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0250-0233"/> uncertain width, perhaps from 4∣ to 5 inches. And
                    lastly there was the common packing-paper, the <hi rend="italic">charta
                    emporetica,</hi> of 6 digiti or <hi rend="italic">4</hi> j inches. Isidore <hi
                    rend="italic">(Etymol.,</hi> vi. 10) mentions yet another kind, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Corneliana,</hi> first made under C. Cornelius Gallus, prefect of
                    Egypt, which, however, may have ×been the same as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >amphitheatrica</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Fanniana.</hi> The name of the man who
                    had incurred the anger of Augustus may have been suppressed by the same
                    influence that expunged the episode of Gallus from the Fourth Géorgie (Birt, <hi
                    rend="italic">Antik. Buchwesen,</hi> p. 250). In the reign of the emperor
                    Claudius also another kind was introduced and entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Claudia.</hi> It had been found by experience that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >charta</hi><hi rend="italic">Aτιgusta</hi> was, from its fineness and porous
                    nature, ill suited for literary use; it was accordingly reserved for
                    correspondence only, and for other purposes was replaced by the new paper. The
                    <hi rend="italic">charta</hi><hi rend="italic">Claudia</hi> was made from a
                    composition of the first and second qualities, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Augusta,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Livia,</hi> a layer of the former being
                    backed with one of the latter; and the sheet was increased to nearly a foot in
                    width. The largest of all, however, was the <hi rend="italic">macrocollon,</hi>
                    probably of good quality and equal to the hieratic, and a cubit or nearly 18
                    inches wide. It was used by Cicero <hi rend="italic">(Epp. ad Attic.,</hi> xiii.
                    25; xvi. 3). The width, however, proved inconvenient, and the broad sheet was
                    liable to injury by tearing.</p>
                <p>An interesting question arises as to the accuracy of the different measurements
                    given by Pliny. His figures regarding the width of the different kinds of papyri
                    have generally been understood to concern the width (or height) of the rolls, as
                    distinguished from their length. It has, however, been observed that in practice
                    the width of extant rolls does not tally in any satisfactory degree with Pliny’s
                    measurements; and a more plausible explanation has been lately offered (Birt,
                    <hi rend="italic">Antik. Buchwesen,</hi> pp. 251 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> y</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi> that the breadth (not
                    height) of the individual sheets of which the rolls aι½ composed is referred
                    to.</p>
                <p>The first sheet of a roll was named <hi rend="italic">πρωτόκολΚον</hi>; the last,
                    <hi rend="italic">iσχaτoκoKKιov.</hi> Under the Romans, the former bore the name
                    of the comes largitionum, who had control of the manufacture, with the date and
                    name of place. It was the practice to cut away the portion thus marked; but in
                    case of legal documents this mutilation was forbidden by the laws of Justinian.
                    On the Arab conquest of Egypt in the 7th century, the manufacture was continued,
                    with the substitution of Arabic in marking the protocol. An instance of one of
                    these Arab signatures is preserved in a bull of Pope John VIII. of the year
                    876.</p>
                <p>Varro’s statement, repeated by Pliny, that papyrus was first made in Alexander’s
                    time, should probably be taken to mean that its manufacture, which till then had
                    been a Government monopoly, was relieved from all restrictions. It is not
                    probable, however, that it was ever manufactured from the native plant anywhere
                    but in Egypt. At Rome there was certainly some kind of industry in papyrus, the
                    <hi rend="italic">charta Fanniana,</hi> already referred to, being an instance
                    in illustration. But it seems probable that this industry was confined to the
                    re-making of material imported into Italy, as in the case of the <hi
                    rend="italic">charta</hi><hi rend="italic">Claudia.</hi> This second
                    manufacture, however, is thought to have been detrimental to the papyrus, as it
                    would then have been in a dried condition requiring artificial aids, such as a
                    more liberal use of gum or paste, in the process. The more brittle condition of
                    the Latin papyri found at Herculaneum has been instanced as the evil result of
                    this re-making of the material.</p>
                <p>According to Strabo the Romans obtained the papyrus plant from Lake Trasimene and
                    other lakes of Etruria, but this statement is unsupported by any other authority
                    and appears to have been made in error. At a later period, however, a papyrus
                    was cultivated in Sicily, which has been identified by Pariatore with the Syrian
                    variety <hi rend="italic">(Cyperus syriacus'),</hi> far exceeding in height the
                    Egyptian plant, and having a more drooping head. It grew in the east and south
                    of the island, where it was probably introduced during the Arab occupation. It
                    was seen in the 10th century, by the Arab traveller Ibn-Haukal, in the
                    neighbourhood of Palermo, where it throve luxuriantly in the pools of the
                    Papireto, a stream to which it lent its name. From it paper was made for the
                    sultan’s use. But in the 13th century it began to fail, and in 1591 the drying
                    up of the Papireto caused the extinction of the plant in that district. It is
                    still to be seen at Syracuse, but it was probably transplanted thither at a
                    later time, and reared only as a curiosity, as there is no notice of it to be
                    found previous to 1674. It is with this Syracusan plant that some attempts have
                    been made in recent years to manufacture a writing material similar to ancient
                    papyrus.</p>
                <p>Even after the introduction of vellum, papyrus still continued in use among the
                    Romans, and was not entirely superseded until a late date. It ceased, however,
                    to be used for books sooner than for documents. In the 5th century St Augustine
                    apologizes for sending a letter written on vellum instead of the more usual
                    substance, papyrus <hi rend="italic">(Ep.</hi> xv.); and Cassiodorus <hi
                    rend="italic">(Farr.,</hi> xi. 38), writing in the 6th century, indulges in a
                    high-flown panegyric on the plant and its value, and refers to the abolition of
                    the tax on paper by the emperor Theodoric. Of mediaeval Greek papyri a very few
                    remains containing Biblical or patristic matter have survived, and one or two
                    fragments of Graeco-Latin glossaries have been published. Of Greek documents,
                    apart from monastic deeds discovered in Egypt, there are two which are well
                    known, viz., the fragmentary epistle of Constantine V. to Pepin le Bref, of 753
                    or 756, now preserved at Paris, and the papyrus containing the subscriptions to
                    the council of Constantinople of 680, at Vienna. Mediaeval Latin MSS. on papyrus
                    in book form are still extant in different libraries of Europe, viz.:—the
                    Homilies of St Avitus, of the 6th century, at Paris; Sermons and Epistles of St
                    Augustine, of the 6th or 7th century, at Paris and Geneva; works of Hilary, of
                    the 6th century, at Vienna; fragments of the Digests, of the 6th century, at
                    Pommersfeld; the Antiquities of Josephus, of the 7th century, at Milan; Isidore,
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Contemptu</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mundi,</hi> of the 7th century, at St Gall; and the Register of the Church of
                    Ravenna, of the 10th century, at Munich. Of Latin documents on papyrus <hi
                    rend="italic">(tomus</hi> was the technical word of the Middle Ages to designate
                    such a document), the first to be mentioned are the fragments of two imperial
                    rescripts addressed to an official in Egypt in the 5th century. The employment
                    of this material in Italy for legal purposes is sufficiently illustrated by the
                    large number of documents which were preserved at Ravenna, and date from the 5th
                    to the 10th century. In the papal chancery too it was used at an early date,
                    evidence of its presence there being found in the biography of Gregory I. But of
                    the extant papal deeds the earliest to which an authentic date can be attached
                    is a bull of Stephen III. of the year 757, while the latest appears to be one of
                    1004. There is evidence to show that in the 10th century papyrus was used, to
                    the exclusion of other materials, in papal deeds. In France it was a common
                    writing substance in the 6th century (Gregory of Tours, <hi rend="italic">Hist.
                    Franc.,</hi> V. 5). Of the Merovingian period there are still extant several
                    papyrus deeds, the earliest of the year 625, the latest of 692. Under
                    Charlemagne and his successors it was not used. By the 12th century the
                    manufacture of papyrus had entirely ceased, as appears from a note by Eustathius
                    in his commentary on the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> xxi. 390.</p>
