                    father was minister. He was educated at the free school of Steyning, and entered
                    Trinity College, Cambridge, at the age of thirteen. During his university career
                    he made himself an accomplished linguist, and even before he took his Μ. A.
                    degree (in 1630) he was engaged in learned correspondence with Briggs and other
                    mathematicians. His great reputation and the influence of Sir William Boswell,
                    the English resident, with the States-General procured his election in 1643 to
                    the chair of mathematics in Amsterdam, whence he removed in 1646, on the
                    invitation of the prince of Orange, to Breda, where he remained till 1652.</p>
                <p>From 1654 to 1658 Pell acted as Cromwell’s political agent to the Protestant
                    cantons of Switzerland. On his return to England he took orders and was
                    appointed by Charles II. to the rectory of Fobbing in Essex, and in 1673 he was
                    presented by Bishop Sheldon to the rectory of Laindon in the same county. His
                    devotion to mathematical science seems to have interfered alike with his
                    advancement in the church and with the proper management of his private affairs.
                    Cheated, it is said, by his tenants and relations, he was reduced to the utmost

                    in the King’s Bench prison. He lived, on the invitation of Dr Whistler, for a
                    short time in 1682 at the College of Physicians, but died 12th December 1685 at
                    the house of Mr Cothorne, reader of the church of St Giles in the Fields. He was
                    buried at the expense of the rector of this church and of Dr Busby, the master
                    of Westminster School. Many of Pell’s manuscripts fell into the hands of Dr
                    Busby, and afterwards came into the possession of the Royal Society; they are
                    still preserved in something like forty folio volumes, which contain, not only
                    Pell’s own memoirs, but much of his correspondence with the mathematicians of
                    his time.</p>
                <p>The Diophantine analysis was a favourite subject with Pell; he lectured on it at
                    Amsterdam; and he is now best remembered for his solution of the indeterminate
                    equation, <hi rend="italic">ax</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> t</hi><hi
