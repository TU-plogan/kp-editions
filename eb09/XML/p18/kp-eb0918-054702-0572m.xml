                    membrane investing the abdominal and pelvic cavities and their contained
                    viscera. It may exist in an acute or a chronic form, and may be either localized
                    in one part or generally diffused.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Acute peritonitis</hi> may attack persons of both sexes and of
                    any age. It is sometimes brought on, like other inflammations, by exposure to
                    cold, but it would appear to arise quite as frequently in connexion with some
                    antecedent injury or disease in some of the abdominal organs, or with depraved
                    conditions of the general health. It is an occasional result of hernia and
                    obstructions of the bowels, of wounds penetrating into the abdomen, of the
                    perforation of viscera by disease <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> in ulcer of the
                    stomach and in typhoid fever), of the bursting of abscesses or cysts into the
                    abdominal cavity, and also of the extension of inflammatory action from some of
                    the abdominal or pelvic organs. Not unfrequently it is at first localized, and
                    then, spreading onwards, becomes general.</p>
                <p>The changes which take place in the peritoneum are similar to those!* undergone
                    by other serous membranes when inflamed, viz., (1) congestion; (2) exudation of
                    lymph in greater or less abundance, at first greyish in colour and soft,
                    thereafter yellow and becoming tough in consistence, causing the folds of
                    intestine to adhere together; (3) effusion of fluid, either clear, turbid,
                    bloody, or purulent; (4) absorption more or less complete of the fluid and
                    lymph. Occasionally shreds or bands of unabsorbed lymph remain, constituting a
                    subsequent danger of strangulation of the bowel. The symptoms usually begin by a
                    rigor, together with vomiting and pain in the abdomen of a peculiarly severe and
                    sickening character, accompanied with extreme tenderness, so that the slightest
                    pressure causes a great aggravation of suffering. The patient lies on the back
                    with the knees drawn up, and it will be noticed that the breathing is rapid and
                    shallow and performed by movements of the chest only, the abdominal muscles
                    remaining quiescent, unlike what takes place in healthy respiration. The abdomen
                    becomes swollen by flatulent distension of the intestines, which increases the
                    patient’s distress. There is usually constipation. The skin is hot, although
                    there may be perspiration; the pulse is small, hard, and wiry; the urine is
                    scanty and high-coloured, and passed with pain. The patient’s aspect is one of
                    anxiety and suffering. These symptoms may subside in a day or two, but if they
                    do not the case is apt to go on rapidly to a fatal termination. In such an event
                    the pain and tenderness subside, the abdomen becomes more distended, hiccough
                    and vomiting of brown or bloodcoloured matter occur, the temperature falls, the
                    face becomes pinched, cold, and clammy, the pulse exceedingly rapid and feeble,
                    and death takes place from collapse, the patient’s mental faculties generally
                    remaining clear till the close. When the peritonitis is due to perforation, as
                    may happen in the case of the gastric ulcer, or the ulcers of typhoid fever, the
                    above-mentioned symptoms and the fatal collapse may all take place in from
                    twelve to twenty-four hours. Further, the puerperal form of this disease, which
                    comes on within a day or two after parturition, is always very serious and is
                    often rapidly fatal. The symptoms are similar to those already described, but in
                    addition there are generally superadded those of septicaemia
                    (blood-poisoning).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chronic peritonitis</hi> occurs in two forms—(1) as a result of
                    the acute attack; (2) as a tubercular disease. In the former case, the acute
                    symptoms having subsided, abdominal pain to some extent continues, and along
                    with this there is considerable swelling of the abdomen, corresponding to a
                    thickening of the peritoneum, and it may be also to fluid in the peritoneal
                    cavity. Occasionally a condition of this kind appears to develop slowly without
                    there having been any preceding acute attack. In this form of peritonitis there
                    is considerable constitutional disturbance, together with loss of strength and
                    flesh; nevertheless, although the disease is essentially a chronic one, it is
                    often recovered from. The tubercular form of peritonitis occurs either alone or
                    associated with tuberculous disease of the lungs or other organs. The chief
                    symptoms are abdominal pain and distension, along with disturbance of the
                    functions of the bowels, there being either constipation or diarrhoea, or each
                    alternately. Along with these local manifestations there exist the usual
                    phenomena of tuberculous disease, viz., high fever, with rapid emaciation and
                    loss of strength. Cases of this kind are of grave import, and their tendency is
                    to a fatal termination.</p>
                <p>In the treatment of acute peritonitis the remedy upon which most reliance is to
                    be placed is opium, which affords relief to the pain, and appears to exercise a
                    certain controlling influence upon the inflammatory process. It requires to be
                    given in considerable quantity, yet with due care, so as to avoid its narcotic
                    action. The old plan of covering the abdomen with leeches is now seldom resorted
                    to; nevertheless a moderate abstraction of blood by this means in a previously
                    healthy person may contribute to the relief of the pain. Hot fomentations with
                    turpentine or opium applied over the abdomen are of value. The strength must be
                    maintained by milk, soups, and other light forms of nourishment. It is not in
                    general desirable that the bowels should act, and this is one of the benefits
                    obtained by the internal administration of opium. In the simple chronic form the
                    use of iodine externally and of tonics with cod-liver oil internally will be
                    found of service; while in the tubercular form remedies are as a rule of little
                    value, but such symptoms as pain, fever, diarrhoea, &amp;c., must be dealt with
                    by palliative measures appropriate to these conditions.</p>
