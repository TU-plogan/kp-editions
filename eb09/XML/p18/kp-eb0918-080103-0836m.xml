                    >(q.υj),</hi> extending along the Mediterranean (sometimes called the Phoenician
                    Sea) from the mouth of the Eleutherus in the north to Mount Carmel in the south,
                    a distance of rather more than two degrees of latitude. In early times
                    Phoenicians were settled beyond this district, but for the Persian period Dor
                    may be taken approximately as the limit towards the south. In the north a strip
                    of country on the other side of the Eleutherus (Nahr al-Kebír) was frequently
                    reckoned to Phoenicia. Formed partly by alluvium carried down by perennial
                    streams from the mountains to the east, and fringed by great sand-dunes thrown
                    up by the sea, Phoenicia is covered by a very fertile, vegetable soil. It is
                    only at Eleutherus in the north, and near Acre (Akka) in the south, that this
                    strip of coastland widens out into plains of any extent; a smaller plain is
                    found at Beirút (Beyrout). For the most part the mountains approach within not
                    many miles of the coast, or even close to it, leaving only a narrow belt of
                    lowland, which from remote antiquity has been traversed by a caravanroute. To
                    the south of Tyre the cliffs sometimes advance so close to the sea that a
                    passage for the road had to be hewn out of the rocks, as at Scala Tyriorum (Ras
                    an-Nakura<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n837/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0837-0802"/>), and farther north at Promontorium Album (Ras
                    al-Abyad). It is not known how far inland the Phoenician territory extended; the
                    limit was probably different at different times. Both the maritime district,
                    partly under artificial irrigation, and the terraces, laid out with great care
                    on the mountain-sides, were in antiquity in a high state of cultivation; and the
                    country—more especially that portion which lies north of the Kásimíye (Litání)
                    along the flanks of Lebanon—still presents some of the richest and most
                    beautiful landscapes in the world, in this respect far excelling the Italian
                    Riviera. The lines of the limestone mountains, running for the most part
                    parallel to the sea, are pierced by deep river-valleys; those that debouch to
                    the south of the Kásimíye have already been mentioned in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Palestine</hi>; the most important of those to the north are
                    the Nahr Zaherani, Al-Auwali, Damur (Tamy-ras), Nahr Beirút, Nahr al-Kelb
                    (Lycus), Nahr Ibrahim (Adonis), Nahr Abu Ali (Kaddisha). The mountains are not
                    rich in mineral products; but it may be mentioned that the geologist Fraas has
                    recently discovered indubitable traces of amber-digging on the Phoenician coast.
                    The purple-shell <hi rend="italic">{Murex trunculus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >brandaris)</hi> is still found in large quantities. The harbours on the
                    Phoenician coast which played so important a part in antiquity are nearly all
                    silted up, and, with the exception of that of Beirút, there is no safe port for
                    the large vessels of modern times. A few bays, open towards the north, break the
                    practically straight coast-line; and there are a certain numb.·r of small
                    islands off the shore. It was, in the main, such points as these that the
                    Phoenicians chose for their towns; since, while affording facilities for
                    shipping, they also enabled the Phoenicians to protect themselves from attacks
                    from the mainland, which was subject to them within but narrow limits.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Race.—</hi> The ethnographic relations of the Phoenicians have
                    been the subject of much debate. As in Gen. x., Sidon, the firstborn of Canaan,
                    is classed with the Hamites, many investigators are still of opinion that, in
                    spite of their purely Semitic language, the Phoenicians were a distinct race
                    from the Hebrews. They attach great weight to the peculiarities that mark the
                    course of Phoenician civilization, and, above all, to their political
                    organization and colonizing habits, which find no analogies among the Semites.
                    In favour of the opposite and more probable view, that the Phoenicians, like the
                    Canaanites, are an early offshoot from the Semitic stock, it may be urged (1)
                    that the account in Gen. x. is not framed on strict ethnographic lines, and (2)
                    that the absence from Phoenicia of all trace of an original non-Semitic form of
                    speech cannot be reconciled with the theory of an exchange of language. The
                    close connexion which existed from an early period between the Phoenicians and
                    the Egyptians accounts for many coincidences in the matter of religion.
                    Phoenician civilization, being on the whole of but little originality, may have
                    been that of a Semitic people, who, from their situation on the narrow strip of
                    country at the east end of the Mediterranean, were naturally addicted to trade
                    and colonization.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Language.—</hi> Inscriptions, coins, topographical names
                    preserved by classical writers, proper names of persons, and the Punic passages
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Paenulus</hi> of Plautus combine to show that the
                    Phoenician language, like Hebrew, belonged to the north Semitic group. Even the
                    Phoenician which survived as a rustic dialect in north Africa till the 5th
                    century of our era was very closely akin to Hebrew. Though it retained certain
                    old forms obsolete in Hebrew, Phoenician, as we know, represents on the whole a
                    later stage of grammatical structure than the language of the Old Testament. Its
                    vocabulary, in like manner, apart from a few archaisms, coincides most nearly
                    with later Hebrew. At a very early period Semitic words were adopted into Greek
                    from Phoenician; and it is also quite certain that the Phoenicians had at least
                    a great share in the development and diffusion of the alphabetic character which
                    forms the foundation of all European alphabets. We possess, however, only a few
                    Phoenician inscriptions and coins of very early date. The longest and most
                    important of the inscriptions—that on King Eshmun'azar’s tomb—is in letters
                    which, while very ancient in certain of their features, present a series of
                    important modifications of the original type of the Semitic alphabet, as it can
                    be fixed by comparison of the oldest documents. Still more divergent from the
                    ancient characters are the forms of the letters on the Phoenician, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Punic, .monuments of north Africa. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(a. so.)</hi><hi rend="italic">Religion.—</hi> Considering the great part which
                    the Phoenicians played in the movements of ancient civilization, it is singular
                    how fragmentary are our sources of knowledge for all the most essential elements
                    of their history. What we are told of their religion is only in appearance an
                    exception to this rule. Eusebius in the <hi rend="italic">Praeparatio
                    Eυangelica</hi> cites at length from the Greek of Philo of Byblus a cosmogony
                    and theogony professedly translated from a Berytian Sanchuniathon, who wrote
                    1221 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> But that this work is a forgery appears from
                    the apocryphal authorities cited, and the affinity displayed with the system of
                    Euhemerus. The forger was Philo himself, for the writer borrows largely from
                    Hesiod and was therefore a Greek; he gives Byblus the greatest prominence in a
                    history professedly Berytian, and was therefore a Byblian; and finally Philo was
                    a fanatical Euhemerist, and the admitted object of the work was to make converts
                    to that system. The materials used by Philo were, however, in all probability
                    mainly genuine, but so cut and clipped to fit his system that they must be used
                    with great caution and constantly controlled by the few scattered data that can
                    be gathered from authentic sources.</p>
                <p>The two triads of Hannibal’s oath to Philip of Macedon (Polyb., vii. 9, 2)—Sun,
                    Moon, and Earth, and Rivers, Meadows, and Waters—contain the objects on which
                    all Phoenician worship is based. Rivers were generally sacred to gods, trees to
                    goddesses; mountains, too, were revered as nearer than other places to heaven;
                    and baetylia or meteoric stones were held sacred as divine messengers.</p>
                <p>Philo’s second generation of men (Genos and Genea) first worshipped the plants of
                    the earth, till a drought ensued and they stretched out their hands towards the
                    sun as the Lord of Heaven or Beelsamên (Baal-Shamaim), —an indication that the
                    worship of heavenly bodies was regarded as a later development of religion.
                    Baudissin, on the other hand, has lately maintained that all Phoenician deities
                    were astral and only manifested themselves in the terrestrial sphere, that the
                    things holy to them on earth were symbols, not dwelling-places, of the gods. And
                    there seems to be little doubt that this was the theory of later Phoenician
                    theology, as appears in the legend of the fiery star of the queen of heaven that
                    fell into the holy stream at Aphaca (Sozom., ii. 5, 5), in the coincidence of
                    the names of sacred rivers with those of the celestial gods, and in the name <hi
                    rend="italic">Ζευς θαλάσσιος</hi> (Hesych.) for a Sidonian sea-god. But surely
                    this theory was devised to remove a contradiction which theologians felt to be
                    involved in the popular religion. In the latter logical consistency is not
                    necessarily to be presumed, and astral and terrestrial worships might well exist
                    side by side. In historical times the astral element had the ascendency; the
                    central point in religion, and the starting-point in all Phoenician mythology,
                    was the worship of the Sun, who has either the Moon or (as the sun-god is also
                    the heaven-god) the Earth for wife. In Byblus, forwhich alone we possess some
                    details of the local cult, El was the founder and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n838/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0838-0803"/> lord of the town, and therefore of course had the
                    pre-eminence in religion; and so the Byblian Philo makes El to be the highest
                    god and the other ëlìm or elõhim subordinate to him. In the other towns also the
                    <hi rend="italic">numen patrium</hi> was a form of the sun-god, or else his
                    wife, and enjoyed somewhat exclusive honour—a step in the direction of
                    monotheism similar to the Moabite worship of Chemosh (cp. the Mesha stone). El
                    is represented as the first to introduce circumcision and the first who
                    sacrificed an only son or a virgin daughter to the supreme god. He wanders over
                    all the earth, westward towards the setting sun, and leaves Byblus to ∙his
                    spouse Baaltis—this is meant to explain why she had the chief place in the cult
                    of Byblus; her male companion Eliün, Shadid (or μεγιστos <hi rend="italic"
                    >θεός),</hi> is conceived as her youthful lover, and El is transformed into a
                    hostile god, who slays Shadid with the sword. According to another legend the
                    youthful god is killed by a boar while hunting, and the mourning for him with
                    the finding of him again make up a chief part of Byblian worship, which at an
                    early date was enriched with elements borrowed from Egypt and the myth of
                    Osiris. In other places we find as spouse of the highest god the moongoddess
                    Astarte with the cow’s horns, who in Tyre was worshipped under the symbol of a
                    star as queen of heaven. With her worship as with that of Baaltis were
                    associated wild orgies; and traces of the like are not lacking even at Carthage
                    (Aug., <hi rend="italic">Civ. Pei,</hi> ii. 4), where theology had given a more
                    earnest and gloomy character to the goddess. Astarte was viewed as the mother of
                    the Tyrian sungod Melkarth (Eudoxus, in Athen., ix. p. 392 D), or, as his full
                    title runs, “our lord Melkarth the Baal of Tyre” <hi rend="italic">{CH.S.,</hi>
                    No. 122). On account of his regular daily course the Sun is viewed as the god
                    who works and reveals himself in the world, as son of the god who is above the
                    world, and as protector of civil order. But, again, as the Sun engenders the
                    fruitfulness of the earth, he becomes the object of a sensual nature-worship,
                    one feature of which is that men and women interchange garments. A chief feast
                    to his honour in Tyre was the “awaking of Heracles” in the month Peritius
                    (February∕March; Menander of Eph., in Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> viii.
                    5, 3), a festival of the returning power of the sun in spring, probably alluded
                    to in the sarcasm of Elijah (1 Kings xviii. 27). Peculiar to Berytus is the
                    worship of Poseidon and other sea-gods, who are connected genealogically with
                    Zeus Belus, a son of El, born beyond the Euphrates, and perhaps therefore
                    connected with the Babylonian fish-gods. Berytus was also a chief seat of the
                    worship of the Cabïri, the seven nameless sons of Sydek, with their brother
                    Eshmùn, who is the eighth and greatest of the Cabiri. Philo supplies for them a
                    genealogy which is an attempt to present the growth of man from rude to higher
                    civilization, and presents analogies, long since observed, to the genealogy of
                    the sons of Cain in Genesis. Not only their half-divine ancestors but the Cabïri
                    themselves belong to a comparatively recent stage of religious development. They
                    are the patron deities of manual arts and civil industry, and as such are the
                    great gods of the Phoenician land, specially worshipped in the federal centre
                    Tripolis. On coins of this town they are called Syrian <hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> perhaps Assyrian) gods,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Eckhel, <hi rend="italic">D.N. V.,</hi> iii. 374.</p></note>
                    which seems to imply that the Phoenicians themselves regarded as not primitive
                    the many Egyptian elements which were quite early introduced into the religion
                    of the Cabïri, and especially of Eshmùn. On the other hand, a figure allied to
                    Eshmùn, Taaut, the inventor of the alphabet, is certainly borrowed from the
                    Egyptian Tehuti. So, too, Onka (Steph., <hi rend="italic">s.v.</hi> “Όγκαΐαι ”)
                    is probably the Anuke of Sais, and it is possible that the whole cycle of gods
                    λvho revealed and interpreted the sacred books is Egyptian; some of the latter
                    have the form of a serpent.</p>
                <p>The Phoenicians did not set up anthropomorphic statues of the gods, but symbolic
                    pillars of stone, or, in the case of the queen of heaven, of wood (ashërãh). If
                    an actual image was used, likeness to man was avoided by fantastic details: the
                    god had two heads or wings, or some animal emblem, or was dwarfish or
                    hermaphrodite, and so on. The sacrifices were of oxen and other male domestic
                    animals— as expiatory offerings also stags<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>For stags offered to Tanit see Clermont-Ganneau, <hi

                    birds. Human sacrifices were exceptionally offered by the state to avert great
                    disasters; the victim was chosen from among the citizens and must be innocent,
                    wherefore children were chosen, and by preference firstborn or only sons. The
                    same idea that the godhead demanded the holiest and most costly gift explains
                    the prostitution. of virgins at certain feasts in the sacred groves of the queen
                    of heaven, and the temporary consecration of maidens or matrons as <hi

                    human sacrifice, substitutes were by and by introduced in many places; thus at

                    30,000 years (Africanus, in Syncellus, p. 31), yet they retained some memory of
                    having migrated from older seats on an Eastern sea. Herodotus (vii. 89)
                    understood this of the Persian Gulf; the companions of Alexander sought to prove
                    by learned etymologies that they had actually found here the old seats of the
                    Phaenicians. But all this rested on a mere blunder, and the true form of the
                    tradition is preserved by Trogus (Just., xviii. 3, 3), who places the oldest
                    seats of the Phaenicians on the Syrium stagnum or Dead Sea—with which the Greeks
                    before the time of the Diadochi had no acquaintance—and says that, driven thence
                    by an earthquake, they reached the coast, and founded Sidon. This earthquake
                    Bunsen has ingeniously identified with that which destroyed Sodom and Gomorrha,
                    and with which Genesis itself connects the migrations of Lot. Perhaps it played
                    much such a part in the mythic history of the peoples of Canaan as the breach of
                    the dam of Märib does in the history of the Arabs.</p>
                <p>In historical times the Phaenicians called themselves Canaanites and their land
                    Canaan (Kena'an, Kcna'; Xvâ in Hecataeus, fr. 254), the latter applying equally
                    to the coast which they tnemselves held and the inland highlands which the
                    Israelites occupied. The Greeks call people and land <hi rend="italic">Φοίνικες,

                    that Phoenicia means the land of the date-palm, which the Greeks called <hi

                <p>When the southern part of the coast of Canaan was occupied by the Philistines the

                    the mouth of the Orontes (Herod., iii. 91; Pseudo-Scylax, § 104). Under the
                    Seleucids these limits contracted, the southern boundary being the Chorseus
                    (Ptol., Codd. B.E., Pal. 1), which falls into the sea north of the tower of

                <p>It is a singular fact that alike in the Old Testament and in Homer, in the time
                    of Tyre’s greatest might, we constantly read of Sidonians and not of Tyrians.
                    The explanation that Sidonians is a synonym of Phoenicians in general is
                    defended on 1 Kings v. 1 [15] compared with ver. 6 [20], but is not adequate;
                    the same chapter distinguishes between the Sidonians and the Giblites or men of
                    Byblus (E.V., “stone squarers,” ver. 18 [32]). And in Gen. x. we have besides
                    Sidon the peoples of Arce, Sinna, Aradus, and Simyra enumerated in order from
                    south to north—mostly unimportant towns afterwards absorbed in the land of
                    Aradus—and yet Tyre is lacking, though one fancies that we could better miss
                    even Aradus, which was a colony from Sidon (Strabo, xvi. p. 753), only Aradus
                    was founded by fugitives, and so must, from the first, have been independent.
                    Hence we may conjecture that the list in Genesis is political in principle; and
                    this gives us a solution of the whole difficulty, viz., that, during the
                    flourishing period of Phoenicia, Sidon and Tyre formed a single state whose
                    kings reigned first in Sidon and then in Tyre, but whose inhabitants continued
                    to take their name from the old metropolis. The first unambiguous example of two
                    distinct kings in Tyre and Sidon is in the end of the 8th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> on an inscription of Sennacherib (Schrader, <hi
                    rend="italic">K.A.T.,</hi> 2d ed., p. 286 s⅛.), and there is every reason to
                    think that the revolt of Sidon from Tyre about 726 spoken of by Menander (Jos.,
                    <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> ix. 14, 2) was a revolt not from Tyrian hegemony
                    but from the Tyrian kingdom. The several Phoenician cities had lists of their
                    kings back to a very early date. Abedbalus<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    are mentioned in connexion with the Syrian wars of the Pharaohs of the XVIIIth,
                    XIXth, and XXth Dynasties (16th-l3th century); thus under Thothmes III. we read
                    of Berytus, Ace, Joppe, and repeatedly of Aradus, which is commonly spoken of
                    along with Haleb (Aleppo) and other eastern districts. The mention of Tyre is
                    less certain, as there were two cities which the Egyptians called T’ar; but
                    there is no mistake as to the city on the sea called “T’aru the haven” in the
                    journey of an Egyptian of the 14th century <hi rend="italic">(Rec. of the

                    ship and founded Tyre a year before the taking of Troy. This goes well with the
                    spread of the Philistine power in the time of the later judges and with the fact
                    that Ascalon was still a Canaanite town under Raineses II. (c. 1385 B.C.), while
                    in the eighth year of Rameses III. (c. 1246) the Pulosata made a raid into

                    author in assuming that the twelve years of Astartus and the twelve of the

                    The towns of the Phoenician coast were active from a very early date in various
                    manufactures. Glass work, for which the sands of the Belus gave excellent
                    material, had its chief seat in Sidon; embroidery and purple-dyeing were
                    favoured by the prevalence of the purple-giving murex all along the coast. The
                    ancients ascribed to the Phoenicians the invention of all three industries, but
                    glass-making seems to have been borrowed from Egypt, where this manufacture is
                    of immemorial antiquity; and several circumstances indicate that the other two
                    arts probably came from Babylon—in particular, the names of the two main tints
                    of purple— dark red (argãmãn) and dark blue (tèkhêleth)—seem not to be
                    Phoenician. The Phoenicians, however, brought these arts to perfection and
                    spread the knowledge of them. In other particulars also the ancients looked on
                    the Phoenicians as the inventive people <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi>:
                    to them as the great trading nation was ascribed the invention of arithmetic,
                    measure, and weight, which are really Babylonian in origin, and also of writing,
                    although it is not even quite certain that it was the Phoenicians who adapted

                    in the last days of Tyre’s glory Ezekiel (xxvii. 12-25) has left a lively
                    picture, which shows how large was the share they had in overland as well as in
                    naval commerce. It was they, in fact, who from the earliest time distributed to
                    the rest of the world the wares of Egypt and Babylon (Herod., i. 1). To the
                    lands of the Euphrates and Tigris there were two routes: the more northerly
                    passed obliquely through Mesopotamia and had on it the trading places of Haran
                    (Carrhae), Canneh (Caenae), and Eden; the other, more southerly, had Sheba
                    (Sabaea) for its goal, and led down the Euphrates, passing Asshur (Sura) and
                    Chilmad (Charmande). There were other routes in the Persian and Macedonian
                    period, but they do not belong to the present history.</p>
                <p>Actual inland settlements of the Phoenicians seem to have been few; we know of
                    one near the head of the northern trade road, Laish, which was lost to the
                    Danites in the time of the judges (Judges xviii.), and one on the southern
                    route, Eddana on the Euphrates (Steph. B., s.v.), which corresponds in name with
                    Eden, but is not the same place, but perhaps rather the Giddan of Isidore of
                    Charax (§ 1). In the Arabian caravan trade in perfume, spices, and incense for
                    worship the Phoenicians had a lively interest (Herod., iii. 107). These wares
                    were mainly produced not in Arabia but in eastern Africa and India; but Sheba in
                    Yemen was the emporium of the whole trade, and the active commerce of this rich

                <p>That in matters economic Syria and Palestine depended on Phoenicia might have
                    been inferred even if we had not the express testimony of Ezekiel that these

                    Armenian district.</p>
                <p>Cilicia was important to the Phoenicians as the natural point of shipment for
                    wares from the Euphrates regions; and the opposite island of Cyprus attracted
                    them by its store of timber for shipbuilding, and of copper. Both these
                    countries were originally peopled by the non-Semitic Kittïm, who have left their
                    name in the Cilician district Cetis and the Cyprian city Citium; but they came
                    under profound Semitic influences, mainly those of the Phoenicians, who on the
                    mainland had settlements at Myri-andus (Xen., <hi rend="italic">Anab.,</hi> i.
                    4, 6) and Tarsus, <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> while in Cyprus Citium—which to
                    the last remained the chief seat of the Phoenician tongue and culture—was held
                    to have its foundation from Belus (Steph., <hi rend="italic">s.v. “</hi><hi

                    but the view that Phoenician sway in Cyprus was very ancient and that the
                    Phoenicians were gradually driven back by the Greeks appears not to be sound. On
                    the contrary, the balance of power seems to have varied greatly; the Assyrian
                    tribute-lists of 673 and 667 (Schrader, <hi rend="italic">K.A.T.,</hi> p. 354
                    <hi rend="italic">sqf</hi> contain but two names of Phoenician cities in Cyprus,
                    Sillü (Soli) and Kartihadast (probably New Paphos); not one of the later
                    Phoenician kingdoms is mentioned, so that presumably none of them then existed,
                    and not one of the ten Cyprian kings mentioned appears to be Phoenician by name.
                    Menander tells us (Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> ix. 14, 2) that the kings
                    of Tyre ruled over Cyprus at the close of the 8th century; but a very clear
                    proof that there was no ancient and uninterrupted political connexion with
                    Phoenicia lies in the fact that the Cyprian Greeks took the trouble to frame a
                    Greek cuneiform character modelled on the Assyrian.</p>
                <p>The Homeric poems represent the Phoenicians as present in Greek waters for
                    purposes of traffic, including the purchase and capture of slaves, but not as
                    settlers. Tradition (see especially Thucyd., i. 8) is unanimous in representing
                    the Carians and Phoenicians as having occupied the islands of the Aegean before
                    the migrations of the Greeks to Asia Minor, but so far as the Phoenicians are
                    concerned this holds only of the southern islands—afterwards occupied by
                    Dorians—where they had mining-stations, and also establishments for the capture
                    of the murex and purpledyeing. <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> The most northerly
                    of the Cyclades on which we can prove a Phoenician settlement is Oliarus
                    (Steph., <hi rend="italic">s.vf,</hi> which was occupied by Sidonians, probably
                    with a view to the use of the marble quarries of Paros, which lies opposite.
                    Similarly the Byblians occupied Melos (Steph., <hi rend="italic">s.vf,</hi>
                    which produced a white pigment (Melian earth), alum, and sulphur. Two great
                    islands were held as main seats of the purple trade, Cythera (Herod., i. 105)
                    and Thera, with the neighbouring Anaphe (Herod., iv. 147; Steph., <hi
                    rend="italic">s.v. “Meμβλlapoς</hi> ”),—as also the town Itanus at the eastern
                    extremity of Crete (Steph., <hi rend="italic">s.vf.</hi> Specially famous was
                    the purple of the Laconian waters,—the isles of Elishah of Ezekiel xxvii. 7.
                    Farther east the Phoenicians were settled in Rhodes. <hi rend="superscript">
                    5</hi> The Greek local tradition about the Phoenicians seems, in Thera and
                    Rhodes, to embody real historical reminiscences, and it is confirmed for Thera
                    and Melos by the discoveries of Phoenician pottery and ornaments in the upper
                    strata of the tuff, and for other places by peculiar cults which survived among
                    the later Dorian settlers. Thus the Aphrodite Urania of Cythera was identical
                    with the Oriental goddess of love at Paphos, and Herodotus (i. 105) makes her
                    temple to be founded from Ascalon; the coins of Itanus (Mionnet, ii. 284 <hi
                    rend="italic">sqf</hi> show a fish-tailed deity; in Rhodes human sacrifices to
                    Cronus were long kept up (Porph., <hi rend="italic">De Abs.,</hi> ii. 54). The
                    legends of Rhodes and Crete have a character quite distinct from that of other
                    Greek myths, and so give lasting testimony to the deep influence in both islands
                    of even the most hideous aspects of Phoenician religion; it is enough to refer
                    in this connexion to the stories of the eight children of Helios in Rhodes, of
                    Europa, the Minotaur, and the brazen Talos in Crete. The pre-Hellenic
                    inhabitants of the islands, the Carians and their near kinsmen the Eteocretans

                    Phoenicians the Greeks derived their weights and measures; /χι ά, the Hebrew <hi
                    rend="italic">maneh,</hi> became a familiar Greek word. From Phoenicia too they
                    had the alphabet which unanimous tradition connects with the name of Cadmus,
                    founder of Thebes. Hence Cadmus has been taken to mean “eastern” (from D∏p), and
                    Thebes viewed as a Phoenician colony; but the Greeks did not speak Phoenician,
                    and the Phoenicians would not call themselves Easterns. Further, an inland
                    colony of Phoenicians is highly improbable; and all other traces seem to connect
                    Cadmus with the north. But the Cadmeans, who traced their descent to Cadmus,
                    colonized Thera, and it was they who, mingling with the Phoenicians left on the
                    island, learned the alphabet. It was in Thera, where the oldest Greek
                    inscriptions have been found, that the invention of letters was ascribed to the
                    mythic ancestor, and that he was made out to be a Phoenician. We now know better
                    than we did a feλv years ago how much the oldest Greeks depended before the
                    migrations on the movements of Eastern civilization, and can well believe that
                    the Phoenicians played a very important part in this connexion. Thus in the
                    tombs of Mycenae we find Phoenician idols, objects of amber, and an ostrich egg
                    side by side with rich jewels of gold, Oriental decoration, and images of
                    Eastern plants and animals; thus too the rock-tombs of Hymettus closely resemble
                    those of Phoenicia; and above all we find on the Isthmus of Corinth, that most
                    ancient seat of commerce, the worship of the Tyrian Melkarth under the name of
                    Melicertes. Yet with all these proofs of a lively trade there is no trace of
                    Phoenician settlements on the Greek mainland and the central islands of the
                    Aegean; but in the north Thasus was occupied for the sake of its gold mines
                    (Herod., vi. 47), and so probably was Galepsus on the opposite Thracian coast
                    (Harpocr., <hi rend="italic">s.vf,</hi> where also it was Phoenicians (Strabo,
                    xiv. p. 680; from Callisthenes) who opened the gold mines of Pangaeus. Beyond
                    these points their settlements in this direction do not seem to have extended;
                    the Tyrians, indeed, according to Ezekiel, traded in slaves and bronze-ware with
                    the Greeks of Pontus (Javan), the Tibareni (Tubal), and Moschi (Meshech); but
                    all supposed traces of actual settlements on these coasts prove illusory, and
                    Pronectus on the Gulf of Astacus, which Stephanus attributes to the Phoenicians,
                    lies so isolated that it was perhaps only a station of their fleet in Persian
                    times.</p>
                <p>The great centre of Phoenician colonization was the western half of the
                    Mediterranean and the Atlantic coasts to the right and left of the straits. In
                    especial the trade with Tarshish, that is, the region of the Tartessus
                    (Guadalquivir), was what made the commercial greatness of the Phoenicians; for
                    here they had not only profitable fisheries (tunny and muraena) but above all
                    rich mines of silver and other metals, to which the navigable rivers Guadiana
                    and Guadalquivir gave easy access. The untutored natives had little idea of the
                    value of the metals; for long there was no competition, and so the profits were
                    enormous; it was said that even the anchors were of silver in ships returning
                    from Spain (Diod., v. 35). Next the Phoenicians ventured farther οή the ocean
                    and drew tin from the mines of north-west Spain or the richer deposits of
                    Cornwall; the tin islands (Cassiterides) were reached from Brittany, and are
                    always distinguished from the British mainland, so that the old view which makes
                    them the Scilly Islands is probably right. The tin was supposed to be produced
                    where it was exchanged,—a very common case.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    north; amber ornaments are often mentioned by Homer, and have been found in the
                    oldest tombs of Cumae and in those by the Lion gate at Mycenae. The Phoenicians
                    can hardly have fetched the amber themselves from the Baltic or even from the
                    North Sea (where it scarcely can have ever been common); it came to them by two
                    trade routes, one from the Baltic to the Adriatic, the other up the Rhine and
                    down the Rhone. But indeed a deposit of amber has been found in the Lebanon not
                    far from Sidon,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Fraas,

                    Pillars of Hercules soon after the Trojan War, in the time, that is, of Tyre’s
                    first expansion. Lixus in Mauretania was older than Gades (Pliny, xix. 63) and
                    Gades a few years older than Utica (Veil., i. 2), which again was founded 1101
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (Pseιτdo-Arist., <hi rend="italic">Mir.
                    ausc.,</hi> 134; Bocchus, in <hi rend="italic">Plin.,</hi> xvi. 216). Most of
                    the African colonies were no doubt younger; we have dates for Aoza (887-855,
                    Menander) and Carthage (814, Timaeus). Here, as generally in like cases, the
                    farthest points were settled first and the need for intermediate stations to
                    secure connexion was felt later. The colonization was carried out on a great
                    scale. Ophelas (Strabo, xvii. 826) may exaggerate when he speaks of 300 cities
                    on the Mauretanian coast beyond the Pillars of Hercules; but the colonists and
                    the Carthaginians after them stamped west Africa with a thoroughly Phoenician
                    character, and their language was dominant, at least in the cities, far beyond
                    the limits of their nationality, just as was the case with Latin and Arabic in
                    later times. It is most likely that so great a mass of colonists was not wholly
                    drawn from the narrow bounds of Phoenicia, but that the inland Canaanites,
                    pushed back by Hebrews and Philistines, furnished many recruits; the supposed
                    testimonies to this fact, however, are late, and certainly apocryphal.</p>
                <p>Surveying the great settlements of the Phoenicians from east to west, we find
                    them first in Sicily, occupying, in a way typical of the commencement of all
                    their settlements, projecting headlands and neighbouring islets, from which they
                    traded with the Siculi (Thucyd., vi. 2). Their chief seat seemingly was Macara
                    (Heraclides, <hi rend="italic">Polit.,</hi> 29), on the south coast, ∏∏p⅛ C∏ on
                    coins, Heraclea Minoa of the Greeks. Before the Greeks they retired to the north
                    coast, where they held Motye, Panormus, and Soloeis, supported by their alliance
                    with and influence over the Elymi, and by the neighbourhood of Carthage, which
                    here and elsewhere succeeded to the heritage of Tyre, and gave protection to the
                    Phoenician colonies. The islands between Sicily and Africa—Melite, with its
                    excellent harbour and commanding position on the naval highway, Gaulus, and
                    Cossura—were also occupied (Diod., v. 12), and a beginning was made with the
                    colonization of Sardinia <hi rend="italic">(ib.,</hi> v. 35), where Caralis is

                    trade with and influence on the Etruscans is older than the political alliance
                    of the latter with Carthage; there were, at least, no Phoenician colonies in

                    therefore necessarily Phoenician, especially as Ohl Carthage lies inland; they
                    may date from the conflicts of Carthage and the Massa-liotes. In Tartessus, on
                    the other hand, or Turdetania, as it was called later, all the important coast
                    towns were Phoenician (Strabo, iii. 151, 156 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi>
                    169.97·)—Abdera, Sex (which was regarded as one of the oldest of the Tyrian
                    settlements in Spain), Malaca, Carteia, and, most famous of all, Gades, with its
                    most holy shrine of Hercules; it lay on an islet which had not even drinking
                    water, but the position was a commanding one. Still farther off lay Onoba, where
                    the Tyrians are said to have settled before they were in Gades. In Africa the
                    most easterly settlement was Great Leptis, which is the only colony ascribed to

                    the accounts that the sister cities (Ea and Sabratha were founded, the former by
                    Phoenicians from Sicily, the latter from Tyre (Sil. Itai., iii. 256 <hi

                    from its many Phoenician trading towns. Here, on the river Cinyps, corn produced
                    threehundredfold, and a great trade-road led inland to the land of the
                    Garamantes. That the commercial town of Tacape (Kãbis) and the island of Meninx
                    (Jirba), with its purple-dyeing trade, were Phoenician is proved by
                    inscriptions, and Capsa, in inland Numidia, was deemed a foundation of the
                    Tyrian Hercules (Oros., v. 15). Among the Phoenician towns in Africa proper
                    Achulla was Melitan (Steph., <hi rend="italic">s.v.</hi> “’Άχολλα”), Lesser
                    Leptis and Hadrumetum Tyrian (Pliny, v. 76; Solin., 27, 9), as was also Aoza
                    (Menander), that is, rather the Uzita of Strabo and Ptolemy (cp. Wilmanns on <hi
                    rend="italic">C.I.L.,</hi> viii. 68), 5⅛ miles inland from Leptis, than Auzia in
                    inland Mauretania. On the north coast Carthage and Utica are Tyrian colonies,
                    and probably also Hippo Zarytus, though Sidon, on a coin, claims it and other
                    Tyrian colonies as her daughters (Movers, <hi rend="italic">Phönizier,</hi> ii.
                    2, p. 134). The unidentified town of Canthele and the island Eudeipne are called
                    Liby-Phaenician (Steph., s.w.), and this name in later times denoted the
                    Phoenicians in Africa apart from and in contrast to Carthage. The Semitic
                    populations were thickly sown over all this region, but we cannot generally
                    distinguish Phoenician colonies, Carthaginian foundations, and native
                    settlements that had become Punic. Chalce, on the coast east of Oran, in the
                    country of the Masaesyli, was Phoenician, but their great domain was the
                    Atlantic coast of Mauretania. Tingis and Zelis, if originally Berber, became
                    thoroughly Phoenician cities (Mela, ii. 6, 9; Strabo, iii. 140); the chief
                    colony here was Lixus (Ps.-Scylax, §112), a city accounted greater than
                    Carthage. Southward, on the so-called K0λτros Εμτro∕xκ0s, and onwards to the
                    mouth of the Dra river Tyrian colonies lay thick, and here a great trade-route
                    went inland to the country of the Blacks. These colonies were ruined by the
                    invasion of the Pharusii and Nigritae (Strabo, xvii. 826), who spread
                    destruction just as did the Almoravids when they issued from the same region in
                    the 11th century; the Carthaginians saved the remnant of their kinsmen by
                    sending Hanno to found the new colony of Thymiaterium and plant 30,000 Liby -
                    Phoenicians in the old ports of Karikon Teichos, Gytte, Aera, Melitta, and
                    Arambys. The most westerly point reached by the Phoenicians was the Fortunate
                    Island (the largest of the Canaries, probably), which later fancy painted in
                    glowing colours after intercourse with so distant a region had ceased (Diod., v.
                    20).</p>
                <p>The trading connexions of the Phoenicians reached far beyond their most remote
                    colonies, and it must have been their knowledge of Africa which encouraged
                    Pharaoh N^echo to send a Phoenician expedition to circumnavigate Africa. This
                    greatest feat of ancient seamanship was actually accomplished in 611-605 B.c.,
                    at a time when the mother-country had already lost its independence, and the
                    colonial empire had but a shadow of its former splendour. The power of Tyre
                    rested directly on her colonies, which, unlike the Greek colonies, remained
                    subject to the mother-city; we read of rebellions in Utica and Citium which were
                    put down by arms. The colonies paid tithes of all their revenues and sometimes
                    also of booty taken in war to the Tyrian Hercules, and sent envoys to Tyre for
                    his chief feast. But Tyre was too remote long to exercise as effective a control
                    over her dependencies as was possible to the more favourably placed Carthage;
                    the relation gradually became looser, and the more substantial obligations of
                    the colonies ceased to be discharged; yet Carthage certainly paid tithes to the
                    Tyrian Hercules as late as the middle of the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>(’ Iτυκαιoις)—having ceased to pay tribute, Hiram reduced them in a victorious
                    expedition, after which he founded the feast of the awaking of Hercules in the
                    month Peritius. The Tyrian annals also mentioned the connexion of Hiram with
                    Solomon king of Jerusalem. The relations of Phoenicians and Israelites had been
                    generally friendly before this; it appears from Judges v. 17, Gen. xlix. 13, 20,
                    that Asher, Zebulon, and Dan acknowledged some dependence on Sidon, and had in
                    return a share in its commerce; and the only passage in the older period of the
                    judges which represents Israelites as subject to Sidonians, and again casting
                    off' the yoke, is Judges x. 12, which perhaps refers to the time of power of the
                    Canaanites of Hazor (Graetz, i. 412). The two nations drew closer together under
                    the kings. Hiram built David’s palace (2 Sam. v. 11), and also gave Solomon
                    cedar and fir-trees, as well as workmen for his palace and temple, receiving in
                    exchange large annual payments of oil and wine, and finally the cession of a
                    Galilaean district (Cabul), in return for the gold he had supplied to decorate
                    the interior of the temple. The temple was quite in Phoenician style, as appears
                    particularly in the two pillars Jachin and Boaz. We may also judge that it was
                    Hiram’s temples that led Solomon to propose to himself a similar work.<note

                    a servant of “Hiram king of the Sidonians,” a title which, as we have seen, is
                    quite suitable for the king of Tyre. Hiram’s grandson Abdastarte I. (929-920)
                    was murdered by his foster-brothers, and the eldest took the regal title
                    (920-908), but in the last twelve years of his reign he shared his throne with a
                    scion of the old house, [Abd]Astarte II. (908-896). His brother Astharym or
                    Abdastharym (896-887) was murdered by a third brother Phelles, who, in turn,
                    after a reign of but eight months, was slain by Ithobal I., priest of Astarte,
                    whose reign (887-855) marks a return to more settled rule. Ithobal was beloved
                    of the gods, and his intercession put an end to a year of drought which Josephus
                    recognized as that which is familiar to us in the history of Elijah and Ahab. In
                    1 Kings xvi. 31 Ithobal appears as Ethbaal, king of the Sidonians. At this time
                    the Tyrians still continued to expand mightily. Botrys in Phoenicia and Aoza in
                    Africa are foundations of Ithobal; the more famous Carthage owed its foundation
                    to the civil discords that followed on the death of King Metten I. (849-820).
                    According to the legend current in later Carthage (Justin, xviii. 4,3-6,9),
                    Metten’s son Phygmalion (820-773), who began to reign at the age of nine, slew,
                    when he grew up, his uncle Sicharbas, the priest of Hercules and second man in
                    the kingdom, in order to seize his treasures. The wife of Sicharbas was Elissa,
                    Phygmalion’s sister, and she fled and founded Carthage. Truth and fable in this
                    legend are not easy to disentangle, but as Elissa is named also in the Tyrian
                    annals she is probably historical.</p>
                <p>From the time of Ithobal downwards the further progress of Phoenicia was
                    threatened by a foreign power. The older campaigns of the empires of the

                <p>More serious was the new advance of the Assyrians under Ashurnãçirpal (<hi
                    rend="italic">c.</hi> 870), when this prince took tribute from the lords of
                    Tyre, Sidon, Byblus, Mahallat, Maiz, Kaiz, the λVestland, and the island Aradus.
                    A king of Aradus was one of the allies of Rammãnidri of Damascus whom
                    Shalmaneser III. smote at Karkar in 854; thereafter the Assyrian took tribute of
                    Tyre in 842 and 839, and in the latter year also from Byblus. Again in 803
                    Rammãnnirãru boasted of exacting tribute from Tyre and Sidon, but thereafter
                    there was a respite until Tiglath Pileser II., the real founder of the Assyrian
                    empire, to whom Tyre paid tribute in 741, and again along with Byblus in 738 <hi

                    submitted, revolting from Tyre. A new kingdom was thus formed under a king [E]
                    luli, whose name makes it likely that he was a relative of the Tyrian prince,
                    and who presently appears on the monuments as lord of Great Sidon (the same name
                    as in Josh, xix. 28), Lesser Sidon ( = Palaetyrus ?), and other cities. But
                    insular Tyre did not yield, and Shalmaneser had to make a second expedition
                    against it, for which the jealous particularism of the other Phoenician cities
                    supplied the ships. With much inferior forces the Tyrians gained a naval victory
                    and the king drew off. But the blockade was continued, and seems to have ended
                    after five years in a capitulation. This siege probably began about the same
                    time with that of Samaria, and may be dated 724-720. About 715 Ionian sea-rovers
                    attacked Tyre and were repulsed by Sargon (Schrader, <hi rend="italic"
                    >K.A.T.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> p. 169), an affair in which we
                    may find the historical basis of such legends as that in the Cyclic <hi
                    rend="italic">Cypria,</hi> that Sidon was taken by Priam’s son Alexander.
                    [E]luli did not prove a faithful subject; Sennacherib attacked him, and he had
                    to flee to Cyprus, Ithobal being set in his place (701). Among the Phoenician
                    kings who appeared to do homage to Sennacherib a prince of Tyre does not appear.
                    One sees from all this how barbarous and ill-consolidated the Assyrian power in
                    the west was; after the retreat of Sennacherib it was even for a time seriously
                    threatened by the Ethiopian dynasty which then held Egypt · and this may explain
                    the revolt of Abdimilkut, king of Sidon, which was visited by Esarhaddon with
                    the destruction of the city, the captivity of part of the inhabitants, and the
                    execution of the rebel king (680 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> Ménant, p. 241

                    at last the war of this monarch with his brother seems to have enabled Phoenicia
                    to throw off the yoke without a contest (<hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 650).</p>
                <p>The Assyrians had proved their inability to create anything; but their talent for

                    at last victorious, their slaves were able to overpower and slay them to a man,
                    all save Straton, whom a faithful servant saved, and whom the slaves chose, on
                    account of his wisdom, to be king and founder of a new dynasty (Abdastarte
                    III.), is only to be understood by reading Assyrians for Per sians.<note

                    Tyre, between 587 and 480; a war between Tyrians and Persians between 480 and
                    390 is nowhere heard of, and is highly improbable, and Straton, from what we
                    learn of his descendants, cannot have reigned later than this.</p></note> The
                    catastrophe must have occurred soon after the events already noticed; and in the
                    same period falls the decay of the colonial power of Tyre, which we cannot
                    follow in detail, though we can recognize some of its symptoms. After reaching
                    the Mediterranean the Assyrians established themselves in Cyprus (709); in the
                    Greek islands farther west the Phoenicians had before this time been gradually
                    displaced by the Dorian migration, which, however, must not be taken to be a
                    single movement eastward in the 11th century, but a long course of colonizing
                    expeditions, starting from Argos and continued for generations, about which we
                    can only say that the whole was over by the middle of the 8th century. Thasus,
                    the most northern settlement in the Aegean, was already deserted by the
                    Phoenicians when the father of the poet Archilochus led a Parian colony thither
                    in 708. But the loss of the more western colonies seems to have been
                    contemporary with the fall of Tyrian independence. About 701 Isaiah looks for a
                    revolt of Tartessus (xxiii. 10), and the first Greek visitor, the Samian Colaeus
                    (639), found no trace of Phoenician competition remaining there (Herod., iv.
                    152). These circumstances seem to justify us in understanding what the
                    contemporary poet Anacreon (fr. 8) says of the hundred and fifty years’ reign of
                    Arganthonius over Tartessus as really applying to the duration of the kingdom;
                    and as he died in 545 the kingdom will date from 695. In Sicily the Phoenicians
                    began to be pushed back from the time of the founding of Gela (690); and Himera
                    (648) and Selinus (628) mark the limits of Greek advance towards the region on
                    the north-west coast, which the Phoenicians continued to hold. In 654 the
                    Carthaginians occupied the island Ebusus, on the sea-way to Spain (Diod., V.
                    16), a step obviously directed to save what could still be saved. Soon after
                    this, when Psammetichus opened Egypt to foreigners (650), the Greeks, whose
                    mental superiority made them vastly more dangerous rivals than the Assyrians,
                    supplanted the Phoenicians in their lucrative Egyptian trade; it is noteworthy
                    that Egypt is passed over in silence in Ezekiel’s full list of the trading
                    connexions of Tyre.</p>
                <p>In the last crisis of the dying power of Assyria the Egyptians for a short time
                    laid their hand on Phoenicia, but after the battle of Carchemish (605) the
                    Chaldaeans took their place. Apries made an attempt to displace the Chaldaeans,
                    took Sidon by storm, gained over the other cities, and defeated the king of
                    Tyre, who commanded the Phoenician and Cyprian fleet (Herod., ii. 161; Diod., i.
                    68). The party hostile to Chaldaea now took the rule all through Phoenicia. The
                    new king of Tyre, Ithobal II., was on the same side (589), and after the fall of
                    Jerusalem Nebuchadnezzar laid siege to the great merchant-city, which was still
                    rich and strong enough to hold out for thirteen years (587-574).<note

                    family is subsequently found in Babylon, obviously as cards that might on

                    for Old Tyre—after which an elected king, Balatorus, ruled for a year (557-556).
                    The next two kings (556-532) were brought from Babylon. Under the second of
                    these, Hiram III., Phoenicia passed in 538 from the Chaldaeans to the Persians;
                    at the same time Amasis of Egypt occupied Cyprus (Herod., ii. 182). There seems
                    to have been no struggle, the great siege and the subsequent civil disorders had
                    exhausted Tyre completely, and the city now becomes second to Sidon. Accordingly
                    about this time Carthage asserted her independence; the political activity of
                    Hanno the Great, the real founder of the Carthaginian state, falls in the years
                    538-521.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This date is
                    got from Justin, who in xix. 1, 1 says of his Mago the same thing that others
                    say of Hanno; for the defeat spoken of in xviii. 7, 1 is the battle against the
                    Phocaeans in 538, and the war with a Spartan prince in Sicily (xix. 1, 7) is the
                    war with Dorieus (510). Taking into account the eleven years of HasdrubaΓs
                    dictatorship we get Hanno’s date as above.</p></note> Of Hanno it is said that
                    he made his townsmen Africans instead of Tyrians (Dio Chrys., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Or.,</hi> XXV. 7). The old dependence was changed for a mere relation of
                    piety.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Constitution.—</hi> As Carthage was of old a republic, and its
                    constitution underwent many changes, it is not safe to infer from the two
                    Carthaginian suffets that Tyre also stood in the oldest time under two such
                    magistrates. All Canaanite analogy speaks for kingship in the several cities as
                    the oldest form of Phoenician government. The royal houses claimed descent from
                    the gods, and the king could not be chosen outside their members (Curt., iv. 1,
                    17). The land belonged to the king, who was surrounded by much splendour (Ezek.
                    xxviii. 13), but the highly-developed independent activity of the citizens
                    limited his actual power more than in ordinary Oriental realms; it was possible
                    for war or peace to be decided at Tyre in the king’s absence, and in Sidon
                    against his will (Arrian, ii. 15, 16; Curt., iv. 1, 16). In Tyre the high priest
                    of Hercules was the second man in the state (Just., xviii. 4, 5), and so the
                    office was by preference given to a kinsman of the king. The sovereign had a
                    council of elders, who in Sidon were in number a hundred; of these the most
                    distinguished were the ten First whom we find at Marathus and Carthage (Diod.,
                    ii. 628; Just., xviii. 6, 1),—originally, it may be supposed, heads of the most
                    noble houses. The third estate was the people; the freemen, however, were much
                    outnumbered by the slaves, as we have seen in Tyre. Under the Persians there was
                    a federal bond between the cities, which we may suppose to be due to that great
                    organizer Darius I. The federation comprised Sidon, Tyre, and Aradus — Sidon
                    being chief—ancl contributed 300 triremes to the Persian fleet (Herod., vii.
                    96-99); the contingents of the lesser towns were under the command of the great
                    cities, which probably had the rule in other matters also. This holds for
                    Marathus, Sigon, Mariamme, which belonged to Aradus (Arr., ii. 13), even for
                    Byblus also, which had its own kings in the Persian period, and seems from the
                    number of its coins and inscriptions to have been very flourishing. We know the
                    names of sixteen kings of Sidon, ten of Byblus, eight of Aradus, but none of
                    Berytus in historical times; presumably it formed with Byblus a single kingdom,
                    and in later times the capital was moved to the latter. Tripolis was a bond of
                    three cities, Sidonian, Tyrian, and Aradian, a stadium distant from one another
                    (Diod., xvi. 41). Here sat the federal council under the kings of the three
                    leading states, who were accompanied to Tripolis by their senators (probably 300
                    in all). Among the chief concerns of this council were the relations to the
                    Persian Government, which was represented at the meetings.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Under Persian Rule.—</hi> Phoenicia, Palestine, and Syria
                    formed the fifth satrapy, paying a tribute of &lt;£99,296. The Phoenicians were
                    favoured subjects for the sake of their indispensable fleet; and having also
                    common interests against Greece they were amongst the most loyal subjects of the
                    empire. Sidon, as we have seen, was now the chief city; its king at the time of
                    the expedition of Xerxes was Tetramnestus. Among his descendants was the
                    youthful Eshmun'azar, whose inscription on the great sarcophagus in Egyptian

                <p>Reckoning back from Straton II., and remembering that Eshmun'azar II. died as a

                    from the great king, may have been a reward for fidelity in the rebellion of the
                    younger Cyrus. Certainly it was not Eshmun'azar who led the eighty ships that
                    joined Conon in 396 (Diod., xiv. 79), an event which may have been the beginning
                    of the friendly relations between Sidon and Athens, indicated in a decree of
                    “proxenia” for Straton I. <hi rend="italic">{C. I. Gr.,</hi> No. 87). Tyre was
                    then quite weak; between 391 and 386 it was stormed by Evagoras of Salamis
                    (Isocr., <hi rend="italic">Paneg.,</hi> 161, and <hi rend="italic">Evag.,</hi>
                    23, 62; Diod., xv. 2), who had already made the Greek element dominant over the
                    Phoenician in Cyprus. Straton was friendly with Evagoras’s son Nicocles; they
                    rivalled one another in debauchery, and both found an unhappy end through their
                    implication in the great revolt of the satraps (Ath., xii. 531). When Tachos
                    entered Phoenicia Straton joined him, and on his failure (361) was about to fall
                    into the hands of the foe when his wife slew him first and then herself (Jerome,
                    ii. 1, 311 Vall.). A new revolt of Sidon against Persia took place under Tennes
                    II. on account of insults offered to the Sidonians at the federal diet at
                    Tripolis. Again they joined the Egyptian Nectanebus II., carried the rest of
                    Phoenicia with them, and with the aid of Greek mercenaries from Egypt drove the
                    satraps of Syria and Cilicia out of Phoenicia. Tennes, however, whose interests
                    were not identical with those of the citizens at large, betrayed his people and
                    opened the city to Artaxerxes III. The Sidonians, to the number of 40,000, are
                    said to have burned themselves and their families within their houses (345 B.c.,
                    Diod., xvi. 41-45). Tennes himself was executed after he had served the ends of
                    the great king. The <hi rend="italic">Periplus</hi> ascribed to Scylax (§ 104)
                    describes the respective possessions of Tyre and Sidon in the year before this
                    catastrophe; Sidon had the coast from Leontopolis to Ornithopolis, an Aradus
                    near the later Sycaminon, and Dor; Tyre had Sarepta and Exope (?) in the
                    district of the later Calamon, farther south a town seemingly called Cirtha,
                    and, strangely enough, the important Ascalon. Tyre now again for a short time
                    took the first place. When, however, Alexander entered Phoenicia after Issus and
                    the kings were absent with the fleet, Aradus, Byblus, and Sidon joined him, the
                    last-named showing special zeal against Persia. The Tyrians also offered
                    submission, but refused to allow Alexander to enter the city and sacrifice in
                    the temple of Hercules. Alexander was determined to make an example of the first
                    sign of opposition that did not proceed from Persian officials, and <pb

                    and, though the king, with enormous toil, drove a mole from the mainland to the
                    island, he made little progress till the Persians were mad enough to dismiss the
                    fleet and give him command of the sea through his Cyprian and Phoenician allies.
                    The town was at length forced in July 332; 8000 Tyrians were slain, 30,000
                    inhabitants sold as slaves, and only a few notables, the king Azemilcus, and the
                    Carthaginian festal envoys, who had all taken shelter in the fane of Hercules,

                    political existence, and the foundation of Alexandria presently changed the
                    lines of trade and gave a blow perhaps still more fatal to the Phoenician
                    cities. The Phoenicians thenceforth ceased to be a great nation, though under
                    the Greeks Tyre and Sidon were still wealthy towns, the seats of rich
                    merchants.</p>

                    >Phönizier,</hi> i., ii. 1-3 (Bonn, 1841-56), which must be compared with his
                    article “Phoenizien,” in Erseh and Gruber (1848). Both works are learned and
                    indispensable, but to be used with caution wherever the author’s judgment on his
                    material is involved, especially in the treatment of the mythology, which is
                    merely syncretistic, whereas it is essential to a right understanding of this
                    subject to distinguish the peculiarities of the several Semitic nations. Selden,
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">diis Syris</hi> (London, 1617), is
                    still a valuable mine. The best recent contributions are those of Baudissin, <hi

                    >Religionsgesehiehte</hi> (Leipsic, 1876, 1878). For the colonial history
                    Bochart’s monumental <hi rend="italic">Chanaan</hi> (Caen, 1646) is not
                    superseded even by Movers, who, as has been wittily observed, has created with
                    the help of etymology Phoenician <hi rend="italic">chambres</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de reunion</hi>; and, though Olshausen <hi rend="italic">{N.
                    Rhein. Mus.,</hi> 1853, p. 321 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> does not go quite so
                    far, both he and Müllenhoff <hi rend="italic">{Deutsche Alterthumskunde,</hi>
                    i., 1870) follow the steps of Movers much too closely. A good corrective is
                    given by Meltzer <hi rend="italic">{Gesch. d.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Karthager,</hi> i., 1879), though he, again, is sometimes too sceptical. Movers
                    is best on the history proper; and the admirable sketch in Grote’s <hi
                    rend="italic">History of Greece</hi> should also be consulted. See also
                    Duncker,∙ <hi rend="italic">Gesch. des Alterthums,</hi> and Maspero, <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Art.—</hi> Of Phoenician buildings few remains now exist on
                    Phoenician soil; the coast has always been, and still is, densely peopled, and
                    the builders of successive generations, like those of the present day, have
                    regarded ancient edifices as their most convenient quarries. Phoenician
                    architecture had its beginning in the widening and adaptation of caves in the
                    rocks; the independent buildings of later times, constructed of great blocks of
                    unhewn stone, are direct imitations of such cave-dwellings. As Syrian limestone
                    (which is the material employed) does not admit of the chiselling of finer
                    details, the Phoenician monuments are somewhat rough and irregular. N^ot a
                    vestige remains of the principal sanctuary of this ancient people, the temple of
                    Melkart in Tyre; but Renan discovered a few traces of the temple of Adonis near
                    Byblus, and a peculiar mausoleum, Burj al-Bezzak, still remains near Amrit
                    (Marathus). It may also be conjectured that the conduits of Ras al-Ain, south of
                    Tyre, are of ancient date. Various notices that have come down to us render it
                    probable that the Phoenician temples, in the erection of which great
                    magnificence was undoubtedly displayed, were in many respects similar to the
                    temple at Jerusalem; and confirmatory evidence is afforded by the remarkable
                    remains of a sanctuary near Amrit, in which there is a cella in the midst of a
                    large court hewn out of the rock, and other buildings more of an Egyptian style.
                    In the domain of art originality was as little a characteristic of the
                    Phoenicians as of the Hebrews; they followed foreign and especially Egyptian
                    models. This influence is mainly evident in sculptured remains, in which
                    Egyptian <hi rend="italic">motifs</hi> such as the Uraeus frieze and the winged
                    sun-disk not unfrequently occur. It was in the time of the Persian monarchy that
                    Phoenician art reached its highest development; and to this period belong the
                    oldest remains, numismatic as well as other, that have come down to us. The
                    whole artistic movement may be divided into two great periods: in the first
                    (from the earliest times to the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>)
                    Egyptian influence is predominant, but the national Phoenician element is
                    strongly marked; while in the second Greek influence has obtained the mastery,
                    and the Phoenician element, though always making itself felt, is much less
                    obtrusive. In the one period works of art, as statues of the gods and even
                    sculptured sarcophagi, were sometimes imported direct from Egypt (such statues
                    of the gods have been found even in the western colonies); in the other Greek
                    works were procured mainly from Rhodes. The Phoenicians also adopted from the
                    Egyptians the custom of depositing their dead in sarcophagi. The oldest examples
                    of those anthropoid stone coffins are made after the pattern of Egyptian
                    mummy-cases; they were painted in divers colours, and at first were cut in low
                    relief; afterwards, however, towards and during the Greek period, the contours
                    of the body began to be shown in stronger relief on the cover. Modern
                    excavations show that, besides stone coffins (in marble or basalt), which indeed
                    cannot be considered the oldest kind of receptacle, the Phoenicians employed
                    coffins of wood, clay, and lead, to which were often attached metal plates or,
                    at times it may be, decorations in carved wood. Embalming also seems to have
                    been frequently practised as well as covering the body with stucco. Great care
                    was bestowed by the Phoenicians on their burial-places, and their cemeteries are
                    the most important monuments left to us. The tombs are subterranean chambers of
                    the most varied form: the walls and roof are not always straight; sometimes
                    there are two tiers of tombs one above the other, often several rows one behind
                    the other. While in early times a mere perpendicular shaft led to the mouth of
                    these excavations, at a later date regular stairs were constructed. The dead
                    were deposited either on the floor of the chamber (often in a sarcophagus) or,
                    according to the later custom, in niches. The mouths of the tombs were Availed
                    up and covered with slabs, and occasionally cippi were set up. The great
                    sepulchral monuments (popularly called <hi rend="italic">magházil,</hi>
                    “spindles ”) which have been found above the tombs near Amrit are very peculiar:
                    some are adorned with lions at the base and at the top with pyramidal finials.
                    Besides busts (which belong generally to the Greek period), the smaller objects
                    usually discovered are numerous earthen pitchers and lamps, glass wares, such as
                    tear-bottles, tesserae, and gems. Unrifled tombs are seldom met with.</p>
