                    rising ground on the north-western shore of Mount Bay, at the terminus of the
                    Great Western Railway, 10 miles east-north-east of Land’s End and 20
                    west-south-west of Truro. It is the nearest port to the Scilly Isles, which are
                    about 40 miles distant to the westsouth-west. The market-place is in the centre
                    of the town, and near it the four principal streets intersect each other at
                    right angles. The southern arm of the pier was built in 1772, the Albert or new
                    pier on the east in 1845. The piers are connected by a wharf, viaduct, and
                    swing-bridge (1882); and a dock is being at present constructed at a cost of
                    £60,000, which will extend to about 3 acres. The limits of the port have lately
                    (1884) been extended. The churches are St Mary’s, constructed of cut granite, in
                    the Perpendicular style, with lofty pinnacled tower and peal of eight bells; St
                    Paul’s, of cut and rubble granite, in the style of the 13th century (1843); and
                    St John’s, of stone, Early English (1881). The public buildings, erected of
                    granite in the Italian style in 1867, include the town-hall and
                    council-chambers, St John’s Hall for public meetings, the lecture-hall, the
                    public library (upwards of 16,000 volumes), the news-rooms, the masonic hall,
                    the museum of the Penzance Natural History and Antiquarian Society, and the
                    museum and other rooms of the Geological Society of Cornwall. The market-house
                    (1837), in the Grecian style, with a central dome, includes a meat-market on the
                    ground-floor with a corn-market above, and in the east end of the building is
                    the grammar-school, founded in 1789. In front of the east end is a marble statue
                    of Davy. Somewhat east of the market-house are the post and telegraph offices,
                    completed in 1883. Among the benevolent institutions is the West Cornwall
                    Infirmary (1874), which includes the dispensary (1809). The town has a
                    considerable shipping trade, the total number of vessels which entered the port
                    in 1882 being 1829 of 197,933 tons burden, the number which cleared 1774 of
                    187,569 tons. The exports include tin, copper, granite, serpentine, and fish,
                    and the imports coal, timber, and provisions. Large quantities of pilchard are
                    annually exported to Italy. Fruits, flowers, and vegetables are grown in the
                    neighbourhood for the London market. On account of its sheltered situation and
                    its remarkably mild and equable climate, the town has a high repute as a winter
                    residence for persons suffering from pulmonary complaints; and on account of its
                    fine scenery it is also becoming a favourite watering-place. The population of
                    the municipal borough in 1871 was 10,414, and in 1881 it was 12,409.</p>
                <p>Penzance is said to mean “holy head,” the name being derived from a chapel
                    dedicated to St Anthony, formerly situated on a headland now forming the base of
                    the old pier, around which a fcλv fishermen built their huts and thus originated
                    the town. A castle built by the Tyes, possessors of the manor of Alwarton or
                    Alverton, is supposed to have occupied the present site of St Mary’s Church.
                    Alice de Lisle, sister and heiress of the last Baron Tyes, obtained for the town
                    the grant of a weekly market from Edward III. In the 15th century Penzance was
                    known as a “place of ships and merchandise;” and on the 16th March 1512 it
                    received from Henry VIII. a charter granting to the inhabitants all profits
                    arising from ships visiting the harbour upon condition that the quays and
                    bulwarks of the town were kept in repair. In 1595 the town was burned and
                    pillaged by the Spaniards, and in 1644 sacked by Fairfax. In 1614 it was
                    incorporated by James I.; and in 1663 it obtained a coinage charter,—a privilege
                    it retained till 1838. On account of the usurpation of its chief magistrate its
                    municipal charter was forfeited in the beginning of the reign of Queen Anne, but
                    was restored in 1706. By the Municipal Act of 1835 the government was made to
                    consist of a mayor, six aidermen, and eighteen councillors.</p>
