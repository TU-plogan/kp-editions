                    lies on a point of land with sandy porous soil at the junction of the Guamâ with
                    the Rio Pará or eastern arm of the Amazons, about 75 miles from the sea. The
                    main river is about 20 miles wide opposite the town, but is broken by numerous
                    islands. Pará is regularly built, well-paved, and well-lighted. The houses,
                    which seldom exceed two or three stories in height, are usually substantial
                    structures of stone; and a general brightness of aspect is produced by red-tiled
                    roofs and white, yellow, or even pink and blue coloured walls relieved by dense
                    tropical foliage. The Estrada das Mon-gubeiras, running about a mile from the
                    river to Largo da Polvora in the east end of the city, has long been famous for
                    its magnificent cotton trees <hi rend="italic">(Bombax</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Monguba, B. Ceiba');</hi> but the grand old trees are dying out, and the finest
                    avenue in Pará is now the Estrada de Sâo José, with its colonnade of tall “royal
                    palms <hi rend="italic">” (Oreodoxa regia).</hi> In the outskirts of the city
                    the wealthy merchants have villas with very extensive grounds, and a little way
                    beyond these begins the dense swamp-forest. Pará has a wonderfully pleasant and
                    healthy climate, with a temperature extremely equable throughout the year. “The
                    mornings are cool. From 10 till 2 the heat increases rapidly, commonly reaching
                    90° or 91°. A little later great black clouds appear in the east and spread
                    quickly over the sky; the temperature falls suddenly, the wind blows in varying
                    gusts, the rain pours down, and ere one is aware the sun leaps out. Sometimes
                    the first shower is followed by a second or even a third. By sunset the ground
                    is dry.” This is the rule all the year round; only in the height of the dry
                    season a week may pass without any showers. The Brazilians have a proverb, “Who
                    came to Pará was glad to stay: who drank assai went never away.” The <pb

                    largely drunk by all classes in Parâ. The importance of the city is due to its
                    being the great emporium of the rapidly-developing trade of the Amazons. The
                    trade is carried on by several steamboat companies; the most important, the
                    Amazonian Steamboat Company, receives a subsidy from the Brazilian Government.
                    Two lines of steamers run between Liverpool and Paré,; there are also a French
                    line and a German line. A large trade is transacted with the United States, but
                    mainly through English, French, German, and Portuguese houses. The principal
                    exports are cocoa, Brazil nuts, hides, deer-skins, isinglass, balsam of copaiba,
                    tonka beans, and Peruvian bark. In 1863 the total value of the imports was about
                    £500,000 and of the exports about &lt;£525,000; by 1882 the duties paid to the
                    custom-house amounted to £864,396.</p>
                <p>Population has been growing faster than the supply of houses. In 1819 the
                    inhabitants were estimated at 24,500, but by 1850 they had declined to 15,000;
                    in 1866 they were 36,000 (about 5000 slaves); and they are now (1884) nearly
                    40,000. Besides a vast cathedral (1720) and the president’s palace, usually
                    considered one of the best buildings of its kind in Brazil, Parâ contains an
                    episcopal palace (formerly the Jesuit college), a handsome theatre, a large
                    market building, a custom-house (formerly a convent, with two great towers),
                    naval and military arsenals (the first of some size, with shipbuilding yards and
                    a gridiron), a botanical garden, &amp;c. About a mile from the city is the
                    chapel of Our Lady of Nazareth, the most celebrated shrine in northern
                    Brazil.</p>
                <p>In 1615 Francisco Caldeira de Castello Branco, sent out by the Portuguese at
                    Maranhao, built the fort of Santo Christo and founded the settlement of Nossa
                    Senhora de Belem. By 1641 it was a place of 400 inhabitants, with four
                    monasteries. A premature declaration of independence was made at Para in 1823,
                    and soon after Captain Grenfell, sent by Lord Cochrane, brought the city over to
                    the Brazilian party; but for many years it was subject to political disturbance.
                    In 1835 “every respectable white was obliged to leave the city” by the
                    anarchical proceedings of the so-called “Liberals” Gomes, Vinagre, and
                    Rodriguez.</p>
