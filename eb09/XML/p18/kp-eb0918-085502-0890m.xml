                    field for inquiry as to its nature, its cause, and its treatment. On all these
                    points medical opinion has undergone numerous changes with the advance of
                    science and the application of more accurate methods of investigation; yet,
                    notwithstanding the many important facts which within recent years have been
                    brought to light, it must be admitted that our knowledge of this disease is
                    still far from complete. As regards the nature or pathology of consumption it is
                    unnecessary in a notice like the present to refer at length to the doctrines
                    which have from time to time been held upon the subject, further than merely to
                    indicate in a general way the views which have been more or less widely accepted
                    in recent times. In the early part of the present century the study of the
                    diseases of the chest received a great impetus from the labours of Laennec,
                    whose discovery of the stethoscope led to greater minuteness and accuracy in
                    investigation (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Auscultation).</hi> This physician held
                    that phthisis depended on the development of tubercles in the lungs, which,
                    undergoing various retrograde changes, led to the breaking down and excavation
                    of these organs,—in short, produced the whole phenomena of consumption; and,
                    further, that this tuberculous formation affected various other parts and
                    organs, and was the result of a morbid constitutional condition or diathesis.
                    This doctrine, which was generally taught during the first half of the century,
                    and even longer, was to some extent superseded by that to which the greatest
                    prominence was given by Niemeyer and others, namely, that the majority of cases
                    of phthisis had their origin in an inflammation of the lung (catarrhal
                    pneumonia), but that tubercle—the existence of which was freely admitted—might
                    occasionally be evolved out of this condition. This view has had wide
                    acceptance, but has been modified in a variety of ways, especially by its
                    extension to inflammation in other parts besides the lungs, the unabsorbed
                    products of which are held to be capable of producing tubercle by infection from
                    within the system. Still more recently there has arisen another doctrine in
                    connexion with the discovery by Koch of the micro-organism or bacillus of
                    tubercle, which can be cultivated and which, when inoculated, appears capable of
                    producing tubercular disease, namely, the doctrine of the infectiveness of
                    phthisis by means of this “microbe” received into the system from without. This
                    view, which is supported by many striking facts and arguments, has been
                    extensively adopted as furnishing in all probability a rational basis of the
                    pathology of tubercular consumption. Yet it has not been universally accepted,
                    being held by many to be insufficient to account for the origin and course of
                    the disease in numerous instances and in certain of its forms. It is impossible
                    to deny an important place in the course of the disease to inflammatory
                    processes. Even in those cases where the lungs are infiltrated with tubercular
                    deposit evidence of inflammation is abundantly present, while, on the other
                    hand, it would seem that in not a few instances the process is inflammatory
                    throughout. That phthisis, therefore, is not the same process in all cases, but
                    that there are distinct varieties of the disease, is made clear by the morbid
                    anatomy of the lungs no less than by other considerations.</p>
                <p>Whatever be the form, the common result of the presence of these disease-products
                    is to produce consolidations in the affected portions of the lungs, which,
                    undergoing retrograde changes (caseation), break down and form cavities, the
                    result being the destruction in greater or less amount of lung-substance. These
                    changes most commonly take place at the apex of one lung, but with the advance
                    of the disease they tend to spread throughout its whole extent and to involve
                    the other lung as well. When the disease is confined to a limited area of a lung
                    it may undergo arrest—even although it has advanced so far as to destroy a
                    portion of the pulmonary tissue, and a healing process may set in and the
                    affected part cicatrize. This is, however, exceptional, the far more common
                    course being the progress of the destructive change either by the spread of the
                    inflammatory process or by infection through the lymphatics, &amp;c., from the
                    existing foci of diseased lungtissue. Various morbid changes affecting the lungs
                    themselves or other organs frequently arise in the course of phthisis,
                    complicating its progress and reducing the chance of recovery. Of these the more
                    common are affections of the pleura, stomach, liver, kidneys, and especially the
                    intestines, which in the later stage of the disease become ulcerated, giving
                    rise to the diarrhoea which is so frequent and fatal a symptom at this
                    period.</p>

                <p>The causes influential in producing phthisis are numerous and varied, but they
                    may for general consideration be embraced under two groups, namely, those which
                    are <hi rend="italic">predisposing</hi> and operate through the constitution as
                    a whole, and those which are <hi rend="italic">exciting</hi> and act immediately
                    upon the organs implicated. These two sets of causes may be more or less
                    distinctly associated in an individual case; but, on the other hand, one may
                    appear to act in both ways—as predisposing and exciting. The following may serve
                    to illustrate some of the conditions of a predisposing kind. A constitutional
                    tendency to scrofula and its manifestations lends itself readily to the
                    production, of phthisis. This morbid constitution is characterized among other
                    things by a liability to low chronic forms of inflammation affecting
                    gland-textures, mucous membranes, &amp;c., the products of which show little
                    readiness to undergo absorption, but rather to degenerate. Inflammations of this
                    character affecting the lungs, as is not uncommon, have a special tendency to
                    lead to the breaking down of lung-texture and formation of phthisical cavities.
                    Many high authorities hold that tubercle-formation may be evolved out of
                    scrofulous inflammations of glands, such as those of the neck, by an infective
                    process, like that already referred to. The mention of this constitutional state
                    naturally suggests another powerful predisposing cause, namely, hereditary
                    transmission. The extent to which this influence operates as a cause of
                    consumption has been differently estimated by writers, owing probably to the
                    various aspects in which the matter is capable of being viewed. It is impossible
                    to deny that the children of parents one or both of whom are consumptive are
                    liable to manifest the disease,—that is, they inherit a constitution favouring
                    its development under suitable exciting causes. But a similar constitutional
                    proclivity may be induced by other influences acting through the parents. Should
                    either or both of them be enfeebled by previous disease or by any other
                    weakening cause, they may beget children possessing a strong predisposition, to
                    consumption. Marriages of near relatives are held by some to induce a
                    consumptive tendency,— probably, however, owing to the fact that any
                    constitutional taint is likely to be intensified in this way. Phthisis is a
                    disease of early life, the period between fifteen and thirty-five being that in
                    which the great majority of the cases occur, and of these by far the larger
                    proportion will be found to take place between the ages of twenty and thirty.
                    The influence of sex is not marked. Occupations, habits, and conditions of life
                    have a very important bearing on the development of the disease apart altogether
                    from inherited tendency. Thus occupations which necessitate the inhalation of
                    irritating particles, as in the case of stone-masons, needle-grinders, workers
                    in minerals, in cotton, flour, straw, &lt;fcc., are specially hurtful, chiefly
                    from the mechanical effects upon the delicate pulmonary tissue of the matter
                    inhaled. No less prejudicial are occupations carried on in a heated and close
                    atmosphere, as is often the case with compositors, gold-beaters, sempstresses,
                    &amp;c. Again, habitual exposure to wet and cold or to sudden changes of
                    temperature will act in a similar way in inducing pulmonary irritation which may
                    lead to phthisis. Irregular and intemperate habits are known predisposing
                    causes; and over-work, over-anxiety, want of exercise, insufficient or
                    unwholesome food, bad hygienic surroundings such as overcrowding and defective
                    ventilation, are all powerful agents in sowing the seeds of the disease.
                    Consumption sometimes arises after fevers and other infectious maladies, or in
                    connexion with any long-continued drain upon the system, as in over-lactation.
                    The subject of climate and locality in connexion with the causation of phthisis
                    has received considerable attention, and some interesting facts have been
                    ascertained on this point. That phthisis is to be met with in all climes, and it
                    would seem fully as frequently in tropical as in temperate regions, is evidence
                    that climate alone exercises but little influence. It is very different,
                    however, with locality, elevation appearing to affect to a considerable extent
                    the liability to this disease. It may be stated as generally true that phthisis
                    is less prevalent the higher we ascend. The investigations of Dr H. J. Bowditch
                    in New England and of Dr George Buchanan of the Local Government Board in the
                    counties of Surrey, Kent, and Sussex agree in proving that elevated regions with
                    dryness of soil are hostile to the prevalence of consumption, while low-lying
                    and damp districts seem greatly to favour its development; and it has been found
                    that the successful drainage of damp localities has occasionally had a marked
                    effect in reducing their phthisis mortality. In all such observations, however,
                    various modifying circumstances connected with social, personal, and other
                    conditions come into operation to affect the general result. As regards
                    immediate or exciting causes, probably the most potent are inflammatory
                    affections of the respiratory passages produced as the result of exposure. The
                    products of such attacks are liable under predisposing conditions, such as some
                    of those already mentioned, to remain unabsorbed and undergo degenerative
                    changes, issuing in the breaking down and excavation of the pulmonary texture. A
                    necessary consequence of the modern doctrine of the contagious nature and
                    inoculability of tubercle has been to bring to the front a view as to phthisis
                    once widely prevalent and in some countries— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    Italy—never wholly abandoned, namely, its infectiousness. By some supporters of
                    the recent theories of tubercle it is maintained that phthisis is communicated
                    by infection and in no other way, the infecting agent being the bacillus.
                    Others, while holding the view of the specific nature of the disease, deny that
                    it can be communicated by infection like-a fever, and cite the experience of
                    consumption hospitals (such as that described by Dr C. T. Williams with respect
                    to the Brompton Hospital) as to the absence of any evidence of its spreading
                    among the nurses and officials. Others, again, deny both its specific nature and
                    its direct infectious character. There appears, however, to be a growing opinion
                    that phthisis may occasionally be acquired by a previously healthy person from
                    close association with one already suffering from it, and, if this view be well
                    founded, it affords a strong presumption that some infecting agent (such as the
                    tubercle bacillus) is the medium of communication. The whole subject of the
                    infectiousness of this disease is as yet unsettled; but there appears to be
                    sufficient reason for special care on the part of those who of necessity are
                    brought into close contact with patients suffering from it.</p>
                <p>Cases of phthisis differ widely as regards their severity and their rate of
                    progress. Sometimes the disease exhibits itself as an acute or galloping
                    consumption, where from the first there is high fever, rapid emaciation, with
                    cough and other chest symptoms, or with the comparative absence of these, and a
                    speedily fatal termination. In such instances there would probably be found
                    extensive tuberculization of the lungs and other organs. In other instances, and
                    these constitute the majority, the progress of the disease is chronic, lasting
                    for months or years, and along with periods of temporary improvement there is a
                    gradual progress to a fatal issue. In other cases, again, the disease is
                    arrested and more or less complete restoration to health takes place.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to describe the symptoms or course and progress of all the
                    varieties of this malady. It will be sufficient to refer to those of the
                    ordinary form of the disease as generally observed. The onset may be somewhat

                    (spitting of blood), but more commonly it is slow and insidious and may escape
                    notice for a considerable time. The patient is observed to be falling away in
                    flesh and strength. His appetite fails, and dyspeptic symptoms trouble him. But
                    the most marked feature of the condition is the presence of a cough, which is
                    either persistent or recurs at certain times, as in lying down in bed or rising
                    in the morning. The cough is dry or is accompanied with slight clear
                    expectoration, and the breathing is somewhat short. Feverish symptoms are
                    present from an early period, the temperature of the body being elevated,
                    especially in the evening. The patient often complains of flying pains in the
                    chest, shoulders, and back. Such symptoms occurring, especially in one who may
                    possess by inheritance or otherwise an evident tendency to chest disease, should
                    excite suspicion, and should be brought under the notice of the physician. They
                    constitute what is commonly known as the first stage of phthisis and indicate
                    the deposit of tubercle or else inflammatory consolidation in the lung.<note

                    by the usual methods of physical diagnosis reveals in this stage the following

                    observed to be narrow and poorly developed, or it may be quite natural. At its
                    upper region there may be noticed slight flattening under the clavicle of one
                    side, along with imperfect expansion of that part on full inspiration. On <hi
                    rend="italic">percussion</hi> the note may be little if at all impaired, but
                    frequently there is dulness more or less marked at the apex of the lung. On <hi
                    rend="italic">auscultation</hi> the breathsounds are variously altered. Thus
                    they may be scarcely audible, or again harsher than natural, and the expiration
                    may be unduly prolonged. Sometimes the breathing is of an interrupted or jerky
                    character, and is occasionally accompanied with fine crepitations or râles.
                    Pleuritic friction-sounds may be audible over the affected area.</p></note> Not
                    unfrequently the disease is arrested in this stage by judicious treatment, but
                    should it go on the symptoms characterizing the second stage (that of softening
                    and disintegration of lung) soon show themselves. The cough increases and is
                    accompanied with expectoration of purulent matter in which lung-tissue and the
                    bacillus of tubercle can be detected on microscopic examination.<note

                    signs are more distinctive of the disease. Thus the flattening of the chest-wall

                    auscultation the breathing is accompanied with coarse moist sounds or râles,
                    which become more audible on coughing. The voice-sound is
                    broncho-phonic.</p></note> The symptoms present in the first stage become
                    intensified: the fever continues and assumes a hectic character, being
                    accompanied with copious night-sweats, while the appetite and digestion become
                    more and more impaired and the loss of strength and emaciation more marked. Even
                    in this stage the disease may undergo abatement, and improvement or recovery
                    take place, though this is rare; and by careful treatment the advance of the
                    symptoms may be in a measure held in check. The final stage (or stage of
                    excavation), in which the lung has become wasted to such an extent that cavities
                    are produced in its substance, is characterized by an aggravation of all the
                    symptoms of the previous stage. In addition, however, there appear others
                    indicating the general break-up of the system. Diarrhoea, exhausting
                    night-perspirations, and total failure of appetite combine with the cough and
                    other pulmonary symptoms to wear out the patient’s remaining strength and to
                    reduce his body to a skeleton. Swelling of the feet and ankles and soreness of
                    the mouth (aphthae) proclaim the approach of the end.<note anchored="true"

                    pneumothorax. A remarkable and often painful feature of the disease is the
                    absence in many patients of all sense of the nature and gravity of the malady
                    from which they suffer, and their singular buoyancy of spirits (the <hi
                    rend="italic">spes phthisica),</hi> rendering them hopeful of recovery up till
                    even the very end.</p>
                <p>This description is but a brief and imperfect outline of the course and progress
                    of an ordinary case of phthisis. It is scarcely necessary to remark that the
                    disease is greatly modified in its course and progress and in the presence or
                    absence of particular symptoms in individuals. Thus in some the chest-symptoms
                    (cough, &amp;c.) are prominent throughout, while in others these are
                    comparatively in abeyance, and diarrhoea or fever and exhausting perspirations
                    or throat-troubles specially conspicuous. Nevertheless, essentially the same
                    pathological conditions are present in each case. Further, as has been already
                    mentioned, there are types of the disease which obviously influence alike its
                    main features and its duration; these have been embraced under two classes, the
                    acute and the chronic. In the former, which includes the acute tuberculous and
                    acute inflammatory or pneumonic phthisis, the progress of the disease is marked
                    by its rapidity and the presence of fever even more than by local
                    chest-symptoms. Such cases run to a fatal termination in from one to three or
                    four months, and are to be regarded as the most severe and least hopeful form.
                    The chronic cases, of which the description above given is an example (and which
                    embrace various chronic changes, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> chronic
                    interstitial pneumonia or cirrhosis of the lung), progress with variable
                    rapidity. Their duration has been estimated by different authorities at from two
                    to eight or more years. Much, however, necessarily depends on the effect the
                    disease exercises upon the patient’s strength and nutrition, on his
                    circumstances and surroundings, and on the presence or absence of weakening
                    complications. Many cases of this class remain for long unchanged for the worse,
                    perhaps undergoing temporary improvement, while in a few rare instances, where
                    the disease has become well marked or has even attained to an advanced stage,
                    what is virtually a cure takes place.</p>
                <p>The treatment of phthisis has received much attention from physicians as well as
                    from empirics, by the latter of whom chiefly many so-called cures for
                    consumption have from time to time been given forth. It need scarcely be stated
                    that no “cure” for this disease exists; but, while this is true, it is no 1ess
                    true that by the adoption of certain principles of treatment under enlightened
                    medical guidance a very great deal may now be done to ward off the disease in
                    those who show a liability to it, and to mitigate and retard, or even arrest,
                    its progress in those who have already become affected by it. The preventive
                    measures include careful attention to hygienic conditions, both personal and
                    surrounding. In the case of children who may inherit a consumptive tendency or
                    show any liability to the disease much care should be taken in bringing them up
                    to promote their general health and strengthen their frames. Plain wholesome
                    food with fatty ingredients, if these can possibly be taken, milk, cream,
                    &amp;c., are to be recommended. Exercise in the open air and moderate exercise
                    of the chest by gymnastics and by reading aloud or singing are all advantageous.
                    An ample supply of fresh air in sleeping apartments, schools, &amp;c., is of
                    great importance, while warm clothing and the use of flannel are essential,
                    especially in a climate subject to vicissitudes. The value of the bath and of
                    attention to the function of the skin is very great. The like general hygienic
                    principles are equally applicable in the case of adults. When the disease has
                    begun to show any evidence of its presence its treatment becomes a matter of
                    first importance, as it is in the early stages that most can be done to arrest
                    or remove it. Special symptoms, such as cough, gastric disturbances, pain,
                    &amp;c., must be dealt with by the physician according to the individual<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0893-0858"/> case; but it is in this stage of the disease that
                    the question of a change of ,climate in the colder seasons of the year arises
                    among those whose circumstances render such a step practicable. There can be no
                    doubt that as regards Great Britain the removal of patients threatened by or
                    already suffering from consumption to some mild locality, either in the country
                    or abroad, proves in many instances most salutary. The object aimed at is to
                    obtain a more equable climate, λvhere the atmosphere may have a soothing
                    influence on the respiratory organs, and where also open-air exercise may be
                    taken with less risk than at home. Of British health-resorts Bournemouth,
                    Hastings, Torquay, Ventnor, Penzance, &lt;fcc., in the south of England, are the
                    best known and most frequented, and although the climate is not so certain as in
                    places farther south in Europe they possess the advantage of home residence, and
                    may be resorted to by persons who are unable to undertake a farther journey. The
                    climate of the Riviera (Maritime Alps) is of superior efficacy owing to its
                    mildness and the dry bracing character of its air, and, despite the long
                    journey, is as a rule to be recommended as one of the best for the greater
                    proportion of the cases of phthisis. The same may be said for Algiers and Egypt.
                    Of recent years the air of elevated dry regions, such as Davos in the Alps and
                    the Rocky Mountains in America, has been strongly recommended, and in not a few
                    cases appears to be productive of good in arresting the disease at its outset,
                    and even advantageous in chronic cases where there is no great activity in its
                    progress. Of like value, and in a similar class of cases, are long sea-voyages,
                    such as those to Australia or New Zealand. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that
                    consumptive patients are often sent abroad manifestly to die. It may be stated
                    generally (although doubtless there may be exceptions) that where the disease
                    exhibits a decidedly acute form, even in its earlier stages, any distant change
                    is rather to be discouraged; while in the advanced stages, where there is great
                    prostration of strength, with colliquative symptoms, the removal of a patient is
                    worse than useless, and frequently hastens the end.</p>
                <p>Throughout the whole course of the malady the nutrition of the patient forms a
                    main part of the treatment, a∏d tonics which promote the function of the
                    digestive organs are especially helpful. Codliver oil has long been held to be
                    of eminent value, as it appears not merely to possess all the advantages of a
                    food but to exert a retarding effect on the disease. Where it is well borne, not
                    only will the weight of the body be found to increase, but the cough and other
                    symptoms will markedly diminish. The oil is as a rule best administered at first
                    in small quantity. The frequently employed substitutes, such as malt extract,
                    tonic syrups, &amp;c., although not without their uses, are all inferior to
                    codliver oil. The occasional employment of counterirritation to the chest in the
                    form of iodine or small blisters is of service in allaying cough and relieving
                    local pains. Respirators to cover the mouth and nose, and so constructed as to
                    contain antiseptic media through which the air is breathed, are sometimes found
                    to lessen cough and other symptoms of chest-irritation.</p>
                <p>Among the most serviceable drugs in the treatment of the symptoms of phthisis are
                    the preparations of opium. Administered along with such agents as hydrocyanic
                    acid and expectorants, they are eminently useful in soothing severe cough; along
                    with astringents they are equally valuable in controlling diarrhoea; while with
                    quinine, digitalis, &amp;c., they aid in allaying fever and restlessness and in
                    procuring sleep. But besides these many other medicinal agents, too numerous to
                    mention here, are employed with much advantage. Each case will present its own
                    features and symptoms calling for special attention and treatment, and details
                    upon these points must be left to the advice of the medical attendant. (j. o.
