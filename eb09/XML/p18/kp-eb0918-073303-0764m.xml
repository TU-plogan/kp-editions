                    was able to predict an earthquake three days before it took place. The accounts
                    of his death are very discrepant, but the commonest was that he died of the <hi
                    rend="italic">morbus</hi><hi rend="italic">pediculosus.</hi> But, if the minute
                    description which Hippocrates gives of the death of Pherecydes refers to the
                    philosopher, he would seem to have died of a virulent fever, perhaps spotted
                    typhus. He is said to have been the first Greek author who wrote in prose, but
                    perhaps the chronicler Cadmus of Miletus preceded him. The statements of late
                    writers, that he drew his philosophy from secret writings of the Phoenicians,
                    and that he was a disciple of the Egyptians and Chaldaeans, deserve little
                    attention, made as they were at a time when it was the fashion to regard all
                    wisdom as derived from the East. He was credited with having originated the
                    doctrine of metempsychosis, while Cicero and Augustine even assert that he was
                    the first to teach the immortality of the soul. Of his astronomical studies he
                    left a proof in the “helio-tropion,” a cave at Syros which served to determine
                    the annual turning-point of the sun, like the grotto of Posillipo at Naples.</p>
                <p>In his book, to which Suidas gives the name of <hi rend="italic">iπτaμυχοs
                    ijτοL</hi><hi rend="italic">θεοκρασία ή</hi><hi rend="italic">θεοyονιa,</hi> he
                    enunciated a system in which philosophy and mythology were blended. In the
                    beginning, according to Pherecydes, were Zeus, Chronos (Time) or Cronus, and
                    Chthon (Earth); Chronos begat Fire, Wind, and Water, and these three begat
                    numerous other gods.</p>
                <p>Another <hi rend="smallcaps">Pherecydes</hi> of Athens, an early Greek historian,
                    was a native of the island of Leros, and lived in the former half of the 5th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Amongst his contemporaries were
                    Hellanicus and Herodotus. Of his works “On Leros,” “On Iphigenia,” “On the
                    festivals of Dionysus” nothing remains; but numerous fragments of his great work
                    on mythology, in ten books, have been preserved, and are collected by C. Müller
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Fr. Hist. Gr.,</hi> vol. i.</p>
