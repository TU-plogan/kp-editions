                <p><label type="entry">PENANCE</label>. The word “penance” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(poenitentia)</hi> has a double signification,—its strict legal meaning of a
                    penalty inflicted by the formal sentence of a spiritual authority in punishment
                    of an offence, and with the primary object of amending and so benefiting the
                    offender; and its wider and more popular sense of any ascetic practice adopted,
                    whether voluntarily or under compulsion, for the expiation of sin or for advance
                    in spiritual attainment. Broadly speaking, no trace of such a theory is visible
                    in classical paganism, from which the idea of sin as a moral defilement is
                    almost absent. There are faint marks discernible in the Greek heroic legends of
                    something analogous to penance, when we read of a hero being driven into exile
                    for some crime (most usually unpremeditated homicide), and not permitted to
                    return till he had found some one able and willing to purify him with certain
                    lustral sacrifices. In the historical period these lustral sacrifices continue,
                    but the accompanying penalty disappears. Punishments for religious offences, and
                    of a very severe kind, extending to death itself, as in the case of Socrates,
                    are frequent, but they are not of the nature of penance, not having the
                    amendment of the offender in view, but only the safety of the state, to be
                    secured by an act of vengeance designed to avert the anger of the gods and to
                    prevent the repetition of the crime believed likely to invoke it. The Oriental
                    religions, contrariwise, teem with the ascetic principle, and personal
                    austerities form a large part of the Zoroastrian, Buddhist, and Brahman systems.
                    Yet, with the exception of the pilgrimages, which enter so deeply and widely
                    into the religious habits of the peoples professing these creeds, and involve
                    much toil and suffering in the case of the poorer pilgrims, these austerities
                    are not of general incidence, but are confined to a comparatively small, and, so
                    to say, professional body of devotees, such as the Indian Jogis, who are
                    entirely distinct from the main body of their co-religionists. Islam had
                    originally nothing even remotely like the practices in question, save in so far
                    as the annual fast of Ramadan and the hajj to Mecca and other sacred places
                    necessitated self-denial; and it is even on record that Mohammed himself
                    directly discouraged an ascetic spirit which displayed itself in some of his
                    trustiest companions and disciples, such as Omar, 'Ali, Abú-Dharr, and
                    Abú-Hcreirah. But the reaction of conquered Persia, long the home of Zoroastrian
                    asceticism, on the Arab victors was marked and early, and an inner body of
                    austere devotees arose in the midst of Mohammedanism within a century and a half
                    of the Flight, though having no justification in the Koran or in the body of
                    early tradition for their tenets and usages. They were in almost every instance
                    of Persian origin, and the most famous of them all, the converted robber Fodheil
                    Abú 'Ali Zalikhání, the Benedict of Islam, who first organized the scattered
                    ascetics into the brotherhood of dervishes, was himself a Khorásání of pure
                    descent. But, like the Indian Jogis, the Mohammedan dervishes and fakirs have
                    continued as an isolated class, and have never exerted the kind of influence
                    which Christian monachism, especially in the West, has done. Nor has the
                    principle of penance ever formed an important integer of the Jewish religion.
                    The Levitical code enjoins the performance of various lustral sacrifices in
                    expiation of certain sins; but the cost of the victims is the only element of
                    penalty, being virtually a money fine <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0506-0485"/> on the offender. The prophets, while dwelling
                    much on the necessity of repentance, of a moral change in the sinner, are almost
                    entirely silent as to any accompanying acts and observances of an ascetic
                    nature; and, though occasional references to prolonged fastings and to the
                    wearing of sackcloth as penitential exercises are found, yet they appear as
                    exceptional and spontaneous, and not as part of an accredited system, nor as
                    enjoined by any authority external to the devotee or penitent himself. Even
                    under the Talmudic code there is no organized system of penance. The three
                    degrees of excommunication, <hi rend="italic">niddui, cherem,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">shammata,</hi> ascending from mere exclusion from the congregation
                    for a month, through the stage of anathema, to that of public and ignominious
                    expulsion from fellowship in Israel (and that at first irrevocably, though the
                    penalty was afterwards relaxed), practically exhaust the code, since there are
                    no formal provisions for inflicting other penalties, whatever voluntary
                    observances may at any time have been superadded.</p>
                <p>The Christian theory of penance ultimately rests on the view that the Christian
                    church is the precise analogue of the Jewish people under the elder
                    dispensation. As the Jews were the one family on earth in direct covenant with
                    God, so that it became necessary for all Gentiles who desired to be brought into
                    the like relation to abandon their own proper nationality and to become Jews by
                    adoption, forsaking their former habits and associations together with their
                    creed; and as various offences against the law of Moses were punished with
                    temporary or final exclusion from fellowship in the Hebrew polity; so was it
                    from a very early period in the Christian church. One marked difference between
                    the Rabbinical and the Christian discipline is indeed visible from the first,
                    that the former involved the suspension or deprivation of civil rights, whereas
                    the latter, in all the earlier centuries at any rate, was a purely spiritual
                    penalty. But they are agreed in combining two ideas, one wholly foreign (as
                    already observed) to paganism, and the other but vaguely shadowed therein, —the
                    aim of healing the offender himself and the need of his making public
                    satisfaction to the society whose rules he had broken, and which might suffer in
                    reputation and influence by reason of his misconduct. It is this notion of
                    satisfaction which has led to the extension of the word “penance” itself from
                    its more restricted and legal meaning to its wider use as covering the whole
                    range of ascetic practices. And, as it soon came to be accepted that the inward
                    sorrow for sin would be attended with an outward token of that sorrow, involving
                    pain or humiliation in some form or other, there are four distinct stages in the
                    ecclesiastical use of the word “poenitentia,”—first, as denoting the change of
                    mind due to sorrow for sin; next, the external penalty attached to each offence;
                    thirdly, the discipline of the church in dealing with all spiritual offences;
                    and lastly, any piece of austerity practised with a religious motive; and the
                    fact of the Latin language having no doublets like the English “penitence” and
                    “penance” to express the distinct though allied ideas of the mental attitude and
                    the outward action has powerfully conditioned Latin theology and practice.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Greek word <hi
                    rend="italic">μετάνοια,</hi> which stands both for repentance and for the
                    sacrament or mystery of penance, has undergone a singular degeneration of
                    meaning in ecclesiastical language, being often used to denote an obeisance of
                    head and body, because that gesture is one which was enjoined upon penitents as
                    part of the outward expression of sorrow for sin. But this ambiguity has had no
                    theological results; because the penalty imposed in the confessional is not
                    called <hi rend="italic">μετάνοια,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">tιrιτιμιa,</hi>
                    and thus no confusion can arise, especially as the context always shows clearly
                    when <hi rend="italic">μετάνοια</hi> stands for a mere gesture.</p></note></p>
                <p>There is naturally but little to be found in the New Testament on the subject of
                    discipline; but the whole principle is provided for and anticipated in one
                    saying of</p>
                <p>Christ—that which directs that he who neglects to hear the church as arbiter in a
                    dispute shall be regarded as a heathen man and a publican, and which goes on to
                    confer upon the apostles the power of binding and loosing (Matt, xviii. 17,
                    18),—words which they, with their Jewish experience and associations, must needs
                    have interpreted as authorizing, and even enjoining, the infliction of
                    penalties, and notably that of excommunication, upon members of the new society.
                    Accordingly, the leading example of such discipline, the case of the incestuous
                    Corinthian, attests plainly some form of trial, a sentence of excommunication,
                    some proof of repentance, and the consequent reconciliation and restoration of
                    the offender (1 Cor. v.; 2 Cor. ii. 6-10); and it is most probable that some
                    such method was pursued in the sub-apostolic church, each case being dealt with
                    locally, and on its separate merits, long before any formal system or code came
                    into existence. The penalties seem at first to have been very simple and
                    lenient, leaving out of account the difficult problem of the phrase “delivering
                    to Satan,” twice found in this connexion (1 Cor. v. 5; 1 Tim. i. 20), which may
                    mean merely relegating to heathen fellowship by exclusion from the society of
                    Christians, but also may cover much more ground. Exclusion from the eucharist
                    itself, exclusion from non-communicating attendance at the eucharist, and
                    exclusion from all religious assemblies for even the minor offices of worship
                    are the only censures discoverable in the earlier period, though it is not long
                    before certain additional penalties accompanying these grades of separation
                    begin to appear. The following broad rules govern all cases of penitential
                    discipline in the ancient church. (1) Penance related only to baptized and
                    communicant Christians. Even catechumens were not held capable of it, to say
                    nothing of Jews or Pagans. (2) It was exclusively spiritual, and in no way
                    touched the civil condition of the penitent, even after the conversion of the
                    empire. (3) It was not compulsory, but spontaneous; nay, so far was it from
                    being imposed, that it had to be sought as a favour. Of course, where it was not
                    so sought the excommunication of the offender remained in force, but this
                    excommunication was not regarded as in itself a penance in the later use of that
                    term. (4) The most usual rule allowed of penance but once. The relapsing
                    offender had no second opportunity granted him. (5) It was always preceded by
                    confession <hi rend="italic">(εξορολόγησις),</hi> a term which, however, even as
                    early as Tertullian’s time, was already extended to include, over and above the
                    oral acknowledgment of guilt, the external acts of mortification accompanying it
                    <hi rend="italic">(De Poen.,</hi> c. 9). (6) There was a careful classification
                    of the offences involving penance, and after a time a corresponding
                    classification of penitents into certain fixed grades, through which it was in
                    many cases necessary to pass, from the lowest to the highest, before receiving
                    absolution and being restored to full communion.</p>
                <p>The case dealt with by St Paul establishes one point, that of the comparative
                    brevity of the time of penance, even for very grave offences, since three years
                    is the longest period which can have elapsed between the two epistles to the
                    Corinthians; whereas under the later system periods of fifteen and twenty years
                    are not rarely to be found, and in some cases penance was for life, however
                    protracted. The earlier method can be shown to have come into wide acceptance
                    far within the 2d century, because it forms the subject of a charge made against
                    the church by Tertullian in one of his Montanist treatises <hi rend="italic"
                    >(De</hi><hi rend="italic">Pudicitia)</hi>; and the more stringent discipline of
                    the succeeding era appears to be due to the nearly simultaneous action of two
                    causes,—the great success which attended the persecution set on foot by the
                    emperor Decius in 249, resulting as it did in a far larger proportion<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n507/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0507-0486"/> of apostasies and compromises than any of the
                    others, and the rise of Novatianism within two years, in protest against the
                    leniency exercised towards the lapsed. Although the church rejected the extreme
                    theories of rigid discipline which Novatian formulated, yet it was tacitly
                    admitted that he did but exaggerate a truth, and the reins began to be drawn
                    tighter from that time forward. Much information regarding the practical working
                    of the system in the third century can be gathered from the epistles of Cyprian,
                    and from his treatise <hi rend="italic">On the Lapsed</hi>; but the fact that he
                    had to struggle against a lax party in Africa, at the very time when laxity was
                    preponderant in the Italian Church, proves that no uniform system had yet been
                    evolved. The 4th century is the period when broad general rules, intended to
                    apply to all cases, begin to be laid down, and when the distribution of
                    penitents into fixed classes or grades is clearly evident. The Eastern Church
                    took the lead in this development, and canons of Ancyra and Neo-Caesarea in 314
                    refer to the grades of penance in terms which imply their general recognition as
                    already established. They are first defined in an epistle ascribed to Gregory
                    Thaumaturgus about the year 258, and are as under: (1) Weepers, forbidden to.
                    enter a church, and permitted merely to assemble at the doors to ask the prayers
                    of those entering; (2) Hearers, suffered to come in for the Scripture lessons
                    and the minor offices, but obliged to depart before the eucharistie office
                    began; (3) Kneelers, allowed to attend the earlier part of the eucharistie
                    office, as far as the close of the introductory portion, but obliged to withdraw
                    then along with the catechumens; (4) Standers, who might remain throughout the
                    entire rite, but were not suffered to communicate. This minute subdivision does
                    not seem to have made good a footing in Western Christendom, where the first of
                    these degrees is not found on record (Morinus, <hi rend="italic">De
                    Poeηiteηt.,</hi> vi. 8), nor did it hold its ground very long in the East
                    itself, disappearing as it does during the 5th century. The penitential
                    observances usually imposed on those who were admitted to these grades were
                    public confession of their offence in presence of the congregation, and that, in
                    the case of the lowest grade, several times over; the disuse of all ornaments,
                    and the assumption of a sackcloth garb, with the strewing of ashes on the head
                    (Euseb., <hi rend="italic">II. E.,</hi> v. 28); men had to cut off their hair
                    and shave their beards; women to wear their hair dishevelled and to adopt a
                    special veil; all had to abstain from baths, festivals, and, generally speaking,
                    all physical enjoyments, and fasting on bread and water was often enjoined; they
                    were bound to much more frequent and regular attendance at all religious
                    assemblies than the faithful or the catechumens (Cone. Carthag. IV., c. 81); if
                    possessed of means, they were required to give largely in alms, or to assist
                    actively in works of charity; and they were, for the first ten centuries,
                    incapable of being admitted to ordination. One result of the crowds of penitents
                    which had to be dealt with after the lull that followed the Decian persecution
                    was that the bishops were no longer sufficient in numbers to deal with each case
                    separately, though under the earlier system the bishop alone (even when the
                    presbyters acted as his assessors) could put to penance, as he continued for a
                    long time to be the only officer who could reconcile and readmit those who had
                    performed their appointed penance. A practice arose, therefore, of appointing
                    certain presbyters to confer with all persons applying for admission to penance,
                    and to receive their confessions privately, in order to prepare them for the
                    public confession which made an integral part of penance, and indeed to decide
                    whether they could be admitted thereto at all. These officers, known as
                    “penitentiaries,” were abolished in the church of Constantinople by the
                    patriarch Nectarius about 390 (Socrat., <hi rend="italic">II. E.,</hi> v. 19;
                    Sozom., <hi rend="italic">II. E.,</hi> vii. 16), and his example was followed
                    throughout nearly the whole East; but the office continued in the West, with
                    various modifications necessitated by the gradual change of discipline.</p>
                <p>The main difference between the earlier and later systems lies in the fact that
                    penance was for some centuries restricted to certain very grave sins, to wit,
                    idolatry, adultery, and murder, with such lesser offences as were closely allied
                    (as, for instance, the delivery of the sacred books to pagan inquisitors, that
                    <hi rend="italic">traditio</hi> which has given the words “treason” and
                    “traitor” to modern diction); nor does it appear that any distinction was made
                    between the treatment of those penitents whose guilt was notorious and those
                    whose own voluntary confession alone made it manifest. Minor offences were
                    punished with suspension of communion and with refusal of oblations at the hands
                    of the offender, and many were left wholly to the individual conscience. But the
                    catalogue of canonical offences was much enlarged at the time when the
                    penitential system was developed and codified,—theft, usury, false witness,
                    polygamy, habitual drunkenness, and some others being included amongst those
                    which had to be publicly expiated. Yet it was this increased severity which led
                    to the almost total abrogation of public penance, because of the scandal given
                    by the publication of the numerous offences on the new list, whereas the cases
                    under the older rule were necessarily few, however serious. It is clearly stated
                    by both Socrates and Sozomen that the motive of Nectarius in abolishing the
                    office of penitentiary was to avoid the recurrence of an uproar occasioned by
                    the public confession of a lady of high rank, implicating others in a
                    disgraceful fashion, so that he judged it better to leave the question of
                    communion to be settled in private by penitents with their religious advisers,
                    and not to be made matter of general publicity. This became the rule at once in
                    the East, but public penance held its place in the West for many centuries
                    longer, and in fact has never become entirely obsolete. There was, however, a
                    considerable innovation introduced after the 7th century, in that offences
                    privately committed were put in a different category from public sins, and were
                    no longer made liable to public penance, but might be, and soon were, dealt with
                    by private confession and penance only. Not only so, but, whereas the accusation
                    of any person to the bishop as an offender was the usual mode of bringing his
                    case under ecclesiastical cognizance in the earlier Christian centuries, on the
                    other hand the discipline introduced in the Middle Ages was to exact public
                    penance from such alone as had been convicted on trial before secular judges.
                    The first beginnings of this innovation on Western usage are attributed by
                    Morinus with much probability to Theodore of Tarsus, the Greek archbishop of
                    Canterbury, who sat from 668 to 690, and whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Penitential</hi> (or code of ecclesiastical discipline), though not the
                    earliest even now extant in the British Isles, soon achieved wide acceptance
                    throughout the West, notwithstanding that it followed the then long-established
                    Eastern usage in favour of private as opposed to public confession. A more
                    serious innovation, fraught with dangerous consequences, made its appearance
                    somewhat later, that of buying off a penance by a money payment to be expended
                    in alms, a system in full force in the 9th century, as attested by the
                    capitularies of Hincmar of Rheims and Hérard of Tours. Another custom which
                    tended to break down the efficiency of the earlier discipline was that of
                    resorting to Rome to have the more serious cases adjudicated on by the pope. At
                    first this was an exceptional mode of dealing with difficult matters, regarded
                    as too serious or too intricate for local decision, but by the 11th century it
                    had become a fashion, so that offenders of any rank or wealth refused habitually
                    to submit to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n508/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0508-0487"/> penance at the hands of the local authorities,
                    and betook themselves to Rome, where they stated their case in their own way,
                    with no evidence to check them, so that they were enabled either to evade the
                    canonical penances altogether or to get them much lightened. This abuse was
                    combated by various councils, notably that of Seligenstadt in 1022, which
                    decreed in its eighteenth canon “that no indulgences obtained from the Roman
                    pontiff should avail for penitents, unless they had first fulfilled the penances
                    set them by their own priests according to the degree of their offence; and, if
                    they chose to go then to Rome, they must procure a permit from their own bishop,
                    and letters on the matter in question to be carried to the pope.” But this
                    attempt to check the practice was unsuccessful, and it became established that,
                    just as certain cases of conscience were reserved to the bishop, and could not
                    be dealt with by ordinary parish priests, so certain other cases were withdrawn
                    from the cognizance of the bishops themselves, and reserved for the hearing and
                    decision of the pope alone. Many alterations in the nature and incidence of
                    penances were made in the course of the later Middle Ages, but the details are
                    unimportant except for specialists; it will suffice to mention such examples as
                    imprisonment in monasteries, penitential pilgrimages, and flagellations, the
                    last having been introduced by the hermit Dominic the Cuirassier (died
                    1060).</p>
                <p>It is time to speak of the position occupied by penance in the theological
                    systems of the Latin and Greek Churches. Both of them account penance, taken in
                    its widest sense of the method of dealing spiritually with sins by confession,
                    discipline, and absolution, as a sacrament, but there are various differences in
                    their theories and methods. The Greek and Armenian Churches are in full
                    agreement with the Latin Church in regarding confession as an integral and
                    essential part of penance, of which they consider it the outward and visible
                    sign, while the spiritual part of the sacrament consists in the form of
                    absolution, whether precatory or declaratory, pronounced by the priest. And they
                    lay down that the external acts of asceticism performed by the penitent are not
                    strictly part of the sacrament itself, but merely the fulfilment of the church’s
                    injunctions, and tokens of that repentance which should attend the confession of
                    sins. And confession, though recommended as a religious observance, is not a
                    matter of formal ecclesiastical precept in the Eastern Church, but is left to
                    the individual conscience, though it is usual to practise it at least once a
                    year, prior to the Easter communion. There are also certain public penances
                    sometimes enjoined in the East for sins of exceptional gravity, publicly or
                    legally proved, but they do not form part of the normal system, one part of
                    which, in strict agreement with ancient usage, consists in suspending heinous
                    offenders from communion for some years, during which they can receive only the
                    <hi rend="italic">aντιδωpoν</hi> or blessed bread. And in all cases the Easterns
                    deny that penances are in any sense satisfactions or expiations of sins made to
                    appease divine justice.</p>
                <p>In the Latin Church the first noticeable divergence from Oriental usage is that
                    the old public form of penance, technically known as “solennis,” still survives
                    in a documentary fashion in the <hi rend="italic">Pontifical,</hi> though it has
                    dropped into virtual abeyance. It consists of two distinct and correlative
                    parts,—the public expulsion of penitents from church on Ash Wednesday and their
                    reconciliation and readmission on Maundy Thursday following. As these rites
                    preserve in essentials the traditions of very early Western usage, it is well to
                    give some account of them here.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">On</hi> Ash Wednesday, then, those penitents whose names are
                    written down on a list for the purpose assemble, in coarse raiment and barefoot,
                    at the cathedral of their diocese at nine o’clock A. Μ. Their penances are then
                    assigned them severally by the penitentiary, or some other officer deputed for
                    the purpose, after which they are sent out of the church, and bidden to wait at
                    the doors. The bishop, attended by the clergy and choir, takes his seat in the
                    middle of the nave, facing the doors, having previously blessed ashes for the
                    coming rite. The penitents are next admitted, and, kneeling before the bishop,
                    have ashes sprinkled on their heads by him or by some other dignitary present,
                    and sackcloth is also laid upon them in similar fashion. The penitential psalms
                    and the litanies are then said, all kneeling; after this the penitents stand up
                    to hear· a sermon from the bishop, at the close of which he takes one of them by
                    the right hand, and leads him towards the doors, followed by all the other
                    penitents, each grasping another’s hand, and also holding lighted tapers, when
                    they are ejected in a body. They kneel outside, and are again addressed by the
                    bishop, enjoining them to spend the time of penance in prayers, fastings,
                    alrasdeeds, and pilgrimages, and to return on Maundy Thursday for
                    reconciliation. The church-doors are then shut in their faces, and the bishop
                    proceeds to celebrate mass.</p>
                <p>The office on Maundy Thursday begins with the penitential psalms and the
                    litanies, said by the bishop and clergy in church, while the penitents wait,
                    barefoot and with unlighted tapers, outside the doors. After some preliminary
                    ceremonies, a deacon goes to the penitents with a lighted candle, and kindles
                    their tapers. The bishop then seats himself, as in the former rite, and the
                    penitents are presented to him collectively by the archdeacon with a formal
                    address. The bishop then rises, and with his immediate attendants advances to
                    the doors, where he delivers a short address to the penitents, which ended, he
                    returns into the church, still keeping near the doors, and, while a psalm is
                    sung, the penitents enter and kneel before him; then the archdeacon or
                    archpriest petitions for their reconciliation, and, having replied to the
                    bishop’s question as to their fitness, recites certain versicles and responses
                    alternately with the choir, while the bishop takes hold of the hand of one of
                    the penitents, who in his turn takes that of another, till all form a chain, and
                    thus they are led by the bishop to the middle of the church, where he recites a
                    form of absolution over them. Psalms and prayers, closing with another
                    absolutory form and a benediction, end the office, after which the penitents
                    resume their ordinary dress, laying aside that which they had worn during
                    Lent.</p>
                <p>A further difference between the Eastern and Latin Churches is that the latter
                    has made confession a formal precept ever since the canon of the Lateran council
                    under Innocent III. in 1215, <hi rend="italic">Omnis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >utri,usque</hi><hi rend="italic">sexus,</hi> which enjoins all those arrived at
                    years of discretion to confess at least once a year to their own parish priest,
                    or to another priest with consent of the parish priest, the act being no longer
                    left optional. And the choice of a confessor is limited also by the rule that
                    absolution is not accounted valid unless pronounced by a priest having local
                    jurisdiction and faculties. The chief divergence, however, between East and West
                    on the sacrament of penance is due to the remarkable developments both in the
                    doctrinal and the disciplinary aspects of the rite which took place in Latin
                    Christendom during the Middle Ages. The former of these is mainly concerned with
                    the new application, in the 12th century, of the system of indulgences, from its
                    original character of a relaxation of the duration or severity of the temporal
                    penalties annexed to offences by the canons to the remission of purgatorial
                    chastisement of departed souls in the intermediate state—-a tenet which seems to
                    have been first developed by Hugh and Richard of St Victor—which gave rise to
                    the practice of penitential observances by persons not lying under any censure,
                    with the aim of acquiring the advantages thus held out to them for themselves or
                    others, living oi' departed, to whom they are at liberty to transfer them. The
                    latter is due to the legal, methodizing, and codifying temper which forms such a
                    marked peculiarity of the Latin mind, in contrast with the more speculative
                    Greek. Hence has arisen a copious literature, beginning with those <hi
                    rend="italic">Penitentials,</hi> or codes of disciplinary canons, already
                    mentioned, but amplified at a later time into a vast system of moral theology
                    and casuistry, mainly elaborated in the 16th and 17 th centuries (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Liguori),</hi> whereby the whole modern administration of
                    penance in the Latin Church is regulated. The Oriental churches have no
                    corresponding system or text-books, and continue to observe the less <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n509/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0509-0488"/> methodized and determinate order in use during
                    the 6th and immediately succeeding centuries. There is no theological difference
                    between them, however, in respect of their view of absolution, although in the
                    one case a declaratory, and in the other a precatory, form is employed. But a
                    distinction in practice is maintained hereupon, for even the United Greeks are
                    obliged, in virtue of an instruction issued by Clement VIII. in 1595, to use
                    only the declaratory form when pronouncing absolution. In Latin theology the
                    matter of the sacrament of penance is distinguished as “remote” and “proximate,”
                    as “exterior” and “interior,” as “necessary” and “sufficient.” The remote and
                    exterior matter of penance is all post-baptismal sin, with the remission and
                    correction of which penance has to do. The class of mortal sins are the
                    necessary exterior matter, because confession is the only recognized mode of
                    obtaining their remission. Venial sins are sufficient or voluntary matter of
                    penance, because confession of them is not compulsory, and remission may be
                    otherwise had. The contrition, confession, and satisfaction of the penitent are
                    the proximate and interior matter of penance, with this further distinction,
                    that the two former are “essential” and inseparable parts of it, while
                    satisfaction, though an “integral” part, is not essential, being capable of
                    dispensation. The form of the sacrament is the absolution pronounced by the
                    priest. And, as before stated, the acts of bodily or spiritual mortification
                    enjoined on the penitent as parts of his satisfaction, are called penances.</p>
                <p>In the Church of England, penance, governed by preReformation canons and
                    statutes, has continued to be inflicted by sentence of the ecclesiastical courts
                    down to very recent times,—one of its commonest forms being that of standing at
                    the church-door clad in a white sheet. Precautions were taken by constitutions
                    of Cardinal Othobon and Archbishop Stratford against the abuse of money
                    commutations of penance; and the right of the spiritual courts to deal with
                    cases involving penance, whether corporal or pecuniary, was protected against
                    writs of prohibition by the statutes <hi rend="italic">Circnmsjìecte</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">agatis,</hi> 13 Edward I. st. 4, and <hi rend="italic">Articuli

                    rend="italic">Legum</hi> provided that ecclesiastical penances should not be
                    commuted for money, save for some grave and necessary cause, and that such money
                    should be applied to the relief of the poor, while a repeated offence should
                    admit of no commutation. This same question came up frequently, having been
                    dealt with under Queen Elizabeth, Charles I., William III., and Queen Anne, on
                    the last occasion by Convocation, which laid down rules that no
                    commutation-money should be allowed by any ecclesiastical judge without the
                    consent of the ordinary in writing, nor disposed of without the like consent.
                    The commination office in the Book of Common Prayer makes reference to the
                    solemn Lenten penance described above, as a thing desirable to be restored; but
                    no action has ever been taken for the purpose.</p>
                <p>In the Lutheran communion, penance, though at first amongst the usages intended
                    to be maintained, and acknowledged in the <hi rend="italic">Articles</hi> of
                    Schmalkald, and also in the <hi rend="italic">Apology</hi> for the Confession of
                    Augsburg, has never held an effective place, being in truth incompatible with
                    the doctrines and polity elaborated by Luther himself; so that, although
                    confession and absolution continue as survivals in the Lutheran system, they are
                    not associated with any regular discipline. Far otherwise is it with Calvinism.
                    The twelfth chapter of the fourth book of Calvin’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Institutes</hi> is mainly taken up with the question of ecclesiastical
                    discipline, whose necessity is broadly stated, and alleged to extend to the
                    whole body, clerical and lay alike, and to be derived from the power of the
                    Keys. No precise rules are laid down, beyond saying that censures may begin with
                    private monition, but should ascend in severity in proportion to the gravity and
                    notoriety of offences; but, in point of fact, the system raised on this basis by
                    most of the Calvinist societies was a stringent and searching one. In
                    particular, the <hi rend="italic">First</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Second Boohs
                    of Discipline,</hi> put forth by John Knox and by the second generation of
                    Scottish Reformers, lay down the principles for dealing with offenders against
                    religion and morals with much clearness and precision, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Form of Process in the Judicatories of the Kirk,</hi> as approved by the
                    General Assembly in 1707, prescribes the manner of proceeding to inflict the
                    several penalties enacted against a variety of offences and scandals. These at
                    one time covered a wide area, but in later times only certain forms of
                    immorality have continued to be brought under ecclesiastical cognizance for
                    public censure and penalties. All the other more important Protestant sects have
                    their own systems of discipline, more or less stringent, but they are virtually
                    restricted in operation to suspension of communion with the body, or to
                    expulsion from membership, no other penalties being provided.</p>
