                    supply St Paul’s personal wants. They were probably wealthier than some of the
                    other communities which he had founded, and consequently he had not the
                    reluctance which he felt elsewhere to receive money from them; the money so sent
                    was no doubt part of the offerings of the community which constituted the
                    Christian sacrifice (iv. 18),—a fund which was administered by the officers of
                    administration, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the bishops and deacons. It was
                    consequently to those officers that he specially addressed his acknowledgment of
                    it.</p>
                <p>He begins by a warm recognition of their steadfastness in the faith and of their
                    sympathy with him (i. 3-7), and, as he is certain that their steadfastness will
                    continue, so he prays that their love may abound more and more in enlightened
                    well-doing (i. 9-11). He proceeds to tell them about himself and about other
                    preachers of the gospel at Rome: as for himself, he is full of hope because his
                    imprisonment has tended to make the gospel known, and has emboldened others to
                    “speak the word of God without fear”; as for other preachers (probably the
                    Jewish Christians who denied his apostleship and disparaged his special
                    teaching), though some of them preach insincerely and controversially, yet,
                    whatever be their motive, “Christ is proclaimed,” and therein he finds cause of
                    rejoicing (i. 12-18). His position is critical, for he may be condemned to
                    death; but, whether he lives or dies, Christ will be glorified through him, so
                    that he cannot tell which he would prefer; for himself it would be far better
                    “to depart and to be with Christ,” but for the Philippians it is better that he
                    should “abide in the flesh” (i. 19-24). Hence he feels confident that he will
                    live, and that he will see the Philippians again; and hence also he exhorts them
                    not to be discouraged by persecutions, and to be at unity among themselves (i.
                    25, ii. 2). The reason for this second exhortation is uncertain: it may be that
                    the differences of race at Philippi, the mingling of Romans and Greeks, of
                    Europeans and Asiatics, had led to the factious assertion by each race of its
                    own superiority, or it may be, though less probably, that there as elsewhere the
                    feud raged between Gentile and Jewish Christians. And, since faction comes of
                    self-assertion, he urges as its antidote the cultivation of “lowliness of mind,”
                    which he enforces by the great example of Jesus Christ, who, so far from
                    asserting the divinity which belonged to Him, emptied Himself of it and took the
                    form of a bond-servant; to this St Paul adds a strong appeal on his own account,
                    that his work among them may not seem to have been in vain (ii. 3-18). He then,
                    with an expression of regret that some of his fellow-workers are no longer with
                    him, announces that he hopes to send Timothy to them as soon as he knows the
                    issue of his coming trial; and he is hopeful that he may be able to go himself;
                    however that may be, he sends back their own messenger, Epaphroditus, who after
                    coming to Rome had almost sacrificed his life in the energy of his work (ii.
                    19-30). Then follows an abrupt transition to another subject, which has
                    sometimes been thought to mark the commencement of a new letter. He suddenly
                    begins to warn the Philippians in strong terms against false teachers, either
                    Judaizing Christians, or, more probably, Jews, who were preaching the necessity
                    of circumcision (Holsten thinks that there is a reference to the murder of James
                    the Just); he maintains that, although he was himself a “Hebrew of Hebrews,” and
                    therefore possessed whatever “confidence in the flesh” such a one might claim,
                    yet he counted it all as “loss” in order that he might gain “the righteousness
                    which is of God by faith”; and borrowing a metaphor from the Greek games he
                    regards this as a prize which has to be won by a continuous effort (iii. 2-16).
                    He urges the Philippians to follow him in this struggle towards moral
                    perfection, in contrast either to the Christians who had lapsed into
                    Epicureanism or, as some think, to the antinomian Jews (iii. 17, iv. 1). He then
                    gives some personal messages to Euodia and Syntyche (whom Schwegler considers to
                    be personifications of the Jewish and heathen Christian parties respectively),
                    and to Synzygus (or, if the word be not a proper name, an anonymous
                    “yoke-fellow” who has been variously supposed to be Paul’s wife, Clement of
                    Rome, St Peter, Lydia the purple-seller, or Epaphroditus), and mentions
                    “Clement,” about whom it has been much discussed, but to little purpose, whether
                    he was a Philippian or a Roman, and, if the latter, whether he was the same
                    person who figures in early legends as bishop of Rome, or whether, as Baur
                    thinks, the name is really that of the Flavius Clemens who was condemned under
                    Domitian for “atheism.” The personal messages are followed by general
                    exhortations to joyfulness, forbearance, trustfulness, and steadfastness in
                    Christian virtue; and then comes that which was probably the special occasion of
                    writing, an acknowledgment of the money which they had sent to him (iv.
                    4-20).</p>
                <p>It is the more probable opinion that the epistle was written from Rome, and not
                    from Caesarea; whether it was written in the earlier or the later period of his
                    stay there is a question which has been much discussed, but which the scantiness
                    of the evidence respecting that stay does not allow of being satisfactorily
                    answered; most writers (De Wette, Wieseler, Wiesinger, Meyer) place it in the
                    later period, others (Bleek, Ewald, Beyschlag, Lightfoot) in the earlier; the
                    latter view is more probable on account of the general agreement of this epistle
                    with the epistle to the Romans. It throws an interesting light on St Paul’s
                    external relations. He was a prisoner, probably in charge of the prefect of the
                    praetorian guard, and consequently with opportunities of making the gospel known
                    among the soldiers; and the mention of Caesar’s household, though no doubt that
                    term covered a large number of scattered individuals, makes it possible that he
                    was lodged near the imperial palace on the Palatine.</p>
                <p>The genuineness of the epistle was attacked by Baur on three grounds, which he
                    himself states to be (1) the appearance of gnostic ideas in ii. 6-11, (2) the
                    want of anything distinctively Pauline, (3) the questionableness of some of the
                    historical data.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    upon this epistle has failed. The supposed gnosticism of ii. 5-11 is not proved;
                    the supposed identification of Clement (iv. 3) with Flavius Clemens, the cousin
                    of Domitian, is merely an arbitrary guess; and the list of expressions which are
                    not found in other epistles of St Paul is not greater than may reasonably be
                    expected from the differences in the subjectmatter.<note anchored="true"

                    (criticized by Hilgenfeld, <hi rend="italic">ibid.,</hi> p. 178), and by Holsten
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Jahrbb. f.prot. Theol.</hi> (1875, p. 425; 1876, p.
                    58), which has been met by the important treatise of P. W. Schmidt, <hi

                <p>The doctrinal importance of the epistle is considerable, for it contains a
                    passage which, if it could be certainly understood, would be at once the key and
                    the summary of St Paul’s Christology. In 2 Corinthians viii. 9 he had <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n781/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0781-0748"/> said of Christ that “though He was rich yet for
                    your sakes He became poor”; in Philippians ii. 5-7 this is expanded into the
                    explicit declaration that “being in the form of God He counted it not a prize
                    (?) to be equal with God, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant,
                    being made in the likeness of men.” Each phrase of the passage is of great
                    significance, but it is also of great uncertainty of meaning: the main points of
                    uncertainty are (1) whether the subject of the sentence is the incarnate or the
                    pre-incarnate Christ; (2) what is implied by the phrase “in the form'of God,”
                    and what is its relation to the phrase “to be equal with God,” some thinking
                    that it implies an identity, others an inferiority of status; (3) what is meant
                    by the word here rendered “prize” (άρτταγ/ιόν), some thinking that this is the
                    right rendering, and that the meaning is “He did not tenaciously cling to His
                    divinity but surrendered it,” others thinking that it should be rendered “an act
                    of robbery,” and that the meaning is “He did not think it a usurpation to assert
                    His divinity”; (4) what is meant by “emptied Himself,” whether He only divested
                    Himself of the outward semblance of divinity, or whether He reduced Himself to
                    the bare consciousness of personality in becoming incarnate; this last question,
                    that of the nature of the <hi rend="italic">henosis,</hi> has bearings of
                    especial importance on the general doctrine of the Person of Christ.</p>
