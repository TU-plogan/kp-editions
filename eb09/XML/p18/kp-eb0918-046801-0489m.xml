                    heaven on his back the horse threw him and continued his heavenward course.
                    Arrived in heaven, Pegasus served Zeus, fetching for him his thunder and
                    lightning. Hence some have thought that Pegasus is a symbol of the thundercloud.
                    In later legend he is the horse of Eos, the Morning. Pindar and later poets
                    represent him as winged. The name is from <hi rend="italic">πηγός,</hi>
                    “compact,” “stout.” The erroneous derivation from <hi rend="italic">πηyη,</hi>
                    “a spring of water,” may have given birth to the legends which connect Pegasus
                    with water, as that his father was Poseidon, that he was born at the springs of
                    Ocean (like the fabulous Indian horse Uccaihs-ravas, prototype of horses,
                    produced at the churning of Ocean), and that he had the power of making springs
                    gush from the ground by a blow of his hoof. This was said to have been the
                    origin of Hippocrene (Horse-spring), the fountain of the Muses on Mount Helicon,
                    as well as of another spring of the same name at Traezen. But there are facts
                    that speak for an independent mythological connexion between horses and water,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the sacredness of the horse to Poseidon, the
                    epithets Hippios and Equester applied to Poseidon and Neptune, the Greek fable
                    of the origin of the first horse (produced by Poseidon striking the ground with
                    his trident), and the custom in Argolis of sacrificing horses to Poseidon by
                    drowning them in a well. (The Illyrians similarly sacrificed horses by
                    drowning.) From his connexion with Hippocrene Pegasus has come to be regarded as
                    the horse of the Muses and hence as a symbol of poetry. But this is a modern
                    attribute of Pegasus, not known to the ancients, and dating only from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Orlando Innarnorato</hi> of the Italian poet Boiardo.</p>
