                    beginning of the 18th century, was born in Paris about 1653. He was son of the
                    Arabic interpreter of the French court, and inherited this office at his
                    father’s death in 1695, afterwards transmitting it to his own son, Alexandre
                    Louis Marie. At an early age he was sent by Colbert to the East; during the ten
                    years he spent in Syria, Persia, and Turkey he mastered Arabic, Persian, and
                    Turkish, and also collected rich materials for future writings.<note

                    manuscript.</p></note> He found, besides, opportunity to equip himself for those
                    diplomatic missions which the French Government entrusted to him soon after his
                    return to Paris in 1680. Having served a short time as secretary to the French
                    ambassador in Morocco, he accompanied as interpreter the French forces sent
                    against Algiers, and greatly contributed to the satisfactory settlement of the
                    treaty of peace between the two countries, which was drawn up by himself in
                    Turkish and ratified in 1684. In a similar capacity he conducted the
                    negotiations with Tunis and Tripoli in 1685 and those with Morocco in 1687; and
                    the zeal, tact, and linguistic knowledge he manifested in these and other
                    transactions with Eastern courts were at last rewarded in 1692 by his
                    appointment to the Arabic chair in the Collège Royal de France, which he filled
                    until his death in 1713.</p>
                <p>He published <hi rend="italic">Contes Tures,</hi> Paris, 1707, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Les Mille et un</hi><hi rend="italic">Jours,</hi> 5 vols., Paris,
                    1710-12, and proved his acquaintance with the Armenian and Ethiopie languages (a
                    powerful impulse to the study of the latter having been given just at that time
                    by the masterly works of Hiob Ludolf) in his <hi rend="italic">Armenian
                    Dictionary</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Account of Ethiopia.</hi> But the
                    lasting monument of his literary fame, the one standard work that has outlived
                    many generations and still keeps a distinct merit of its own, is his excellent
                    French version of Sharaf-uddín 'AH Yazdí’s <hi rend="italic">Zafarnárna,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">History of Timúr</hi> (completed 828 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.h.;</hi> 1425 A.D.), which was given to the world nine years after his death,
                    1722 (4 vols., Paris; translated into English by J. Darby, London, 1723). This
                    work, renowned throughout the East as a model of elegant style, and one of the
                    rare specimens of a fairly critical history Persia can boast of, was compiled
                    under the auspices of Mirzá Ibrahim Sultán, the son of Shah Rukh and grandson of
                    the great Timúr himself. This prince collected all the official records of
                    Tímúr’s reign, both in Turkish and Persian, collated and revised them, and had
                    then an accurate text drawn up by his secretaries, which was turned by
                    Sharaf-uddín into elegant and refined language and revised by Ibrahim Sultán
                    himself (see Rieu’s <hi rend="italic">Cat. Persian MSS. in the Brit. Mus.,</hi>
                    i. p. 173 <hi rend="italic">sq.').</hi> The only error committed by Petis de la
                    Croix in his otherwise very correct translation is that he erroneously ascribed
                    the important share which Ibrahim Sultán had in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zafarndma</hi> to Timúr himself.</p>
