                    years on the death of its father. The story was that the phaenix came from
                    Arabia, bearing its father embalmed in a ball of myrrh, and buried him in the
                    temple of the sun. Herodotus did not believe this story, but he tells us that
                    the picture represented a bird with golden and red plumage, and closely
                    resembling an eagle in size and shape. The story of the phaenix is repeated with
                    variations by later writers, and was a favourite one with the Romans. There is
                    only one phaenix at a time, says Pliny (A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi
                    rend="italic">H.,</hi> x. 2), who, at the close of his long life, builds himself
                    a nest with twigs of cassia and frankincense, on which he dies; from his corpse
                    is generated a worm which grows into the young <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0846-0811"/> phaenix. The young bird lays his father on the
                    altar in the city of the sun, or burns him there, as Tacitus has it <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ann.,</hi> vi. 28). The story of the birth and death of the
                    phaenix has several other forms. According to Horapollo (ii. <hi rend="italic"
                    >57)</hi> he casts himself on the ground and receives a wound, from the ichor of
                    which the new phaenix springs; but the most familiar form of the legend is that
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Physiologus,</hi> where the phaenix is described as an
                    Indian bird which subsists on air for 500 years, after which, lading his wings
                    with spices, he flies to Heliopolis, enters the temple there, and is burned to
                    ashes on the altar. Next day the young phaenix is already feathered; on the
                    third day his pinions are full-grown, he salutes the priest and flies away. The
                    period at which the phaenix reappears is very variously stated, some authors
                    giving as much as 1461 or even 7006 years, but 500 years is the period usually
                    named; and Tacitus tells us that the bird was said to have appeared first under
                    Sesostris, then under Amasis, again under Ptolemy III., and once more in 34
                    A.D., after an interval so short that the genuineness of the last phaenix was
                    suspected. The phaenix that was shown at Rome in the year of the secular games,
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.u.c.</hi> 800, was universally admitted to be an
                    imposture.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some other
                    ancient accounts may be here referred to. That ascribed to Hecataeus is, in the
                    judgment of Cobet <hi rend="italic">{Mnemosyne,</hi> 1883), stolen from
                    Herodotus by a late forger. The poem of the Jew Ezechiel quoted by Eusebius <hi
                    rend="italic">{Praep. Ev.,</hi> ix. 29, 30) appears to refer to the phaenix.
                    Here the sweet song is first mentioned,—a song which, according to the poem on
                    the phaenix ascribed to Lactantius, accompanies the rising sun. The bird is
                    often spoken of in Latin poetry, and is the subject of an idyl by Claudian. See
                    also Solinus, cap. xxxiii., with Salmasius’s <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The form and variations of these stories characterize them as popular tales
                    rather than official theology; but they evidently must have had points of
                    attachment in the mystic religion of Egypt, and indeed both Horapollo and
                    Tacitus speak of the phaenix as a symbol of the sun. Now we know from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Book of the Dead</hi> and other Egyptian texts that a bird called
                    the “bennu” was one cf the sacred symbols of the worship of Heliopolis, and
                    Wiedemann <hi rend="italic">(Ztsch. f. Aeg.</hi><hi rend="italic">Sprache,</hi>
                    xvi. p. 89 <hi rend="italic">sg.)</hi> has made it tolerably clear that the
                    bennu was a symbol of the rising sun, whence it is represented as
                    “self-generating” and called “the soul of Ra (the sun),” “the heart of the
                    renewed Sun.” All the mystic symbolism of the morning sun, especially in
                    connexion with the doctrine of the future life, could thus be transferred to the
                    bennu, and the language of the hymns in which the Egyptians praised the luminary
                    of dawn as he drew near from Arabia, delighting the gods with his fragrance and
                    rising from the sinking flames of the morning glow, was enough to suggest most
                    of the traits materialized in the classical pictures of the Phaenix. That the
                    bennu is the prototype of the phaenix is further confirmed by the fact that the
                    former word in Egyptian means also “palm-tree,” just as the latter does in
                    Greek. How far the Egyptian priests translated the symbolism of the bennu into a
                    legend it would be vain to conjecture; that the common people did so is only
                    what we should expect; and it is to be observed that the monuments have not yet
                    shown any trace of the element in the classical legend which makes the phaenix a
                    prodigy instead of a symbol—its actual appearance at long intervals. The very
                    various periods named make it probable that the periodical return of the phaenix
                    belongs only to vulgar legend, materializing what the priests knew to be
                    symbolic. The hieroglyphic figure of the bennu is that of a heron <hi
                    rend="italic">( bennu,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bah),</hi> and the gorgeous
                    colours and plumed head spoken of by Pliny and others would be least
                    inappropriate to the purple heron <hi rend="italic">(Ardea</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >purpurea),</hi> with which, or with the allied <hi rend="italic">Ardea
                    cinerea,</hi> it has been identified byLepsius and Peters <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Aelteste</hi><hi rend="italic">Texte</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Todten-buchs,</hi> 1867, p. 51). But it must be remembered that the bennu in the
                    Egyptian texts is really a mere symbol, having the very vaguest connexion with
                    any real bird, and the golden and purple hues described by Herodotus may be the
                    colours of sunrise rather than the actual hues of the purple heron. How
                    Herodotus came to think that the 1oird was like an eagle is quite unexplained;
                    perhaps this is merely a slip of memory.</p>
                <p>Many commentators still understand the word 5∏∏, <hi rend="italic">chõl,</hi> in
                    Job xxix. 18 (A.V. “sand”) of the phaenix. This interpretation is perhaps as old
                    as the (original) Septuagint, and is current with the later Jews, whose appetite
                    for fable, however, is often greater than their exegetical sagacity. Compare
                    Eisenmenger’s <hi rend="italic">Entdecktes Juden-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lhum,</hi> vol. i. <hi rend="italic">passim.</hi> Among the Arabs the story of
                    the phaenix was confused with that of the salamander; and the samand or samandal
                    (Damiri, ii. 36 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> is represented sometimes as a
                    quadruped, sometimes as a bird. It was firmly believed in, for the incombustible
                    cloths woven of flexible asbestos were popularly thought to be made of its hair
                    or plumage, and were themselves called by the same name (comp. Yakut, i. 529,
                    and Dozy, <hi rend="italic">s.υ.).</hi> The 'anká (Pers, <hi rend="italic"
                    >símurglì),</hi> a stupendous bird like the roc (rukh) of Marco Polo and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Arabian Nights,</hi> also borrows some features of the phaenix.
                    According to Kazwíní (i. 420) it lives 1700 years, and when a young bird is
                    hatched the parent of opposite sex burns itself alive. In the book of Kalilah
                    and Dimnah the símúr or 'anká is the king of birds, the Indian garúda on whom
                    Vishnu rides.</p>
