                <p><label type="entry">PEARL</label>, Pearls are calcareous concretions of peculiar
                    lustre, produced by certain molluscs, and valued as objects of personal
                    ornament. It is believed that most pearls are formed by the intrusion of some
                    foreign substance between the mantle of the mollusc and its shell, which,
                    becoming a source of irritation, determines the deposition of nacreous matter in
                    concentric layers until the substance is completely encysted. The popular notion
                    that the disturbing object is commonly a grain of sand seems untenable;
                    according to Dr Gwyn Jeffreys and some other conchologists, it is in most cases
                    a minute parasite; while Dr Kelaart has suggested that it may be the frustule of
                    a diatom, or even one of the ova of the pearl-producing mollusc itself. The
                    experience of pearl-fishers shows that those shells which are irregular in shape
                    and stunted in growth, or which bear excrescences, or are honeycombed by boring
                    parasites, are those most likely to yield pearls.</p>
                <p>The substance of a pearl is essentially the same as that which lines the interior
                    of many shells, and is known as “mother-of-pearl.” Sir D. Brewster first showed
                    that the iridescence of this substance was an optical phenomenon due to the
                    interference of rays of light reflected from microscopic corrugations of the
                    surface—an effect which may be imitated by artificial striations on a suitable
                    medium. "When the inner laminated portion of a nacreous shell is digested in
                    acid the calcareous layers are dissolved away, leaving a very delicate
                    membranous pellicle, which, as shown by Dr Carpenter, may retain the iridescence
                    as long as it is undisturbed, but which loses it when pressed or stretched.</p>

                    this is the name adopted by most modern zoologists; the animal was placed in a
                    separate genus, <hi rend="italic">Margaritana,</hi> by Schumacher for
                    insufficient reasons. It belongs to the order Isomya, family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Unionaceae.</hi> The molluscs from which river-pearls are obtained in the
                    United States and other parts of the world are mostly species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Unio</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Anodonta.</hi> The above are all
                    Lamellibranchs.</p></note> These river-pearls are generally of dull leaden hue,
                    and inferior in beauty to those of marine origin.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that if a pearl presents a perfectly spherical form it must have
                    remained loose in the substance of the muscles or other soft tissues of the
                    mollusc. Frequently, however, the pearl becomes cemented to the interior of the
                    shell, the point of attachment thus interfering with its symmetry. In this
                    position it may receive successive nacreous deposits, which ultimately form a
                    pearl of hemispherical shape, so that when cut from the shell it may be flat on
                    one side and convex on the other, forming what jewellers know as a “perle
                    bouton.” In the course of growth the pearl may become involved in the general
                    deposit of mother-of-pearl, and be ultimately buried in the substance of the
                    shell. It has thus happened that fine pearls have occasionally been unexpectedly
                    brought to light in cutting up mother-of-pearl in the workshop.</p>
                <p>When a pearl oyster is attacked by a boring parasite the mollusc protects itself
                    by depositing nacreous matter at the point of invasion, thus forming a hollow
                    body of irregular shape known as a “blister pearl.” Hollow warty pearl is
                    sometimes termed in trade “coq de perle.” Solid pearls of irregular form are
                    often produced by deposition on rough objects, such as small fragments of wood,
                    and these, and in fact all irregular-shaped pearls, are termed “perles
                    baroques,” or “barrok pearls.” It appears that the Romans in the period of the
                    Decline restricted the name <hi rend="italic">unio</hi> to the globular pearl,
                    and termed the baroque <hi rend="italic">margaritum.</hi> It was fashionable in
                    the 16th and 17th centuries to mount curiously-shaped baroques in gold and
                    enamel so as to form ornamental objects of grotesque character. A valuable
                    collection of such mounted pearls by Dinglinger is preserved in the Green vaults
                    at Dresden.</p>
                <p>A pearl of the first water should possess, in jewellers’ language, a perfect
                    “skin” and a fine “orient”; that is to say, it must be of delicate texture, free
                    from speck or flaw, and of clear almost translucent white colour, with a subdued
                    iridescent sheen. It should also be perfectly spherical, or, if not, of a
                    symmetrical pear-shape. On removing the outer layer of a pearl the subjacent
                    surface is generally dull, like a dead fish-eye, but it occasionally happens
                    that a poor pearl encloses a “lively kernel,” and may therefore be improved by
                    careful peeling. The most perfect pearl in existence is said to be one, known as
                    “La Pellegrina,” in the museum of Zosima in Moscow; it is a perfectly globular
                    Indian pearl of singular beauty, weighing 28 carats. The largest known pearl is
                    one of irregular shape in Mr Beresford Hope’s collection at the South Kensington
                    museum. This magnificent pearl weighs 3 oz., has a circumference of 4∣ inches,
                    and is surmounted by an enamelled and jewelled gold crown, forming a pendant of
                    great value.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pearl Fisheries.—</hi> The ancients obtained their pearls
                    chiefly from India and the Persian Gulf, but at the present time they are also
                    procured from the Sulu seas, the coast of Australia, the shores of Central
                    America, and some of the South Pacific islands. The ancient fisheries of Ceylon
                    (Taprobane) are situated in the Gulf of Manaar, the fishing-banks<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n468/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0468-0447"/> lying from 6 to 8 miles off the western shore, a
                    little to the south of the isle of Manaar. The Tinnevelly fishery is on the
                    Madras side of the strait, near Tuticorin. These Indian fishing-grounds are
                    under the control of Government inspectors, who regulate the fisheries, and
                    permit fishing only when they consider the banks to be in a satisfactory
                    condition. The oysters yield the best pearls at about four years of age.
                    Fishing, when permitted, generally commences in the second week in March, and
                    lasts for from four to six weeks, according to the season. The boats are grouped
                    in fleets of from sixty to seventy, and start usually at midnight so as to reach
                    the oyster-banks at sunrise. Each boat generally carries ten divers. On reaching
                    the bank a signal-gun is fired, and diving commences. To facilitate the descent
                    of the diver, a stone of granite weighing about 40 Bb is attached to the cord by
                    which he is let down. The divers work in pairs, one man diving while the other
                    watches the signal-cord, drawing up the sink-stone first, then hauling up the
                    baskets of oysters, and finally raising the diver himself. On an average the
                    divers remain under water from fifty to eighty seconds, though some can endure a
                    much longer submergence, and exceptional instances are cited of men remaining
                    below for as long as six minutes. After resting for a minute or two at the
                    surface, the diver descends again; and so on, until exhausted, when he comes on
                    board and watches the rope, while his comrade relieves him as diver. Using
                    neither diving dress nor bell, the native descends naked, carrying only a girdle
                    for the support of the basket in which he places the pearl-oysters. In his
                    submarine work the diver makes skilful use of his toes for prehensile purposes.
                    To arm himself against the attacks of the sharks and other fishes which infest
                    the Indian waters, he carries spikes of ironwood; and the genuine Indian diver
                    never descends without the incantations of shark-charmers, one of whom
                    accompanies the boat while others remain on shore. Not only is the diver exposed
                    to the danger of attack by sharks, but his exciting calling, in a tropical
                    climate, is necessarily exhausting, and as a rule he is a short-lived man.</p>
                <p>The diving continues from sunrise to about noon, when a gun is fired, and the
                    work stopped. On the arrival of the fleet at shore, the divers carry their
                    oysters to a shed, where they are made up into four heaps, one of which is taken
                    by the diver as his remuneration. The oysters are then sold by auction in lots
                    of 1000 each. The pearls, after removal from the dead oysters, are “classed” by
                    passing through a number of small brass cullenders, known as “baskets,” the
                    holes in the successive vessels being smaller and smaller. Having been sized in
                    this way, they are sorted as to colour, weighed, and valued. (For the history
                    and production of the Ceylon fishery, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Ceylon,</hi> vol.
                    V. p. 364.)</p>
                <p>Since the days of the Macedonians pearl-fishing has been carried on in the
                    Persian Gulf. It is said that the oyster-beds extend along the entire Arabian
                    coast of the gulf, but the most important are on sandbanks off the islands of
                    Bahrein. According to Colonel Pelly’s report in 1863, there were 1500 boats
                    belonging to Bahrein alone, and the annual profit from the pearl-fishery was
                    about &lt;£400,000. The chief centre of the trade is the port of Lingah. Most of
                    the products of this fishery are known as “Bombay pearls,” from the fact that
                    many of the best are sold there. The shells usually present a dark colour about
                    the edges, like that of “smoked pearl.” The yellow-tinted pearls are sent
                    chiefly to Bombay, while the whitest go to Baghdad. Very small pearls, much
                    below a pea in size, are generally known as “seed-pearls,” and these are valued
                    in India and China as constituents of certain electuaries, while occasionally
                    they are calcined for <hi rend="italic">chunarn,</hi> or lime, used with betel
                    as a masticatory. There is a small pearl-fishery near Kurrachee on the coast of
                    Bombay.</p>
                <p>From the time of the Ptolemies pearl-fishing has been prosecuted along the coast
                    of the Red Sea, especially in the neighbourhood of Jiddah and Koseir. This
                    fishery is now insignificant, but the Arabs still obtain from this district a
                    quantity of mother-of-pearl shells, which are shipped from Alexandria, and come
                    into the market as “Egyptians.”</p>
                <p>Very fine pearls are obtained from the Sulu Archipelago, on the north-east of
                    Borneo. The mother-of-pearl shells from the Sulu seas are characterized by a
                    yellow colour on the border and back, which unfits them for many ornamental
                    purposes. Pearl-oysters are also abundant in the seas around the Aru Islands to
                    the south-west of New Guinea. From Labuan a good many pearl-shells are
                    occasionally sent to Singapore. They are also obtained from the neighbourhood of
                    Timor, and from New Caledonia. The pearl-oyster occurs throughout the Pacific,
                    mostly in the clear water of the lagoons within the atolls, though fine shells
                    are also found in deep water outside the coral reefs. The Polynesian divers do
                    not employ sink-stones, and the women are said to be more skilful than the men.
                    They anoint their bodies with oil before diving. Fine pearl-shells are obtained
                    from Navigators’ Islands, the Society Islands, the Low Archipelago or Paumota
                    Isles, and the Gambier Islands. Many of the Gambier pearls present a bronzy
                    tint.</p>
                <p>Pearl-fishing is actively prosecuted along the western coast of Central America,
                    especially in the Gulf of California, and to a less extent around the Pearl
                    Islands in the Bay of Panama. These pearls are obtained from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Meleagrina</hi><hi rend="italic">californica,</hi> Cpr., and the
                    mother-of-pearl shell is known in commerce as “Panama” or “bullock” shell. The
                    fishing-grounds are in water about 40 feet deep, anjJ the season lasts for four
                    months. An ordinary fishing-party expects to obtain about three tons of shells
                    per day, and it is estimated that one shell in a thousand contains a pearl. The
                    pearls are shipped in barrels from San Francisco and Panama. Some pearls of rare
                    beauty have been obtained from the Bay of Mulege, near Los Coyetes, in the Gulf
                    of California; and in 1882 a pearl of 75 carats, the largest on record from this
                    district, was found near La Paz in California. The coast of Guayaquil also
                    yields pearls. Columbus found that pearl-fishing was carried on in his time in
                    the Gulf of Mexico, and pearls are still obtained from the Caribbean Sea. These
                    are produced chiefly by <hi rend="italic">Meleagrina squamulosa,</hi> Lam.; and
                    the mother-of-pearl shells are known as “blue-edged” or “black-lipped,” these
                    being less valuable than the “silver-lipped” shells of India. In the West Indies
                    the best pearls are obtained from St Thomas and from the island of Margarita,
                    off the coast of Venezuela. From Margarita Philip II. of Spain is said to have
                    obtained in 1579 a famous pearl of 250 carats.</p>
                <p>Of late years pearl-fishing has been started with considerable success in the
                    Australian seas. Good pearls are found in Shark’s Bay, on the coast of West
                    Australia, especially in an inlet termed Useless Harbour. Mother-of-pearl shells
                    are also fished at many other points along the western coast, between the 15th
                    and 25th parallels of south latitude. An important pearl-fishery is also
                    established in Torres Strait and on the coast of Queensland. The shells occur in
                    water from four to six fathoms deep, and the divers are generally Malays and
                    Papuans, though sometimes native Australians. On the western coast of Australia
                    the pearl-shells are obtained by dredging rather than by diving. Quite recently
                    (1884) pearl-shells have been found at Port Darwin. Pearls have also been found
                    in Oakley Creek, New Zealand.</p>

                    Bavaria, Lapland, and Canada. The pearls of Britain are mentioned by Tacitus and
                    by Pliny, and a breastplate studded with British pearls was dedicated by Julius
                    Caesar to Venus Genetrix. As early as 1355 Scotch pearls are referred to in a
                    statute of the goldsmiths of Paris; and in the reign of Charles II. the Scotch
                    pearl trade was sufficiently important to attract the attention of parliament.
                    Writing in 1705, John Spruel says, “I have dealt in pearls these forty years and
                    more, and yet to this day I could never sell a necklace of fine Scots pearl in
                    Scotland, nor yet fine pendants, the generality seeking for Oriental pearls,
                    because farther fetched. At this very day I can show some of our own Scots pearl
                    as fine, more hard and transparent, than any Oriental” <hi rend="italic">(An
                    Account Current betwixt Scotland and England,</hi> Edinburgh, 1705). The Scotch
                    pearl-fishery, after having declined for years, was revived in I860 by a German
                    named Moritz Unger, who visited Scotland and bought up all the pearls he could
                    find in the hands of the peasantry, thus leading to an eager search for more
                    pearls the following season. It is estimated that in 1865 the produce of the
                    season’s fishing in the Scotch rivers was worth at least £12,000. This yield,
                    however, was not maintained; the rivers were overfished, and the industry was
                    discouraged inasmuch as it tended to interfere with the salmon-fishery, andin
                    some cases injured the banks of the streams. At the present time only a few
                    pearls are obtained at irregular intervals by an occasional fisherman.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers in Scotland which have yielded pearls are the Spey, the Tay,
                    and the South Esk; and to a less extent the Doon, the Dee, the Don, the Ythan,
                    the Teith, the Forth, and many other streams. In North Wales the Conway was at
                    one time celebrated for its pearls; and it is related that Sir Richard Wynn,
                    chamberlain to the queen of Charles II., presented her with a Conway pearl which
                    is believed to occupy a place in the British crown. In Ireland the rivers of
                    Donegal, Tyrone, and Wexford have yielded pearls. It is said that Sir John
                    Hawkins the circumnavigator had a patent for pearl-fishing in the Irt in
                    Cumberland. Although the pearl-fisheries of Britain are now neglected, it is
                    otherwise with those of Germany. The most important of these are in the
                    foreststreams of Bavaria, between Ratisbon and Passau. The Saxon fisheries are
                    chiefly confined to the basin of the White Elster, and those of Bohemia to the
                    Horazdiowitz district of Wotawa. For more than two centuries the Saxon fisheries
                    have been carefully regulated by inspectors, who examine the streams every
                    spring, and αeteftnine where fishing is to be permitted. After a tract has been
                    fished over, it is left to rest for ten or fifteen years. The fisher folk open
                    the valves of the mussels with an iron instrument, and if they find no pearl
                    restore the mussel to the water.</p>
                <p>River-pearls are found in many parts of the United States, and have been
                    systematically worked in the Little Miami river, Warren county, Ohio. The season
                    extends from June to October. Japan produces freshwater pearls, found especially
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Aηodonta japonica.</hi> But it is in China that the
                    culture of the pearl-mussel is carried to the greatest perfection. The Chinese
                    also obtain marine pearls, and use a large quantity of mother-of-pearL for
                    decorative purposes. More than twenty-two centuries before our era pearls are
                    enumerated as a tribute or tax in China; and they are mentioned as products of
                    the western part of the empire in the <hi rend="italic">Rh'ya,</hi> a dictionary
                    compiled earlier than 1000 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> A process for
                    promoting the artificial formation of pearls in the Chinese river-niussels was
                    discovered by Ye-jin-yang, a native of Hoochow, in the 13th century; and this
                    process is still extensively carried on near the city of Teh-tsing, where it
                    forms the staple industry of several villages, and is said to give employment to
                    about 5000 people. Large numbers of the mussels are collected in May and June,
                    and the valves of each are gently opened with a spatula to allow of the
                    introduction of various foreign bodies, which are inserted by means of a forked
                    bamboo stick. These ‘ ‘ matrices” are generally pellets of prepared mud, but may
                    be small bosses of bone, brass, or wood. After a number of these objects have
                    been placed in convenient positions on one valve, the unfortunate mollusc is
                    turned over and the operation is repeated on the other valve. The mussels are
                    then placed in shallow ponds connected with the canals, and are-nourished by
                    tubs of night-soil being thrown in from time to time. After several months, in
                    some cases two or three years, the mussels are removed, and the pearls which
                    have formed over the matrices are cut from the shells, while the molluscs
                    themselves serve as food. The matrix is generally extracted from the pearl and
                    the cavity filled with white wax, the aperture being neatly sealed up so as to
                    render the appearance of the pearl as perfect as possible. Millions of such
                    pearls are annually sold at Soo-chow. The most curious of these Chinese pearls
                    are those which present the form of small seated images of Buddha. The figures
                    are cast in very thin lead, or stamped in tin, and are inserted as previously
                    described. As many as twenty may sometimes be seen, ranged in parallel rows, in
                    the valves of a single individual. Covered with nacreous matter, closely
                    adherent to the shell, they have all the appearance of natural objects, and,
                    exciting the wonder of the ignorant, are prized as amulets. Specimens of these
                    Buddha pearls in the British Museum are referred to the species <hi

                    that Linnaeus, probably ignorant of what had long been practised in China,
                    demonstrated the possibility of producing artificial pearls in the freshwater
                    mussels of Sweden.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Artificial pearls</hi> were first made in western Europe in
                    1680 by Jacquin, a rosary-maker in Paris, and the trade is now largely carried
                    on in France, Germany, and Italy. Spheres of thin glass are filled with a
                    preparation known as “essence d’orient,” made from the silvery scales of the
                    bleak or “ablette,” which is caused to adhere to the inner wall of the globe,
                    and the cavity is then filled with white wax. The scales are in some cases
                    incorporated with celluloid. Many imitation pearls are now formed of an opaline
                    glass of nacreous lustre, and the soft appearance of the pearl obtained by the
                    judicious use of hydrofluoric acid. An excellent substitute for black pearl is
                    found in the so-called “ironstone jewellery,” and consists of close-grained
                    haematite, not too highly polished; but the great density of the haematite
                    immediately destroys the illusion. Pink pearls are imitated by turning small
                    spheres out of the rosy part of the conch shell, or even out of pink coral.</p>
