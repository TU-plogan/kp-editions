                    Perez, who was legitimated by an imperial diploma issued at Valladolid in 1542,
                    was, however, believed by many to be in reality the son of the well-known Ruy
                    Gomez, prince of Eboli, to whom, on the completion of a liberal education at
                    home and abroad, he appears at least to have owed his first introduction to a
                    diplomatic career. In 1567 he became one of the secretaries of state, receiving
                    also about the same time the lucrative appointment of protonotary of Sicily, and
                    in 1573 the death of Ruy Gomez himself made room for Perez’s promotion to be
                    head of the “despacho universal,” or private bureau, from which Philip attempted
                    to govern by assiduous correspondence the affairs of his vast dominions. Another
                    of the king’s secretaries at this time, though in a less confidential relation,
                    was a friend and contemporary of Perez, named Juan de Escovedo, who, however,
                    after the fall of Tunis in 1574, was sent off to supersede Juan de Soto as
                    secretary and adviser of Don John of Austria, thus leaving Perez without a
                    rival. Some time after Don John’s appointment to the governorship of the
                    Netherlands Perez accidentally became cognizant of his inconveniently ambitious
                    “empresa de Inglaterra,” in which he was to rescue Mary queen of Scots, marry
                    her, and so ascend the throne of England. This secret scheme the faithful
                    secretary at once carried to Philip, who characteristically resolved to meet it
                    by quietly removing his brother’s aider and abettor. With the king’s full
                    cognizance, accordingly, Perez, after several unsuccessful attempts to poison
                    Escovedo, succeeded in procuring his assassination in a street of Madrid on 31st
                    March 1578. The immediate effect was to raise Perez higher than ever in the
                    royal confidence and favour, but, wary though the secretary had been, he had not
                    succeeded in obliterating all trace of his connexion with the crime, and very
                    soon a prosecution was set on foot by the representatives of the murdered man.
                    For a time Philip was both willing and able to protect his accomplice, but
                    ultimately he appears to have listened to those who, whether truly or falsely,
                    were continually suggesting that Perez had had motives of his own, arising out
                    of his relations with the princess of Eboli, for compassing the assassination of
                    Don John’s secretary; be this as it may, from trying to screen Perez the king
                    came to be the secret instigator of those who sought his ruin. The process, as
                    such matters often are in Spain, was a slow one, and it was not until 1589 that
                    Perez, after more than one arrest and imprisonment on a variety of charges,
                    seemed on the eve of being convicted and condemned as the murderer of Escovedo.
                    At this juncture he succeeded in making his escape from prison in Castile into
                    Aragon, where, under the ancient “fueros” of the kingdom he could claim a public
                    trial in open court, and so bring into requisition the documentary evidence he
                    possessed of the king’s complicity in the deed. This did not suit Philip, who,
                    although he instituted a process in the supreme tribunal of Aragon, speedily
                    abandoned it and caused Perez to be attacked from another side, the charge of
                    heresy being now preferred, arising out of certain reckless and even blasphemous
                    expressions Perez had used in connexion with his troubles in Castile. But all
                    attempts to remove the accused from the civil prison in Saragossa to that of the
                    Inquisition raised popular tumults, which in the end led to Perez’s escape
                    across the Pyrenees, but unfortunately also furnished Philip with a pretext for
                    sending an army into Aragon and suppressing the ancient “fueros” altogether
                    (1591). From the court of Catherine de Bourbon, at Pau, where he was well
                    received, Perez passed to that of Henry IV. of France, and both there and in
                    England his talents and diplomatic experience, as well as his well-grounded
                    enmity to Philip, secured him much popularity. While in England he became the
                    “intimate coach-companion and bed-companion” of Francis Bacon, and was also much
                    in the society of the earl of Essex. The peace of Vervins in 1598 greatly
                    reduced his apparent importance abroad, and Perez now tried to obtain the pardon
                    of Philip III., that he might return to his native country. His efforts,
                    however, proved vain, and he died in comparative obscurity in Paris on 3d
                    November 1611. Some years afterwards his wife and family were relieved from the
                    ban of the Inquisition, under which, along with himself, they had been laid.</p>
                <p>Perez’s earliest publication was a small quarto, dedicated to the earl of Essex,
                    written and apparently printed in England about 1594, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pedazos de</hi><hi rend="italic">Historia,</hi> and professedly published at
                    Leon. A Dutch translation appeared in 1594, and in 1598 he published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Relationes,</hi> including the <hi rend="italic">Memorial del
                    Hecho de</hi><hi rend="italic">su</hi><hi rend="italic">Causa,</hi> drawn up in
                    1590, and many of his letters. The Paris edition is dedicated to Henry IV., but
                    apparently another issue was inscribed to the pope. Both dedications are given
                    in the fullest reprint, that of Geneva (1654), which includes a collection of
                    “aphorisms” culled from the author’s writings. The literary performances of
                    Perez owe their importance almost exclusively to the fascination of his personal
                    narrative, which, however, gives no great impression of simplicity and
                    straightforwardness; the letters, though admittedly models of idiomatic
                    Castilian, are somewhat tedious reading. Much has recently been done, by Mignet
                    <hi rend="italic">(Antonio Perez</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Philippe II.,</hi> 1845, 4th ed., 1874) and by Froude (“An Unsolved Historical
                    Riddle,” <hi rend="italic">Nineteenth Cent.,</hi> 1883) among others, towards
                    the elucidation of various difficult points in Perez’s somewhat perplexing
                    story.</p>
