                    rend="italic">(PοlyοU&gt;iοn,</hi> Song 9), where it is said to be the Welsh <hi
                    rend="italic">pen gwyn,</hi> or “white head”; the second, which seems to meet
                    with Littré’s approval, deduces it from the Latin <hi rend="italic">pinguis</hi>
                    (fat); the third supposes it to be a corruption of “pin-wing” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ann. Nat. History,</hi> ser. 4, iv. p. 133), meaning a bird that has undergone
                    the operation of pinioning or, as in one part at least of England it is commonly
                    called, “pin-winging.” In opposition to the first of these hypotheses it has
                    been urged (1) that there is no real evidence of any Welsh discovery of the
                    bird, (2) that it is very unlikely for the Welsh, if they did discover it, to
                    have been able to pass on their name to English navigators, and (3) that it had
                    not a white head, but only a patch of white thereon. To the second hypo thesis
                    Prof. Skeat <hi rend="italic">(Dictionary,</hi> p. 433) objects that it “will
                    not account for the suffix <hi rend="italic">-in,</hi> and is therefore wrong;
                    besides which the ‘ Dutchmen ’ [who were asserted to be the authors of the name]
                    turn out to be Sir Francis Drake” and his men. In support of the third
                    hypothesis Mr. Reeks wrote <hi rend="italic">(Zoologist,</hi> ser. 2, p. 1804)
                    that the people in Newfoundland who used to meet with this bird always
                    pronounced its name “Pin wing.” Prof. Skeat’s inquiry <hi rend="italic">(loc.
                    citA),</hi> whether the name may not after all be South-American, is to be
                    answered in the negative, since, so far as evidence goes, it was given to the
                    North-American bird before the South-Americau was known in Europe.</p></note>

                    perhaps the most singular group of the whole Class, or at least we may say of
                    the Carinate Subclass. For a long while their position was very much
                    misunderstood, some of the best of recent or even living systematists having
                    placed them in close company with the <hi rend="italic">Alcidae</hi> or Auks, to
                    which they bear only a relationship of analogy, as indeed had been perceived by
                    a few ornithologists, who recognized in the Penguins a very distinct Order, <hi

                    disputed in future, now that the anatomical researches of MM. Paul Gervais and

                    light.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Though the
                    present writer cannot wholly agree with the conclusions of the last of these
                    investigators, his remarks (pp. 230-232) on the “Origin of the Penguins” are
                    worthy of all attention. He considers that they are the surviving members of a
                    group that branched off early from the primitive “avian” stem, but that at the
                    time of their separation the stem had diverged so far from Reptiles as to
                    possess true wings, though the metatarsal bones had not lost their distinctness
                    and become fused into the single bone so characteristic of existing Birds. The
                    ancestral Penguin, Prof. Watson argues, must have had functional wings, the
                    muscles of which, through atrophy, have been converted into non-contractile
                    tendinous bands.</p></note> The most conspicuous outward character presented by
                    the Penguins is the total want of quills in their wings, which are as incapable
                    of flexure as the flippers of a Cetacean, though they move freely at the
                    shoulder-joint, and some at least of the species occasionally make use of them
                    for progressing on land. In the water they are most efficient paddles, and are
                    usually, if not always, worked alternately with a rotatory action. The plumage
                    which clothes the whole body, leaving no bare spaces, generally consists of
                    small scale-like feathers, many of them consisting only of a simple shaft
                    without the development of barbs; but several of the species have the head
                    decorated with long cirrhous tufts, and in some the tail-quills, which are very
                    numerous, are also long.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The pterylographical characters of the Penguins are well described by Mr
                    Hyatt <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Boston Soc. Nat. History,</hi> 1871). Mr Bartlett
                    has observed <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zook Society,</hi> 1879, pp. 6-9) that,
                    instead of moulting in the way that birds ordinarily do, Penguins, at least in
                    passing from the immature to the adult dress, cast off the short scale-like
                    feathers from their wings in a manner that he compares to “the shedding of the
                    skin in a serpent.”</p></note> In standing these birds preserve an upright
                    position, generally resting on the “tarsus”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The three metatarsals in the Penguins are not, as in other
                    birds, united for the whole of their length, but only at the extremities, thus
                    preserving a portion of their originally distinct existence, a fact probably
                    attributable to arrest of development, since the researches of Prof. Gegenbaur
                    shew that the embryos of all birds, so far as is known, possess these bones in
                    an independent condition. More recently Prof. Marsh has found that in the
                    Dinosaurian genus <hi rend="italic">Ceratosaurus</hi> the metatarsals acquire a
                    condition very similar to that which they present in the Penguins <hi

                    walking or running on land this is kept nearly vertical, and their weight is
                    supported by the toes alone.</p>
                <p>The most northerly limit of the Penguins’ range in the Atlantic is Tristan
                    d’Acunha, and in the Indian Ocean Amsterdam Island, but they also occur off the
                    Cape of Good Hope and along the south coast of Australia, as well as on the
                    south and east of New Zealand, while in the Pacific one species at least extends
                    along the west coast of South America and to the Galapagos; but north of the
                    equator none are found. In the breeding season they resort to the most desolate
                    lands in higher southern latitudes, and indeed have been met with as far to the
                    southward as navigators have penetrated. Possibly the Falkland Islands may be
                    regarded as the locality richest in species,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    though, whatever may have been the case once, their abundance there as
                    individuals does not now nearly approach what it is in many other places, owing
                    doubtless to the ravages of man, whose advent is always accompanied by massacre
                    and devastation on an enormous scale—the habit of the helpless birds, when
                    breeding, to congregate by hundreds and thousands in what are called
                    “Penguin-rookeries” contributing to the ease with which their slaughter can be
                    effected. Incapable of escape by flight, they are yet able to make enough
                    resistance or retaliation (for they bite powerfully <pb break="no"

                    of their murderers, and this only brings upon them greater destruction, so that
                    the interest of nearly all the numerous accounts of these “rookeries” is spoilt
                    by the disgusting details of the brutal havoc perpetrated upon them.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Spheniscùlae</hi> have been divided into at least eight
                    genera, but three, or at most four, seem to be all that are needed, and three
                    can be well distinguished, as pointed out by Dr Coues in the Philadelphia <hi
                    rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> for 1872 (pp. 170-212), by anatomical as well as
                    by external characters. They are (1) <hi rend="italic">Aptenodytes,</hi> easily
                    recognized by its long and thin bill, slightly decurved, from which <hi
                    rend="italic">Pygoscelis,</hi> as Prof. Watson has shewn, is hardly
                    distinguishable; (2) <hi rend="italic">Eudyptes,</hi> in which the bill is much

                    Three others belong also to this genus, if <hi rend="italic">Pygoscelis</hi> be
