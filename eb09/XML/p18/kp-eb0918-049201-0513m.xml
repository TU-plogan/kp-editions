                <p><label type="entry">PENN, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label> (1644-1718),
                    the Quaker, was the son of Admiral William Penn and Margaret Jasper, a Dutch
                    lady, and was born at Tower Hill, London, on 14th October 1644. During his
                    father’s absence at sea he lived at Wanstead in Essex, and went to school at
                    Chigwell close by, in which places he was brought under strong Puritan
                    influences. Like many children of sensitive temperament, he had times of
                    spiritual excitement; when about twelve he was “suddenly surprised with an
                    inward comfort, and, as he thought, an external glory in the room, which gave
                    rise to religious emotions, during which he had the strongest conviction of the
                    being of a God, and that the soul of man was capable of enjoying communication
                    with Him. He believed also that the seal of divinity had been put upon him at
                    this moment, or that he had been awakened or called upon to a holy life.” It
                    would indeed have been unnatural if a mind so disposed had not, when the time
                    came, seized with avidity upon the distinctive doctrine of the Friends, that of
                    the “inward light.”</p>
                <p>Upon the death of Cromwell, Penn’s father, who, like Monk, was purely an
                    adventurer, and had served the Protector because there was no other career open,
                    and who, according to Clarendon, had previously offered to bring over the fleet
                    to Charles, remained with his family on the Irish estates which Cromwell had
                    given him, of the value of £300 a year. On the deposition of Richard Cromwell he
                    at once declared for the king and went to the court at Holland, where he was
                    received into favour and knighted; and at the elections for the Convention
                    Parliament he was returned for Weymouth. During these events young Penn studied
                    under a private tutor on Tower Hill until, in October 1660, he was entered as a
                    gentleman commoner at Christ Church. He appears in the same year to have
                    contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Threnodia,</hi> a collection of elegies on
                    the death of the young duke of Gloucester.</p>
                <p>The rigour with which the Anglican statutes were revived, and the Puritan heads
                    of colleges supplanted, roused the spirit of resistance at Oxford to the
                    uttermost. With this spirit Penn, who was on familiar terms with John Owen, and
                    who had already fallen under the influence of Thomas Loe the Quaker, then at
                    Oxford, actively sympathized. He and others refused to attend chapel and church
                    service, and were fined in consequence. So far did the young enthusiasts proceed
                    in the expression of their hatred to the Anglican regulations that it is said
                    they fell upon the students who were clothed in surplices and violently tore the
                    hated vestments from them. How faillis leaving the university resulted from this
                    cannot be clearly ascertained. Anthony Wood has nothing regarding the cause of
                    his leaving, but says that he stayed at Oxford for two years, and that he was
                    noted for proficiency in manly sports. There is no doubt that in January 1662
                    his father was anxious to remove him to Cambridge, and consulted Pepys on the
                    subject; and in later years he speaks of being “banished” the college, and of
                    being whipped, beaten, and turned out of doors on his return to his father, in
                    the anger of the latter at his avowed Quakerism. A reconciliation, however, was
                    effected; and Penn was sent to France to forget this folly. The plan was for a
                    time successful. Penn appears to have entered more or less into the gaieties of
                    the court of Louis XIV., and while there to have become acquainted with Robert
                    Spencer, afterwards earl of Sunderland, and with Dorothy, sister to Algernon
                    Sidney. What, however, is more certain is that he somewhat later placed himself
                    under the tuition of Moses Amyraut, the celebrated president of the Protestant
                    college of Saumur, and at that time the exponent of liberal Calvinism, from whom
                    he gained the patristic knowledge which is so prominent in his controversial
                    writings, and whose example, doubtless, stimulated the tolerant views he already
                    entertained. He afterwards travelled in Italy, returning to England in August
                    1664, with “a great deal, if not too much, of the vanity of the French garb and
                    affected manner of speech and gait.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Pepys, 30th August 1664.</p></note></p>
                <p>Until the outbreak of the plague Penn was a student of Lincoln’s Inn. For a few
                    days also he served on the staff of his father—now great captain commander—and
                    was by him sent back in April 1665 to Charles with despatches. It will be
                    observed that his letters to his father even at this time are couched in
                    quaintly devout phraseology. Returning after the naval victory off Lowestoft in
                    June, Admiral Penn found that, probably from the effect upon his mind of the
                    awful visitation of the plague, his son had again become settled in seriousness
                    and Quakerism. To bring him once more to views of life not inconsistent with
                    court preferment, the admiral sent him in February 1666 with introductions to
                    Ormonde’s pure but brilliant court in Ireland, and to manage his estate in Cork
                    round Shannangarry Castle, his title to which was disputed. Penn appears also
                    later in the year to have been “clerk of the cheque” at Kinsale, of the castle
                    and fort of which his father had the command. When the mutiny broke out in
                    Carrickfergus Penn volunteered for service, and acted under Arran so as to gain
                    considerable reputation. The result was that in May 1666 Ormonde offered him his
                    father’s company of foot, but, for some unexplained reason, the admiral demurred
                    to this arrangement. It was at this time that the well-known portrait was
                    painted of the great Quaker in a suit of armour; and, strangely enough, it was
                    at this time, too, that the conversion, begun when he was a boy, according to
                    Penn’s own account, by Thomas Loe in Ireland, was completed at the same place by
                    the same agency.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Webb,
                    <hi rend="italic">The Penns and Penningtons,</hi> 1867, p. 174.</p></note></p>
                <p>On 3d September 1667 Penn attended a meeting of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n514/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0514-0493"/> Quakers in Cork, at which he assisted to expel a
                    soldier who had disturbed the meeting. He was in consequence, with others
                    present, sent to prison by the magistrates. From prison he wrote to Lord Orrery,
                    the president of Munster, a letter, in which he first publicly makes a claim for
                    perfect freedom of conscience. He was immediately released, and at once returned
                    to his father in London, with the distinctive marks of Quakerism strong upon him
                    —the use of the “thee” and “thou,” and the refusal to remove his hat. So staunch
                    on the hat question was he that he could not accept even the compromise
                    suggested by his father, viz., that he should uncover before the king, the duke
                    of York, and himself.</p>
                <p>Penn now became a minister of the denomination, and at once entered upon
                    controversy and authorship. His first book, <hi rend="italic">Truth
                    Exalted,</hi> in which he summons to trial princes, priests, and people, was “a
                    short but sure testimony against all those religions, faiths, and worships that
                    have been formed and followed in the darkness of apostacy,” and declared
                    Quakerism to be “the alone good way of life and salvation.” Its tone and
                    language were violent and aggressive in the extreme. The same offensive
                    personality is shown in <hi rend="italic">The Guide Mistaken,</hi> a tract
                    written in answer to John Clapham’s <hi rend="italic">Guide to the True
                    Religion.</hi> It was at this time, too, that he appealed, not unsuccessfully,
                    to Buckingham, who on Clarendon’s fall was posing as the protector of the
                    Dissenters, to use his efforts to procure parliamentary toleration.</p>
                <p>Penn’s first public discussion was with Thomas Vincent, a London Presbyterian
                    minister, who had reflected on the “damnable” doctrines of the Quakers. In this
                    he appears to have acted as second to George Whitehead.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>SeweΓs <hi rend="italic">Hist, of
                    Friends,</hi> p. 172.</p></note> The discussion, which had turned chiefly upon
                    the doctrine of the Trinity, ended uselessly, and Penn at once published <hi
                    rend="italic">The Sandy Foundation Shaken,</hi> a tract of ability sufficient to
                    excite Pepys’s astonishment, in which orthodox views on the Trinity, plenary
                    satisfaction, imputed righteousness, and other doctrinal points were so
                    offensively attacked that, at the instance of the bishop of London, Penn was
                    placed in the Tower, where he remained for nearly nine months. The imputations
                    upon his opinions and good citizenship, made as well by Dissenters as by the
                    church, he repelled in <hi rend="italic">Innocency with her Open Face,</hi> in
                    which he asserts his full belief in the divinity of Christ, the atonement, and
                    justification through faith, though insisting on the necessity of good works. It
                    was now, too, that he published the most important of his books, <hi
                    rend="italic">No Cross, no Crown,</hi> which, besides the lessons of constancy
                    and resignation indicated by the title, contained an able defence of the Quaker
                    doctrines and practices, and a scathing attack on the evils of the age,
                    especially the loose and unchristian lives of the clergy.</p>
                <p>While completely refusing to recant or to yield to the persuasions of
                    Stillingfleet, who, it is stated on doubtful authority, was sent to argue with
                    him, Penn addressed a letter to Arlington in July 1669, in which, on grounds of
                    religious freedom, he asked him to interfere. It is noteworthy, as showing the
                    views then predominant, that he was almost at once set at liberty.</p>
                <p>An informal reconciliation now took place with his father, who had been impeached
                    through the jealousy of Rupert and Monk (in April 1668), and whose conduct in
                    the operations of 1665 he had publicly vindicated; and Penn was again sent on
                    family business to Ireland. There is good reason for thinking that the extent of
                    the differences between him and his father have been much exaggerated.<note

                    active in intercession for imprisoned Friends. At the desire of his father,
                    whose health was fast failing, Penn returned to London in 1670, and was
                    immediately involved in fresh trouble. Having found the usual place of meeting
                    in Gracechurch Street closed by soldiers, Penn, as a protest, preached to the
                    people in the open street. With William Mead he was at once arrested and
                    indicted at the Old Bailey on 1st September for preaching to an unlawful,
                    seditious, and riotous assembly, which had met together with force and arms. The
                    Conventicle Act not touching their case, the trial which followed, and which may
                    be read at length in Penn’s <hi rend="italic">People's Ancient and Just
                    Liberties Asserted,</hi> was a notable one in the history of trial by jury. The
                    prisoners and the jury were alike browbeaten and threatened by the bench, and
                    particularly by the recorder. With extreme courage and skill Penn exposed the
                    illegality of the prosecution, while the jury, for the first time, asserted the
                    right of juries to decide in opposition to the ruling of the court. They brought
                    in a verdict declaring Penn and Mead “guilty of speaking in Gracechurch Street,”
                    but refused to add “to an unlawful assembly”; then, as the pressure upon them
                    increased, and as they were sent back time after time without food, light, fire,
                    or tobacco, they first acquitted Mead, while returning their original verdict
                    upon Penn, and then, when that verdict was not admitted, returned their final
                    answer “not guilty” for both. The court fined the jurymen 40 marks each for
                    their contumacy, and, in default of payment, imprisoned them, whereupon they
                    vindicated and established for ever the right they had claimed in an action
                    before the Court of Common Pleas, when all twelve judges unanimously declared
                    their imprisonment illegal.</p>
                <p>Penn himself had been fined for not removing his hat in court, had been
                    imprisoned on his refusal to pay, and had earnestly requested his family not to
                    pay for him. The fine, however, was settled anonymously, and he was released in
                    time to be present at his father’s death on 16th September 1670, at the early
                    age of forty-nine. Penn now found himself in possession of a fortune of
                    &lt;£1500 a year, and a claim on the crown for £15,000, lent to Charles II. by
                    his father. The admiral appears, from a later statement of Penn, to have asked
                    the king and James to become his son’s protectors, and James accepted and acted
                    up to the engagement in a special manner. Upon his release Penn at once plunged
                    into controversy, challenging a Baptist minister named Ives, at High Wycombe, to
                    a public dispute and, according to the Quaker account, easily defeating him. No
                    account is forthcoming from the other side. Hearing at Oxford that students who
                    attended Friends’ meetings were rigorously used, he wrote a vehement and abusive
                    remonstrance to the vice-chancellor in defence of religious freedom. This found
                    still more remarkable expression in the <hi rend="italic">Seasonable Caveat
                    against Popery</hi> (January 1671), in which, while refuting the arguments of
                    Roman Catholics, he urges, far in advance of his age and of all other sects,
                    entire and unlimited toleration of faith and worship,—not, be it observed, on
                    the grounds of expediency or of Scripture, but upon the distinctively Quaker
                    doctrine of the “inward light.” .</p>
                <p>In the beginning of 1671 Penn was again arrested for preaching in Wheeler Street
                    meeting-house by Sir J. Robinson, the lieutenant of the Tower, formerly lord
                    mayor, and known as a brutal and bigoted churchman. Legal proof being wanting of
                    any breach of the Conventicle Act, and the Oxford or Five Mile Act also proving
                    inapplicable, Robinson, who had some special cause of enmity against Penn, urged
                    upon him the oath of allegiance. This, of course, the Quaker would not take, and
                    consequently was imprisoned for six months. A saying is recorded of Penn on this
                    occasion worthy of remembrance. Robinson had ordered a corporal and some
                    soldiers to take him to prison. “No, no,” said Penn, “send thy lacquey. I know
                    the way <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n515/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0515-0494"/> to Newgate.” During this imprisonment Penn wrote
                    several works, the most important being <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Creat</hi><hi rend="italic">Case of Liberty of Conscience</hi>
                    (February 1671), a noble defence of complete toleration. Upon his release he
                    started upon a missionary journey through Holland and Germany; at Emden he
                    founded a Quaker Society, and established an intimate friendship with the
                    princess palatine Elizabeth. In his letters written during this journey will be
                    found a full exposition of the doctrine of the “inward light.”</p>
                <p>Upon his return home in the spring of 1672 Penn married Gulielma Springett,
                    daughter of Mary Pennington by her first husband, Sir William Springett; she
                    appears to have been equally remarkable for beauty, devotion to her husband, and
                    firmness to the religious principles which she had adopted when little more than
                    a child.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For a very

                    Rickmansworth in Hertfordshire, and gave himself up to controversial writing. To
                    this year, 1672, belong the <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Oaths</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">England’s Present Interest Considered,</hi> in the latter of
                    which, written immediately after the withdrawal of the Declaration of
                    Indulgence, is contained an able statement of the arguments against
                    comprehension and for toleration. It should not be omitted by any one who
                    desires to understand the state of feeling on the subject. In the year 1673 Penn
                    was still more active. He secured the release of George Fox, addressed the
                    Quakers in Holland and Germany, carried on public controversies with Hicks, a
                    Baptist, and Faldo, an Independent, and published his treatise on the <hi

                    in which, of course, each party claimed the victory. During this year his active
                    sympathies were enlisted on behalf of imprisoned Quakers at Aberdeen. At this
                    point Penn’s connexion with America begins.</p>
                <p>The province of New Jersey, comprising the country between the Hudson and
                    Delaware rivers on the east and west, had been granted in March 1663-64 by
                    Charles II. to his brother; James in turn had in June of the same year leased it
                    to Lord Berkeley and Sir G. Carteret in equal shares. By a deed, dated 18th
                    March 1673/74, John Fenwick, a Quaker, bought one of the shares, that of Lord
                    Berkeley (Stoughton erroneously says Carteret’s) in trust for Edward By Hinge,
                    also a Friend, for £1000. This sale was confirmed by James, after the second
                    Dutch war, on 6th August 1680. Disputes having arisen between Fenwick and
                    Byllinge, Penn acted as arbitrator; and then, Byllinge being in money
                    difficulties, and being compelled to sell his interest in order to satisfy his
                    creditors, Penn was added, at their request, to two of themselves, as trustee.
                    The disputes were settled by Fenwick receiving ten out of the hundred parts into
                    which the province was divided,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    with a considerable sum of money, the remaining ninety parts being afterwards
                    put up for sale. Fenwick sold.his ten parts to two other Friends, Eldridge and
                    Warner, who thus, with Penn and the other two, became masters of West Jersey,
                    West New Jersey, or New West Jersey, as it was indifferently called.<note

                    “from the east side of Little Egg Harbour, straight north, through the country,
                    to the utmost branch of Delaware river.”</p></note> The five proprietors
                    appointed three commissioners, with instructions dated from London 6th August
                    1676, to settle disputes with Fenwick (who had bought fresh land from the
                    Indians, upon which Salem was built, Penn being himself one of the settlers
                    there) and to purchase new territories, to survey and divide them, and to build
                    a town,—New Beverley, or Burlington, being the result. For the new colony Penn
                    drew up a constitution, under the title of “Concessions,” which he himself thus
                    describes: “There we lay a foundation for after ages to understand their liberty
                    as men and Christians, that they may not be brought in bondage but by their own
                    consent; for we put the power in the people.” The greatest care is taken to make
                    this constitution “as near as may be conveniently to the primitive, ancient, and
                    fundamental laws of the nation of England.” But a democratic element is
                    introduced, and the new principle of perfect religious freedom—“that no men, nor
                    numbers of men upon earth, hath power or authority to rule over men’s
                    consciences in religious matters ”—stands in the first place (chap, xvi.). With
                    regard to the liberty of the subject, no one might be condemned in life,
                    liberty, or estate, except by a jury of twelve, and the right of challenging was
                    granted to the uttermost (chap, xvii.). Imprisonment for debt was not abolished
                    (as Dixon states), but was reduced to a minimum (chap, xviii.), while theft was
                    punished by twofold restitution either in value or in labour to that amount
                    (chap, xxviii.). The provisions of chap, xix., taking their rise doubtless in
                    Penn’s own trial at the Old Bailey in 1670, deserve special notice. All causes
                    were to go before three justices, with a jury. “They, the said justices, shall
                    pronounce such judgment as they shall receive from, and be directed by the said
                    twelve men, in whom only the judgment resides, and not otherwise. And in case of
                    their neglect and refusal, that then one of the twelve, by consent of the rest,
                    pronounce their own judgment as the justices should have done.” The justices and
                    constables, moreover, were elected by the people, the former for two years only
                    (chap, xli.). Suitors might plead in person, and the courts were public (chap,
                    xxii.). Questions between Indians and settlers were to be arranged by a mixed
                    jury (chap, xxv.).</p>
                <p>An assembly was to meet yearly, consisting of a hundred persons, chosen by the
                    inhabitants, freeholders, and proprietors, one for each division of the
                    province. The election was to be by ballot, and each member was to receive a
                    shilling a day from his division, “that thereby he may be known to be the
                    servant of the people.” The executive power was to be in the hands of ten
                    commissioners<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Penn’s

                    is in marked contrast with Locke’s aristocratic one for Carolina, settled eight
                    years previously, soon attracted large numbers of Quakers to West Jersey.</p>
                <p>It was shortly before these occurrences that Penn inherited through his wife the
                    estate of Worminghurst in Sussex, whither he removed from Rickmansworth. He now
                    (25th July 1677) undertook a second missionary journey to the Continent along
                    with George Fox, Robert Barclay, and George Keith. Of this journey a full
                    account, published seventeen years later, will be found in his selected works.
                    He visited particularly Rotterdam and all the Holland towns, renewed his
                    intimacy with the princess Elizabeth at Herwerden, and, under considerable
                    privations, travelled through Hanover, Germany, the lower Rhine, and the
                    electorate of Brandenburg, returning by Bremen and the Hague. It is worthy of
                    recollection that the American settlers from Kirchheim, one of the places which
                    responded in an especial degree to Penn’s teaching, are noted as the first who
                    declared it unlawful for Christians to hold slaves. Penn reached England again
                    on 24th October.</p>

                <p>His attention was at once taken up both with the disputes which had arisen within
                    the Quaker body itself on questions of discipline, and still more with an
                    endeavour to secure some decent measure of toleration for the Friends. He tried
                    to gain the insertion in the Bill for the relief of Protestant Dissenters of a
                    clause enabling F riends to affirm instead of taking the oath, and twice
                    addressed the House of Commons’ committee with considerable eloquence and
                    effect. The Bill, however, fell to the ground at the sudden prorogation.</p>
                <p>In 1678 the Popish Terror came to a head, and to calm and guide Friends in the
                    prevailing excitement Penn wrote his <hi rend="italic">Epistle to the Children
                    of Light in this Generation.</hi> A far more important publication was <hi
                    rend="italic">An Address to Protestants of all Persuasions,</hi> by William
                    Penn, Protestant, in 1679. In the first part of this work he inveighs against
                    the five crying evils of the time so far as they are “under the correction of
                    the civil magistrates,” with an address to the magistrates for redress of those
                    evils; the second part deals similarly with “the five capital evils that relate
                    to the ecclesiastical state of these kingdoms”; the whole work is a powerful
                    exposition of the doctrine of pure tolerance and a protest against the
                    enforcement of opinions as articles of faith. This was succeeded, at the general
                    election which followed the dissolution of the pensionary parliament, by an
                    important political manifesto, <hi rend="italic">Englands Great Interest in the
                    Choice of this New Parliament,</hi> in which he insisted on the following points
                    :—the discovery and punishment of the plot, the impeachment of corrupt
                    ministersand councillors, the punishment of “pensioners,” the enactment of
                    frequent parliaments, security from Popery and slavery, and ease for Protestant
                    Dissenters. Next came <hi rend="italic">One Project for the Good of
                    England,</hi> perhaps the most pungent of all his political writings. A single
                    sentence will show the homely style of illustration which Penn usually adopted.
                    “But since the industry, rents, and taxes of the Dissenters are as current as
                    their neighbours’, who loses by such narrowness more than England, than the
                    Government, and the magistracy? . . . Till it be the interest of the former to
                    destroy his flock, to starve the horse he rides and the cow that gives him milk,
                    it cannot be the interest of England to let a great part of her sober and useful
                    inhabitants be destroyed for things that concern another world.” But he was not
                    merely active with his pen. He was at this time in close intimacy with Algernon
                    Sidney, who stood successively for Guildford and Bamber. In each case, owing in
                    a great degree to Penn’s eager advocacy, Sidney was elected, only to have his
                    elections annulled by court influence. Toleration for Dissenters seemed as far
                    off as ever. The future of English politics must have appeared to Penn well-nigh
                    hopeless. Encouraged by his success in the New Jersey provinces, he again turned
                    his thoughts to America. In repayment of the debt mentioned above Penn now asked
                    from the crown, at a council held on 24th June 1680, for “a tract of land in
                    America north of Maryland, bounded on the east by the Delaware, on the west
                    limited as Maryland <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> by New
                    Jersey], northward as far as plantable”; this latter limit Penn explained to be
                    “three degrees northwards.” This formed a tract 300 miles by 160, of extreme
                    fertility, mineral wealth, and richness of all kinds. Disputes with James, and
                    with Lord Baltimore, who had rights over Maryland, delayed the matter until 24th
                    March 1681, when the grant received the royal signature, and Penn was made
                    master of the province of Pennsylvania. His own account of the name is that he
                    suggested “Sylvania,” that the king added the “Penn” in honour of his father,
                    and that, although he strenuously objected and even tried to bribe the
                    secretaries, he could not get the name altered. It should be added that early in
                    1682 Carteret, grandson of the original proprietor, transferred his rights in
                    East Jersey to Penn and eleven associates, who soon afterwards conveyed one-half
                    of their interest to the earl of Perth and eleven others. It is uncertain to
                    what extent Penn retained his interest in West and East Jersey, and when it
                    ceased. The two provinces were united under one government in 1699, and Penn was
                    a proprietor in 1700. In 1702 the government of New Jersey was surrendered to
                    the crown.</p>
                <p>By the charter for Pennsylvania Penn was made proprietary of the province. He was
                    supreme governor; he had the power of making laws with the advice, assent, and
                    approbation of the freemen, of appointing officers, and of granting pardons. The
                    laws were to contain nothing contrary to English law with a saving to the crown
                    and the English council in the case of appeals. Parliament was to be supreme in
                    all questions of trade and commerce; the right to levy taxes and customs was
                    reserved to England; an agent to represent Penn was to reside in London; neglect
                    on the part of Penn was to lead to the passing of the government to the crown
                    (which event actually took place in 1692); no correspondence might be carried on
                    with countries at war with Great Britain. A clause added at the last moment
                    illustrates curiously both the strength and the jealousy of the Anglican Church
                    at the time. The importunity of the bishop of London extorted the right to
                    appoint Anglican ministers, should twenty members of the colony desire it, thus
                    securing the very thing which Penn was anxious to avoid,—the recognition of the
                    principle of an establishment.</p>
                <p>Having appointed Colonel Markham, his cousin, as deputy, and having in October
                    sent out three commissioners to manage affairs until his arrival, Penn proceeded
                    to draw up proposals to adventurers, with an account of the resources of the
                    colony. He negotiated, too, with James and Lord Baltimore with the view,
                    ultimately successful, of freeing the mouth of the Delaware, wrote to the
                    Indians in conciliatory terms, and encouraged the formation of companies to work
                    the infant colony both in England and Germany, especially the “Free Society of
                    Traders in Pennsylvania,” to whom he sold 20,000 acres, absolutely refusing,
                    however, to grant any monopolies. In July he drew up a body of “conditions and
                    concessions.” This constitution, savouring strongly of Harrington’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Oceana,</hi> was framed in consultation with Sidney, though to
                    what extent is doubtful. The inferences drawn by Hepworth Dixon from a single
                    letter of Penn to Sidney, given at length by Stoughton, are quite unjustifiable.
                    This sketch of a constitution was democratical in the purest sense. Until the
                    council of seventy-two (chosen by universal suffrage every three years,
                    twenty-four retiring each year) and the assembly (chosen annually) were duly
                    elected, a body of provisional laws was added.</p>
                <p>It was in the midst of this extreme activity that Penn was made a Fellow of the
                    Royal Society. Leaving his family behind him, Penn sailed with a hundred
                    comrades from Deal in the “Welcome” on 1st September 1682. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Last Farewell to England</hi> and his letter to his wife and children contain a
                    beautiful expression of his pious and manly nature. He landed at Newcastle on
                    the Delaware on 27th October, his company having lost one-third of their number
                    by smallpox during the voyage. After receiving formal possession, and having
                    visited New York, Penn ascended the Delaware to the Swedish settlement of
                    Upland, to which he gave the name of Chester. The assembly at once met, and on
                    the 7th December passed the “Great Law of Pennsylvania.” The idea which informs
                    this law is that Pennsylvania was to be a Christian state on a Quaker model.
                    Only one condition is made necessary for office or citizenship, viz.,
                    Christianity. The constitution is purely democratic; all offices, for example,
                    are elective. In many other provisions Penn showed himself<pb break="no"

                    as where the penalty of death was abolished for all offences except murder.
                    Lawsuits were to be superseded by arbitration, always a favourite idea with
                    Penn. Philadelphia was now founded, and within two years contained 300 houses
                    and a population of 2500. At the same time an Act was passed, uniting under the
                    same government the territories which had been granted by feoffment by James in
                    1682. Realistic and entirely imaginative accounts <hi rend="italic">(cf</hi>
                    Dixon, p. 270), inspired chiefly by Benjamin West’s picture, have been given of
                    the treaty which there seems no doubt Penn actually made in November 1682 with
                    the Indians. His connexion with them was one of the most successful parts of his
                    management, and he gained at once and retained through life their intense
                    affection. At his death they sent to his widow a message of sorrow for the loss
                    of their “brother Onas,” with some choice skins to form a cloak which might
                    protect her “while passing through the thorny wilderness without her guide.”</p>
                <p>Penn now wrote an account of Pennsylvania from his own observation for the “Free

                    disputes which had arisen with Lord Baltimore, his neighbour in Maryland,
                    brought Penn back to England (2d October 1684) after an absence of two years. In
                    the spring of 1683 he had modified the original charter at the desire of the
                    assembly, but without at all altering its democratic character<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dixon, p. 276.</p></note> He
                    was, in reference to this alteration, charged with selfish and deceitful dealing
                    by the assembly. Within five months after his arrival in England Charles II.
                    died, and Penn found himself at once in a position of great influence. His close
                    connexion with James, dating from the death of his father, was rendered doubly
                    strong by the fact that, from different causes, each was sincerely anxious to
                    establish complete liberty of conscience. Even before his coronation James had
                    told Penn that “he desired not that peaceable men should be disturbed for their
                    religion.” Penn now took up his abode at Kensington in Holland House, so as to
                    be near the court. His influence there was great enough to secure the pardon of
                    John Locke, who had been dismissed from Oxford by Charles, and of 1200 Quakers
                    who were in prison. At this time, too, he was busy with his pen once more,
                    writing a further account of Pennsylvania, a pamphlet in defence of Buckingham’s
                    essay in favour of toleration, in which he is supposed to have had some share,
                    and his <hi rend="italic">Persuasive to Moderation to Dissenting</hi><hi

                    He says himself in a letter dated 2d October 1685, “About 300 hanged in divers
                    towns in the West, about 1000 to be transported. I begged twenty of the
                    king.”</p>
                <p>Macaulay, the grotesqueness of whose blunders on this matter is equalled only by
                    the animus that inspired them, and by the disingenuousness with which he
                    defended them, has accused Penn of being concerned in some of the worst actions
                    of the court at this time. His complete refutation by Forster, Paget, Dixon, and
                    others renders it unnecessary to do more than allude to the cases of the Maids
                    of Taunton, Aiderman Kiffin, and Magdalen College (Oxford).</p>
                <p>In 1686, when making a third missionary journey to Holland and Germany, Penn was
                    charged by James with an informal mission to the prince of Orange to endeavour
                    to gain his assent to the removal of religious tests. Here he met Burnet, from
                    whom, as from the prince, he gained no satisfaction, and who greatly disliked
                    him. On his return he went on a preaching mission through England. His position
                    with James was undoubtedly a compromising one, and it is not strange that,
                    wishing to tolerate Papists, he should, in the prevailing temper of England, be
                    once more accused of being a Jesuit, while he was in constant antagonism to
                    their body. Even Tillotson took up this view strongly, though he at once
                    accepted Penn’s vehement disavowal. It was in reference to this that Penn wrote
                    one of his pithy sentences: “I abhor two principles in religion, and pity them
                    that own them; the first is obedience upon authority without conviction; and the
                    other, destroying them that differ from me for God’s sake. Such a religion is
                    without judgment, though not without teeth.”</p>
                <p>In 1687 James published the Declaration of Indulgence, and Penn probably drew up
                    the address of thanks on the part of the Quakers. It fully reflects his views,
                    which are further ably put in the pamphlet <hi rend="italic">Good Advice to the
                    Church of England, Roman Catholics, and Protestant Dissenters,</hi> in which he
                    showed the wisdom and duty of repealing the Test Acts and Penal Laws.</p>
                <p>At the Revolution he behaved with courage. He was one of the few friends of the
                    king who remained in London, and, when twice summoned before the council, spoke
                    boldly in his behalf. He admitted that James had asked him to come to him in
                    France; but at the same time he asserted his perfect loyalty. During the absence
                    of William in 1690 he was proclaimed by Mary as a dangerous person, but no
                    evidence of treason was forthcoming. It was now that he lost by death two of his
                    dearest friends, Robert Barclay and George Fox. It was at the funeral of the
                    latter that, upon the information of the notorious informer Fuller, an attempt
                    was made to arrest him, but he had just left the ground; the fact that no
                    further steps were then taken shows how little the Government believed in his
                    guilt. He now lived in retirement in London, though his address was perfectly
                    well known to his friends in the council. In 1691, again on Fuller’s evidence, a
                    proclamation was issued for the arrest of Penn and two others as being concerned
                    in Preston’s plot. He might, on the intercession of Locke, have obtained a
                    pardon, but refused to do so. He appears to have especially felt the suspicions
                    that fell upon him from the members of his own body. In 1692 he began to write
                    again, both on questions of Quaker discipline and in defence of the sect. <hi

                <p>Meantime matters had been going badly in Pennsylvania. Penn had, in 1687, been
                    obliged to make changes in the composition of the executive body, though in 1689
                    it reverted to the original constitution; the legislative bodies had quarrelled;
                    and Penn could not gain his rents. He was closely concerned also in this year
                    with a dispute between East and West Jersey regarding the dividing line, in
                    which he espoused the cause of the former (and richer) province. The chief
                    difficulty, however, in Pennsylvania was the dispute between the province— <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the country given to Penn by the charter—and the
                    “territories,” or the lands granted to him by the duke of York by feoffment in
                    August 1682, which were under the same Government but had differing interests.
                    No sooner had Penn by a skilful compromise settled this matter than the colony
                    was torn by the religious schism caused by George Keith. The difficulties which
                    Quaker principles placed in the way of arming the colony—a matter of grave
                    importance in the existing European complications—fought most hardly against
                    Penn’s power. On 21st October 1692 an order of <pb break="no"

                    governorship of Pennsylvania, and giving it to Colonel Fletcher, the governor of
                    New York.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Colonel
                    Fletcher’s commission recites “that by reason of great neglect and miscarriage
                    in the government of Pennsylvania Her Majesty found it necessary to take the
                    government into her hands and under her immediate protection.” The
                    attorney-general and the solicitorgeneral were of opinion (on 12th July 1694)
                    that, when the aforesaid reasons failed or ceased, the right of government
                    belonged to the petitioner.</p></note> To this blow were added the illness of
                    his wife and a fresh accusation of treasonable correspondence with James. In his
                    enforced retirement he wrote the most devotional and the most charming of his
                    works,—the collection of maxims of conduct and religion entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Fruits of Solitude.</hi> In December, thanks to the efforts of
                    his friends at court, among whom were Buckingham, Somers, Rochester, and Henry
                    Sidney, he received an intimation that no further steps would be taken against
                    him. The accusation, however, had been public, and he insisted on the withdrawal
                    being as public. He was therefore heard in full council before the king, and
                    honourably acquitted of all charge of treason. It was now that he wrote an <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay towards the Present and Future Peace of Europe,</hi> in
                    which he puts forth the idea of a great court of arbitration, a principle which
                    he had already carried out in Pennsylvania.</p>
                <p>In 1694 (23d February) his wife Gulielma died, leaving two sons, Springett and
                    William, and a daughter Letitia, afterwards married to William Aubrey. Two other
                    daughters, Mary and Hannah, died in infancy. He consoled himself by writing his
                    <hi rend="italic">Account of the Pise and Progress of the People called
                    Quakers.</hi> The coldness and suspicion with which he had been regarded by his
                    own denomination had now ceased, and he was once more regarded by the Quaker
                    body as their leader. About the same time (20th August) he was restored to the
                    governorship of Pennsylvania; and he promised to supply money and men for the
                    defence of the frontiers. In 1695 he went on another preaching mission in the
                    west, and sent a petition to parliament praying that affirmations might be
                    substituted for oaths. This year and the next were busily occupied with
                    preaching and writing, one of his auditors being no less a person than Peter the
                    Great. In March 1696 he formed a second marriage, with Hannah Callowhill, his
                    son Springett dying five weeks later. In this year he wrote his work <hi
                    rend="italic">On Primitive Christianity,</hi> in which lie argues that the faith
                    and practice of the Friends were those of the early church. In 1697 Penn removed
                    to Bristol, and during the greater part of 1698 was preaching with great success
                    against oppression in Ireland, whither he had gone to look after the property at
                    Shannangarry.</p>
                <p>In 1699 he was back in Pennsylvania, landing near Chester on 30th November, where
                    the success of Colonel Quary, j udge of the admiralty in Pennsylvania, who was
                    in the interests of those who wished to make the province an imperial colony,
                    and the high-handed action of the deputy Markham in opposition to the crown,
                    were causing great difficulties. Penn carried with him particular instructions
                    to put down piracy, which the objections of the Quakers to the use of force had
                    rendered audacious, and concerning which Quary had made strong representations
                    to the home Government, while Markham and the inhabitants apparently encouraged
                    it. Penn and Quary, however, came at once to a satisfactory understanding on
                    this matter, and the illegal traffic was vigorously and successfully attacked.
                    The next question he took up was slavery, and his attitude towards it is
                    curious. In 1696 the Philadelphian yearly meeting had passed a resolution
                    declaring it contrary to the first principles of the gospel. Penn, however, did
                    not venture upon emancipation; but he insisted on the instruction of negroes,
                    permission for them to marry, repression of polygamy and adultery, and proposed
                    regulations for their trial and punishment. The assembly, however, a very mixed
                    body of all nations, now refused to accept any of these proposals except the
                    last-named.</p>
                <p>His great success was with the Indians; by their treaty with him in 1700 they
                    promised not to help any enemy of England, to traffic only with those approved
                    by the governor, and to sell furs or skins to none but inhabitants of the
                    province. At the same time he showed his capacity for legislation by the share
                    he took with Lord Bellomont at New York in the consolidation of the laws in use
                    in the various parts of America.</p>
                <p>Affairs now again demanded his presence in England. The king had in 1701 written
                    to urge upon the Pennsylvania Government a union with other private colonies for
                    defence, and had asked for money for fortifications. The difficulty felt by the
                    crown in this matter was a natural one. A Bill was brought into the Lords to
                    convert private into crown colonies. Penn’s son appeared before the committee of
                    the House and managed to delay the matter until his father’s return. On 15th
                    September Penn called the assembly together, in which the differences between
                    the province and the territories again broke out. He succeeded, however, in
                    calming them, appointed a council of ten to manage the province in his absence,
                    and gave municipal institutions to Philadelphia. In May 1700, experience having
                    shown that alterations in the charter were advisable, the assembly had, almost
                    unanimously, requested Penn to revise it. On 28th October 1701 he handed it back
                    to them in the form in which it afterwards remained. An assembly was to be
                    chosen yearly, of four persons from each county, with all the self-governing
                    privileges of the English House of Commons. Two-thirds were to form a quorum.
                    The nomination of sheriffs, coroners, and magistrates for each county was given
                    to the governor, who was to select from names handed in by the freemen.
                    Moreover, the council was no longer elected by the people, but nominated by the
                    governor, who was thus practically left single in the executive. The assembly,
                    however, who, by the first charter, had not the right to propound laws, but
                    might only amend or reject them, now acquired that privilege. In other respects
                    the original charter remained, and the inviolability of conscience was again
                    emphatically asserted. Penn reached England in December 1701. The accession of
                    Anne appears to have put an end to the Bill in the Lords, and to his troubles on
                    this score. He once more assumed the position of leader of the Dissenters and
                    himself read the address of thanks for the promise from the throne to maintain
                    the Act of Toleration. He now too took up his abode again at Kensington, and
                    published while here his <hi rend="italic">More Fruits of Solitude.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1703 he went to Knightsbridge, where he remained until 1706, when he removed
                    to Brentford, his final residence being taken up in 1710 at Field Ruscombe, near
                    Twyford. In 1704 he wrote his <hi rend="italic">Life of Bulstrode
                    Whitelocke.</hi> He had now much trouble from America. The terri-torialists were
                    openly rejecting his authority, and doing their best to obstruct all business in
                    the assembly; and matters were further embarrassed by the injudicious conduct of
                    Governor Evans in 1706. Moreover, pecuniary troubles came heavily upon him,
                    while the conduct of his son William, who became the ringleader of all the
                    dissolute characters in Philadelphia, was another and still more severe trial.
                    This son was married, and had a son and daughter, but appears to have been left
                    entirely out of account in the settlement of Penn’s proprietary rights on his
                    death.</p>
                <p>Whatever were Penn’s great qualities, he was deficient in judgment of character.
                    This was especially shown in the choice of his steward Ford, from whom he had
                    borrowed money, and who, by dexterous swindling, had managed, at the time of his
                    death, to establish a claim for =£14,000 <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0519-0498"/> against Penn. Penn, however, refused to pay, and
                    spent nine months in the Fleet rather than give way. He was released at length
                    by his friends, who paid £7500 in composition of all claims. Difficulties with
                    his government of Pennsylvania continued to harass him. Fresh disputes took
                    place with Lord Baltimore, the owner of Maryland, and Penn also felt deeply what
                    seemed to him the ungrateful treatment which he met with at the hands of the
                    assembly. He therefore in 1710 wrote, in earnest and affectionate language, an
                    address to his “old friends,” setting forth his wrongs. So great was the effect
                    which this produced that the assembly which met in October of that year was
                    entirely in his interests; revenues were properly paid; the disaffected were
                    silenced and complaints were hushed; while an advance in moral sense was shown
                    by the fact that a Bill was passed prohibiting the importation of negroes. This,
                    however, when submitted to the British parliament, was cancelled. Penn now, in
                    February 1712, being in failing health, proposed to surrender his powers to the
                    crown. He appears, from Dixon’s work (p. 413), to have offered previously, just
                    before he was arrested by the Fords, to give up his government for £20,000, but
                    with stipulations which rendered the crown unwilling to take it. On the present
                    occasion the commission of plantations recommended that Penn should receive
                    £12,000 in four years from the time of surrender, Penn stipulating only that the
                    queen should take the Quakers under her protection; and £1000 was given him in
                    part payment. Before, however, the matter could go further he was seized with
                    apoplectic fits, which shattered his understanding and memory. A second attack
                    occurred in 1713, and from that time until his death his powers gradually
                    failed, although at times his intellect was clear and vigorous. He died on 30th
                    May 1718, leaving three sons by his second wife, John, Thomas, and Richard, and
                    was buried along with his first and second wives at Jourdan’s meeting-house,
                    near Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire. It has finally to be mentioned that
                    in 1790 the proprietary rights of Penn’s descendants were bought up for a
                    pension of £4000 a year to the eldest male descendant by his second wife, and
                    that this pension was commuted in 1884 for the sum of £67,000. (o. A.)</p>
