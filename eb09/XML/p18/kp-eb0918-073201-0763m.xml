                    been indigenous to this quarter of the globe. If it was introduced into England,
                    it must almost certainly have been brought hither by the Romans; for, setting

                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Among these perhaps that worthy of most
                    attention is in Probert’s translation of <hi rend="italic">The Ancient Laws of
                    Cambria</hi> (ed. 1823, pp. 367, 368), wherein extracts are given from Welsh
                    triads, presumably of the age of Howel the Good, who died in 948. One of them is
                    “There are three barking hunts: a bear, a squirrel, and a pheasant.” The
                    explanation is “A pheasant is called a barking hunt, because when the pointers
                    come upon it, and chase it, it takes to a tree, where it is hunted by baiting.”
                    The present writer has not been able to trace the manuscript containing these
                    remarkable statements so as to find out what is the original word rendered
                    “Pheasant” by the translator; but a reference to what is probably the same
                    passage with the same meaning is given by Ray <hi rend="italic">{Synops.

                    spurious.</p></note> Bishop Stubbs has shewn that by the regulations of King
                    Harold in 1059 “<hi rend="italic">units j)hasianus”</hi> is prescribed as the
                    alternative of two Partridges or other birds among the “pitantiae” (rations or
                    commons, as we might now say) of the canons of Waltham Abbey, and, as Prof.
                    Dawkins has remarked <hi rend="italic">{Ibis,</hi> 1869, p. 358), neither
                    Anglo-Saxons nor Danes were likely to have introduced it into England. It seems
                    to have been early under legal protection, for, according to Dugdale, a licence
                    was granted in the reign of Henry I. to the abbot of Amesbury to kill hares and
                    pheasants, and from the price at -which the latter are reckoned, in various
                    documents that have come down to us, we may conclude that they were not very
                    abundant for some centuries, and also that they were occasionally artificially
                    reared and fattened, as appears from Upton,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    middle of the 15th century, while Henry VIII. seems from his privy purse
                    expenses to have had in his household in 1532 a French priest as a regular
                    “fesaunt breder,” and in the accounts of the Kytsons of Hengrave in Suffolk for
                    1607 mention is made of wheat to feed Pheasants, Partridges, and Quails.</p>
                <p>Within recent years the practice of bringing up Pheasants by hand has been
                    extensively followed, and the numbers so reared vastly exceed those that are
                    bred at large. The eggs are collected from birds that are either running wild or
                    kept in a mew,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    writer is informed that, in 1883,134,000 Pheasants’ eggs were sold from one
                    estate in Suffolk.</p></note> and are placed under domestic Hens; but, though
                    these prove most attentive foster-mothers, much additional care on the part of
                    their keepers is needed to ensure the arrival at maturity of the poults; for,
                    being necessarily crowded in a comparatively small space, they are subject to
                    several diseases which often carry off a large proportion, to say nothing of the
                    risk they run by not being provided with proper food, or by meeting an early
                    death from various predatory animals attracted by the assemblage of so many
                    helpless victims. As they advance in age the young Pheasants readily take to a
                    wild life, and indeed can only be kept from wandering in every direction by
                    being plentifully supplied with food, which has to be scattered for them in the
                    coverts in which it is desired that they should stay. Of the proportion of
                    Pheasants artificially bred that “come to the gun” when the shooting season
                    arrives it is impossible to form any estimate, for it would seem to vary
                    enormously, not only irregularly according to the weather, but regularly
                    according to the district. In the eastern counties of England, and some other
                    favourable localities, perhaps three-fourths of those that are hatched may be
                    satisfactorily accounted for; but in many of the western counties, though they
                    are the objects of equally unremitting or even greater care, it would seem that
                    more than half of the number that live to grow their feathers disappear
                    inexplicably before the coverts are beaten. The various effects of the modern
                    system of Pheasant-breeding and Pheasant-shooting need here be treated but
                    briefly. It is commonly condemned as giving encouragement to poaching, and,
                    especially under ignorant management, as substituting slaughter for sport.
                    Undoubtedly there is much to be said, on this score; but in reply to the first
                    objection it has been urged that as a rule the poacher does not like visiting
                    coverts that he knows to be effectively preserved, and that coverts containing a
                    great stock of Pheasants, whose rearing has cost a considerable sum of money,
                    are probably the most effectively preserved. As to the second objection it is to
                    be observed that what constitutes sport is in great measure a matter of
                    individual taste, and that the reasonable limit of a sportsman’s “bag” is
                    practically an unknown quantity. One man likes shooting a Pheasant rising at his
                    feet or sprung by his spaniels, as it flies away from him through the trees and
                    is still labouring to attain its full speed; another prefers shooting one that
                    has mounted to its greatest height, and, assisted perhaps by the wind, is
                    traversing the sky at a pace that almost passes calculation. If skill has to be
                    considered in the definition of sport there can be no doubt as to which of these
                    cases most requires it. In regard to cruelty—that is, the proportion of birds
                    wounded to those killed—there seems to be little difference, for the temptation
                    to take “long shots” is about equal in either case. The Pheasant whose wing is
                    broken by the charge, if at a great height, is often killed outright by the
                    fall, whereas, if nearer the ground, it will often make good its escape by
                    running, possibly to recover, or more possibly to die after lingering in pain
                    for a longer or shorter time. On the other hand, high-flying Pheasants, having
                    their vital parts more exposed, are often hit in the body, but not hard enough
                    to bring them down, though the wound they have received proves mortal, and the
                    velocity at which they are travelling takes them beyond reach of retrieval.</p>
                <p>Formerly Pheasants were taken in snares or nets, and by hawking but the crossbow
                    was also used, and the better to obtain a “sitting shot,” for with that weapon
                    men had not learnt to “shoot flying” · dogs appear to have been employed in the
                    way indicated by the lines under an engraving by Hollar, who died in 1677 :—</p>

                <p>The use of firearms has put an end to the older practices, and the gun is now the

                <p>Of the many other species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Phasianus,</hi> two only
                    can be dwelt upon here. These are the Ring-necked Pheasant of China, <hi
                    rend="italic">P. torquatus,</hi> easily known by the broad white collar, whence
                    it has its name, as well as by the pale greyish-blue of its upper wing-coverts
                    and the light buff of its flanks, and the <hi rend="italic">P. versicolor</hi>
                    of Japan, often called the Green Pheasant from the beautiful tinge of that
                    colour that in certain lights pervades almost the whole of its plumage, and,
                    deepening into dark emerald, occupies all the breast and lower surface that in
                    the common and Chinese birds is bay barred with glossy black scallops. Both of
                    these species have been to a considerable extent introduced into England, and
                    cross freely with <hi rend="italic">P. colchicus,</hi> while the hybrids of each
                    with the older inhabitants of the woods are not only perfectly fertile <hi
                    rend="italic">inter se,</hi> but cross as freely with the other hybrids, so that
                    birds are frequently found in which the blood of the three species is mingled.
                    The hybrids of the first cross are generally larger than either of their
                    parents, but the superiority of size does not seem to be maintained by their
                    descendants. White and pied varieties of the common Pheasant, as of most birds,
                    often occur, and with a little care a race or breed of each can be perpetuated.
                    A much rarer variety is sometimes seen; this is known as the Bohemian Pheasant,
                    not that there is the least reason to suppose it has any right to such an
                    epithet, for it appears, as it were, accidentally among a stock of the pure <hi
                    rend="italic">P. colchicus,</hi> and offers an example analogous to that of the
                    japanned Peafowl already noticed <hi rend="smallcaps">(Peacock,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">supra,</hi> p. 443), being, like that breed, capable of
                    perpetuation by selection. To a small extent two other species of Pheasant have
                    been introduced to the coverts of England—P. <hi rend="italic">reevesi</hi> from
                    China, remarkable for its very long tail, white with black bars,<note

                    species by Lord Tweedmouth near Guisachan in Inverness-shire is said to have

                    rend="italic">saemmerrüngi,</hi> from Japan. The well-known Gold and Silver
                    Pheasants, P. <hi rend="italic">pictus</hi> and P. <hi rend="italic"
                    >uycthemerus,</hi> each the type of a distinct section or subgenus, are both
                    from China and have long been introduced into Europe, but are only fitted for
                    the aviary. To the former is allied the still more beautiful P. <hi
                    rend="italic">amherstiae</hi> and to the latter about a dozen more species, most
                    of them known to Indian sportsmen by the general name of “Kaleege.” The

                    magnificent Monauls, <hi rend="italic">Lophophorus,</hi> and the fine

                    there are several species—must, for want of space, be only mentioned here. All
                    the species known at the time are beautifully figured from drawings by Mr Wolf
