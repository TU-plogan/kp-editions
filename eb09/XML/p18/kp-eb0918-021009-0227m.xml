                <p><label type="entry">PANGOLIN</label>. In Africa, India, and Malayana are found
                    certain curious Mammals known to the Malays as Pangolins, to the English as
                    Scaly Anteaters, and to naturalists by the scientific name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Manis.</hi> These animals, which, by a superficial observer, might be taken for
                    reptiles rather than mammals, belong to the order <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edentata,</hi> otherwise almost wholly confined to the New World, and
                    containing, besides the Pangolins, the Sloths, Anteaters, Armadillos, and Aard
                    Varks.</p>
                <p>In size pangolins range from 1 to 3 feet in length, exclusive of the tail, which
                    varies from much shorter than to nearly twice the length of the rest of the
                    animal; their legs are short, so that the body is only a few inches off the
                    ground; their ears are very small; and their tongue is long and worm-like, and
                    is used to catch ants with. Their most striking character, however, is their
                    wonderful external coat of mail, composed of numerous broad overlapping horny
                    scales, which cover the whole animal, with the exception of the under surface of
                    the body, and, in most species, of the lower part of the tip of the tail.
                    Besides the scales there are generally, especially in the Indian species, a
                    certain number of isolated hairs, which grow up between the scales, and are also
                    scattered over the soft and flexible skin of the belly. There are five toes on
                    each foot, the claws on the pollex and hallux rudimentary, but the others,
                    especially the third of the forefoot, long, curved, and laterally compressed. In
                    walking the fore claws are turned backwards and inwards, so that the weight of
                    the animal rests on their back and outer surfaces, and their points are thus
                    kept from becoming blunted.</p>

                <p>Their skulls are long, smooth, and rounded, with imperfect zygomatic arches, no
                    teeth of any sort, and, as in other ant-eating mammals, with the bony palate
                    extending unusually far backwards towards the throat. The lower jaw consists of
                    a pair of thin styliform bones anchylosed to each other at the chin, and rather
                    loosely attached to the skull by a joint which, instead of being horizontal, is
                    tilted up at an angle of 45°, the outwardly-twisted condyles articulating with
                    the inner surfaces of the long glenoid processes, an arrangement quite unique
                    among mammals, the sloths alone showing a slight tendency towards it. The other
                    skeletal and anatomical characters have already been sufficiently described
                    under <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> (vol. XV. p. 388).</p>
                <p>The single genus <hi rend="italic">Manis,</hi> which contains all the pangolins,
                    may be conveniently divided into two groups, distinguished both by their
                    geographical distribution and by certain convenient, though not highly
                    important, external characters. (1) The Asiatic pangolins are characterized by
                    having the central series of body-scales continued quite to the extreme end of
                    the tail, by having many isolated hairs growing up between the scales of the
                    back, and by their small external ears. They all have a small naked spot beneath
                    the tip of the tail, which is said to be of service as an organ of touch. There
                    are three species, viz., <hi rend="italic">Manis javanica,</hi> ranging from
                    Burmah, through Malacca and Java, to Borneo; <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aurita,</hi> found in China, Formosa, and Nepal; and the common
                    Indian Pangolin, <hi rend="italic">Μ. pentadactyla,</hi> distributed over the
                    whole of India and Ceylon. (2) The African species have the central series of
                    scales suddenly interrupted and breaking into two at a point about 2 or 3 inches
                    from the tip of the tail; they have no hair between the scales, and no external
                    ear-conch. The following are the four species belonging to this group :—the
                    Long-tailed Pangolin <hi rend="italic">(Μ. macrura),</hi> which has a tail
                    nearly twice as long as its body, and containing as many as forty-six caudal
                    vertebrae, nearly the largest number known among Mammals; the White-bellied
                    Pangolin <hi rend="italic">(Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">tricuspis),</hi> closely
                    allied to the last, but with longer and tricuspid scales, and white belly hairs
                    (these two, like the Indian species, have a naked spot beneath the tail tip, a
                    character probably correlated with the power of climbing, and they are,
                    moreover, peculiar in having the outer sides of their fore legs clothed with
                    hair, all the other species being scaly there as elsewhere); and the
                    Short-tailed and the Giant Pangolins <hi rend="italic">(Μ. temminckii</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">gigantea),</hi> both of which have their tails covered
                    entirely with scales, and evidently never take to arboreal habits. All the four
                    species of the second group are found in the West African region, one only, <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ. temminckii,</hi> extending besides into south and eastern
                    equatorial Africa. The following account of the habits of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Manis</hi><hi rend="italic">tricuspis</hi> is taken from Mr Louis Fraser’s <hi

                <p>“During my short residence at Fernando Po I succeeded in procuring two living
                    specimens of this animal. The individuals, judging from the bones, were
                    evidently not adult; the largest pleasured 30 inches in length, of which the
                    head and body were 12 inches and the tail 18 inches. I kept them alive for about
                    a week at Fernando Po, and allowed them the range of a room, where they fed upon
                    a small black ant, which is very abundant and troublesome in the houses and
                    elsewhere. Even when first procured they displayed little or no fear, but
                    continued to climb about the room without noticing my occasional entrance. They
                    would climb up the somewhat roughly-hewn square posts which supported the
                    building with great facility, and upon reaching the ceiling would return head
                    foremost; sometimes they would roll themselves up into a ball and throw
                    themselves down, and apparently without experiencing any inconvenience from the
                    fall, which was in a measure broken upon reaching the ground by the
                    semi-yielding scales, which were thrown into an erect position by the curve of
                    the body of the animal. In climbing, the tail, with its strongly-pointed scales
                    beneath, was used to assist the feet; and the grasp of the hind feet, assisted
                    by the tail, was so powerful that the animal would throw the body back (when on
                    the post) into a horizontal position, and sway itself to and fro, apparently
                    taking pleasure in this kind of exercise. It always slept with the body rolled
                    up; and when in this position in a comer of the building, owing to the position
                    and strength of the scales, and the power of the limbs combined, I found it
                    impossible to remove the animal against its will, the points of the scales being
                    inserted into every little notch and hollow of the surrounding objects. The eyes
                    are very dark hazel, and very prominent. The colonial name for this species of
                    <hi rend="italic">Manis</hi> is <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Attadillo, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> and it is called by the Boobies, the natives of the
                    island, ’ Gahlah. ’ The flesh is said to be exceedingly good eating, and is in
                    great request among the natives.” (0. T. )</p>
