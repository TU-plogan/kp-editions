                    side of the Gulf of Patras, which opens into the Gulf of Corinth by the Little
                    Dardanelles, marked by forts Kastro Moreas and Kastro Rumelias. Since the War of
                    Independence Patras has been one of the most prosperous cities in the <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0431-0410"/> kingdom; the quarters of the new town are well
                    laid out; its old harbour being considered hardly safe in winter, a new harbour
                    defended by a breakwater was commenced in 1880; new roads (to Kalavryta, for
                    example) are opening up communication with the interior; a railway to connect
                    the city with Corinth and Athens is in process of construction (1884); and the
                    proposed cutting of the canal across the isthmus of Corinth would add new
                    elements to its commerce. The population, which had sunk to 8000 at the time of
                    the war, was 16,641 in 1870, and 24,993 in 1879. Patras is the seat of one of
                    the four courts of appeal in the kingdom, and the residence of the archbishop of
                    Patras and Elis. The custom-house is the most important in all Greece. Like the
                    ancient city, the modern Patras previous to the revolution occupied the high
                    ground of Scatovuni (a hill connected with Mount Voidia or Pan-achaicum, the
                    dominant summit in this region), but since then it has spread out over the plain
                    towards the sea. The two most interesting buildings are the castle, a mediaeval
                    structure on the site of the ancient acropolis, and the cathedral of St Andrew,
                    which is highly popular as the reputed burial-place of the saint, and has been
                    rebuilt since the revolution. The commerce of Patras consists mainly in the
                    export of currants, valonia, olive-oil, wine, and sheepskins (value in 1881,
                    19,369,270 francs, of which 18,104,046 francs were for currants alone), and the
                    import of cotton and woollen goods, grain, flour, and colonial wares (value in
                    1881, 16,560,600 francs). Great Britain and Austria almost divide the foreign
                    shipping trade, with a preponderance in favour of the former country, which
                    takes more than half of the currants. August and September are the months when
                    the port is at its busiest with British vessels. Famous even in antiquity for
                    its flax manufactures (whence the number of females in the city was double that
                    of the males), Patras at present contains several steam factories with about
                    4000 spindles producing coarse cotton twist from cotton grown in northern
                    Grèece; and there are also sulphur-crushing mills, flour and macaroni mills, and
                    an iron-foundry. Gas-works and water-works were constructed about 1874.</p>
                <p>The foundation of Patras goes back to prehistoric times, the legendary account
                    being that Eumelus, having been taught by Triptolemus how to grow grain in the
                    rich soil of the Glaucus valley, established three townships, Aroe <hi
                    rend="italic">(i.c.,</hi> ploughland), Antheia (the flowery), and Mesatis (the
                    middle settlement), which were united by the common worship of Artemis Triclaria
                    at her shrine on the river Meilichus. The Achaians having strengthened and
                    enlarged Aroe called it Patrae as the exclusive residence of the ruling
                    families. In 419 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the town was, by the advice of
                    Alcibiades, connected with its harbour by long walls in imitation of those at
                    Athens. The whole armed force of Patrae was destroyed by Metellus after the
                    defeat of the Achaians at Scarpheia, and many of the remaining inhabitants
                    forsook the city; but after the battle of Actium Augustus restored the ancient
                    name Aroe, introduced a military colony of veterans from the 10th and 12th
                    legions (not, as is usually said, the 22d), and bestowed the rights of coloni on
                    the inhabitants of Rhypae and Dyme, and all the Locri Ozolae except those of
                    Amphissa. Colonia Augusta Aroe Patrensis became one of the most populous of all
                    the towns of Greece; its colonial coinage extends from Augustus to Gordian III.
                    That it was the scene of the martyrdom of St Andrew is purely apocryphal, but,
                    like Corinth, it was an early and effective centre of Christianity; its
                    archbishop is mentioned in the lists of the council of Sardica in 347. In 551
                    Patrae was laid in nιins by an earthquake. In 807 it was able without external
                    assistance to deTeat tne Slavonians (Avars), though most of the credit of the
                    victory was assigned to St Andrew, whose church was enriched by the imperial
                    share of the spoils, and whose archbishop was made superior of the bishops of
                    Methone, Lacedaemon, and Corone. Captured in 1205 by William of Champlitte and
                    Villehardouin, the city became the capital and its archbishop the primate of the
                    principality of Achaia. In 1587 De Heredia, grandmaster of the order of the
                    Hospital at Rhodes, endeavoured to make himself master of Achaia, and took
                    Patras by storm. At the close of the 15th century the city was governed by the
                    archbishop in name of the pope; but in 1428 Constantine, son of John VI.,
                    managed to get possession of it for a time. Taken by a Spanish fleet under
                    Andrea Doria in 1532, sacked by another Spanish fleet in 1595, and again sacked
                    by the knights of Malta in 1603, Patras was at length in 1687 surrendered by the
                    Turks to the Venetians, who made it the seat of one of the seven fiscal boards
                    into which they divided the Morea. It was at Patras that the Greek revolution
                    began iu 1821; but the Turks, confined to the citadel, held out till 1828, when
                    the French troops took possession of the Morea.</p>
