                    reason to doubt that the latter part of the despot’s life was darkened by crime.
                    Goaded by the slanders of concubines, he murdered his beloved wife Melissa,
                    daughter of Procles, tyrant of Epidaurus, and then, in a fit of remorse, burned
                    the slanderers alive.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The relations of Periander to his dead wife form the subject of a curious
                    tale. It is said that he got a necromancer to call up the spirit of Melissa (as
                    Saul called up Samuel), in order to question her about a hidden treasure, just
                    as people in Wurtemberg used to call up ghosts in churchyards for a similar
                    purpose. But the ghost refused to answer. “For,” said she, “I am cold; 1 cannot
                    wear the garments laid in my grave, because they have not been burned.” So
                    Periander called together all the women of Corinth in their best attire as for a
                    festival, stripped them, and burned their garments on the grave of his wife,
                    that her ghost might not go naked. Similar to this is the story in Lucian of the
                    ghost of a dead wife appearing to her husband and begging him to find and burn
                    one of her golden sandals which had fallen underneath the chest and so had not
                    been burned with the other.</p></note> The murder of his wife alienated from the
                    tyrant the affection of his favourite son Lycophron, whom, failing to move
                    either by rigour or blandishments, he banished to Corcyra, then a dependency of
                    Corinth. At last, enfeebled by age, Periander offered to resign the tyranny to
                    his son and to retire himself to Corcyra; but the prospect alarmed the
                    Corcyreans, and they put Lycophron to death. The tyrant took his revenge by
                    sending three hundred of the noblest Corcyrean youths to Alyattes, king of
                    Lydia, to be made eunuchs of; they were rescued, however, by the Samians.
                    Periander did not long survive his son; he fell into a deep despondency, and
                    died either of grief or by violence voluntarily incurred in 585 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> at the age of eighty.</p>
                <p>The accounts of Periander’s character are at first sight discrepant. One writer
                    (Heraclides) describes him as just and moderate, an enemy of vice and luxury,
                    which he severely repressed. But more commonly he appears as cruel and
                    oppressive. He surrounded himself with a body-guard, and, according to
                    Aristotle, reduced tyranny to a system by putting down eminent and aspiring
                    citizens, impoverishing the rich, maintaining spies, and sowing distrust between
                    classes and individuals. His costly offerings to the gods drained the resources,
                    while his public works and constant wars taxed the energies and distracted the
                    attention of the citizens. The privilege of settling in Corinth was placed by
                    him under certain restrictions. On the other hand, he not only patronized
                    literature in the person of the poet Arion but was himself the author of a
                    collection of moral maxims in 2000 verses. His reputation for wisdom stood so
                    high that he was commonly reckoned amongst the seven wise men, though some, as
                    Plato, denied his claim. Amongst the wars to which he owed his military fame
                    were successful expeditions against Epidaurus and Corcyra. He built a fleet and
                    scoured the seas on both sides of the isthmus, through which it is said that he
                    meditated cutting a canal. To him were due the Greek colonies of Apollonia,
                    Anactorium, and Leucas. On the whole, Periander would appear to have been one of
                    those brilliant despots whose personal vices have not destroyed their literary
                    and artistic sense, and who by their abilities have raised the states which they
                    governed to a high pitch of outward prosperity and power. Certain it is that
                    with the close of his dynasty, which happened a few years after his death, when
                    his successor Psammetichus perished in a popular rising, the golden age of
                    Corinthian history came to an end.</p>
                <p>There was another Periander, tyrant of Ambracia, said to have been a relative of
                    the tyrant of Corinth. He was deposed by the people, probably not long after the
                    death of the latter.</p>
                <p>The chief authorities for the life of Periander are Herodotus (iii. 48-53; V.
                    92), Aristotle (PoZ., v. 11, 12), Heraclides Ponticus (v.), Nicol. Damasc. (59,
                    60), Diog. Laert. (i. 7). The letter’s in Diogenes ascribed to Periander are no
                    doubt spurious.</p>
