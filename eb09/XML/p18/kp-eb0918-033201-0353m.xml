                    i</hi><hi rend="italic">js,</hi> French <hi rend="italic">Perdrix,</hi> all from
                    the Latin <hi rend="italic">Perdix,</hi> which word in sound does not imitate
                    badly the call-note of this bird, so well known throughout the British Islands
                    and the greater part of Europe as to need no description or account of its
                    habits here. The English name properly denotes the only species indigenous to
                    Britain, often nowadays called the Grey Partridge (to distinguish it from
                    others, of which more presently), the <hi rend="italic">Perdix cinerea</hi> of
                    ornithologists, a species which may be regarded as the model game-bird—whether
                    from the excellence of the sport it affords in the field, or the no less
                    excellence of its flesh at table, which has been esteemed from the time of
                    Martial to our own—while it is on all hands admitted to be wholly innocuous, and
                    at times beneficial to the agriculturist. It is an undoubted fact that the
                    Partridge thrives with the highest system of cultivation; and the lands that are
                    the most carefully tilled, and bear the greatest quantity of grain and green
                    crops, generally produce the greatest number of Partridges. Yielding perhaps in
                    economic importance to the Red Grouse, what may be called the social influence
                    of the Partridge is greater than that excited by any other wild bird, for there
                    must be few rural parishes in the three kingdoms of which the inhabitants are
                    not more or less directly affected in their movements and business by the coming
                    in of Partridgeshooting, and therefore a few words on this theme may not be out
                    of place.</p>
                <p>From the days when men learned to “shoot flying” until some forty years ago, dogs
                    were generally if not invariably used to point out where the “covey,” as a
                    family party of Partridges is always called, was lodged, and the greatest pains
                    were taken to break in the “pointers” or “setters” to their duty. In this way
                    marvellous success was attained, and the delight lay nearly as much in seeing
                    the dogs quarter the ground, wind and draw up to the game, helping them at times
                    (for a thorough understanding between man and beast was necessary for the
                    perfection of the sport) by word or gesture, as in bringing down the bird after
                    it had been finally sprung. There are many who lament that the old-fashioned
                    practice of shooting Partridges to dogs has, with rare exceptions, fallen into
                    desuetude, and it is commonly believed that this result has followed wholly from
                    the desire to make larger and larger bags of game. The opinion has a certain
                    amount of truth for its base; but those who hold it omit to notice the wholly
                    changed circumstances in which Partridgeshooters now find themselves. In the old
                    days there were plenty of broad, tangled hedgerows which afforded permanent
                    harbour for the birds, and at the beginning of the shooting-season admirable
                    shelter or “lying” (to use the sportsman’s word) was found in the rough
                    stubbles, often reaped knee-high, foul with weeds and left to stand some six or
                    eight weeks before being ploughed, as well as in the turnips that were sown
                    broadcast. Throughout the greater part of England now the fences are reduced to
                    the narrowest of boundaries and are mostly trimly kept; the stubbles—mown, to
                    begin with, as closely as possible to the ground—are ploughed within a short
                    time of the corn being carried, and the turnips are drilled in regular lines,
                    offering inviting alleys between them along which Partridges take foot at any
                    unusual noise. Pointers in such a district—and to this state of things all the
                    arable part of England is tending—are simply useless, except at the beginning of
                    the season, when the young birds are not as yet strong on the wing, and the old
                    birds are still feeble from moulting their quill-feathers. Of late years
                    therefore other modes of shooting Partridges have had to be employed, of which
                    methods the most popular is that known as “driving”—the “guns” being stationed
                    in more or less concealment at one end of the field, or series of fields, which
                    is entered from the other by men or boys who deploy into line and walk across it
                    making a noise. It is the custom with many to speak depreciatingly of this
                    proceeding, but it is a fact that as much knowledge of the ways of Partridges is
                    needed to ensure a successful day’s “driving” as was required of old when nearly
                    everything was left to the intelligence of the dogs, for the course <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n354/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0354-0333"/> of the birds’ flight depends not only on the
                    position of the line of beaters, but almost on the station of each person
                    composing it, in relation to the force and direction of the wind and to the
                    points on which it is desired that the Partridges should converge. Again, the
                    skill and alacrity wanted for bringing down birds flying at their utmost
                    velocity, and often at a considerable height, is enormously greater than that
                    which sufficed to stop those that had barely gone 20 yards from the dog’s nose,
                    though admittedly Partridges rise very quickly and immediately attain great
                    speed. Moreover, the shooting of Partridges to pointers came to an end in little
                    more than six weeks, whereas “driving” may be continued for the whole season,
                    and is never more successful than when the birds, both young and old, have
                    completed their moult, and are strongest upon the wing. But, whether the new
                    fashion be objectionable or not, it cannot be doubted that to go back to the old
                    one with success would necessitate a reversion to the slovenly methods of
                    agriculture followed in former years, and therefore is as impossible as would be
                    a return to the still older practice of taking Partridges in a setting-net,
                    described by Gervase Markham or Willughby.</p>
                <p>The Grey Partridge has doubtless largely increased in numbers in Great Britain
                    since the beginning of the present century, when so much down, heath, and
                    moorland was first brought under the plough, for its partiality to an arable
                    country is very evident. It has been observed that the birds which live on grass
                    lands or heather only are apt to be smaller and darker in colour than the
                    average; but in truth the species when adult is subject to a much greater
                    variation in plumage than is commonly supposed, and the well-known chestnut
                    horse-shoe mark, generally considered distinctive of the cock, is very often
                    absent. In Asia our Partridge seems to be unknown, but in the temperate parts of
                    Eastern Siberia its place is taken by a very nearly allied form, <hi
                    rend="italic">P. barbata,</hi> and in Tibet there is a bird, <hi rend="italic"
                    >P. hodgsoniae,</hi> which can hardly with justice be generically separated from
                    it. The relations of some other forms inhabiting the Indian Region are at
                    present too obscure to make any notice of them expedient here.</p>
                <p>The common Red-legged Partridge of Europe, generally called the French Partridge,
                    <hi rend="italic">Caccabis</hi><hi rend="italic">ruf</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> seems to be justifiably considered the type of a separate group.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Prof. Parker first <hi
                    rend="italic">(Trans. Zool. Soe.,</hi> v. p. 155) and, after him, Prof. Huxley
                    <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zook Soc.,</hi> 1868, pp. 299-302) have pointed out
                    that the true <hi rend="italic">GaUinae</hi> offer two types of structure, “one
                    of which may be called Galline, and the other Tetraonine,” to use the latter’s
                    words, though he is “by no means clear that they do not graduate into one
                    another”; and, according to the characters assigned by him, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caecabis</hi> lies “on the Galline side of the boundary,” while <hi
                    rend="italic">Perdix</hi> belongs to the Tetraonine group. Further investigation
                    of this matter is very desirable, and, with the abundant material possessed by
                    zoological gardens, it might easily be carried out.</p></note> This bird has
                    been introduced into England within little more than one hundred years ago, and
                    has established itself in various parts of the country, notwithstanding a
                    widely-spread, and in some respects unreasonable prejudice against it. It has
                    certainly the habit of trusting nearly as much to its legs as to its wings, and
                    thus incurred the obloquy of old-fashioned sportsmen, whose dogs it vexatiously
                    kept at a running point; but, when it was also accused of driving away the Grey
                    Partridge, the charge only shewed the ignorance of those that brought it, for as
                    a matter of fact the French Partridge rather prefers ground which the common
                    species avoids—such as the heaviest clay-soils, or the most infertile heaths.
                    But even where the two species meet, the present writer can declare from the
                    personal observation of many years that the alleged antipathy between them is
                    imaginary, and unquestionably in certain parts of the country the “head of game”
                    has been increased by the introduction of the foreigner.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is a singular fact that the
                    game-preservers who object most strongly to the Red-legged Partridge are not
                    agreed on the exact grounds of their objection. One party will declare that it
                    vanquishes the Grey Partridge, while the other holds that, though the latter,
                    the- “English” Partridge, is much vexed by the introduced species, it invariably
                    beats off the “Frenchman”!</p></note> The French Partridge has several
                    congeners, all with red legs and plumage of similar character. In Africa north
                    of the Atlas there is the Barbary Partridge, <hi rend="italic">C. petrosa;</hi>
                    in southern Europe another, <hi rend="italic">C. saxatilis,</hi> which extends
                    eastward till it is replaced by <hi rend="italic">C. chukar,</hi> which reaches
                    India, where it is a well-known bird. Two very interesting desert&gt;forms,
                    supposed to be allied to <hi rend="italic">Caccabis,</hi> are the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ammoperdix lιeyi</hi> of North Africa and Palestine and the <hi
                    rend="italic">A. boηhami</hi> of Persia; but the absence of the metatarsal knob,
                    or incipient spur, suggests (in our ignorance of their other osteological
                    characters) an alliance rather to the genus <hi rend="italic">Perdix.</hi> On
                    the other hand the groups of birds known as Francolins and Snow-Partridges are
                    generally furnished with strong but blunt spurs, and therefore probably belong
                    to the Cacca-bine group. Of the former, containing many species, there is only
                    room here to mention the Francolin, which used to be found in many parts of the
                    South of Europe, <hi rend="italic">Francolinus vulgaris,</hi> which also extends
                    to India, where it is known as the Black Partridge. This seems to have been the
                    <hi rend="italic">Attagas</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Attagen</hi> of classical
                    authors,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>However, many
                    naturalists have maintained a different opinion— some making it a Woodcock, a
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Godwit</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.υ.), or</hi> even the
                    Hazel-hen (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Grouse,</hi> vol. xi. p. 223). The question
                    has been well discussed by Lord Lilford <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1862, pp.
                    352-356).</p></note> a bird so celebrated for its exquisite flavour, the strange
                    disappearance of which from all or nearly all its European haunts has been
                    before noticed <hi rend="smallcaps">(Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 736, note), and
                    still remains inexplicable. It is possible that this bird has been gradually
                    vanishing for several centuries, and if so to this cause may be attributed the
                    great uncertainty attending the determination of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Attagen</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> it being a common practice among men in
                    all countries to apply the name of a species that is growing rare to some other
                    that is still abundant. Of the Snow-Partridges, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tetraogallus,</hi> it is only to be said here that they are the giants of their
                    kin, and that nearly every considerable range of mountains in Asia seems to
                    possess its specific form.</p>
                <p>By English colonists the name Partridge has been very loosely applied, and
                    especially so in North America. Where a qualifying word is prefixed no confusion
                    is caused, but without it there is sometimes a difficulty at first to know
                    whether the Ruffed Grouse <hi rend="italic">(Bonasa umbellus)</hi> or the
                    Virginian Colin <hi rend="italic">(Ortyx virginianus)</hi> is intended, <hi
