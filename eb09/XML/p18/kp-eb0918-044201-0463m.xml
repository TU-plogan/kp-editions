                    the district school, and when only eleven years of age he became apprentice at a
                    grocery store. At the end of four years he became assistant to his brother, who
                    kept a dry goods shop, and a year afterwards, on the shop being burned, to his
                    uncle, who had a business in George Town, District of Columbia. After serving as
                    a volunteer at Fort Warburton in the short war between Great Britain and the
                    United States in 1812, he became partner with Elisha Riggs in a dry goods store,
                    Riggs furnishing the capital, while Peabody had the practical management. As
                    bagman he travelled through the western wilds of New York and Pennsylvania and
                    the plantations of Maryland and Virginia. Through his energy and skill the
                    business increased •with astounding rapidity, and on the retirement of Riggs
                    about 1830 Peabody found himself at the head of one of the largest mercantile
                    concerns in the world. About 1837 he established himself in London as merchant
                    and money-broker at Wanford Court, City, and in 1843 he withdrew from the
                    concern in America. It is, however, as a sagacious and generous philanthropist
                    that Peabody has made his name a household word. While holding aloof from the
                    strife of politics in the United States, he was ready to give his native country
                    the benefit of his business skill and the aid of his wealth in its financial
                    difficulties. The number of his great benefactions to public objects is too
                    great for bare mention here. It must suffice to name among the more important a
                    gift of £25,000 for educational purposes at Danvers; of &lt;£100,000 to found
                    and endow an institution for science in Baltimore, a sum afterwards increased by
                    a second donation of £100,000; of various sums to Harvard University; and of
                    £350,000 for the erection of dwelling-houses for the working-classes in London,
                    which sum was increased by his will to half a million. If this last benefaction
                    has failed to produce the good results anticipated, this has been due to causes
                    for which Peabody was not responsible, and which do not at all detract from the
                    wise beneficence of the gift. He received from the Queen the offer of a
                    baronetcy, but declined it. In 1867 the United States Congress awarded him a
                    special vote of thanks for his many large gifts to public institutions in
                    America. He died at Eaton Square, London, 14th November 1869.</p>
