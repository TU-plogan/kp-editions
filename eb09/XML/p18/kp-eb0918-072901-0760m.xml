                    >b.c.)</hi> Phalaris was entrusted with the building of the temple of Zeus
                    Atabyrius on the citadel, and he took advantage of his position to make himself
                    master of the city. Under his rule Agrigentum seems to have attained a
                    considerable pitch of external prosperity. He supplied the city with water,
                    adorned it with fine buildings, and strengthened it with walls. His influence
                    reached to the northern coast of the island, where the people of Himera elected
                    him general, with absolute power, in spite of the warnings of the poet
                    Stesichorus. Eastward on the coast he had fortified posts at Ecnomus and
                    Phalarium, and he is said to have conquered Leontini; but that he ruled the
                    whole of Sicily, as Suidas asserts, is unlikely. He was at last overthrown,
                    apparently by a combination of the noble families, headed by the rich and
                    distinguished Telemachus, and he was burned, along with his mother <pb

                    carried that no one should thereafter wear a blue dress, as blue had been the
                    tyrant’s livery.</p>
                <p>After ages have held up Phalaris to infamy for his excessive cruelty. In his
                    brazen bull, invented, it is said, by Perilaus of Athens, and presented by him
                    to Phalaris, the tyrant’s victims were shut up and, a fire being kindled
                    beneath, were roasted alive, while their shrieks, conveyed through pipes in the
                    beast’s nostrils, represented the bellowing of the bull. Perilaus himself is
                    said to have been the first victim. There is hardly room to doubt that we have
                    here a tradition of human sacrifice in connexion with the worship of the
                    Phoenician Baal, such as prevailed at Rhodes, where Zeus Atabyrius was no other
                    than Baal; when misfortune threatened Rhodes the brazen bulls in his temple
                    bellowed. The Rhodians brought this worship to Gela, which they founded
                    conjointly with the Cretans, and from Gela it passed to Agrigentum. Human
                    sacrifices to Baal were common, and, though in Phoenicia proper there is no
                    proof that the victims were burned alive (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Moloch),</hi>
                    the Carthaginians had a brazen image of Baal, from whose down-turned hands the
                    children slid into a pit of fire; and the story that Minos had a brazen man who
                    pressed people to his glowing breast points to similar rites in Crete, where the
                    child-devouring Minotaur must certainly be connected with Baal and the favourite
                    sacrifice to him of children. So, too, we have the fire-spitting bull of
                    Marathon which burned Androgens. The stories that Phalaris threw men into
                    boiling cauldrons and vessels filled with fire, and that he devoured sucklings,
                    all tell the same tale. From this point of view we may perhaps reconcile with
                    history the apparently contradictory tradition which seems to have prevailed in
                    later times, that Phalaris was a naturally humane man and a patron of philosophy
                    and literature. This is the view of his character which we find in the
                    declamations ascribed to Lucian, and in the letters which bear Phalaris <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> s own name. Plutarch, too, though he takes the
                    unfavourable view, mentions that the Sicilians gave to the severity of Phalaris
                    the name of justice and a hatred of crime. It is recorded that he once pardoned
                    two men who had conspired against him. Phalaris may thus have been one of those
                    men, not unknown in history, who combine justice and even humanity with a
                    religious fanaticism which shrinks from no horrors believed to be demanded by
                    the cause of God.</p>
                <p>The letters bearing the name of Phalaris (148 in number) are now chiefly
                    remembered for the crushing exposure they received at the hands of Bentley in
                    his controversy with the Hon. Charles Boyle, who had published an edition of
                    them in 1695. The first edition of Bentley’s <hi rend="italic">Dissertation
                    on</hi><hi rend="italic">Phalaris</hi> appeared in 1697, and the second edition,
                    replying to the answer which Boyle published in 1698, came out in 1699. From the
                    mention in the letters of towns (Phintia, Alaesa, and Tauromenium) which did not
                    exist in the time of Phalaris, from the imitations of authors (Herodotus,
                    Democritus, Euripides, Callimachus) who wrote long after he was dead, from the
                    reference to tragedies, though tragedy was not yet invented in the lifetime of
                    Phalaris, from the dialect, which is not Dorian but Attic, nay, New or Late
                    Attic, as well as from absurdities in the matter, and the entire absence of any
                    reference to them by any writer before Stobaeus (who lived apparently about 500
                    A.D.), Bentley sufficiently proved that the letters were written by a sophist or
                    rhetorician hundreds of years after the death of Phalaris. Suidas admired the
                    letters, which he thought genuine, and in modern times, before their exposure by
                    Bentley, they were admired by some, <hi rend="italic">c.g.,</hi> by Sir William
                    Temple, though others, as Politian and Erasmus, perceived that they were not by
                    Phalaris.</p>
                <p>There are editions of the epistles of Phalaris by Lennep and Valckenaer,
                    Groningen, 1777 (re-edited, with corrections and additions, by Schaefer,
                    Leipsic, 1823), and by R. Hercher, in <hi rend="italic">Epistolographi
                    Graeci,</hi> Paris, 1873. The latest edition of Bentley’s <hi rend="italic"
