                    fallen in the stirring times of the great Persian war. From his friendship with
                    the poet Anacreon, his father would seem to have been a man of taste, and as he
                    stood in relations of hospitality to the Spartan kings his house was no doubt a
                    political as well as literary centre. Pericles received the best education which
                    the age could supply. For masters he had Pythoclides and the distinguished
                    musician Damon, who infused into his music lessons a tincture of philosophy,
                    whereby he incurred the suspicions of the vulgar, and received the honour of
                    ostracism.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Plut., <hi

                    also to the subtle dialectics of the Eleatic Zeno. But the man who swayed him
                    most deeply and permanently was the philosopher Anaxagoras. The influence of the
                    speculative genius and dignified and gentle character of the philosopher who
                    resigned his property that he might turn his thoughts more steadily to heaven,
                    which he called his home, and who begged as his last honour that the
                    school-children might have a holiday on the day he died, can be traced alike in
                    the intellectual breadth and the elevated moral tone of the pupil, in his
                    superiority to vulgar superstitions, and in the unruffled serenity which he
                    preserved throughout the storms of political life.<note anchored="true"

                    he probably arrived there about 462, and Pericles must have reached maturity
                    before he met him (see Zeller, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Pericles took no notice of him till he reached his own door, when he bade one of

                    Peloponnesian War (see Pierson, in <hi rend="italic">Philologus,</hi> 1869;
                    Classen’s <hi rend="italic">Thucydides,</hi> book i. Anh.). Pericles, who died
                    in 429, is said to have had a public life of forty years; hence he probably
                    began to take part in politics about 469.</p></note> and the death of Aristides
                    had somewhat cleared the political stage, Pericles came forward as the champion
                    of the democratic or progressive party, in opposition to Cimon, the leader of
                    the aristocratic or conservative party. The two leaders differed hardly less
                    than their policies. Both indeed were men of aristocratic birth and temper,
                    honourable, brave, and generous, faithful and laborious in the service of
                    Athens. But Cimon was a true sailor, blunt, jovial, freehanded, who sang a
                    capital song, and was always equally ready to drink or fight, to whose artless
                    mind (he was innocent of even a smattering of letters<note anchored="true"

                    merits of Aeschylus and Sophocles (⅛., 8).</p></note>) the barrack-room life of
                    the barbarous Spartans seemed the type of human perfectibility, and whose simple
                    programme was summed up in the maxim “fight the Persians.” Naturally the new
                    ideas of political progress and intellectual development had no place in his
                    honest head; naturally he was a sturdy supporter of the good old times of which,
                    to the popular mind, he was the best embodiment. Pericles, grave, studious,
                    reserved, was himself penetrated by those ideas of progress and culture which he
                    undertook to convert into political and social realities; philosophy was his
                    recreation; during the whole course of his political career he never accepted
                    but once an invitation to dinner, and he was never to be seen walking except
                    between his house and the popular assembly and senate-house. He husbanded his
                    patrimony and regulated his domestic affairs with rigid economy that he might
                    escape both the temptation and suspicion of enriching himself at the public
                    expense.</p>
                <p>The steps by which he rose to the commanding position which he occupied in later
                    life cannot be traced with certainty. According to Plutarch, Pericles, whose
                    fortune did not allow him to imitate the profuse hospitality by which Cimon
                    endeared himself to the people, sought to outbid him by a lavish distribution of
                    the public moneys among the poorer classes; this device was suggested to him by
                    Damonides, says Plutarch on the authority of Aristotle. We may doubt the motive
                    alleged by Plutarch, but we cannot doubt the fact that Pericles did extend, if
                    not originate, the practice of distributing large sums among the citizens either
                    as gratuities or as payment for services rendered,—a practice which afterwards
                    attained most mischievous proportions. According to Plato <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Gorgias,</hi> 515 E), it was a common saying that Pericles, by the system of
                    payments which he introduced, had corrupted the Athenians, rendering them idle,
                    cowardly, talkative, and avaricious. It was Pericles who introduced the payment
                    of jurymen, and, as there were 6000 of them told off annually for duty, of whom
                    a great part sat daily, the disbursement from the treasury was great, while the
                    poor and idle were encouraged to live at the public expense. But the payment for
                    attendance on the public assembly or parliament (of which all citizens of mature
                    age were members), though probably suggested by the payment of the jurymen, was
                    not introduced by Pericles, and indeed does not seem to have existed during his
                    lifetime.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Boeckh,

                    measure but for which the Athenians would probably not have prolonged the
                    Peloponnesian War as they did, and in particular would not have been so ready to
                    embark on the fatal Sicilian expedition. There was more justification, perhaps,
                    for the practice, originated by Pericles, of supplying the poorer citizens from
                    the public treasury with the price of admission to the theatre. For in an age
                    when the study of the poets formed a chief element of education, and when the
                    great dramas of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides were being put on the stage
                    in all their freshness, such a measure may almost be regarded as a state
                    provision for the education of the citizens. It was part of the policy of
                    Pericles at once to educate and delight the people by numerous and splendid
                    festivals, processions, and shows. But the good was mixed with seeds of evil,
                    which took root and spread, till, in the days of Demosthenes, the money which
                    should have been spent in fighting the enemies of Athens was squandered in
                    spectacles and pageants. The Spectacular Fund or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theori-kon</hi> has been called the cancer of Athens. Vast sums were further
                    spent by Pericles in adorning the city with those buildings which even in their
                    ruins are the wonder of the world. Amongst these were the Parthenon, or Temple
                    of the Virgin (Athene), and the Erechtheum, <pb break="no"

                    temple extended at least as far back as 447. See Curtius, <hi rend="italic">Gr.

                    death; the magnificent Propylaea or vestibule to the Acropolis, built 437-432;
                    and the Odeum or music-hall, on the south-eastern slope of the Acropolis,
                    completed before 444. The musical contests instituted by Pericles, and for which
                    he himself laid down the rules and acted as judge, took place in the Odeum. Many
                    artists and architects were entrusted with the execution of these great works,
                    but under the direction of the master-mind of Phidias, sculptor, architect,
                    painter,— the Michelangelo of antiquity. But Pericles fortified as well as
                    beautified Athens. It had been the policy of Themistocles to make her primarily
                    a naval and commercial power, and to do so he strengthened the marine, and gave
                    to the city as far as possible the advantages of an insular situation by means
                    of fortifications, which rendered both it and its port (the Piraeus) impregnable
                    on the land side. By thus basing the Athenian state on commerce instead of, like
                    Solon, on agriculture,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    transferred the political predominance to the democratic or progressive party,
                    which is as naturally recruited from a commercial as a conservative or
                    aristocratic party is from an agricultural population. This policy was fully
                    accepted and carried out by Pericles. It was in his time and probably by his
                    advice that the Long Walls were built, which, connecting Athens with Piraeus,
                    converted the capital and its seaport into one vast fortress.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There were three of these
                    walls, of which the northern (to Piraeus) and the southern (to Phalerum) were
                    completed after the battle of Oenophyta (Thucyd., i. 108) in 456. The foundation
                    of these two walls seems to have been laid by Cimon (Plut., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cim.,</hi> 13) about 462. See Leake’s <hi rend="italic">Topography of
                    Athens,</hi> i. p. 424. Some scholars, relying on an interpretation of
                    Thucydides (i. 107, 108), suppose that these walls were begun in one year and
                    finished in the next. But considering the length of the walls (8 miles) and
                    their massiveness (as shown by their remains) this seems quite impossible. The
                    middle wall, which ran parallel to the northern wall and at no great distance
                    from it, was built later (it was not begun before 449, Andocides, <hi

                    construction (Plato, <hi rend="italic">Gorgias,</hi> 455 E). The wall to
                    Phalerum seems afterwards to have fallen into decay, and the middle wall then
                    went by the name of the southern, and it and the northern were known as the Long
                    Walls (Harpocration, <hi rend="italic">s.v.</hi><hi rend="italic">διά</hi><hi

                    order to train the Athenians in seamanship, he kept a fleet of sixty ships at
                    sea eight months out of every year. The expenses entailed by these great schemes
                    were chiefly defrayed by the annual tribute, which the confederates of Athens
                    originally furnished for the purpose of waging war against Persia, but which
                    Athens, as head of the league, subsequently applied to her own purposes. If, as
                    seems probable, the transference of the treasury of the league from Delos to
                    Athens, which sealed the conversion of the Athenian headship into an empire,
                    took place between 460 and 454, the step was probably suggested or supported by
                    Pericles, and at all events he managed the fund after its transference.<note

                    though the diversion of the fund from its original purpose probably did not
                    begin with Pericles, yet, once established, he maintained it unwaveringly. The
                    Athenians, he held, fulfilled the trust committed to them by defending their
                    allies against all comers, and the tribute (increased during his administration
                    from 460 to 600 talents annually) was their wages, which it was their right and
                    privilege to expend in works which by employing labour and stimulating commerce
                    were a present benefit, and by their beauty would be “a joy for ever.” That
                    Athens ruled by force, that her empire was in fact a tyranny, he fully admitted,
                    but he justified that tyranny by the high and glorious ends which it
                    subserved.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cp. Thucyd.,

                <p>The rise of Pericles to power, though it cannot be followed step by step, has an
                    obvious and sufficient explanation in his combined wisdom and eloquence. Plato
                    traces his eloquence largely to the influence of Anaxagoras; intercourse with
                    that philosopher (he says) filled the mind of Pericles with lofty speculations
                    and a true conception of the nature of intelligence, and hence his oratory
                    possessed the intellectual grandeur and artistic finish characteristic of the
                    highest eloquence <hi rend="italic">(Phaedrus,</hi> 270 A). The range and
                    compass of his rhetoric were wonderful, extending from the most winning
                    persuasion to the most overwhelming denunciation. The comic poets of the day, in
                    general very unfriendly to him, speak with admiration of his oratory: “greatest
                    of Grecian tongues,” says Cratinus; “persuasion sat on his lips, such was his
                    charm,” and “he alone of the orators left his sting in his hearers,” says
                    Eupolis; “he lightened, he thundered,” says Aristophanes. His speeches were
                    prepared with conscientious care; before rising to speak he used to pray that no
                    inappropriate word might fall from his lips.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    his which have come down to us reveal a passionate imagination such as breathes
                    in the fragments of Sappho. Thus, in speaking of those who had died in war, he
                    said that the youth had perished from the city like the spring from the
                    year.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cope (on
                    Aristotle, <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric,</hi> i. 7, 34) denies that Pericles was
                    the author of the saying. His only plausible ground is that a similar saying is
                    attributed to Gelon by Herodotus (vii. 162). But from the clumsy way in which
                    the simile is there applied it has all the appearance of being borrowed, and
                    Herodotus, who long survived Pericles, may have borrowed it from him. It is more
                    open to question whether the simile occurred in the funeral speech delivered at
                    the close of the Samian War, or in that during the Peloponnesian War, but the
                    former is more probable. In Thucydides’s report of the latter speech the simile
                    does not occur.</p></note> He called the hostile island of Aegina “the eye-sore
                    of the Piraeus,” and declared that he saw Avar “lowering from Peloponnesus.”
                    Three of his speeches have been reported by Thucydides, who may have heard them,
                    but, though their substance may be correctly recorded, in passing through the
                    medium of the historian’s dispassionate mind they have been shorn of the
                    orator’s imaginative glow, and in their cold iron logic are hardly to be
                    distinguished from the other speeches in Thucydides. An exception to this is the
                    speech which Thucydides reports as having been delivered by Pericles over the
                    slain in the first year of the Peloponnesian War. This speech stands quite apart
                    from the others; and as well in particular touches <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi>
                    the saying that “the grave of great men is the world” ) as in its whole tenor we
                    catch the ring of a great orator, such as Thucydides with all his genius was
                    not. It is probably a fairly close report of the speech actually delivered by
                    Pericles.</p>
                <p>The first public appearance of Pericles of which we have record probably fell
                    about 463. When Cimon, on his return from the expedition to Thasos, was tried on
                    the utterly improbable charge of having been bribed by the Macedonian king to
                    betray the interests of Athens, Pericles was appointed by the people to assist
                    in conducting the prosecution; but, more perhaps from a conviction of the
                    innocence of the accused than, as was said, in compliance with the entreaties of
                    Cimon’s sister Elpinice, he did not press the charge, and Cimon was acquitted.
                    Not long afterwards Pericles struck a blow at the conservative <pb break="no"

                    composed of life-members who had worthily discharged the duties of archon. The
                    nature of the functions of the Areopagus at this period is but little known; it
                    seems to have had a general supervision over the magistrates, the popular
                    assembly, and the citizens, and to have exercised this supervision in an
                    eminently conservative spirit. It sat also as a court for the trial of certain
                    crimes, especially murder. Pericles seems to have deprived it of nearly all its
                    functions, except its jurisdiction in cases of murder.<note anchored="true"

                    Though Pericles was the real author of the attack on the Areopagus, the measure
                    was nominally carried by Ephialtes. It was, indeed, part of Pericles’s policy to
                    keep in the background, and to act as far as possible through agents, reserving
                    himself for great occasions. Ephialtes, a friend of Pericles, and a patriot of
                    inflexible integrity, paid dearly for the distinction; he fell by the hand of an
                    assassin employed by the oligarchical party,—an event the more striking from the
                    rarity of political assassinations in Greek history. The popular party seems to
                    have immediately followed up its victory over the Areopagus by procuring the
                    ostracism of Cimon,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    ostracism of Cimon lasted between four and five years (Theopompus, 92, in <hi
                    rend="italic">Fr. Hist. Gr.</hi>; cp. Coro. Nep., <hi rend="italic">Cimon,</hi>
                    3). Hence, if his recall took place shortly after the battle of Tanagra (Plut.,
                    <hi rend="italic">Cim.,</hi> 17, and <hi rend="italic">Per.,</hi> 10), say at
                    the beginning of 456, he must have been ostracized about the middle or latter
                    part of 461. Diodorus (xi. 77) places the attack on the Areopagus in 460; but,
                    if that attack preceded (as Plutarch implies) the banishment of Cimon, it would
                    be necessary, in order to harmonize Diodorus and Theopompus, to place the recall
                    of Cimon in 455 or 454— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> between one and two years
                    after the battle of Tanagra—and this seems forbidden by Plutarch’s
                    narrative.</p></note> which strengthened the hands of Pericles by removing his
                    most influential opponent (461). Pericles took part in the battle of Tanagra
                    (457) and bore himself with desperate bravery. After the battle Cimon was
                    recalled from banishment, and it was Pericles who proposed and carried the
                    decree for his recall. In 454 Pericles led an Athenian squadron from the port of
                    Pegae on the Corinthian Gulf, landed at Sicyon, and defeated the inhabitants who
                    ventured to oppose him; then, taking with him a body of Achaeans, he crossed to
                    Acarnania, and besieged the town of Oeniadae, but had to return home without
                    capturing it. Not long afterwards<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In 453, according to Diod., xi. 88.</p></note> Pericles
                    conducted a successful expedition to the Thracian Chersonese, where he not only
                    strengthened the Greek cities by the addition of 1000 Athenian colonists, but
                    also protected them against the incursions of the barbarians by fortifying the
                    isthmus from sea to sea. This was only one of Pericles’s many measures for
                    extending and strengthening the naval empire of Athens. Colonies were
                    established by him at various times in Naxos, Andros, Oreus in Eubaea (in 446),
                    Brea in Macedonia (about 443), and Aegina (in 431). They served the double
                    purpose of establishing the Athenian power in distant parts and of relieving the
                    pressure of population at Athens by providing the poorer citizens with lands.
                    Somewhat different were the famous colonies established under Pericles’s
                    influence at Thurii in Italy, on the site of the ancient Sybaris (in 443), and
                    at Amphipolis on the Strymon (in 437), for, though planted under the conduct of
                    Athens, they were not exclusively Athenian colonies, other Greeks being allowed,
                    and even invited, to take part in them. This was especially true of Thurii,
                    which was in a manner a national Greek colony, and never stood in a relation of
                    subjection to Athens. On one occasion (some time apparently between 454 and
                    449)<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The expedition is
                    only recorded by Plutarch <hi rend="italic">(Per.,</hi> 20), and is mentioned by
                    him immediately after the expedition against Oeniadae (454) and before the
                    Sacred War (449).</p></note></p>
                <p>Pericles sailed at the head of a splendid armament to the Black Sea, where he
                    helped and encouraged the Greek cities and overawed the barbarians. At Sinope he
                    left a force of ships and men under the gallant Lamachus, to co-operate with the
                    inhabitants against the tyrant Timesi-leus, and on the expulsion of the tyrant
                    and his party he carried a decree for the despatch of 600 Athenian colonists to
                    Sinope, to occupy the lands vacated by the exiles. But, with the sober wisdom
                    which characterized him, Pericles never allowed his plans to exceed the bounds
                    of the possible; he was no political dreamer like Alcibiades, to be dazzled with
                    the vision of a universal Athenian empire in Greece, Italy, and Africa, such as
                    floated before the minds of many in that and the following generations.<note

                <p>When Cimon died in 449 the aristocratical party sought to counterbalance the
                    power of Pericles by putting forward Thucydides, son of Melesias, as the new
                    head of the party. He seems to have been an honest patriot, but, as the event
                    proved, he was no match for Pericles. The Sacred War in 448 showed once more
                    that Pericles knew how to defend the interests of Athens. The Phocians, under
                    the protection of Athens, had wrested the control of the Delphic oracle from
                    their enemies the Delphians. The latter were friendly to Sparta, and accordingly
                    the Spartans marched into Phocis and restored the oracle to the Delphians. When
                    they had departed, Pericles, at the head of an Athenian force, placed the oracle
                    once more in the hands of the Phocians. As the seat of the great oracle, Delphi
                    was to ancient Greece much what Rome was to mediaeval Europe, and the friendship
                    of the god, or of his priests, was no small political advantage. When the
                    Athenians despatched a small force under Tolmides to crush a rising in Baeotia,
                    they did so in spite of the warnings of Pericles. These warnings were soon
                    justified by the unfortunate battle of Coronea (447), which deprived Athens at a
                    blow of the continental dominion she had acquired a few years before by the
                    battle of Oenophyta (456). The island of Eubaea now revolted from Athens, and
                    hardly had Pericles crossed over with an army to reduce it when word came that
                    the Megarians had massacred the Athenian garrison, and, in league with Corinth,
                    Sicyon, and Epidaurus, were up in arms, while a Peloponnesian army under King
                    Plistoanax was on the point of invading Attica. Pericles recrossed in haste to
                    Attica. The Peloponnesians returned home, having advanced no farther than
                    Eleusis and Thria. It was said that Pericles had bribed Cleandridas; certain it
                    is that both Cleandridas and Plistoanax were charged at Sparta with having
                    misconducted the expedition and were found guilty. Having saved Attica, Pericles
                    returned to Eubaea, reduced it to subjection, expelled the Histiaeans, and
                    settled the Athenian colony of Oreus (446) on their lands. The thirty years’
                    peace, concluded soon afterwards (445) with Sparta, was probably in large
                    measure the work of Pericles. The Athenians had evacuated Baeotia immediately
                    after the battle of Coronea, and by the terms of the peace they now renounced
                    their other continental possessions,—Achaea, Traezen, Nisaea, and Pegae. The
                    peace left Pericles at liberty to develop his schemes for promoting the internal
                    welfare of Athens, and for making it the centre of the intellectual and artistic
                    life of Greece. But first he had to settle accounts with his political rival
                    Thucydides; the struggle was soon decided by the ostracism of the latter in 444.
                    Thenceforward to the end of his life Pericles <pb break="no"

                    words of the historian Thucydides, the government was in name a democracy, but
                    in fact it was the rule of the first citizen. The unparalleled ascendency which
                    he wielded so long over the fickle people is one of the best proofs of his
                    extraordinary genius. He owed it entirely to his personal character, and he used
                    it for the wisest and purest purposes. He was neither a vulgar demagogue to
                    truckle to the passions and caprices of the mob, nor a vulgar despot to cow it
                    by a hireling soldiery; he was a citizen among citizens, who obeyed him because
                    they trusted him, because they knew that in his hands the honour and interests
                    of Athens were safe. The period during which he ruled Athens was the happiest
                    and greatest in her history, as it was one of the greatest ages of the world.
                    Other ages have had their bright particular stars; the age of Pericles is the
                    Milky Way of great men. In his lifetime there lived and worked at Athens the
                    poets Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Cratinus, Crates, the philosophers
                    Anaxagoras, Zeno, Protagoras, Socrates, the astronomer Meton, the painter
                    Polygnotus, and the sculptors Myron and Phidias. Contemporary with these, though
                    not resident at Athens, were Herodotus, the father of history; Hippocrates, the
                    father of medicine; Pindar, “the Theban eagle”; the sculptor Polyclitus; and the
                    philosophers Empedocles and Democritus, the latter joint author with Leucippus
                    of the atomic theory. When Pericles died other stars were rising or soon to rise
                    above the horizon,—the historians Thucydides and Xenophon, the poets Eupolis and
                    Aristophanes, the orators Lysias and Isocrates, and the gifted but unscrupulous
                    Alcibiades. Plato was born shortly before or after the death of Pericles. Of
                    this brilliant circle Pericles was the centre. His generous and richly-endowed
                    nature responded to all that was beautiful and noble not only in literature and
                    art but in life, and it is with justice that the age of Pericles has received
                    its name from the man in whom, more than in any other, all the various lines of
                    Greek culture met and were harmonized. In this perfect harmony and completeness
                    of nature, and in the classic calm which was the fruit of it, Pericles is the
                    type of the ideal spirit, not of his own age only, but of antiquity.</p>
                <p>It seems to have been shortly after the ostracism of Thucydides that Pericles
                    conceived the plan of summoning a general congress of all the Greek states to be
                    held at Athens. Its objects were the restoration of the temples which the
                    Persians had destroyed, the fulfilment of the vows made during the war, and the
                    establishment of a general peace and the security of the sea. Invitations were
                    sent to the Greeks of Asia, the islands from Lesbos to Rhodes, the Hellespont,
                    Thrace, Byzantium, Baeotia, Phocis, Peloponnesus, Locris, Acarnania, Ambracia,
                    and Thessaly. The aim of Pericles seems to have been to draw the bonds of union
                    closer between the Greeks and to form a national federation. The beneficent
                    project was defeated by the short-sighted opposition of the Spartans. But, if in
                    this scheme Pericles rose above the petty jealousies of Greek politics, another
                    of his measures proves that he shared the Greek prejudices as to birth. At an
                    early period of his career (apparently about 460) he enacted, or perhaps only

                    for Athens. In 440 a war broke out between the island of Samos (a leading member
                    of the Athenian confederacy) and Miletus. Athens sided with Miletus; Pericles
                    sailed to Samos with an Athenian squadron, and established a democracy in place
                    of the previous oligarchy. After his departure, however, some of the exiled
                    oligarchs, in league with Pissuthnes, satrap of Sardis, collected troops and,
                    crossing over to Samos, overpowered the popular party and revolted from Athens.
                    In this revolt they were joined by Byzantium. The situation was critical; the
                    example set by Samos and Byzantium might be followed by the other confederates.
                    Pericles discerned the danger and met it promptly. He led a squadron of sixty
                    ships against Samos; and, after detaching some vessels to summon reinforcements
                    from Chios and Lesbos, and others to look out for the Phoenician fleet which the
                    Persians were expected to send to the help of Samos, he gave battle with
                    forty-four ships to the Samian fleet of seventy sail and defeated it. Having
                    received reinforcements of sixty-five ships, he landed in Samos and laid siege
                    to the capital. But, wflιen he sailed with sixty ships to meet the Phoenician
                    vessels which were reported to be near, the Samians sallied out with their
                    vessels, defeated the besiegers, and remained masters of the sea for fourteen
                    days. On his return, however, they were again blockaded, and were compelled to
                    surrender, nine months after the outbreak of the war (spring of 439).</p>
                <p>Though Pericles enjoyed the confidence of the people as a whole, his policy and
                    opinions could not fail to rouse the dislike and suspicions of many, and in the
                    last years of his life his enemies combined to assail him. Two points in
                    particular were singled out for attack, his administration of the public moneys
                    and his religious opinions. With regard to the former there must always be a
                    certain number of persons who will not believe that others can resist and
                    despise a temptation which to themselves would be irresistible; with regard to
                    the latter, the suspicion that Pericles held heretical views on the national
                    religion was doubtless well grounded. At first, however, his enemies did not
                    venture to impeach himself, but struck at him in the persons of his friends. In

                    seven years before the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, or in 438 (according

                    having appropriated some of the gold destined for the adornment of the statue of
                    Athene in the Parthenon. But by the prudent advice of Pericles the golden
                    ornaments had been so attached that they could be taken off and weighed, and
                    when Pericles challenged the accusers to have recourse to this test the
                    accusation fell to the ground. More dangerous, for more true, was the charge
                    against Phidias of having introduced portraits of himself and Pericles into the
                    battle of the Amazons, depicted on the shield of the goddess: the sculptor
                    appeared as a bald old man lifting a stone, while Pericles was represented as
                    fighting an Amazon, his face partly concealed by his raised spear. To the pious
                    Athenians this seemed a desecration of the temple, and accordingly Phidias was
                    clapped into gaol. Whether he died there or at Elis is uncertain.<note

                    accusation levelled at the woman he loved. This was the famous Aspasia, a native
                    of Miletus, whose talents won for her general admiration at Athens. Pericles
                    divorced his wife, a lady of good birth who had borne him two sons, Xanthippus
                    and Paralus, but with whom he was unhappy, and attached himself to Aspasia. With
                    her he lived on terms of devoted affection to the end of his life, though, as
                    she was a foreigner, their union was not a legal marriage. She enjoyed a high
                    reputation as a teacher of rhetoric, and <pb break="no"

                    intellectual society, which included Socrates and his friends. The comic poet,
                    Hermippus, brought her to trial on the double charge of impiety and of
                    corrupting Athenian women for the gratification of Pericles. A decree was
                    further carried by a religious fanatic named Diopithes, whereby all who denied
                    the existence of the gods or discussed the nature of the heavenly bodies were to
                    be tried as criminals. This blow was aimed directly at the aged philosopher
                    Anaxagoras, but indirectly at his pupil Pericles as well as at Aspasia. When
                    this decree was passed, and apparently while the trial of Aspasia was still
                    pending, Pericles himself was called upon by a decree of the people to render an
                    account of the money which had passed through his hands. The result is not
                    mentioned, but we cannot doubt that the matter either was dropped or ended in an
                    acquittal. The perfect integrity of Pericles is proved by the unimpeachable
                    evidence of his contemporary, the historian Thucydides. Aspasia was acquitted,
                    but not before Pericles had exerted all his eloquence in her behalf. Anaxagoras,
                    tried on the charge of impiety, was obliged to quit the city.<note

                    Thucydides, that the war was brought about by Pericles for the purpose of
                    avoiding a prosecution. The war was in truth inevitable; its real cause was
                    Sparta’s jealousy of the growing power of Athens;*its immediate occasion was the
                    help lent by Athens to Corcyra in its war with Corinth. At first, with a
                    hypocritical regard for religion, the Spartans demanded as a condition of peace
                    that the Athenians should expel the race of the Alcmaeonidae (including, of
                    course, Pericles), whose ancestors had been guilty of sacrilege about two
                    centuries before. The Athenians retorted in kind, and, after a little more
                    diplomatic fencing, the Spartans were constrained to show their hand by
                    demanding bluntly that Athens should give back to the Greeks their
                    independence,—in otherwords, renounce her empire and abandon herself to the
                    tender mercies of Sparta. Pericles encouraged the Athenians to reject the
                    demand. He pointed out that Athens possessed advantages over the Peloponnesians
                    in superior wealth and greater unity of counsels. He advised the Athenians, in
                    case of war, not to take the field against the numerically superior forces of
                    the Peloponnesians, but to allow the enemy to ravage Attica at will, while they
                    confined themselves to the defence of the city. Through their fleet they would
                    maintain communication with their island empire, procure supplies, and harass
                    the enemy by sudden descents on his coasts. By pursuing this defensive policy
                    without attempting to extend their empire, he predicted that they would be
                    victorious. The people hearkened to him and replied to the Spartan ultimatum by
                    counter-demands, which they knew would not be accepted. Pericles had not
                    neglected in time of peace to prepare for war, and Athens was now well equipped
                    with men, money, and ships. In June of the following summer (431) a
                    Peloponnesian army invaded Attica. By the advice of Pericles the rural
                    population, with their movables, had taken refuge in the city, while the cattle
                    had been sent for safety to the neighbouring islands. The sight of their country
                    ravaged under their eyes excited in the Athenians a long ing to march out and
                    meet the enemy, but in the teeth of popular clamour and obloquy Pericles
                    steadily adhered to his defensive policy, content to protect the suburbs of
                    Athens with cavalry. Meanwhile, Athenian fleets retaliated upon the enemy’s
                    coasts. About the same time, as a punishment for the share that they were
                    supposed to have had in bringing on the war, the whole population of Aegina was
                    expelled from their island to make room for Athenian colonists. This measure,
                    directed by Pericles, relieved to some extent the pressure in the overcrowded
                    capital, and secured a strong outpost on the side of the Peloponnesus. In the
                    autumn, after the Peloponnesian army had been obliged by want of provisions to
                    quit Attica and disband, Pericles conducted the whole available army of Athens·
                    into the territory of Megara, and laid it waste.</p>
                <p>It was a custom with the Athenians that at the end of a campaign the bones of
                    those who had fallen in battle should be buried with public honours in the
                    beautiful suburb of Ceramicus, the Westminster of Athens, and the vast crowd of
                    mourners and spectators gathered about the grave was addressed by a citizen
                    chosen for his character and abilities to pay the last tribute of a grateful
                    country to its departed brave. On the present occasion the choice fell on
                    Pericles. Once before, at the close of the Samian War, it had been his lot to
                    discharge a similar duty. The speech -which he now delivered, as reported to us
                    by Thucydides, is one of the noblest monuments of antiquity. It is indeed the
                    creed of Athens and of Greece. In its aristocratic republicanism—recognizing at
                    once the equal legal rights and the unequal intrinsic merits of individuals —it
                    differs alike from the monarchical spirit of mediaeval and modern Europe, with
                    its artificial class distinctions, and from that reactionary communism which
                    preaches the natural as well as the legal equality of men. In its frank
                    admiration of art and letters and all the social festivals which humanize and
                    cheer life it is as far from the sullen asceticism and the wild debauchery of
                    the East, as the grave and manly simplicity of its style is removed from the
                    fanciful luxuriance of Oriental rhetoric. Finally, in the words of comfort a: .

                <p>The fortitude of the Athenians was put to a still severer test in the following
                    summer (430), when to the horrors of war (the Peloponnesians had again invaded
                    Attica) were added the horrors of the plague, which spread havoc in the crowded

                    and best friends, amongst them his sister and his two sons Xanthippus and

                    young man, the father had been on bad terms, but the death of his surviving son,
                    at an interval of a few days, affected him deeply, and, when he came to lay the
                    wreath upon the corpse, though he struggled hard to maintain his habitual calm,
                    he broke down, and for the first time in his public life burst into a passion of

                    powerful fleet against Peloponnesus, ravaged the coast, and destroyed the town
                    of Prasiae in Laconia. But the Athenians were greatly disheartened; they sued
                    for peace, and when their suit was rejected by Sparta they vented their
                    ill-humour on Pericles, as the author of the war, by subjecting him to a fine.
                    However, they soon repented of this burst of petulance, and atoned for it by

                    reconciliation about a year, but his name is not again mentioned in connexion

                    consoled him in the clouded evening of his life. To his clement nature it was a
                    peculiar consolation to reflect that he had never carried political differences
                    to the shedding of blood. Indeed, his extraordinary, almost fatherly, tenderness
                    for the life of every Athenian citizen is attested by various of his

                <p>The chief, perhaps the only trustworthy, authority for the life of Pericles is
                    the history of his contemporary Thucydides. The biography by Plutarch is
                    compiled from Thucydides, Ephorus, Ion, Stesimbrotus, Duris of Samos, Aristotle,
                    Idomeneus, Aeschines, and Heraclides Ponticus, together with the comic poets
                    Cratinus, Teleclides, Hermippus, Plato, Eupolis, and A. istophanes. Ephorus, a
                    pupil of Isocrates, must have had plenty of means of ascertaining the facts, but
                    how little his judgment is to be trusted is shown by his account of the origin
                    of the Peloponnesian War,—an account ‘also followed by Diodorus Siculus, whose
                    history adds nothing of importance to the narratives of Thucydides and Plutarch.
                    Ion and Stesimbrotus were contemporaries of Pericles, but, as both were admirers
                    of Cimon and opposed to the policy of Pericles, their accounts have to be
                    received with caution. (J. G. FR. )</p>
