                <p><label type="entry">PELOPS</label>, a hero of Greek mythology, was the grandson
                    of Zeus, son of Tantalus and Dione, and brother of Niobe. His father’s home was
                    on Mount Sipylus in Asia Minor, whence Pelops is spoken of as a Lydian or a
                    Phrygian, or even as a Paphlagonian. Tantalus was a friend and companion of the
                    gods, and one day he served up to them his own son boiled and cut in pieces. The
                    gods detected the crime, and none of them would partake except Demeter
                    (according to others Thetis), who, distracted by the loss of her daughter
                    Persephone, ate of the shoulder. The gods restored Pelops to life, and the
                    shoulder consumed by Demeter was replaced by one of ivory. Wherefore the
                    descendants of Pelops had a white mark on their shoulder ever after. This tale
                    is perhaps a reminiscence of human sacrifice, of which numerous traces remain in
                    Greek legend and history. Poseidon admired Pelops, the beautiful boy, and
                    carried him off to Olympus, where he dwelt with the gods, till, for his father’s
                    sins, he was cast out from heaven. Then, taking much wealth with him, he crossed
                    over from Asia to Greece. He went to Pisa in Elis as suitor of Hippodamia,
                    daughter of King Oenomaus, who had already vanquished in the chariotrace and
                    slain many suitors for his daughter’s hand. But by the help of Poseidon, who
                    lent him winged steeds, or of Oenomaus’s charioteer Myrtilus, whom he or
                    Hippodamia bribed, Pelops was victorious in the race, wedded Hippodamia, and
                    became king of Pisa. Pelops’s race for his wife was a favourite subject of Greek
                    poetry and art. It may be a confused recollection of the custom of
                    wife-snatching prevalent in early times. When Myrtilus claimed his promised
                    reward, Pelops flung him into the sea near Geraestus in Eubaea, and from his
                    dying curse sprang those crimes and sorrows of the house of Pelops which
                    supplied the Greek tragedians with such fruitful themes. Among the sons of
                    Pelops by Hippodamia were Atreus, Thyestes, and Chrysippus. According to others
                    Chrysippus was his son by a different mother. Atreus and Thyestes were jealous
                    of Chrysippus and murdered him, wherefore Pelops drove them out. According to
                    another story it was Hippodamia who murdered him and fled, but afterwards her
                    bones were brought back to Olympia, where she had a temple, in which the women
                    offered her a yearly sacrifice. From Pisa Pelops extended his sway over the
                    neighbouring Olympia, where he celebrated the Olympian games with a splendour
                    unknown before. He warred against and treacherously slew Stymphalus, king of
                    Arcadia. His power and fame were so great that henceforward the whole peninsula
                    was known to the ancients as Peloponnesus (Isle of Pelops). In after times
                    Pelops was honoured at Olympia above all other heroes; a temple was built for
                    him by Heracles, his descendant in the fourth generation, in which the annual
                    magistrates sacrificed to him a black ram. During the Trojan war the Greeks were
                    told that Troy could not be taken until they fetched a bone of Pelops. So a
                    shoulder-blade of Pelops was brought from Pisa. When it was being brought back
                    again the ship carrying it was wrecked off Eubaea. Many years afterwards the
                    bone was taken up by Damarmenus, a fisherman, in his net. Astonished at its
                    size, he went to inquire of the Delphic oracle. There he met envoys from Elis
                    come to discover a remedy for a pestilence. The oracle bade them recover the
                    bone of Pelops, and commanded Damarmenus to restore it to them. He did so, and
                    he and his descendants were appointed custodians of the bone. Some thought that
                    the Palladium was made of the bones of Pelops. This belief in the miraculous
                    efficacy of the bones of heroes was common in Greece (witness, <hi rend="italic"
                        >e.y.,</hi> the story of the bones of Orestes in Herodotus). From the great
                    size of the bones they may sometimes have been those of large extinct
                    animals.</p>
                <p>From the reference to Asia in the tales of Tantalus, Niobe, and Pelops it has
                    been conjectured with some probability that Asia was the original seat of these
                    legends, and that it was only after emigration to Greece that the people amongst
                    whom they were current localized a part of the tale of Pelops in their new home.
                    In the time of Pausanias the throne of Pelops was still shown on the top of
                    Mount Sipylus. The story of Pelops is told in the beautiful first Olympian ode
                    of Pindar. The prosaic version of the story found in Nicolaus Damascenus (17)
                    differs in several points from the usual legend.</p>
