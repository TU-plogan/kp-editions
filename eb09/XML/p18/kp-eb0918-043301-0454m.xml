                    A.D. his attention had been drawn to the New Testament, and especially to the
                    epistles of Paul, whence he derived a set of opinions which, in their
                    combination at least, were quite peculiar to himself, and under their
                    inspiration he forthwith came forward as a reforming preacher. The scene of his
                    first efforts was Cibossa, in the district of Colonia in Armenia Prima, where,
                    in token of his Pauline discipleship, he called himself Sylvanus and his flock
                    Macedonians. He died about the year 684, but had a succession of like-minded
                    followers— Simeon (called Titus), Paul, Gegnaesius (Timothy), Joseph
                    (Epaphroditus)—under whom the sect continued to spread into Asia Minor,
                    ultimately taking up its headquarters in Phaneraea in Helenopontus. According to
                    Petrus Siculus, whose <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Manichaeorum</hi> was written about 870, they held the ordinary dualistic
                    doctrine common to all the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0455-0434"/> Manichaeans, expressly distinguishing the Being
                    to whom the present world owes its creation and government from the maker and
                    ruler of that which is to come; further, besides being quite out of sympathy
                    with the Catholic doctrine as to the Theotokos, they rejected the Old Testament,
                    the sacraments, the symbol of the cross, and the ordained ministry of the
                    church. The morals of the followers of Constantine seem to have been for the
                    most part unexceptionable, tending to severity, but one of his remoter
                    successors, Baanes by name, gave way to such excesses as to earn for himself the
                    surname of ó <hi rend="italic">ρνπαρός</hi>; and Sergius (Tychicus), about the
                    beginning of the 9th century, found so great scope for a moral reformation and
                    was so successful in his efforts for this end that he is sometimes spoken of,
                    not extravagantly, as the second founder of the sect. Their aversion to images
                    made them specially obnoxious to persecution by both parties during the
                    iconoclastic controversy,—the iconoclasts specially finding it necessary to give
                    practical demonstration of their antipathy to the Paulician heretics. The
                    violence of Leo the Armenian in particular compelled many of their number, and
                    Sergius among them, to seek refuge in the Saracen part of Armenia, where the
                    emir of Melitene assigned them a seat in the little town of Argaum; from this
                    settlement, notwithstanding the remonstrances of their head, they made frequent
                    and damaging inroads on the Byzantine territory. After the death of Sergius in
                    835 their government became more political and republican, until the violence of
                    Theodora drove new reinforcements to their camp, including an able military
                    leader named Carbeas, who presently placed himself at their head. The sect
                    continued to grow and to found new settlements, among which Tephrica is
                    specially mentioned by the Byzantine historians as a cause of embarrassment. At
                    the head of an army composed of Paulicians and Moslems, Carbeas more than once
                    invaded the territory of the empire and inflicted defeat on the opposing forces.
                    Chrysocheir, his stepson and successor, was still more successful; sweeping all
                    opposition before him, he overran the whole of Asia Minor, pillaging Nice and
                    Nicomedia, Ancyra and Ephesus,—Basil the Macedonian vainly appealing now to arms
                    and now to negotiation. At last, however (871), he was surprised and slain, and
                    his followers were driven back to their mountain fastnesses. In 970 John
                    Zimisces succeeded in removing a large colony of them, as guardians of the
                    frontier, to the region about Philippopolis in Thrace, where full religious
                    liberty was guaranteed them. Here they continued to flourish in virtual
                    independence for more than a century, until Alexius Comnenus inflicted
                    chastisement on them for having deserted his standard in the course of the
                    Norman war. In 1115 that emperor .fixed his winter quarters in Philippopolis to
                    use for their conversion the various powers of persuasion at his command, and
                    the orthodox city of Alexiopolis was founded in the immediate neighbourhood. The
                    sect, however, called “Popelicans” by Villehardouin, continued to subsist in
                    Thrace until at least the beginning of the 13th century, as did also the
                    Euchites, afterwards Bogomili, who had been attracted to the locality by the
                    toleration of Zimisces. Meanwhile, branch societies of Paulicians had
                    established themselves in Italy and France, and reappear in history there under
                    various names, such as Bulgari, Patareni, Cathari, and Albigenses.</p>
