                    submission, were allowed to retain a quasi-corporate existence under the
                    protection of Rome. But the name (derived from <hi rend="italic"
                    >eitlere,</hi><hi rend="italic">κλveιν,</hi> to obey) was common before Rome had
                    made any conquests, and was usually applied to individuals who had attached
                    themselves in a condition of dependence to the heads of patrician houses as
                    their patrons, in order thereby to secure a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                    freedom. The relationship was ordinarily created by what, from the client’s
                    point of view, was called <hi rend="italic">adplicatio ad</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >patronum,</hi> from that of the patron, <hi rend="italic">susceptio
                    clientis,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the client being either a person who had
                    come to Rome as an exile, who had passed through the asylum, or who had belonged
                    to a state which Rome had overthrown. According to Dionysius and Plutarch, it
                    was one of the early cares of Romulus to regulate the relationship, which, by
                    their account of it, was esteemed a very intimate one, imposing upon the patron
                    duties only less sacred than those he owed to his children and his ward, more
                    urgent than any he could be called upon to perform towards his kinsmen, and
                    whose neglect entailed the penalty of death <hi rend="italic">{Tellumoni sacer
                    esto).</hi> He was bound to provide his client with the necessaries of life; and
                    it was a common practice to make him a grant during pleasure of a small plot of
                    land to cultivate on his own account. Further, he had to advise him in all his
                    affairs; <hi rend="italic">to</hi> represent him in any transactions with third
                    parties in which, as a non-citizen, he could not act with effect; and, above all
                    things, to stand by him, or rather be his substitute, in any litigation in which
                    he might become involved. The client in return had not only generally to render
                    his patron the respect and obedience due by a dependant, but, when he was in a
                    position to do so and the circumstances of the patron required it, to render him
                    pecuniary assistance. As time advanced and clients amassed wealth, we find this
                    duty insisted upon in a great variety of forms, as in contributions towards the
                    dowries of a patron’s daughters, towards the ransom of a patron or any of his
                    family who had been taken captive, towards the payment of penalties or fines
                    imposed upon a patron, even towards his maintenance when he had become reduced
                    to poverty. Neither might give evidence against the other, —a rule we find still
                    in observance well on in the 7th century of the city, when C. Herennius declined
                    to be a witness against C. Marius on the ground that the family of the latter
                    had for generations been clients of the Herennii (Plut., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mar.</hi> 5). The client was regarded as a minor member <hi rend="italic"
                    >{gentilicius')</hi> of his patron’s <hi rend="italic">gens;</hi> he was
                    entitled to assist in its religious services, and bound to contribute to the
                    cost of them; he had to follow his patron to battle on the order of the <hi
                    rend="italic">gens</hi>; he was subject to its jurisdiction and discipline, and
                    was entitled to burial in its common sepulchre. And this was the condition, not
                    only of the client who personally had attached himself to a patron, but that
                    also of his descendants; the patronage and the clientage were alike hereditary.
                    In much the same position as the clients, in the earlier centuries of Rome at
                    least, were the freedmen; for originally a slave did not on enfranchisement
                    become a citizen; it was a <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> freedom merely that
                    he enjoyed; his old owner was always called his patron, while he and his
                    descendants were substantially in the position of clients, and often so
                    designated. In the two hundred years that elapsed before the Servian
                    constitutional reforms, the numerical strength of the clients, whether in that
                    condition by <hi rend="italic">adplicatio,</hi> enfranchisement, or descent,
                    must have become considerable; and it was from time to time augmented by the
                    retainers of distinguished immigrants admitted into the ranks of the patriciate.
                    That all these, concurrently with the unattached plebeians, must have been
                    admitted by Servius to nominal citizenship can hardly be doubted. They probably
                    were included in the four urban tribes; but, being incapable as yet of owning
                    land, they could have no admission to the higher centuries, paid no
                    censustribute, were not qualified to serve in the legion, and most likely ranked
                    no higher than <hi rend="italic">accensi.</hi> With the institution of the
                    assemblies of the plebeians of the tribes they must, thanks to their numbers,
                    have gained in influence politically. But it was only with the enactment of the
                    XII. Tables that their relations to their patrons were sensibly affected. For,
                    while that code still denied them, in common with the plebeians generally, the
                    right of intermarriage with the patrician families, it conferred upon them most
                    of the other private rights of citizens; in particular, it entitled them to hold
                    and acquire property, to enter into contracts on their own responsibility, and
                    to litigate in person on their own behalf. The relation of patron and client, it
                    is true, still remained; the patron could still exact from his client respect,
                    obedience, and service, and he and his <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> had still an
                    eventual right of succession to a deceased client’s estate. But the fiduciary
                    duties of the patron were greatly relaxed, and practically little more was
                    expected of him than that he should continue to give his client his advice, and
                    prevent him falling into a condition of indigence; <hi rend="italic"
                    >sacer</hi><hi rend="italic">esto</hi> ceased to be the penalty of protection
                    denied or withheld, its application being limited to <hi rend="italic"
                    >fraus</hi><hi rend="italic">facta,</hi> which, in the language of the Tables,
                    meant positive injury inflicted or damage done. So matters remained during the
                    4th and 5th centuries. In the 6th a variety of events, social and political,
                    contributed still further to modify the relationship. The rapacity of patrons
                    was checked by the Cincian law, which prohibited their taking actual gifts of
                    money from their clients; marriages between patron and client gradually ceased
                    to be regarded as unlawful, or as ineffectual to secure to the issue the status
                    of the patron father; political changes opened to the clients the rural tribes
                    and the higher centuries, and qualified them for the legion, the magistracy, and
                    the senate; hereditary clientage ceased when a client attained to a curule
                    dignity; and, in the case of the descendants of freedmen enfranchised in solemn
                    form, it came to be limited to the first generation. Gradually but steadily one
                    feature after another of the old institution disappeared, till by the end of the
                    7th century it had resolved itself into the limited relationship between patron
                    and freedman on the one hand, and the unlimited honorary relationship between
                    the patron who gave gratuitous advice on questions of law and those who came to
                    consult him on the other. To have a large following of clients of this class was
                    a matter of ambition to every man of mark in the end of the republic; it
                    increased his importance, and ensured him a band of zealous agents in his
                    political schemes. But amid the rivalries of parties and with the venality of
                    the lower orders, baser methods had to be resorted to in order to maintain a
                    patron’s influence; the favour and support of his clients had to be purchased
                    with something more substantial than mere advice. And so arose that wretched and
                    degrading clientage of the early empire, of which Martial, who was not ashamed
                    to confess himself a first-rate specimen of the breed, has given us such graphic
                    descriptions; gatherings of miserable idlers, sycophants, and spendthrifts, at
                    the levees and public appearances of those whom, in their fawning servility,
                    they addressed as lords and masters, but whom they abused behind their backs as
                    close-fisted upstarts,— and all for the sake of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sportula,</hi> the daily dole of a dinner, or of a few pence wherewith to
                    procure one. With the middle empire this disappeared; and, when a reference to
                    patron and client occurs in later times, it is in the sense of counsel and
                    client, the words patron and advocate being used almost synonymously. It was not
                    so in the days of the great forensic orators. The word advocate, it is said, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n435/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0435-0414"/> occurs only once in the singular in the pages of
                    Cicero; and by <hi rend="italic">advocati</hi> was generally understood at that
                    time the body of friends who stood by a litigant in a great cause to give him in
                    any shape their countenance and support. The orator who then appeared in the
                    comitia or before a judge was almost invariably called patron, though the name
                    of client was not so commonly given to the litigant he represented. But at a
                    later period, when the bar had become a profession, and the qualifications,
                    admission, numbers, and fees of counsel had become a matter of state regulation,
                    <hi rend="italic">adνocati</hi> was the word usually employed to designate the
                    pleaders as a class of professional men, each individual advocate, however,
                    being still spoken of as patron in reference to the litigant with whose interest
                    he was entrusted. It is in this limited connexion that patron and client come
                    under our notice in the latest monuments of Roman law.</p>
