                    basin of the Parana-Paraguay system, between 22° and 27° 35' S. lat. and 54° 35'
                    and 61° 40' W. long. It is conterminous with Brazil, Bolivia, and the Argentine
                    Rep-blic, and its boundaries were long under dispute. The Argentine Republic
                    especially laid claim to a portion of the Gran Chaco to the north-east of the
                    Pilcomayo; but in 1878 the president of the United States (to whose arbitration
                    the matter had been submitted) decided in favour of Paraguay.<note

                    Amanbaya to the sources of the Apa, and down that stream to its junction with
                    the Paraguay. The Buenos Aires treaty of February 3, 1876, fixed the frontier
                    between Argentina and Paraguay, and assigned to Paraguay the portion of the Gran
                    Chaco between Rio Verde and Bahia Negra; the appropriation of the portion
                    between Rio Verde and the Pilcomayo was left for after consideration.</p></note>
                    The town of Villa Occidental, on the Gran Chaco side of the Paraguay river,
                    opposite Asuncion, has since been called Villa Hayes. The whole area of the
                    country is estimated at 91,980 square miles, of which 35,280 are in the Gran
                    Chaco portion.</p>
                <p>Paraguay proper, or the country between the Paraguay and the Paranâ, is traversed
                    from north to south by a broad irregular belt of highlands which are known as
                    the Cordillera Amanbaya, Cordillera Urucury, &amp;c., but partake rather of the
                    character of plateaus, and form in fact a continuation and outwork of the great
                    interior plateau of Brazil (Keith Johnston, jun.<note anchored="true"

                    nowhere much exceeds 2200 feet. On the western side these highlands terminate
                    with a more or less sharply-defined edge, the country sloping gradually up to
                    their bases in gentle undulations with open ill-defined valleys; on the eastern
                    side they send out broad spurs enclosing deep-cut valleys, and the whole country
                    retains more of an upland character. The tributaries that flow westward to the
                    Paraguay are consequently to some extent navigable, while those that run
                    eastward to the Paranâ are interrupted by rapids and falls often of a formidable

                    to the rivers, compare the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate
                    River.</hi></p></note> Apart from the central highlands there are several
                    plateaus and knots of hills in the west between 25° and 26° 20' S. lat. The
                    plateau on the edge of which Asuncion is built has a relative height of about
                    200 feet, and skirts the Paraguay for about 25 miles with red sandstone cliffs;
                    to the north of this is the Altos Cordillera, with a relative height of 600
                    feet. From the Asuncion plateau southwards, near the confluence of the Paraguay
                    and Paranâ, there is a vast stretch of marshy country draining partly into the
                    Ypoa lagoon; and smaller tracts of the same character are found in other parts
                    of the lowlands, especially in the valley of the Paraguay. The country sloping
                    to the Paranâ is nearly covered with dense and well-nigh impenetrable forest,
                    and has been left in possession of the sparsely-scattered native tribes. On the
                    other hand the country sloping to the Paraguay, and comprising the whole of the
                    properly settled districts, is, in keeping with its proximity to the vast plains
                    of the Argentine Republic, grassy and open, though the hills are usually covered
                    with forest, and clumps of trees-·are frequent in the lowlands. Except in the
                    marshy regions already mentioned and along the rivers the soil is dry, porous,
                    and sandy, produced by the weathering of the red sandstone, which is the
                    prevailing formation throughout the country.</p>
                <p>The year in Paraguay is divided into two seasons,— “summer” lasting from October
                    to March, and <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> winter” from April to September.
                    December, January, and February are generally the hottest months, and May, June,
                    J uly, and August the coldest. The most temperate month is April. The mean
                    temperature for the year seems to be about 75° or 76°; for summer 81°, for
                    winter 71°. The rainfall, amounting to 58 inches at Asuncion, is distributed <pb

                    being cloudy and 206 bright and clear. In the five years 1877-81 only 50 frosts
                    were observed, and of these 17 fell in August. The wind blows from the south on
                    118 days, and from the north on 103; while from the east it blows only 44 days,
                    and from the west only 3. Neither north nor south appears to obtain any definite
                    mastery in any month or season. The south wind is dry, cool, fresh, and
                    invigorating, and banishes mosquitoes for a time; the north wind is hot, moist,
                    and relaxing. Violent wind-storms, generally from the south, average sixteen per
                    annum. Goitre and leprosy are the only endemic diseases; but the natives, being
                    underfed, are prone to diarrhoea and dyspepsia.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The fauna of Paraguay proper is practically the same as that of Brazil. Caymans,

                    called partridges, the <hi rend="italic">ρato real</hi> or royal duck, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Palamedea</hi><hi rend="italic">cornuta,</hi> parrots and
                    parakeets, are among the more notable forms. Insect life is peculiarly abundant;
                    the red stump-like ant-hills are a feature in every landscape, and bees used to
                    be kept in all the mission villages.</p>
                <p>As to the mineral resources of Paraguay but little is known—possibly because
                    there is little to know. The gold mines said to have been concealed by the
                    Jesuits may have had no existence; and, though iron was worked by Lopez II. at
                    Ibicuy (70 miles south-east of Asuncion), and native copper, black oxide of
                    manganese, marbles, lime, and salt have been found in greater or less abundance,
                    the real wealth of the country consists rather in the variety and value of its
                    vegetable productions. Its forests yield at least seventy kinds of timber fit
                    for industrial purposes,— some, such as the lapacho and quebracho, of rare
                    excellence and durability, as is shown by the wonderful state of preservation in
                    which the wood-work of early Jesuit churches still remains. Fifteen plants are
                    known to furnish dyes, and eight are sources of fibre—the caraguatay especially
                    being employed in the manufacture of the exquisite nanduty or spiderweb lace of
                    the natives. Fruit trees of many kinds flourish luxuriantly; the cocoa palm
                    often forms regular groves, and the orange tree (reaching a height of 50 feet)
                    is so common and bears so profusely that oranges, like bananas, have a mere
                    nominal value. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mate</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.),</hi> or Paraguayan tea, Paraguay has a commercial plant of great
                    importance, which may be said to be peculiarly its own; and most of the primary
                    crops of the tropics could be cultivated with ease if there were only men and
                    means. Paraguay tobacco is prized in all the La Plata countries, and, as men,
                    women, and children all smoke, there is a large home consumption; but only a
                    small quantity finds its way to Europe, under other names; coffee (though the
                    berry is of excellent quality, if slightly bitter) is even more neglected; sugar
                    is grown only for manufacture into rum and syrups, and loaf-sugar has to be
                    imported from Brazil; and, although the whole population is clothed exclusively
                    in white cotton stuffs, and cotton grows almost spontaneously in the country,
                    English goods burdened by a duty of 40 per cent, keep the market. Wheat, oats,
                    and rice can all be raised in different districts, but the dietary staples of
                    the Paraguayans are still, as when the Spaniards first came, maize and mandioca
                    (the latter the chief ingredient in the excellent <hi rend="italic">chipa</hi>
                    or Paraguayan bread), varied it may be with the seeds of the <hi rend="italic"

                    destroyed during the war, and is only being slowly recruited from the Argentine
                    Republic. The total number of horned cattle is estimated at 500,000. Land may be
                    purchased from private owners for from &lt;£160 to £200 per square league of
                    4500 English acres, but the Government rate amounts to £900 or £1000.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Paraguay are mainly Guaranis or half-breeds with a strong
                    proportion of Guarani blood.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    displayed during the desolating wars of 1865-70 (as so often before in the time
                    of the Jesuits) indomitable courage in the face of overwhelming odds.
                    Trustworthy figures in regard to the population can hardly be said to exist. A
                    so-called census for 1879 gives a total of 346,048, which is probably not far
                    from the truth. The female births being always in excess of the male, and most
                    of the full-grown men having perished in the wars, the females form about
                    two-thirds of the whole. Of the foreign residents in 1879, about 4000 were
                    Italians, 400 Germans, 400 Spaniards, and 40 English. Formerly, about 1857,
                    divided into twenty-five departments, the country was in 1876 distributed into
                    twenty-three electoral districts, each with a gefe politico, ajuez de paz, and a
                    municipality. <hi rend="smallcaps">Asuncion (j.u),</hi> the capital, is also the
                    largest city (40,000 in 1857,16,000 in 1879). Other places of present or
                    historical importance are Villa Rica (12,570 in 1879), often called Villa Pobre,
                    the chief seat of the, tobacco trade, and the easternmost of the larger towns;
                    Villa Pilar or El Pilar (3722), formerly Neembucu, opposite the mouth of the
                    Berιnejo, and the “strangers’ farthest” under Dr Francia’s despotism; San
                    Estanislao (7453); San Pedro (9706), near the Tejui, about 3 leagues from its
                    junction with the Paraguay; Concepcion (10,697), the northernmost of the towns
                    or villages, 200 miles above Asuncion, and the trading centre for the northern
                    maté plantations; Humai ta (3868), 198 miles below the capital, the site of the
                    great earthw'orks by which Lopez stopped the advance of the allies for more than
                    a year; Paraguari (5315), the present terminus of the railway; Jaguaron (3413),
                    2⅜ leagues from Paraguari, founded in 1536, and the seat of a manufacture of
                    orange-flower essence; Ita (6332), known for its earthenware; Itangua (6948),
                    with brick and tile works; Luque (8878), the provisional capital in 1868; Villa
                    Hayes (Villa Occidental, Nouvelle Bourdeaux), 10 miles above Asuncion, founded
                    in 1854 by Lopez with French settlers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Paraguay is a constitutional republic. The president and vice-president hold
                    office for four years, and are again eligible after eight years. The legislative
                    bodies are a chamber of deputies (one deputy from each 6000 inhabitants) and a
                    senate (one senator from each territorial division with 8000 inhabitants, and
                    beyond that from every 12,000 inhabitants). There are five Government
                    departments, and a supreme court of three salaried judges. The people are
                    nominally Roman Catholics, but full religious liberty prevails. Crime is
                    comparatively rare, and is rapidly diminishing. Marriage has fallen so
                    completely out of fashion that only 3 per cent, of the births are legitimate.
                    Education is technically compulsory; but the 178 schools were in 1879 attended
                    only by 5862 boys and 920 girls. There is only one public library (3000 vols.)
                    in the country. The army, which, when Lopez II. ascended the throne, numbered
                    12,000 men, but with a reserve of 46,000, is now reduced to 500 men; every
                    able-bodied citizen is under obligation to serve in case of need. There is but
                    one war-steamer, of 440 tons burden. The only railway is the line (45 miles)
                    from Asuncion to Paraguari, which was begun by Lopez I. in 1859, and surveyed as
                    far as Villa Rica. It was bought for £100,000 by a jcint-stock company in 1877.
                    The double run, occupying twelve hours, is performed four times a week. The
                    general trade of the country has begun to revive: from £131,493 in 1876, the
                    value of the imports rose to £258,000 in 1881, and the exports from £68,577 to
                    £385,700. Among the exports (all duty free) there appeared in 1881—mate,
                    £182,025; dry hides, £23,345; tobacco, £131,730; 20,009,597 cigars, £4802 (about
                    seventeen a penny); 47,917,700 oranges, £9583; and hard woods, £3342. The
                    customs furnish nearly four-fifths of the national revenue (not much more than
                    £100,000 in 1881). Previous to the war there was no national debt. In 1871 and
                    1872 two foreign loans (nominally £1,000,000 and £2,000,000) were contracted
                    through Messrs Robinson, Fleming, &amp; Company, London, and hypothecated on the
                    public lands of Paraguay, valued at £19,380,000. Apart from the war debt of more
                    than £45,000,000, the official statement for 1882 recognizes a foreign debt of
                    £3,463,000.</p>

                    Paraguay and Rio Parana, but to the whole Spanish territory, which now comprises
                    parts of Brazil, the republic of Uruguay, and the Argentine provinces of Buenos
                    Ayres, Entre Rios, C'orrientes, Misiones, and part of Santa Fé. It was not till
                    1620 that Paraguay proper and Rio de la Plata or Buenos Ayres were separated
                    from each other as distinct governments, and they were both dependent on the
                    vice-royalty of Peru till 1776, when Buenos Ayres was erected into a
                    vice-royalty, and Paraguay placed under its jurisdiction. In the history of
                    Paraguay down to the latter part of the 18th century, the interest develops
                    along two main lines, which from time to time get entangled with each other—the
                    struggle between Spaniard and Portuguese for the possession of the border region
                    between the Brazils and the country of the plains, and the formation and defence
                    of a great philanthropic despotism by the Jesuits. The first Christian missions
                    in Paraguay were established by the Franciscans—Armenta, Lebron, Solano (who was
                    afterwards canonized as the apostle of Paraguay), and Bolanos—between 1542 and
                    1560; but neither they nor the first Jesuit missionaries, Salonio, Field, and
                    Ortega, were allowed to make their enterprise a permanent success. This fell to
                    the lot of the second band of Jesuits, Cataldino, Mazeta, and Lorenzana, who
                    began work in 1605. The methods by which they controlled and disciplined the
                    Guaranis have been described in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    the present limits of the republic, in the country south of the Parana, which
                    now forms the two Argentine provinces of Corrientes and Misiones. La Guayra, one
                    of the most celebrated, is in the Brazilian province of Parana. Though they
                    succeeded in establishing a kind of <hi rend="italic">imperium in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">imperio,</hi> and were allowed to drill the natives to the use of
                    arms, the Jesuits never held rule in the government of Paraguay; indeed they had
                    nearly as often to defend themselves from the hostility of the governor and
                    bishop at Asuncion as from the actual invasions of the Paulistas or Portuguese
                    settlers of Sâo Paulo. It was only by the powerful assistance of Zabala,
                    governor of Buenos Ayres that the Anti-Jesuit and quasi-national party which had
                    been formed under Antequera was crushed in 1735. In 1750 Ferdinand VI. of Spain
                    ceded to the Portuguese, in exchange for the fortified village of Colonia del
                    Sacramento (Uruguay), both the district of La Guayra and a territory of some
                    20,000 square miles to the east of the Uruguay. Seven of their reductions being
                    included in this area, the Jesuits determined to resist the transference, and it
                    was only after several engagements that they were defeated by the combined
                    forces of Spain and Portugal. The treaty which they thus opposed was revoked by
                    Spain in 1761, but the missions never recovered their prosperity, and the
                    Jesuits were finally expelled the country in 1767. In 1811 Paraguay declared
                    itself independent of Spain; by 1814 it was a despotism in the hands of Dr <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Francia</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.υ. ).</hi> On Francia’s death
                    in 1840, the chief power passed to his nephew Carlos Antonio <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Lopez</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> and he was in 1862
                    succeeded by his son Francisco Solano Lopez, whose ambitious schemes of conquest
                    resulted in the almost total extinction of Paraguayan nationality. The three
                    allies, Uruguay, Brazil, and the Argentine Republic, which united against him,
                    bound themselves by the treaty of 1865 to respect and guarantee for five years
                    the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Paraguay, and at the
                    close of the war in 1870 a new constitution was established, and a president,
                    Jovellanos, appointed under their protection. Reduced to utter helplessness, the
                    country owes its continued existence to the jealousy and balance of power
                    existing between its neighbours. By a separate treaty with Brazil in 1872 it
                    undertook to pay the cost of the war—£40,000,000 to Brazil, £7,000,000 to the
                    Argentine Republic, and £200,000 to Uruguay, or more than £136 per head of the
                    population. An attempt made in 1873 by Messrs Robinson and Fleming to establish
                    an English colony of so-called Lincolnshire farmers ended in disaster. Somewhat
                    better success has as yet attended the German colony of San Bernardino on Lake
                    Ipacanay (414 colonists in 1879). The Brazilian army of occupation was withdrawn
                    only in 1876.</p>
