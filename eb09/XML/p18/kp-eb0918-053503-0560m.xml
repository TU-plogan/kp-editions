                <p><label type="entry">PERIODICALS</label> may be broadly divided into two classes,
                    the one chiefly devoted to general literature, apart from political and social
                    news (a subject dealt with under the heading of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Newspapers),</hi> and the other more exclusively to science and art, or to
                    particular branches of knowledge or trade. The former class, and those of
                    general interest only, will be principally dealt with in this article, where an
                    endeavour is made to trace briefly the history of the rise and progress of that
                    vast and increasing body of printed matter which, under the different names of
                    reviews, magazines, &lt;tc., forms so large a part of current literature.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">British.</hi></p>
                <p>The first literary periodical in English was the <hi rend="italic">Mercurius
                    Librarius,</hi><hi rend="italic">or a Fcιithful Account of all Books and
                    Pamphlets</hi> (1680), a mere catalogue, followed by <hi rend="italic">Weekly
                    Memorials for the Ingenious</hi> (16th January 1681/82 to 15th January 1683),
                    which was more of the type of the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Savants,</hi>
                    whence it borrowed many contributions, and by the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque
                    Universelle et Historique</hi> (January 1686-93), begun by Jean Leclerc,
                    continued with the assistance of J. de la Crose, and carried on during the last
                    six years of its existence by J. Bernard. Of the <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Learning</hi> (1691; another with the same title in 1694) only a few numbers
                    appeared, as the conductor, De la Crose, started the <hi rend="italic">Works of
                    the Learned</hi> (August 1691 to April 1692), devoted principally to Continental
                    scholarship. The <hi rend="italic">Compleat Library (fWP2</hi> to December 1693)
                    was a ventureof John Dunton; the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs for the
                    Ingenious</hi> (1693) ran to six monthly numbers, and another with the same
                    title appeared in the following year, only to enjoy an equally brief career. The
                    first periodical of merit and influence was the <hi rend="italic">History of
                    the</hi> JFbrfø <hi rend="italic">of the Learned (1699-1712),</hi> largely
                    consisting of descriptions of foreign books. The <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of
                    Literature,</hi> the first English review consisting entirely of original
                    matter, published in London from 1710 to 1714, had for editor Michel de la
                    Roche, a French Protestant refugee, who also edited at Amsterdam the <hi

                    subsequently <hi rend="italic">Mémoires Littéraires de la Grande Bretagne</hi>
                    (17 20-24). Returning to England in 1725, he recommenced his <hi rend="italic"
                    >New Memoirs of Literature</hi> (1725-28), and in 1730 a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Literary Journal.</hi> Dr Samuel Jebb started <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca
                    Literaria</hi> (17 22-24), which dealt with medals and antiquities as well as
                    with literature, but only ten numbers appeared. <hi rend="italic">The Present

                    January 1728, and completed in December 1736. It contained not only excellent

                    Ephraim Chambers had much to do, were very short-lived. In 1737 the <hi

                    appeared again, and was continued without intermission until 1743, when its
                    place was taken by <hi rend="italic">A Literary Journal</hi> (Dublin, 1744-49),
                    the first review published in Ireland. The <hi rend="italic">Museum</hi> (1746)
                    of R. Dodsley united the character of a review of books with that of a literary
                    magazine. Although England can show nothing like the <hi rend="italic">Journal
                    des Savants,</hi> which has flourished almost without a break for 220 years, a
                    nearly· complete series of reviews of English literature may be made up from
                    1681 to the present day.</p>
                <p>After the close of the first quarter of the 18th century the literary journal
                    began to assume more of the style of the .modern review, and in 1749 the title
                    and the chief features were united in the <hi rend="italic">Monthly Review,</hi>
                    established by Ralph Griffiths,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    down to 1825. It came to an end in 1845. From its commencement the <hi
                    rend="italic">Review</hi> dealt with science and literature, as well as with
                    literary criticism. It was Whig in politics and Nonconformist in theology. The
                    Tory party and the established church were defended in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Critical Review</hi> (1756-1817), founded by Archibald Hamilton and supported
                    by Smollett, Johnson, and Robertson. Johnson took a considerable part in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Literary Magazine</hi> (1756-58). The reviews rapidly increased in
                    number towards the end of the century. Among the principal were the <hi
                    rend="italic">London Review</hi> (1775-80), <hi rend="italic">A New Review</hi>
                    (1782-86), the <hi rend="italic">English Review</hi> (1783-96), incorporated in
                    1797 with the <hi rend="italic">Analytical Review</hi> (1788-99), the <hi
                    rend="italic">AntiJacobin Review and Magazine</hi> (1798-1821), and the <hi
                    rend="italic">British Critic</hi> (1793-1843), the organ of the High Church
                    party, and first edited by Archdeacon Nares and Beloe.</p>
                <p>These periodicals had now become extremely numerous, and many of the leading
                    London publishers found it convenient to maintain their own particular organs.
                    It is not a matter of surprise, therefore, that the authority of the reviews
                    should have fallen somewhat in public estimation. The time was ripe for one
                    which should be quite independent of the booksellers, and which should also aim
                    at a higher standard of excellence. As far back as 1755 Adam Smith, Blair, and
                    others had endeavoured to carry on such a quarterly without achieving success,
                    and in 1773 Gilbert Stuart and William Smellie issued during three years an <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh Magazine and Review.</hi> To the northern capital is
                    also due the first high-class critical journal which has kept up its reputation
                    to the present day. The <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> was established
                    in 1802 by Jeffrey, Scott, Horner, Brougham, and Sydney Smith. It created a new
                    era in periodical criticism, and assumed from the commencement a wider range and
                    more elevated tone than any of its predecessors. The first editor was Sydney
                    Smith, then Jeffrey for many years, and afterwards Macvey Napier. At one time
                    20,000 copies are said to have been published, but the circulation declined in
                    1832 to less than 9000. Scott, being dissatisfied with the new review, persuaded
                    John Murray, to start its brilliant Tory competitor, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quarterly Review</hi> (1809), first edited by William Gifford, then by Sir J.
                    T. Coleridge, and subsequently by J. G. Lockhart. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Westminster Review</hi> (1824), established by the disciples of Jeremy Bentham,
                    advocated radical reforms in church, state, and legislation. In 1836 it was
                    joined to the <hi rend="italic">London Review</hi> (1829), founded by Sir
                    William Molesworth, and then bore the name of the <hi rend="italic">London and
                    Westminster Review</hi> till 1851, when it returned to the original title. The
                    other quarterly reviews are the <hi rend="italic">Eclectic Review</hi>
                    (1805-68), edited down to 1834 by Josiah Conder and supported by the Dissenters;
                    the <hi rend="italic">British Review</hi> (1811- 25); the <hi rend="italic"

                    (1828- 29); the <hi rend="italic">Dublin Review</hi> (1836), still continued as
                    the organ of the Roman Catholics; the <hi rend="italic">Foreign and Colonial
                    Quarterly Review</hi> (1843-47); the <hi rend="italic">Prospective Review</hi>
                    (1845-55), given up to theology and literature, previously the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Christian Teacher</hi> (1835-44); the <hi rend="italic">North British
                    Revierv</hi> (1844-71); the <hi rend="italic">British Quarterly Review</hi>
                    (1845), successor to the <hi rend="italic">British and Foreign Review</hi>
                    (1835-44); the <hi rend="italic">New Quarterly Review</hi> (1852-61); the <hi
                    rend="italic">Scottish Review</hi> (1853-62), published at Glasgow; the Wesleyan
                    <hi rend="italic">London Quarterly Review</hi> (1853); the <hi rend="italic"
                    >National Review</hi> (1855-64); the <hi rend="italic">Diplomatic Review</hi>
                    (1855-81); the <hi rend="italic">Irish Quarterly Review</hi> (1851-59), brought
                    out in Dublin; the <hi rend="italic">Home and Foreign Review</hi> (1862-64); the
                    <hi rend="italic">Fine Arts Quarterly Review</hi> (1863-65); the <hi

                    Quarterly Review</hi> (1875); <hi rend="italic">Mind</hi> (1876), dealing with
                    mental philosophy; the <hi rend="italic">Modern Review</hi> (1880); and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Scottish Review</hi> (1882).</p>
                <p>The monthly reviews include the <hi rend="italic">Christian Observer</hi>
                    (1802-57), conducted by members of the established church upon evangelical
                    principles, with Zachary Macaulay as the first editor; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monthly Repository</hi> (1806-37), originally purely theological, but after
                    coming into the hands of the Rev. W. J. Fox made entirely literary and
                    political. The <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly Review</hi> (1865) was intended as
                    a kind of English <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes.</hi> Since 1866 it
                    has appeared monthly. The <hi rend="italic">Contemporary</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Reviere</hi> (1866) and the <hi rend="italic">Nineteenth Century</hi> (1877)
                    are similar in character, consisting of signed articles by men of mark of all
                    opinions upon questions of the day. The <hi rend="italic">National Review</hi>
                    (1883) was brought out to supply the demand for an exclusively Conservative
                    review, and <hi rend="italic">Modern Thought</hi> (1879) for the free discussion
                    of political, religious, and social subjects.</p>
                <p>The weekly reviews dealing generally with literature, science, and art are the
                    <hi rend="italic">Literary Gazette</hi> (1817-62), first edited by William
                    Jerdan, which had for many years a circulation of 6000 copies; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> (1828), established by Silk Buckingham, but which
                    was not very successful until it was taken over by C. W. Dilke; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Academy</hi> (1869), founded, and at first edited, by Dr Appleton.
                    Those which also include political and social topics are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Examiner</hi> (1808-81), the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> (1828), the <hi
                    rend="italic">Saturday Review</hi> (1855), and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronicle</hi> (1867-68). The reviews in the <hi rend="italic">Academy</hi> are
                    signed.</p>
                <p>Soon after the introduction of the literary journal in England, one of a more
                    familiar tone was started by the eccentric John Dunton <hi rend="italic">A
                    thenian Gazette, or Casuistical Mercury, resolving all the most Nice and Curious
                    Questions</hi> (1689/90 to 1695/96), a kind of forerunner of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Notes and Queries,</hi> being a penny weekly sheet, with a quarterly critical
                    supplement. In the last part the publisher announces that it will be continued
                    “as soon as ever the glut of news is a little over.” Defoe’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Review</hi> (1704-13) dealt chiefly with politics and commerce, but the
                    introduction in it of what its editor fittingly termed the “scandalous club” was
                    another step nearer the papers of Steele and the periodical essayists, the first
                    attempts to create an organized popular opinion in matters of taste and manners.
                    These little papers, rapidly thrown off for a temporary purpose, were destined
                    to form a very important part of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n562/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0562-0537"/> the literature of the 18th century, and in some
                    respects its most marked feature. Although the frequenters of the clubs and
                    coffee-houses were the persons for whom the essay-papers were mainly written, a
                    proof of the increasing refinement of the age is to be found in the fact that
                    now for the first time were women specially addressed as part of the reading
                    public. The <hi rend="italic">Tatter</hi> was commenced by Richard Steele in
                    1709, and issued thrice a week until 1711. The idea was at once extremely
                    popular, and a dozen similar papers were started within the year, at least one
                    half bearing colourable imitations of the title. Addison contributed to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tatter,</hi> and together with Steele established and carried on
                    the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> (1710-14), and subsequently the <hi
                    rend="italic">Guardian</hi> (1713). The newspaper tax enforced in 1712 was a
                    sore blow. Before this time the daily issue of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spectator</hi> had reached 3000 copies; it then fell to 1600; the price was
                    raised from a penny to twopence, but the paper came to an end in 1714. Dr Drake
                    <hi rend="italic">{Essays illustr. of the Rambler,</hi> &amp;c., ii. 490) drew

                <p>As from the “pamphlet of news” arose the weekly paper wholly devoted to the
                    circulation of news, so from the general newspaper was specialized the weekly or
                    monthly review of literature, antiquities, and science, which, when it included
                    essay-papers, made up the magazine or miscellaneous repository of matter for
                    information and amusement. Several monthly publications had come into existence
                    since 1681, but perhaps the first germ of the magazine is to be found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gentleman’s Journal</hi> (1691-94) of Peter Motteux, which,
                    besides the news of the month, contained miscellaneous prose and poetry. In 1722
                    Dr Samuel Jebb included antiquarian notices as well as literary reviews in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Literaria</hi> (1722-24), but the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gentleman’s Magazine,</hi> founded in 1731, fully established,
                    through the tact and energy of the publisher Edward Cave, the type of the
                    magazine, from that time so marked a feature of English periodical literature.
                    This magazine, so long a source of fortune to its successive owners, was vainly
                    offered during four years to different publishers before Cave was able to start
                    it himself. The first idea is due to Motteux, from whom the title, motto, and
                    general plan were borrowed. The chief feature in the new venture at first
                    consisted of the analysis of the journals, which Cave undertook personally.
                    Prizes were offered for poetry. In April 1732 the leading metropolitan
                    publishers, jealous of the interloper Cave, started the <hi rend="italic">London
                    Magazine, or Gentleman’s Monthly Intelligencer</hi> (1732-84), which had a long
                    and prosperous career. The new magazine closely copied Cave’s title, plan, and
                    aspect, and bitter war was long waged between the two. The rivalry was not
                    without benefit to the literary public, as the conductors of each used every
                    effort to improve their own review. Cave introduced the practice of giving
                    engravings, maps, and portraits, but his greatest success was the addition of
                    Johnson to the regular staff. This took place in 1738, when the latter wrote the
                    preface to the volume for that year, observing that the magazine had “given rise
                    to almost twenty imitations of it, which are either all dead or very little
                    regarded.” The plan was also imitated in Denmark, Sweden, and Germany. Cave
                    edited his magazine down to his death in 17 54, when it was continued by his
                    brother-in-law David Henry, afterwards by John Nichols and his son. The
                    specially antiquarian and historical features were dropped in 1868, and it was
                    changed to a miscellany of light literature.</p>
                <p>Many other magazines were produced in consequence of the success of these two. It
                    will be sufficient to mention the folF <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> ing. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Scots Magazine</hi> (1739-1817) was the first published in
                    Scotland; from 1817 to 1826 it was styled the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh
                    Magazine.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Universal Magazine</hi> (1747) had a short,
                    if brilliant, career; but the <hi rend="italic">European Magazine,</hi> founded
                    by James Perry in 1782, lasted down to 1826. Of more importance than these, or
                    than the <hi rend="italic">Royal Magazine</hi> (1759-71), was the <hi
                    rend="italic">Monthly Magazine</hi> (1796- 1843), with which Priestley and
                    Godwin were originally connected. During thirty years the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monthly</hi> was conducted by Sir Richard Phillips, under whom it became more
                    statistical and scientific than literary. Class magazines were represented by
                    the Edinburgh <hi rend="italic">Farmer’s Magazine</hi> (1800-25) and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine</hi> (1798), established in London by
                    Alexander Tilloch; the latter at first consisted chiefly of translations of
                    scientific articles from the French. The following periodicals, all of which
                    date from the 18th century, are still published :—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gentleman’s Magazine</hi> (1731), the <hi rend="italic">Gospel Magazine</hi>
                    (1768), <hi rend="italic">Wesleyan Methodist Magazine</hi> (1778), <hi
                    rend="italic">Curtis’s Botanical Magazine</hi> (1786), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Evangelical Magazine</hi> (1793), <hi rend="italic">Methodist New Connexion
                    Magazine</hi> (1797), <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine</hi> (1798).</p>
                <p>The increased influence of this class of periodical upon the public opinion of
                    our own era was first apparent in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood’s Edinburgh
                    Magazine,</hi> founded in 1817 by the publisher of that name, and carried to a
                    high degree of excellence by the contributions of Scott, Lockhart, Hogg, Maginn,
                    Syme, and John Wilson, the editor. It is still issued, and has always remained
                    Liberal in literature and Conservative in politics. The <hi rend="italic">New
                    Monthly Magazine</hi> is somewhat earlier in date. It was founded in 1814 by the
                    London publisher Colburn, and was edited in turns by Campbell, Theodore Hook,
                    Bulwer Lytton, and Ainsworth. Many of Carlyle’s and Thackeray’s pieces first
                    appeared in <hi rend="italic">Fraser’s Magazine</hi> (1830), long famous for its
                    personalities and its gallery of literary portraits. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metropolitan Magazine</hi> was started in opposition to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fraser,</hi> and was first edited by Campbell, who had left its rival. It
                    subsequently came into the hands of Captain Marryatt, who printed in it many of
                    his sea-tales. The <hi rend="italic">British Magazine</hi> (1832-49) included
                    religious and ecclesiastical information. From Ireland came the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dublin University Magazine</hi> (1833). The regular price of these
                    magazines was half a crown; the first of the cheaper ones was <hi rend="italic"
                    >Taù’s Edinburgh Magazine</hi> (1832-61) at a shilling. It was Radical in
                    politics, and had Roebuck as one of its founders. <hi rend="italic">Bentley’s
                    Miscellany</hi> (1837-68) was exclusively devoted to novels, light literature,
                    and travels. Several of Ainsworth’s romances, illustrated by Cruikshank, first
                    saw the light in <hi rend="italic">Bentley.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Nautical
                    Magazine</hi> (1832) was addressed specially to <pb break="no"

                <p>From 1815 to 1820 a number of low-priced and unwholesome periodicals flourished.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Mirror</hi> (1823-49), a twopenny illustrated magazine,
                    begun by John Limbird,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    followers.</p></note> and the <hi rend="italic">Mechanics Magazine</hi> (1823)
                    were steps in a better direction. The political agitation of 1831 led to a
                    further popular demand, and a supply of cheap and healthy serials for the
                    reading multitude commenced with <hi rend="italic">Chambers’s Edinburgh
                    Journal</hi> (1832), the <hi rend="italic">Penny Magazine</hi> (1832-45) of
                    Charles Knight, issued under the patronage of the Society for the Diffusion of
                    Useful Knowledge, and the <hi rend="italic">Saturday Magazine</hi> (1832-44),
                    begun by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. The first was published
                    at l⅜d. and the last two at Id. Knight secured the best authors and artists of
                    the day to write for and illustrate his magazine, which, though at first a
                    commercial success, may have had the reason of its subsequent discontinuance in
                    its literary excellence. At the end of 1832 it had reached a sale of 200,000 in
                    weekly numbers and monthly parts. It came to an end in 1845 and was succeeded by
                    <hi rend="italic">Knight’s Penny Magazine</hi> (1845), which was stopped after
                    six monthly parts. These periodicals were followed by a number of penny weeklies
                    of a lower tone, such as the <hi rend="italic">Family Herald</hi> (1843), the
                    <hi rend="italic">London Journal</hi> (1845), and <hi rend="italic">Lloyds
                    Miscellany;</hi> the two former are still thriving. In 1850 the sale of the
                    first of them was placed at 175,000 copies, the second at 170,000, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Lloyds</hi> at 95,000. In 1846 fourteen penny and three halfpenny
                    magazines, twelve social journals, and thirty-seven book-serials were produced
                    every week in London. A further and permanent improvement in cheap weeklies for
                    home reading may be traced from the foundation of <hi rend="italic">Howitt’s
                    Journal</hi> (1847-49), and more especially <hi rend="italic">Household
                    Words</hi> (1850), conducted by Charles Dickens, <hi rend="italic">All the Year
                    Round</hi> (1859), by the same editor, and afterwards by his son, <hi
                    rend="italic">Qnce a Week</hi> (1859), and the <hi rend="italic">Leisure
                    Hour</hi> (1852). The plan of <hi rend="italic">Notes and Queries</hi> (1849),
                    for the purpose of intercommunication among those interested in special points
                    of literary and antiquarian character, has led to the adoption of similar
                    departments in a great number of newspapers and periodicals, and, besides
                    several imitators in England, there are now parallel journals in Holland,
                    France, and Italy.</p>
                <p>Recent shilling monthlies began with <hi rend="italic">Macmillan</hi> (1859), the
                    <hi rend="italic">Cornhill</hi> (1860), and <hi rend="italic">Temple Bar</hi>
                    (1860). The <hi rend="italic">Cornhill,</hi> first edited by Thackeray, was
                    known for its specially literary tone down to 1883. <hi rend="italic">St James’s
                    Magazine</hi> (1861), <hi rend="italic">Belgravia</hi> (1866), <hi rend="italic"
                    >St Paul’s</hi> (1867-74), <hi rend="italic">London Society</hi> (1862), and <hi
                    rend="italic">Tinsley’s</hi> (1867) are devoted chiefly to novels and light
                    reading. The sixpenny illustrated magazines commenced with <hi rend="italic"
                    >Good Words</hi> (1860) and the <hi rend="italic">Quiver</hi> (1861), both
                    religious in tendency. In 1882 <hi rend="italic">Fraser</hi> changed its name to
                    <hi rend="italic">Longman’s Magazine,</hi> and was entirely popularized and
                    reduced to sixpence. The <hi rend="italic">Cornhill</hi> followed the same
                    example in 1883, reducing its price to sixpence and devoting its pages to light
                    reading. The <hi rend="italic">English Illustrated Magazine</hi> (1883) was
                    brought out in competition with the American <hi rend="italic">Harper</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Century.</hi> Of the artistic periodicals we may signalize the
                    <hi rend="italic">Art Journal</hi> (1849), long known for its line engravings,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Portfolio</hi> (1870), which has done much to popularize
                    etching, and the <hi rend="italic">Magazine of Art</hi> (1878).</p>
                <p>The following statistics furnish an idea of the marvellous increase in the number
                    of periodicals issued at different times during the last fifty years. In figures
                    submitted to the House of Commons in 1864 Sir Edward Baines estimated the
                    circulation of the monthly magazines in 1831 at no more than 125,000 copies;
                    when he spoke the number had increased to 3,609,350. The weeklies might be
                    reckoned in 1831 at about equal to the monthlies in circulation, and the
                    miscellaneous serials at 120,000, amounting altogether to 420,000 copies. In
                    1864 the circulation of weeklies and monthlies reached a total of 6,094,950 <hi
                    rend="italic">{Journal of Statist. Soc.,</hi> 1864, pp. 410-412). Concurrently
                    with this increase in the whole number published there may be observed an
                    equally regular decrease in the average cost of each. In 1831 there were issued
                    in London alone 177 monthlies, costing £17, 12s. 6d., or an average of 2s.
                    apiece. At the end of 1833 there were 236 of the same class, costing £23, 3s.
                    6d., and the average price had decreased to Is. ll∣d. Twenty years later, in
                    1853, there were 362 monthlies, costing £14, 17s. 6d., the average cost of each
                    being now only 9∣d. (Knight’s <hi rend="italic">Old Printer and Modern

                <p>In London itself the increase of the weeklies, monthlies, and quarterlies at
                    different periods has been as follows :—</p>

                    rend="italic">Bureau d'</hi><hi rend="italic">Adresse</hi> of Théophraste
                    Renaudot, giving the proceedings of his conferences upon literary and scientific
                    matters (1633-42). About the year 1663 Mézeray obtained a privilege for a
                    regular literary periodical, which came to nothing, and it was left to Denis de
                    Sallo, counsellor of the parliament of Paris and a man of rare merit and
                    learning, to actually carry the project into effect. The first number of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal des Savants</hi> appeared on 5th January 1665, under the
                    assumed name of the sieur d’Hédouville. The prospectus promised to give an
                    account of the chief books published throughout Europe, obituary notices, a
                    review of the progress of science, besides legal and ecclesiastical information
                    and other matters of interest to cultivated persons. The criticisms, however,
                    wounded alike authors and the clergy, and the journal was suppressed after a
                    career of three months. Colbert, seeing the public utility of such a periodical,
                    ordered the abbé Gallois, a contributor of De Sallo’s, to re-establish it, an
                    event which took place on 4th January 1666. It lingered nine years under the new
                    editor, who was replaced in 1675 by the abbé de la Roque, and the latter in his
                    turn by the president Cousin in 1686. From 1701 commenced a new era for the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal,</hi> which was then acquired by the chancellor de
                    Pontchartrain for the state and placed under the direction of a commission of
                    learned men. Just before the Revolution it developed fresh activity, but the
                    troubles of 1792 caused it to be discontinued until 1796, when it again failed
                    to appear after twelve numbers had been issued. In 1816 it was definitively
                    re-established and replaced under Government patronage, remaining subject to the
                    chancellor or garde-des-sceaux until 1857, when it was transferred to the
                    control of the minister of public instruction. The present organization much
                    resembles that of an academy. The members of the commission are elected,
                    approved of by the minister, and divided into assistants and authors, the latter
                    furnishing at least three articles per annum at a fixed and modest rate of
                    payment. All communications are discussed at fortnightly conferences.</p>
                <p>Louis Auguste de Bourbon, sovereign prince of Dombes, having transferred his
                    parliament to Trévoux, set up a printing press, and was persuaded by two
                    Jesuits, Michel le Tellier and Philippe Lalle-man, to establish the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoires pour servir à l’Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Sciences</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arts</hi> (1701-67),
                    more familiarly known as the <hi rend="italic">Journal de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Trévoux,</hi> long the best-informed and best-written journal in France. One
                    feature of its career was its constant appeal for the literary assistance of
                    outsiders. It was continued in a more popular style as <hi rend="italic">Journal
                    des Sciences</hi><hi rend="italic">et des Beaux-Arts</hi> (1768-75) by the abbé
                    Aubert and by the brothers Castilhon (1776-78), and as <hi rend="italic">Journal

                    by the abbé Grosier.</p>
                <p>The first legal periodical was the <hi rend="italic">Journal du Palais</hi>
                    (1672) of Blondeau and Guéret, and the first devoted to medicine the <hi

                    la Médecine</hi> (1679) of Nicolas de Blégny, frequently spoken of as a
                    charlatan, a term which sometimes means simply a man of many ideas. Religious
                    periodicals date from 1680 and the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ecclésiastique</hi> of the abbé de la Roque. The prototype of the
                    historico-literary periodical may be discovered in <hi rend="italic">La Clef du
                    Cabinet des Princes</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’Europe</hi> (1704-6), familiarly
                    known as <hi rend="italic">Journal de Verdun,</hi> and carried on under various
                    titles down to 1794.</p>
                <p>Literary criticism was no more free than political discussion, and no person was
                    allowed to trespass either upon the domain of the <hi rend="italic">Journal des
                    Savants</hi> or that of the <hi rend="italic">Mercure de France</hi> without the
                    payment of heavy subsidies. This was the origin of the clandestine press of
                    Holland, and it was that country which for the next hundred years supplied the
                    ablest periodical criticism from the pens of French Protestant refugees. During
                    that period thirty-one journals of the first class proceeded from these sources.
                    From its commencement the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Savants</hi> was pirated
                    in Holland, and for ten years a kind of joint issue made up with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Joιtrnal</hi><hi rend="italic">des Trévoux</hi> appeared at
                    Amsterdam. From 1764 to 1775 miscellaneous articles from different French and
                    English reviews were added to this reprint. Bayle, a born journalist and the
                    most able critic of the day, conceived the plan of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nouvelles de la République des Lettres</hi> (1684-1718), which at once became
                    entirely successful and obtained for him during the three years of his control
                    the dictatorship of the world of letters. Pie was succeeded as editor by La
                    Roque, Barrin, Bernard, and Leclerc. Bayle’s method was followed in an equally
                    meritorious periodical, the <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >des</hi><hi rend="italic">Ouvrages</hi><hi rend="italic">des Savants</hi>
                    (1687-1704) of H. Basnage de Beauval. Another continuator of Bayle was Jean
                    Leclerc, one of the most learned and acute critics of the 18th century, who
                    carried on three reviews, the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Universelle et
                    Historique</hi> (1686-93), the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Choisie</hi>
                    (1703-13), and the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Ancienne et Moderne</hi>
                    (1714-27). They form one series, and, besides valuable estimates of new books,
                    include original dissertations, articles, and biographies like our modern
                    learned magazines. The <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Littéraire</hi> (1713-22, 1729-36) was founded by a society of young men, who
                    made it a rule to discuss their contributions in common. Specially devoted to
                    English literature were the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Anglaise</hi> (1716-28), the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires Littéraires de la

                    Britannique</hi> (1733-34), and the <hi rend="italic">Journal Britannique</hi>
                    (1750-57) of Maty,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Matthew Maty, M.D., born in Holland, 1718, died principal librarian of the
                    British Museum, 1776. He settled in England in 1740, published several books,
                    and wrote the preface to Gibbon’s first work, <hi rend="italic">Étude de la
                    Littérature</hi>.</p></note> who took for his principle, “pour penser avec
                    liberté il faut penser seul.” One of these Dutch-printed reviews was <hi
                    rend="italic">L'Europe Savante</hi> (1718-20), founded chiefly by Themiseul de
                    Saint-Hyacinthe, with the intention of placing each separate department under
                    the care of a specialist. The <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Germanique</hi>
                    (1720-40) was established by Jacques Lenfant to do for northern Europe what the
                    <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Britannique</hi> did for England. It was followed
                    by the <hi rend="italic">Nouvelle</hi><hi rend="italic">Bibliotheqιιe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Germanique</hi> (1746-59). The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliotheqιιe</hi><hi rend="italic">Raisonnée des Ouvrages des Savants</hi>
                    (1728-58) was supplementary to Leclerc, and was succeeded by the <hi

                    rend="italic">et des Beaux-Arts</hi> (1754-80). Nearly all of the preceding were
                    produced either at Amsterdam or Rotterdam, and, although out of place in a
                    precise geographical arrangement, really belong to France by the close ties of
                    language and of blood.</p>
                <p>Taking up the exact chronological order again, we find the success of the English
                    essay-papers led to their prompt introduction to the Continent. An incomplete
                    translation of the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> was published at Amsterdam
                    in 1714, and many volumes of extracts from the <hi rend="italic">Tatter,
                    Spectator,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Guardian</hi> were issued in France early
                    in the 18th century. Marivaux brought out a <hi rend="italic">Spectateur
                    Français</hi> (1722), which was coldly received; it was followed by fourteen or
                    fifteen others under the titles of <hi rend="italic">La Spectatrice</hi> (1728-
                    30), <hi rend="italic">Le Radoteur</hi> (1775), <hi rend="italic">Le
                    Babillard</hi> (1778-79), &amp;c. Of a similar character was <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le Pour et le Contre</hi> (1723-40) of the abbé Prévost, which contained
                    anecdotes and criticism, with special reference to Great Britain. Throughout the
                    18th century, in France as in England, a favourite literary method was to write
                    of social subjects under the assumed character of a foreigner, generally an
                    Oriental, with the title of <hi rend="italic">Turkish Spy,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Lettres Chinoises,</hi> &amp;c. These productions were usually issued in
                    periodical form, and, besides an immense amount of worthless tittle-tattle,
                    contain some valuable matter.</p>
                <p>During the first half of the century France has little of importance to show in
                    periodical literature. The <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles Ecclésiastiques</hi>
                    (1728-1803) were first printed and circulated secretly by the Jansenists in
                    opposition to the <hi rend="italic">Constitution</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Unigenitus.</hi> The Jesuits retaliated with the <hi rend="italic">Supplément
                    des Nouvelles Ecclésiastiques</hi> (1734-48). The promising title may have had
                    something to do with the temporary success of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">Secrets</hi><hi rend="italic">de la République
                    des Lettres</hi> (1744-48) of the marquis d’Argens. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observations</hi><hi rend="italic">sur les Écrits Modernes</hi> (1735-43)
                    Desfontaines held the gates of Philistia for eight years against the
                    Encyclopaedists and even the redoubtable Voltaire himself. It was continued by
                    the <hi rend="italic">Jugements sur quelques Ouvrages nouveaux</hi> (1744-45).
                    The name of Fréron, perhaps the most vigorous enemy Voltaire ever encountered,
                    was long connected with <hi rend="italic">Lettres sur quelques Écrits de ce
                    Temps</hi> (1749- 54), followed by <hi rend="italic">L’Année Littéraire</hi>
                    (1754-90). Among the contributors of Fréron was another manufacturer of
                    criticism, the abbé de la Porte, who, having quarrelled with his confrère,
                    founded <hi rend="italic">Observations</hi><hi rend="italic">sur la

                <p>A number of special organs came into existence about this period. The first

                    a <hi rend="italic">Journal de Marine</hi> in 1778. We have already noticed
                    several journals specially devoted to one or other foreign literature. It was
                    left to Fréron, Grimm, Prevost, and others in 1754 to extend the idea to all
                    foreign productions, and the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Étranger</hi> (1754-62) was founded for this purpose. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gazette</hi><hi rend="italic">Littéraire</hi> (1764-66), which had Voltaire,
                    Diderot, and Saint-Lambert among its editors, was intended to swamp the small
                    fry of criticism; the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Dames</hi> (1759-78) was of
                    a light magazine class; and the <hi rend="italic">Journal de Monsieur</hi>
                    (1776-83) had three phases of existence, and died after extending to thirty
                    volumes. The <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">Secrets</hi><hi

                    furnish a minute account of the social and literary history for a period of
                    twenty-six years. Of a similar character was the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Correspondance Littéraire Secrète</hi> (1774-93), to which Métra was the chief
                    contributor. <hi rend="italic">L'Esprit des Journaux</hi> (1772-1818) forms an
                    important literary and historical collection, which is rarely to be found
                    complete.</p>
                <p>The movement of ideas at the close of the century may best be traced in the <hi

                    Linguet. The <hi rend="italic">Décade Philosophique</hi> (year V. or 1796/97),
                    founded by Ginguené, is the first periodical of the magazine class which
                    appeared after the storms of the Revolution. It was a kind of resurrection of
                    good taste; under the empire it formed the sole refuge of the opposition. By a
                    decree of 17th January 1800 the consulate reduced the number of Parisian
                    journals to thirteen, of which the <hi rend="italic">Décade</hi> was one; all
                    the others, with the exception of those dealing solely with science, art,

                    permitted to appear.</p>
                <p>Between 1815 and 1819 there was a constant struggle between freedom of thought on
                    the one hand and the censure, the police, and the law-officers on the other.
                    This oppression led to the device of “semi-periodical” publications, of which
                    <hi rend="italic">La Minerve Française</hi> (1818-20) is an instance. It was the
                    <hi rend="italic">Satire Ménippée</hi> of the Restoration, and was brought out
                    four times a year at irregular intervals. Of the same class was the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliothèque Historique</hi> (1818- 20), another anti-royalist
                    organ. The censure was re-established in 1820 and abolished in 1828 with the
                    monopoly. It has always seemed impossible to carry on successfully in France a
                    review upon the lines of those which have become so numerous and important in
                    England. The short-lived <hi rend="italic">Revue Française</hi> (1828-30),
                    founded by Guizot, Rémusat, De Broglie, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >doctrinaires,</hi> was an attempt in this direction. The well-known <hi
                    rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes</hi> was established in 1829 by
                    Ségur-Dupeyron and Mauroy, but it ceased to appear at the end of the year, and
                    its actual existence dates from its acquisition in 1831 by François Buloz,<note

                    its contributors, for whom it has been styled the “vestibule of the Academy.” It

                    literary journal in Germany is to be found in the <hi rend="italic">Erbauliche
                    Monatsunterredungen</hi> (1663) of the poet Johann Rist and in the <hi

                    >medico</hi><hi rend="italic">-physica</hi> (1670-1704) of the Academia naturae
                    curiosorum Leopoldina-Carolina, the first scientific annual, uniting the
                    features of the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Savants</hi> and of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions.</hi> D. G. Morhof, the author of the
                    well-known <hi rend="italic">Polyhistor,</hi> conceived the idea of a monthly
                    serial to be devoted to the history of modern books and learning, which came to
                    nothing. While professor of morals at Leipsic, Otto Mencke planned tlιe <hi
                    rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi rend="italic">Eruditorum,</hi> with a view to make
                    known, by means of analyses, extracts, and reviews, the new works produced
                    throughout Europe. In 1680 he travelled in England and Holland in order to
                    obtain literary assistance, and the first number appeared in 1682, under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi rend="italic">Eruditorum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Liρsiensium,</hi> and, like its successors, was written in Latin.
                    Among the contributors to subsequent numbers were Leibnitz, Seckendorf, and
                    Cellarius. A volume came out each year, with supplements. After editing about 30
                    volumes Mencke died, leaving the publication to his son, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Acta</hi> remained in the possession of the family down to 1745,
                    when they extended to 117 volumes, which form an extremely valuable history of
                    the learning of the period. A selection of the dissertations and articles was
                    published at Venice in 7 vols. 4to, 1740. The <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi> soon
                    had imitators. The <hi rend="italic">Ephemerides Litterariae</hi> (1686) came
                    out at Hamburg in Latin and French. The <hi rend="italic">Nova
                    Litteraria</hi><hi rend="italic">maris</hi><hi rend="italic">Balthici</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et Septentrionis</hi> (1698- 1708) was more especially devoted to
                    north Germany and the universities of Kiel, Rostock, and Dorpat. Supplementary
                    to the preceding was the <hi rend="italic">Nova Litteraria Germanise</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">collecta</hi><hi rend="italic">Hambnrgi(Tl03-9'),</hi> which from
                    1707 widened its field of view to the whole of Europe. At Leipsic was produced
                    the <hi rend="italic">Teutsche Acta</hi><hi rend="italic">Eruditorum</hi>
                    (1712), an excellent periodical, edited by J. G. Rabener and C. G. Jocher, and

                    himself in the vernacular, to defend his novel theories against the alarmed
                    pedantry of Germany, and, together with Strahl, Buddeus, and others, <hi

                    rend="italic">litterariam spectantes</hi> (1700), written in Latin. W. E. Tenzel
                    also published <hi rend="italic">Monatliche Unterredungen</hi> (1689-98),
                    continued from 1704 as <hi rend="italic">Curieuse</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliothek,</hi> and treating various subjects in dialogue form. After the
                    death of Tenzel the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothek</hi> was carried on under
                    different titles by C. Woltereck, J. G. Krause, and others, down to 1721. Of
                    much greater importance than these was the <hi rend="italic">Monatlicher
                    Auszug</hi> (1701), supported by J. G. Eccard and Leibnitz. Another periodical
                    on Thomasius’s plan was <hi rend="italic">Neue Unterredungen</hi> (1702), edited
                    by N. H. Gundling. The <hi rend="italic">Gιιndlingiana</hi> of the latter

                <p>Nearly all departments of learning possessed their several special periodical

                <p>Down to the early part of the 18th century Halle and Leipsic were the
                    headquarters of literary journalism in Germany. Other centres began to feel the
                    need of similar organs of opinion. Hamburg had its <hi rend="italic"
                    >Niedersächsische neue Zeitungen,</hi> styled from 1731 <hi rend="italic"
                    >Niedersächsische Nachrichten,</hi> which came to an end in 1736, and
                    Mecklenburg owned in 1710 its <hi rend="italic">Neuer Vorrath,</hi> besides
                    others brought out at Rostock. Prussia owes the foundation of its literary
                    periodicals to G. P. Schulze and Μ. Lilienthal, the former of whom began with
                    <hi rend="italic">Gelehrtes Preussen</hi> (1722), continued under different
                    titles down to 1729; the latter helped with the <hi rend="italic">Erläutertes
                    Preussen</hi> (1724), and was the sole editor of the <hi rend="italic">Acta
                    Borussica</hi> (1730-32). Pomerania and Silesia also had their special
                    periodicals in the first quarter of the 18th century. Franconia commenced with
                    <hi rend="italic">Nova Litteraria,</hi> and Hesse with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kurze Historie,</hi> both in 1725. In south Germany appeared the <hi

                    rend="italic">Parnassus Boicus,</hi> first published at Munich in 1722. The <hi

                    >Vermischte Bibliothek</hi> (1718-20), and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliotheca</hi><hi rend="italic">Novissima</hi> (1718- 21), both founded by J.
                    G. Francke in Halle. Shortly after the foundation of the university of Göttingen
                    appeared <hi rend="italic">Zeitungen</hi><hi rend="italic">von</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">gelehrten</hi><hi rend="italic">Sachsen</hi> (1739), still famous
                    as the <hi rend="italic">Göttingische</hi><hi rend="italic">gelehrte
                    Anzeigen,</hi> which during its long and influential career has been conducted
                    by professors of that university, and among others by Haller, Heyne, and
                    Eichhorn.</p>
                <p>Influenced by a close study of English writers, the two Swiss Bodmer and
                    Breitinger established Die <hi rend="italic">Discurse</hi><hi rend="italic">der
                    Maler</hi> (1721), and, by paying more attention to the matter of works reviewed
                    than to their manner, commenced a critical method new to Germany. The system was
                    attacked by Gottsched, who, educated in the French school, erred in the opposite
                    direction. The war between the two parties gave fresh life to the literature of
                    the country, but German criticism of the higher sort can only be said really to
                    begin with Lessing. The Berlin publisher Nicolai founded the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften,</hi> and afterwards handed it over to C.
                    F. Weisse in order to give his whole energy to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Briefe,</hi><hi rend="italic">die</hi><hi rend="italic">neueste Literatur
                    betreffend</hi> (1759-65), carried on by the help of Lessing, Mendelssohn, and
                    Abbt. To Nicolai is also due the <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine deutsche
                    Bibliothek</hi> (1765-1806), which embraced a much wider field and soon became
                    extremely influential. Herder founded the <hi rend="italic">Kritische
                    Wälder</hi><hi rend="italic">in 1766.</hi><hi rend="italic">Der deutsche
                    Merkur</hi> (1773-89, revived 1790-1810) of λVieland was the solitary
                    representative of the French school of criticism. A new era in German periodical
                    literature began when Bertuch brought out at Jena in 1785 the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Allgemeine Literaturzeitung,</hi> to which the leading writers of the country
                    were contributors. On being transferred to Halle in 1804 it was replaced by the
                    <hi rend="italic">Jenaische</hi><hi rend="italic">allgemeine
                    Literaturzeitung,</hi> founded by Eichstädt. Both reviews enjoyed a prosperous
                    career down to the year 1848.</p>
                <p>At the commencement of the present century we find the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Erlanger</hi><hi rend="italic">Literaturzeitung</hi> (1799-1810), which had
                    replaced a <hi rend="italic">Gelehrte Zeitung</hi> (1746); <hi rend="italic"
                    >One</hi><hi rend="italic">Leipziger Literaturzeitung</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >{1866-84')</hi>; the <hi rend="italic">Heidelbergische</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Jahrbücher der Literatur</hi> (1808); and the <hi rend="italic">Wisner</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Literaturzeitung</hi> (1813-16), followed by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wiener</hi><hi rend="italic">Jahrbücher der Literatur</hi> (±818- 48), both of
                    which received Government support and were like the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly
                    Review</hi> in their Conservative politics and high literary tone. <hi
                    rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> founded at Leipsic in 1819 by W. T. Krug, was
                    distinguished for its erudition, and came out down to 1831. One of the most
                    remarkable periodicals of this class was the <hi rend="italic">Jahrbücher für
                    wissenschaftliche Kritik</hi> (1827-46), first published by Cotta. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Hallische Jahrbücher</hi> (1838-42) was founded by Rüge and
                    Echter-meyer, and supported by the Government. The <hi rend="italic">Repertorium
                    der gesammten deutschen Literatur,</hi> established by Gersdorf in 1834, and
                    known after 1843 as the <hi rend="italic">Leipziger Repertorium der deutschen
                    und ausländischen Literatur,</hi> existed to 1860. Buchner founded the <hi
                    rend="italic">Literarische Zeitung</hi> at Berlin in 1834. It was continued by
                    Brandes down to 1849. The political troubles of 1848 and 1849 were most
                    disastrous to the welfare of the literary and miscellaneous periodicals.
                    Gersdorf s <hi rend="italic">Repertorium ,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gelehrte</hi><hi rend="italic">A nzeigem</hi> of Göttingen and of Munich, and
                    the Heidelberg <hi rend="italic">Jahrbücher</hi> were the sole survivors. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine Monatschrift für Literatur</hi> (1850), conducted
                    after 1851 by Droysen, Nitzsch, and others, continued only down to 1854; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Literarisches Centralblatt</hi> (1850) had a longer existence. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Blätter für literarische Unterhaltung</hi> sprang out of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Literarisches Wochenblatt</hi> (1818), founded by Kotzebue;
                    since 1865 it has been edited by R. Gottschall with considerable success. Many
                    of the literary journals did not disdain to occupy themselves with the fashions,
                    but the first periodical of any merit specially devoted to the subject was the
                    <hi rend="italic">Bazar</hi> (1855). The first to popularize science was <hi
                    rend="italic">Natur</hi> (1852). The <hi rend="italic">Hausblätter</hi> (1855),
                    a bi-monthly magazine, was extremely successful. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salon</hi> (1868) followed more closely the type of the English magazine.</p>
                <p>About this period arose a great number of serials for popular reading, known as
                    “Sontagsblätter,” of which the <hi rend="italic">Gartenlaube</hi> (1858) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Daheim</hi> are examples. Of a more solid character are the <hi
                    rend="italic">Deutsches Museum</hi> (1851-57) of Prutz and Frenzel; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Grenzboten</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Preussische Jahrbücher</hi> (1858); the <hi rend="italic">Berliner Revue</hi>
                    (1855); <hi rend="italic">Unsere Zeit</hi> (1857), at first only a kind of
                    supplement to Brockhaus’s <hi rend="italic">Conversationslexikon,</hi> but now
                    an important review of matters of contemporary interest; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Gegenwart</hi> (1872); the new <hi rend="italic"
                    >Literaturzeitung</hi> (1874) of Jena; the <hi rend="italic">Deutschs
                    Rundschau</hi> (1874), conducted upon the method of the <hi rend="italic">Revue
                    des Deux Mondes</hi>; and many others.</p>
                <p>Periodicals have been specialized in Germany to an extent perhaps unequalled in
                    any other country. Those of a really high class have become so numerous and form
                    so marked a feature in the current literature that it may be useful to give a
                    classified list of the chief of them, including the many <hi rend="italic"

                    Helvetica</hi> (1703-15) of Zurich is the earliest literary periodical which
                    Switzerland can show. From 1728 to 1734 a <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque
                    Italique,</hi> and towards the end of the century the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliothèque Britannique</hi> (1796-1815), dealing with agriculture,
                    literature, and science, in three separate series, were published at Geneva. The
                    latter was followed by what still remains the leading periodical of
                    French-speaking Switzerland, the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Universelle</hi>
                    (1816), which also has a scientific and a literary series. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Revue Suisse</hi> (1838) was produced at Neuchâtel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Italy.—</hi> Prompted by Μ. A. Ricci, Francesco Nazzari, the
                    future cardinal, established in 1668 the <hi rend="italic">Giornale de’
                    Letterati</hi> upon the plan of the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Savants.</hi>
                    His collaborateurs each agreed to undertake the criticism of a separate
                    literature, while Nazzari retained the general editorship and the analysis of
                    the French books. The journal was continued to 1675, and another series was
                    carried on to 1769. Bacchini brought out at Parma (1688-90) and at Modena
                    (1692-97) a periodical with a similar title. A much better known <hi
                    rend="italic">Giomale</hi> was that of Apostolo Zeno, founded with the help of
                    Maffei and Muratori (1710), continued after 1718 by Pietro Zeno, and after 1728
                    by Mastraca and Paitoni. Another <hi rend="italic">Giornale,</hi> to which
                    Fabroni contributed, was published at Pisa in 1771; it has been continued almost
                    down to our own times. The <hi rend="italic">Galleria di Minerva</hi> was first
                    published at Venice in 1696. One of the many merits of the antiquary Lami was
                    his connexion with the <hi rend="italic">Novelle</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Letterarie</hi> (1740-70), founded by him, and after the first two years almost
                    entirely written by him. Its learning and impartiality gave it much authority.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Frusta Letteraria</hi> (1763-65) was brought out at Venice
                    by Giuseppe Baretti under the pseudonym of Aristarco Scannabue. The next that
                    deserve mention are the <hi rend="italic">Giornale Enci-clopedieo</hi> (1806) of
                    Naples, followed by the <hi rend="italic">Progresso</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >delle</hi><hi rend="italic">Seienze</hi> (1833-48) and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Museo</hi><hi rend="italic">di Seienze e Letteratura</hi> of the same city, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Giornale</hi><hi rend="italic">Arcadico</hi> (1819) of
                    Rome. Among the contributors to the <hi rend="italic">Poligrafo</hi> (1811) of
                    Milan were Monti, Perticari, and some of the first names in Italian literature.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Biblioteca Italiana</hi> (1816-40) was founded at Milan by
                    the favour of the Austrian Government, and the editorship was offered to and
                    declined by Ugo Foscolo. It rendered service to Italian literature by its
                    opposition to the Della-Cruscan tyranny. Another Milanese serial was the <hi
                    rend="italic">Conciliatore</hi> (1818-20), which, although it only lived two
                    years, will be remembered for the endeavours made by Silvio Peìlico, Camillo
                    Ugoni, and its other contributors to introduce a more dignified and courageous
                    method of criticism. After its suppression and the falling off in interest of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Biblioteca Italiana</hi> the next of any merit to appear
                    was the <hi rend="italic">Antologia,</hi> a monthly periodical brought out at
                    Florence in 1820 by Gino Capponi and Giampetro Vieusseux, but suppressed in 1833
                    on account of an epigram of Tommaseo, a principal writer. Some striking papers
                    were contributed by Giuseppe Mazzini. Naples had in 1832 <hi rend="italic"
                    >II</hi><hi rend="italic">Progresso</hi> of Carlo Troya, helped by Tommaseo and
                    Centofanti, and Palermo owned the <hi rend="italic">Giornale di Statistica</hi>
                    (1834), suppressed eight years later. The <hi rend="italic">Arehivio
                    Storico,</hi> consisting of reprints of documents with historical dissertations,
                    dates from 1842, and was founded by Vieusseux and Gino Capponi. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Civiltà Cattolica</hi> (1850) is still the organ of the Jesuits.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Rivista</hi><hi rend="italic">Contemporanea</hi> (1852)
                    was founded at Turin in emulation of the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux
                    Mondes,</hi> which has been the type followed by so many Continental
                    periodicals; it still appears. The <hi rend="italic">Politecnico</hi> (1839) of
                    Milan was suppressed in 1844 and revived in 1859. The <hi rend="italic">Nuova
                    Antologia</hi> (1866) has already acquired a well-deserved reputation as a
                    high-class review and magazine. Its rival, the <hi rend="italic">Rivista
                    Europea,</hi> is now considered the special organ of the Florentine men of
                    letters. The <hi rend="italic">Rassegna Settinwιnale</hi> was a weekly political
                    and literary review, which after eight years of existence gave place to a daily
                    newspaper, the <hi rend="italic">Rassegna.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Arehivio
                    Trentino</hi> (1882) is the organ of “Italia Irredenta.” The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rassegna</hi><hi rend="italic">Nationale,</hi> conducted by the marchese
                    Manffedo di Passano, a chief of the moderate clerical party, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nuova Rivista</hi> of Turin, the <hi rend="italic">Fanfulla della
                    Domenica,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Gazzetta Letteraria</hi> may also be
                    mentioned. During the last few years Italy has been showing such vigour in her
                    periodical literature that it may be worth while to append the titles of the
                    chief of those which are now appearing: <hi rend="italic">Annali</hi><hi

                    scientific, 19 administrative, 20 humorous, &amp;c. showing a total of 416. Ten

                    propagandist centre for the philosophical party. In the same city was also first

                    (1788-90) was founded at Luxemburg by the Jesuit De Feller; having been
                    suppressed there, it was transferred to Liège, and subsequently to Maestricht.
                    It is one of the most curious of the Belgian periodicals of the 18th century,
                    and contains most precious materials for the national history. A complete set is
                    very rare and much sought after. The <hi rend="italic">Revue Beige</hi>
                    (1835-43), in spite of the support of the best writers of the kingdom, its
                    successor the <hi rend="italic">Revue de Liége</hi> (1844-47), the <hi

                    rend="italic">Revue de Belgiqτιe</hi> (1846-51) were all shortlived. The <hi

                    the clergy, had a longer career. The <hi rend="italic">Revue</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Nationale</hi> was the champion of Liberalism, and came to an end
                    in 1847. The <hi rend="italic">Messager</hi><hi rend="italic">des

                    Ghent, has been much more successful, and is in repute on account of its

                    rend="italic">Catholique</hi> is also still published by the professors of the
                    university of Louvain. In 1846 it began a controversy with the <hi rend="italic"

                    upon the origin of human knowledge, which lasted for many years and excited

                <p>Spurred by the success of the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</hi> in
                    England, Benjamin Franklin printed and published the earliest miscellany in
                    America, under the title of the <hi rend="italic">General Magazine</hi> (1741),
                    at Philadelphia, which, owing to want of support, expired after six monthly
                    numbers had appeared. Franklin’s rival, John Webbe, brought out in opposition
                    the <hi rend="italic">American Magazine</hi> (1741), which ran only to two
                    numbers. Further attempts at Philadelphia in 1757 and 1769 to revive periodicals
                    with the same name were both fruitless. The other pre-revolutionary magazines
                    were the Boston <hi rend="italic">American Magazine</hi> (1743-47), in imitation
                    of the <hi rend="italic">London Magazine;</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Boston
                    Weekly Magazine</hi> (1743); the <hi rend="italic">Christian History</hi> (1743-
                    44); the New York <hi rend="italic">Independent Reflector</hi> (1752-54); the
                    <hi rend="italic">New England Magazine</hi> (1758-60), a collection of fugitive
                    pieces; the Boston <hi rend="italic">Royal American Magazine</hi> (1774-75); and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Pennsylvania Magazine</hi> (1775-76), which, founded by R.
                    Aitken, with the help of Thomas Paine, came to an untimely end upon the
                    commencement of the war. The <hi rend="italic">Columbian Magazine</hi> (1786-90)
                    was continued as the <hi rend="italic">Universal Asylum</hi> (1790-92). Matthew
                    Carey brought out the <hi rend="italic">American Museum</hi> in 1787, and it
                    lasted until 1792. Five or six more magazines ran out a brief existence before
                    the end of the century. One of the most successful of them was the <hi
                    rend="italic">Farmer’s Museum</hi> (1793-99), supported by perhaps the most
                    brilliant staff of writers American periodical literature had yet been able to
                    show, and edited by Dennie, who in 1801 commenced the publication of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Portfolio,</hi> carried on to 1827 at Philadelphia. For five years
                    it was a weekly miscellany in quarto, and afterwards an octavo monthly; it was
                    the first American serial which could boast of so long an existence. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Literary Magazine</hi> (1803-8) was established at Philadelphia by
                    C. B. Brown, who, with Dennie, may be considered as having been the first
                    American professional man of letters. The Anthology Club was founded at Boston
                    in 1803 by Phineas Adams for the cultivation of literature and the discussion of
                    philosophy. Ticknor, Everett, and Bigelow were among the members, and were
                    contributors to the organ of the club, the <hi rend="italic">Monthly A
                    nthology</hi> (1803-11), the forerunner of the <hi rend="italic">North American
                    Review.</hi> In the year 1810 Thomas <hi rend="italic">{Printing in
                    America,</hi> ii. 292) informs us that 27 periodicals were issued in the United
                    States. The first serious rival of the <hi rend="italic">Portfolio</hi> was the
                    <hi rend="italic">Analectic Magazine</hi> (1813-20), founded at Philadelphia by
                    Moses Thomas, with the literary assistance of W. Irving (for some time the
                    editor), Paulding, and the ornithologist Wilson. In spite of a large
                    subscription list it came to an end on account of the costly style of its
                    production. The first southern serial was the <hi rend="italic">Monthly
                    Register</hi> (1805) of Charleston. New York possessed no periodical worthy of
                    the city until 1824, when the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Magazine</hi> appeared,
                    which changed its name shortly afterwards to the <hi rend="italic">New York
                    Monthly Review,</hi> and was supported by R. C. Sands and W. C. Bryant. For many
                    years <hi rend="italic">Graham’s Magazine</hi> was the leading popular
                    miscellany in the country, reaching at one time a circulation of about 35,000
                    copies. The first western periodical was the <hi rend="italic">Illinois Monthly
                    Magazine</hi> (1830-32), published, owned, edited, and almost entirely written
                    by James Hall, who followed with his <hi rend="italic">Western Monthly
                    Magazine</hi> (1833-36), produced in a similar manner. In 1833 the novelist C.
                    F. Hoffman founded at New York <hi rend="italic">The Knickerbocker</hi>
                    (1833-60), which soon passed under the control of Timothy Flint and became
                    extremely successful, most of the leading native writers of the next twenty
                    years having been contributors. Equally popular was <hi rend="italic">Putnam's
                    Monthly Magazine</hi> (1853-57,1867-69). The <hi rend="italic">Dial</hi>
                    (1841-44), Boston, the organ of the transcendentalists, was first edited by
                    Margaret Fuller, and subsequently by R. W. Emerson and G. Ripley. Among other
                    extinct magazines may be mentioned the <hi rend="italic">American Monthly
                    Magazine</hi> (1833-38), the <hi rend="italic">Southern Literary Messenger</hi>
                    (1834), Richmond, the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman's Magazine</hi> (1837-40), and
                    the <hi rend="italic">International Magazine</hi> (1850-52), edited by R. W.
                    Griswold. The <hi rend="italic">Yale Literary Magazine</hi> dates from 1836. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Merchants' Magazine</hi> was united in 1871 with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Commercial and Financial Chronicle.</hi> Foremost among existing
                    magazines come <hi rend="italic">Harper's Monthly Magazine</hi> (1850) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Scribner’s Monthly</hi> (1870), now <hi rend="italic">The
                    Century,</hi> both famous for their unrivalled woodengraving and literary
                    excellence. Within the last few years the circulation of these two periodicals
                    has increased to a remarkable degree both at home and abroad. Not less admirable
                    in their way are the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi> (1857), <hi
                    rend="italic">Lippincott's Magazine,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Manhattan.</hi></p>
                <p>The first attempt to carry on an American review was made by Robert Walsh in 1811
                    at Philadelphia with the <hi rend="italic">American Review of History and
                    Politics,</hi> which lasted only a couple of years. Still more brief was the
                    existence of the <hi rend="italic">General Repository and Review</hi> (1812),
                    brought out at Cambridge by Andrews Norton with the help of the professors of
                    the university, but of which only four numbers appeared. Niles’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Weekly Register</hi> (1811-48) was political, historical, and
                    literary. The <hi rend="italic">North American Review,</hi> the oldest and most
                    prosperous of all the American reviews, dates from 1815, and was founded by
                    William Tudor, a member of the previously, mentioned Anthology Club. After two
                    years’ control Tudor handed over the review to the club, then styled the North
                    American Club, whose most active members were E. T. Channing, R. H. Dana, and
                    Jared Sparks. On his return from Europe in 1819 E. Everett became the editor;
                    his elder brother Alexander acquired the property in 1829. The roll of the
                    contributors to this review numbers almost every American writer of note. Since
                    January 1879 it has been published monthly. The <hi rend="italic">American
                    Quarterly Review</hi> (1827- 37), established at Philadelphia by Robert Walsh,
                    came to an end on his departure for Europe. The <hi rend="italic">Southern
                    Review</hi> (1828-32), conducted by H. Legare, S. Elliott, and G. W. Simms in
                    defence of the politics and finance of the South, enjoyed a shorter career. It
                    was resuscitated in 1842, and lived another ten years. These two were followed
                    by the <hi rend="italic">Democratic Review</hi> (1838-52), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >American Review,</hi> afterwards the <hi rend="italic">American Whig
                    Review</hi> (1845-52), the <hi rend="italic">Massachusetts Quarterly Review</hi>
                    (1847-50), and a few more. The <hi rend="italic">New Englander</hi> (1843), the
                    <hi rend="italic">Biblical Repertory and Princeton Review</hi> (1825), and the
                    <hi rend="italic">National Quarterly Review</hi> (1860) are still published. The
                    critical weeklies of the past include the New York <hi rend="italic">Literary
                    Gazette</hi> (1834-35, 1839), <hi rend="italic">De Bow’s Review</hi> (1846), the
                    <hi rend="italic">Literary World</hi> (1847-53), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Criterion</hi> (1855-56), the <hi rend="italic">Round Table</hi> (1863- 64),
                    the <hi rend="italic">Citizen</hi> (1864-73), and <hi rend="italic">Appleton's
                    Journal</hi> (1869). The leading weeklies of the day include the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nation</hi> (1865), the <hi rend="italic">Literary World</hi>
                    (1870), and the <hi rend="italic">Critic</hi> (1881).</p>
                <p>Religious periodicals have been extremely numerous in the United States during
                    the last hundred years. The earliest was the <hi rend="italic">Theological
                    Magazine</hi> (1796-98). The <hi rend="italic">Christian Examiner</hi> dates
                    from 1824 and lasted down to 1870. The <hi rend="italic">Panoplist</hi> (1805),
                    changed to the <hi rend="italic">Missionary Herald,</hi> still represents the
                    American Board of Missions. The <hi rend="italic">Methodiet Magazine</hi> dates
                    from 1818 and the <hi rend="italic">Christian Disciple</hi> from 1813. The <hi
                    rend="italic">American Biblical Repository</hi> (1831-50), a quarterly, was
                    united with the Andover <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Sacra</hi> (1843) and with
                    the <hi rend="italic">Theological Eclectic</hi> (1865). <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brownson's Quarterly Review</hi> began as the <hi rend="italic">Boston
                    Quarterly Review</hi> in 1838, and did much to introduce to American readers the
                    works of the modern French philosophical school. Among more recent serials of
                    this class we may notice the <hi rend="italic">Protestant Episcopal Quarterly
                    Review</hi> (1854), the <hi rend="italic">Presbyterian Magazine</hi> (1851-60),
                    the <hi rend="italic">Catholic World</hi> (1865), the <hi rend="italic">Southern
                    Review</hi> (1867), the <hi rend="italic">New Jerusalem Magazine</hi> (1827),
                    <hi rend="italic">American Baptist Magazine</hi> (1817), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Church Review</hi> (1848), the <hi rend="italic">Christian Review</hi> (1836),
                    the <hi rend="italic">Universalist Quarterly</hi> (1844). Among historical
                    periodicals may be numbered the <hi rend="italic">American Register</hi>
                    (1806-11), Stryker’s <hi rend="italic">American Register</hi> (1848- 51),
                    Edwards’s <hi rend="italic">American Quarterly Register</hi> (1829-43), the <hi
                    rend="italic">New England Historical and Genealogical Register</hi> (1847),
                    Folsom’s <hi rend="italic">Historical Magazine</hi> (1857), the <hi
                    rend="italic">New York Genealogical Record</hi> (1869), and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Magazine of American History</hi> (1877).</p>
                <p>For many years the leading English periodicals have been regularly reprinted in
                    the United States, and many serial publications have been almost entirely made
                    up of extracts from English sources. Perhaps the earliest example is to be found
                    in <hi rend="italic">Select Views of Literature</hi> (1811-12). The <hi
                    rend="italic">Eclectic Magazine</hi> (1844) and <hi rend="italic">Littell's
                    Living Age</hi> (1844) are still published.</p>
                <p>In 1817 America possessed only one scientific periodical, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal of Mineralogy.</hi> Professor Silliman established the journal known by
                    his name in 1818. Since that time the <hi rend="italic">American Journal of
                    Science</hi> has enjoyed unceasing favour. Among other special periodicals of
                    the day may be mentioned the <hi rend="italic">American Naturalist,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">American Journal of the Medical Sciences,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">American Journal of Speculative Philosophy,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">American Journal of Philology,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">American

                    rend="italic">Index</hi><hi rend="italic">Medicus,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal of the Franklin Institute.</hi></p>
                <p>The number of periodicals devoted to light literature and to female readers has
                    been, and still remains, extremely large. The earliest in the latter class λvas
                    the <hi rend="italic">Lady's Magazine</hi> (1792) of Philadelphia. The name of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Lowell Offering</hi> (1841), written chiefly by factory
                    girls, is λvell known in England. <hi rend="italic">Godey’s Ladies’ Book</hi> is
                    still issued. Children’s magazines originated with the <hi rend="italic">Young
                    Missed Magazine</hi> (1806) of Brooklyn; <hi rend="italic">St Nicholas</hi> is a

                <p>The following estimate of the number of periodicals now appearing in the United
                    States is taken from G. P. Rowell and Co. s <hi rend="italic">American Newspaper
                    Record</hi> (1883). Weeklies, and those published more frequently than once a
                    week, are omitted on account of the difficulty of distinguishing them from
                    newspapers. The numbers given are—bi-weeklies 47, semi-monthlies 175, monthlies
                    1034, bi-monthlies 12, quarterlies 59; total 1327.</p>
