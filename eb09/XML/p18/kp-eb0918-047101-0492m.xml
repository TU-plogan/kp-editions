                <p><label type="entry">PELAGIUS</label>. Of the origin of Pelagius almost nothing is
                    known. The name is supposed to be a Graecized form of the Cymric <hi
                    rend="italic">Morgan (muir</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> sea; <hi
                    rend="italic">gin,</hi> begotten). His contemporaries understood that he was of
                    British birth, and gave him the distinctive appellation <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brito.</hi> He was a large ponderous person, heavy both in body and mind, if we
                    are to believe Jerome (“stolidissimus et Scotorum pultibus praegravatus”). Born
                    during the second half of the 4th century, he was influenced by the monastic
                    enthusiasm which had been kindled in Gaul by Athanasius (336), and which,
                    through the energy of Martin of Tours (361), rapidly communicated itself to the
                    Britons and Scots. For, though Pelagius remained a layman throughout his life,
                    and though he never appears in any strict connexion with a caenobitical
                    fraternity, he yet adhered to monastic discipline (“veluti monachus ”), and
                    distinguished himself by his purity of life and exceptional sanctity (“egregie
                    Christianus ”). He seems to have been one of the earliest, if not the very
                    earliest, of that remarkable series of men who issued from the monasteries of
                    Scotland and Ireland and carried back to the Continent in a purified form the
                    religion they had received from it. Coming to Rome in the beginning of the 5th
                    century (his earliest known writing is of date 405), he found a scandalously low
                    tone of morality prevalent. From his extant <hi rend="italic">Commentaries on
                    the Epistles of St Paul</hi> it may be gathered that men were encouraged to rely
                    on a profession of the Christian creed, and on the magical efficacy of the
                    sacraments, while they entirely neglected to cultivate a Christian character.
                    This state of things Pelagius denounced. But his remonstrances were met by the
                    plea of human weakness (“durum est, arduum est, non possumus, homines sumus,
                    fragili carne circumdati ”). To remove this plea by exhibiting the actual powers
                    of human nature became his first object. It seemed to him that the Augustinian
                    doctrine of total depravity and of the consequent bondage of the will both cut
                    the sinew of all human effort and threw upon God the blame which really belonged
                    to man. Unless men had the power to do God’s will, it was vain for Him to
                    declare it. And, if men believed they were incapable of virtue, they would make
                    no effort to reach it. His favourite maxim was, “If I ought, I can.”
                    Accordingly, he expressed unmeasured disapproval when he heard a bishop at Rome
                    quoting with approbation the characteristic words of Augustine: “Give what Thou
                    commandes!, and command what Thou wilt.”</p>
                <p>The views of Pelagius did not originate in a conscious reaction against the
                    influence of the Augustinian theology, although each of these systems was
                    developed into its ultimate form by the opposition of the other. Neither must
                    too much weight be allowed to the circumstance that Pelagius was a monk, for he
                    was unquestionably alive to the delusive character of much that passed for
                    monkish sanctity. Yet possibly his monastic training may have led him to look
                    more at conduct than at character, and to believe that holiness could be arrived
                    at by rigour of discipline. This view of things suited his natural temperament,
                    which was essentially matter-of-fact and somewhat shallow. Judging from the
                    general style of his writings, his religious development had been equable and
                    peaceful, not marked by the prolonged mental conflict, the spiritual turmoil,
                    the hand-to-hand wrestling with God, the abrupt transitions, which characterized
                    the experience of his great opponent. With no great depth of mind, he saw very
                    clearly the thing before him, and many of his practical counsels are marked by
                    sagacity, and are expressed with the succinctness of a proverb (“corpus non
                    frangendum, sed regendum est ”). His interests were primarily ethical; hence his
                    insistence on the freedom of the will and his limitation of the action of divine
                    grace.</p>
                <p>The peculiar tenets of Pelagius, though indicated in the commentaries which he
                    published at Rome previous to 409, might not so speedily have attracted
                    attention had they not been adopted by Coelestius, a much younger and bolder man
                    than his teacher. Coelestius had been trained as a lawyer, but abandoned his
                    profession for an ascetic life. When Rome was sacked by the Goths (410) the two
                    friends crossed to Africa. There Pelagius once or twice met with Augustine, but
                    very shortly sailed for Palestine, where he justly expected his opinions would
                    be more cordially received. Coelestius remained in Carthage with the view of
                    receiving ordination. But Aurelius, bishop of Carthage, being warned against
                    him, summoned a synod, at which Paulinus, a deacon of Milan, charged Coelestius
                    with holding the following six errors:—(1) that Adam would have died even if he
                    had not sinned; (2) that the sin of Adam injured himself alone, not the human
                    race; (3) that new-born children are in the same condition in which Adam was
                    before the fall; (4) that the whole human race does not die because of Adam’s
                    death or sin, nçr will the race rise again because of the resurrection of
                    Christ; (5) that the law gives entrance to heaven as well as the gospel; (6)
                    that even before the coming of Christ there were men who were entirely without
                    sin. To these propositions a 7th is sometimes added, “that infants, though
                    unbaptized, have eternal life,” a corollary from the third. Coelestius did not
                    deny that he held these opinions, but he maintained that they were open
                    questions, on which the church had never pronounced. The synod, notwithstanding,
                    condemned and excommunicated him. Coelestius, after a futile appeal to Rome,
                    repaired to Ephesus, and there received ordination.</p>
                <p>In Palestine Pelagius lived unmolested and revered, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n493/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0493-0472"/> until in 415 Orosius, a Spanish priest, came from
                    Augustine to warn Jerome against him. The result was that in June of that year
                    Pelagius was cited before John, bishop of Jerusalem, and charged with holding
                    that man may be without sin, if only he desires it. This prosecution broke down,
                    and in December of the same year Pelagius was summoned before a synod of
                    fourteen bishops at Diospolis (Lydda). The prosecutors on this occasion were two
                    Gallican bishops, Heros of Arles and Lazarus of Aix, but on account of the
                    illness of one of them neither could appear. The proceedings, being conducted in
                    various languages and by means of interpreters, lacked certainty, and justified
                    Jerome’s application to the synod of the epithet “miserable.” But there is no
                    doubt that Pelagius repudiated the assertion of Caelestius, that “the divine
                    grace and help is not granted to individual acts, but consists in free will, and
                    in the giving of the law and instruction.” At the same time he affirmed that a
                    man is able, if he likes, to live without sin and keep the commandments of God,
                    inasmuch as God gives him this ability. The synod was satisfied with these
                    statements, and pronounced Pelagius to be in agreement with Catholic teaching.
                    Pelagius naturally plumed himself on his acquittal, and provoked Augustine to
                    give a detailed account of the synod, in which he shows that the language used
                    by Pelagius was ambiguous, but that, being interpreted by his previous written
                    statements, it involved a denial of what the church understood by <hi
                    rend="italic">grace</hi> and by man’s dependence on it. The North-African church
                    as a whole resented the decisions of Diospolis, and sent up from their synods of
                    Carthage and Mileve (416) an appeal to Innocent, bishop of Rome, who decided the
                    question in favour of the African synods on “the broad, popular, and
                    unanswerable ground that all Christian devotion implies the assistance of divine
                    grace, that it is admitted in every response of the service, in every act of
                    worship.” And, though his successor Zosimus wavered.for a time, influenced
                    partly by his Greek training, which led him to consider the points in dispute as
                    idle, and partly by the <hi rend="italic">Confession of Faith</hi> which
                    Pelagius had addressed to the see of Rome, he at length fell in with what he saw
                    to be the general mind of both the ecclesiastical and the civil powers. For,
                    simultaneously with the largely attended African synod which finally condemned
                    Pelagianism in the West, an imperial edict was issued at Ravenna on 30th April
                    418, peremptorily determining the theological question and enacting that not
                    only Pelagius and Caelestius but all who accept their opinions shall suffer
                    confiscation of goods and irrevocable banishment. Thus prompted, Zosimus drew up
                    a circular inviting all the bishops of Christendom to subscribe a condemnation
                    of Pelagian opinions. To this document signature was refused by nineteen Italian
                    bishops, among whom was Julian of Ec-lanum (Apulia), a man of good birth,
                    approved sanctity, and great capacity, who now became the recognized leader of
                    the movement. But not even his acuteness and zeal could redeem a cause which was
                    rendered hopeless when the Eastern Church (Ephesus, 431) confirmed the decision
                    of the West.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pelagianism.</hi></p>
                <p>The system of Pelagius is a consistent whole, each part involving the existence
                    of every other. Starting from the idea that “ability limits obligation,” and
                    resolved that men should feel their responsibility, he insisted that man is able
                    to do all that God commands, and that there is, and can be, no sin where the
                    will is not absolutely free,—able to choose good or evil. The favourite Pelagian
                    formula, “Si necessitatis est, peccatum non est; si voluntatis, vitari potest,”
                    has an appearance of finality which imposed on superficial minds. The theory of
                    the will involved in this fundamental axiom of Pelagianism is that which is
                    commonly known as the “liberty of indifference,” or “power of contrary
                    choice,”—a theory which affirms the freedom of the will, not in the sense that
                    the individual is self-determined, but in the sense that in each volition and at
                    each moment of life, no matter what the previous career of the individual has
                    been, the will is in equipoise, able to choose good or evil. We are born
                    characterless (non pleni), and with no bias towards good or evil (ut sine
                    virtute, ita et sine vitio). It follows that we are uninjured by the sin of
                    Adam, save in so far as the evil example of our predecessors misleads and
                    influences us (non propagine sed exemplo). There is, in fact, no such thing as
                    original sin, sin being a thing of will and not of nature; for if it could be of
                    nature our sin would be chargeable on God the creator. This will, capable of
                    good as of evil, being the natural endowment of man, is found in the heathen as
                    well as in the Christian, and the heathen may therefore perfectly keep such law
                    as they know. But, if all men have this natural ability to do and to be all that
                    is required for perfect righteousness, what becomes of grace, of the aid of the
                    Holy Spirit, and, in a word, of Christianity? Pelagius vacillates considerably
                    in his use of the word “grace.” Sometimes he makes it equivalent to natural
                    endowment. Indeed one of his most careful statements is to this effect: “We
                    distinguish three things—the ability, the will, the act (posse, veile, esse).
                    The ability is in nature, and must be referred to God, who has bestowed this on
                    His creature; the other two, the will and the act, must be referred to man,
                    because they flow from the fountain of free will” (Aug., <hi rend="italic">De
                    Gr. Christi,</hi> c. 4). But at other times he admits a much wider range to
                    grace, so as to make Augustine doubt whether his meaning is not, after all,
                    orthodox. But, when he speaks of grace “sanctifying,” “assisting,” and so forth,
                    it is only that man may “more easily” accomplish what he could with more
                    difficulty accomplish without grace. A decisive passage occurs in the letter he
                    sent to the see of Rome along with his <hi rend="italic">Confessio Fidei</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">:</hi> “We maintain that free will exists generally in all
                    mankind, in Christians, Jews, and Gentiles; they have all equally received it by
                    nature, but in Christians only is it assisted by grace. In others this good of
                    their original creation is naked and unarmed. They shall be judged and condemned
                    because, though possessed of free will, by which they might come to the faith
                    and merit the grace of God, they make an ill use of their freedom; while
                    Christians shall be rewarded because, by using their free will aright, they
                    merit the grace of the Lord and keep His commandments” <hi rend="italic"
                    >ζib.,</hi> c. 33, 34). Pelagius allowed to grace everything but the initial
                    determining movement towards salvation. He ascribed to the unassisted human will
                    power to accept and use the proffered salvation of Christ. It was at this point
                    his departure from the Catholic creed could be made apparent: Pelagius
                    maintains, expressly and by implication, that it is the human will which takes
                    the initiative, and is the determining factor in the salvation of the
                    individual; while the church maintains that it is the divine will that takes the
                    initiative by renewing and enabling the human will to accept and use the aid or
                    grace offered.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Semipelagianism.</hi></p>
                <p>It was easy for Augustine to show that this was an “impia opinio”; it was easy
                    for him to expose the defective character of a theory of the will which implied
                    that God was not holy because He is <hi rend="italic">necessarily</hi> holy; it
                    was easy for him to show that the positions of Pelagius were anti-Scriptural
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Augustine)</hi>; but, though his arguments prevailed,
                    they did not wholly convince, and the rise of Semipelagianism—an attempt to hold
                    a middle course between the harshness of Augustinianism and the obvious errors
                    of Pelagianism —is full of significance. This earnest and conciliatory movement
                    discovered itself simultaneously in North Africa and in southern Gaul. In the
                    former church, which naturally desired to adhere to the views of its own great
                    theologian, the monks of Adrumetum found themselves either sunk to the verge of
                    despair or provoked to licentiousness by his predestinarian teaching. When this
                    was reported to Augustine he wrote two elaborate treatises to show that when God
                    ordains the end He also ordains the means, and if any man is ordained to life
                    eternal he is thereby ordained to holiness and zealous effort. But meanwhile
                    some of the monks themselves had struck out a <hi rend="italic">via media</hi>
                    which ascribed to God sovereign grace and yet left intact man’s responsibility.
                    A similar scheme was adopted by Cassian of Marseilles (hence Semipelagians are
                    often spoken of as <hi rend="italic">MassilianF),</hi> and was afterwards ably
                    advocated by Vincent of Lerins and Faustus of Rhegium. These writers, in
                    opposition to Pelagius, maintained that man was damaged by the fall, and seemed
                    indeed disposed to purchase a certificate of orthodoxy by the abusive epithets
                    they heaped upon Pelagians (ranae, muscae inoriturae, &amp;c.). The differentia
                    of Semipelagianism is the tenet that in regeneration, and all that results from
                    it, the divine and the human will are co-operating (synergistic) coefficient
                    factors. After finding considerable acceptance, this theory was ultimately
                    condemned, because it retained the root-principle of Pelagianism,— that man has
                    some ability to will good and that the beginning of salvation <hi rend="italic"
                    >may</hi> be with man. The councils of Orange and Valence (529), however, which
                    condemned Semipelagianism, did so with the significant restriction that
                    predestination to evil was not to be taught,—a restriction so agreeable to the
                    general feeling of the church that, three centuries after, Gottschalk was
                    sentenced to be <pb break="no"

                    imprisoned for teaching reprobation. The questions raised by Pelagius
                    continually recur, but, without tracing the strife as sustained by Thomists and
                    Jansenists on the one side and the Jesuits and Arminians on the other, this
                    article can only indicate the general bearing of the controversy on society and
                    the church.</p>
                <p>The anthropology of Pelagius was essentially naturalistic. It threatened to
                    supersede grace by nature, to deny all immediate divine influence, and so to
                    make Christianity practically useless. Pelagius himself did not carry his
                    rationalism through to its issues; but the logical consequence of his system
                    was, as Augustine perceived, the denial of the atonement and other central
                    truths of revealed religion. And, while the Pelagians never existed as a sect
                    separate from the church catholic, yet wherever rationalism has infected any
                    part of the church there Pelagianism has sooner or later appeared; and the term
                    “Pelagian” has been continued to denote views which minimize the effects of the
                    fall and unduly magnify man’s natural ability. These views and tendencies have
                    appeared in theologies which are not in other respects rationalistic, as, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in Arminianism; and their presence in such theologies
                    is explained by the desire to remove everything which might seem to discourage
                    human effort.</p>
                <p>It is not easy to determine how far the vices which ate so deeply into the life
                    of the church of the Middle Ages were due to the sharpness with which some of
                    the severer features of the Augustinian theology were defined during the
                    Pelagian controversy. The pernicious belief in the magical efficacy of the
                    sacraments and the consequent defective ethical power of religion, the
                    superstitious eagerness to accept the church’s creed without examining or really
                    believing it, the falsity and cruelty engendered and propagated by the idea that
                    in the church’s cause all weapons were justifiable, these vices were undoubtedly
                    due to the belief that the visible church was the sole divinely-appointed
                    repository of grace. And the sharply-accentuated tone in which Augustinianism
                    affirmed man’s inability quickened the craving for that grace or direct agency
                    of God upon the soul which the church declared to be needful and administered
                    through her divinely-appointed persons and sacraments, and thus brought a
                    decided impulse to the development of the sacerdotal system.</p>
                <p>Again, although it may fairly be doubted whether, as Baur supposes, Augustine was
                    permanently tainted with the Manichaean notion of the inherent evil of matter,
                    it can scarcely be questioned that his views on marriage as elicited by the
                    Pelagian controversy gave a considerable impulse to the already prevalent idea
                    of the superiority of virginity. When the Pelagians declared that Augustine’s
                    theory of original sin discredited marriage by the implication that even the
                    children of the regenerate were born in sin, he could only reply <hi
                    rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic">Nuptiis et Concupiscentia)</hi> that
                    marriage now cannot partake of the spotless purity of the marriage of unfallen
                    man, and that, though what is evil in concupiscence is made a good use of in
                    marriage, it is still a thing to be ashamed of,—not only with the shame of
                    natural modesty (which he does not take into account) but with the shame of
                    guilt. So that, even although he is careful to point out the advantages of
                    marriage, an indelible stigma is still left even on the lawful procreation of
                    children.</p>
                <p>The remark of Milman, that “all established religions subside into Pelagianism,
                    or at least semi-Pelagianism,” is unexpected, but the converse remark, that “no
                    Pelagian ever has or ever will work a religious revolution,” may be easily
                    substantiated. It has indeed become a commonplace of historical science that in
                    order to do or to endure great things men must believe in one form or other of
                    predestination. They must feel confident that they are made use of by God to
                    accomplish things that to Him seem worthy, and that until these be accomplished
                    no earthly power can defeat or harm them. They must feel that their will is
                    embraced in the divine and empowered by it. And it is the consciousness of their
                    own impotence that leads men to yield themselves as instruments of the divine
                    power. Pelagianism is the creed of quiet times and commonplace people;
                    Augustinianism is the inevitable faith of periods that are dangerous and
                    eventful, and in which men must exhibit some heroism.</p>
                <p>Of the writings of Pelagius there have been preserved to us in the works of
                    Jerome (5th vol. of Martianay’s ed., and 11th vol. of Vallarsi’s ed.) (1) <hi

                <p>. PELAGIUS I., pope from 555 to 560, was a Roman by birth, and first appears in
                    history at Constantinople in the rank of deacon, and as apocrisiarius of Pope
                    Silverius, whose overthrow in favour of Vigilius his intrigues promoted.
                    Vigilius continued him in his diplomatic appointment, and he was sent by the
                    emperor Justinian in 542 to Antioch on ecclesiastical business; he afterwards
                    took part in the synod at Gaza which deposed Paul of Alexandria. In his official
                    position he had amassed some wealth, which on his return to Rome he so employed
                    among the poor as to secure for himself great popularity; and, when Vigilius was
                    summoned to Byzantium in 544, Pelagius, now archdeacon, was left behind as his
                    vicar, and by his tact in dealing with Totila, the Gothic invader, succeeded in
                    saving the citizens from murder and outrage. He appears subsequently to have
                    followed his master to Constantinople, and there to have taken part in the Three
                    Chapters controversy; in 553, at all events, he signed the “constitutum” of
                    Vigilius in favour of these, and for refusing, along with him, to accept the
                    decrees of the fifth general council (the 2d of Constantinople, 553) shared his
                    sentence of exile. Like Vigilius, he afterwards, however, condemned the
                    chapters, and accordingly, when the citizens of Rome, through the mediation of
                    Narses, begged for the restoration of the pope and his clergy, both were
                    recalled from banishment. The emperor now asked the Roman representatives whom
                    they should prefer—Vigilius or Pelagius—and it may safely be presumed that their
                    reply, to the effect that they would not choose the latter as long as the former
                    was alive, was hardly such as Justinian had expected or wished. Both set out for
                    Rome, but Vigilius died mysteriously on the way at Syracuse. Pelagius, as the
                    nominee of Justinian, at once succeeded on his arrival in Rome, but most of the
                    clergy, suspecting his orthodoxy, and believing him to have had some share in
                    the unlooked-for removal of his predecessor, shunned his fellowship, and only
                    two bishops and one presbyter could be got to take part in his ordination to the
                    pontificate. He enjoyed, however, the support of Narses, and, after he had
                    publicly purged himself of the charge of complicity in Vigilius’s death by
                    solemn oath in the church of St Peter, he met with toleration, at least so far
                    as his own immediate diocese was concerned, the populace remembering his former
                    charities and his success in dealing with Totila. The rest of the Western
                    bishops, however, still held aloof from the man who, by condemning the Three
                    Chapters, had put a slight, as they thought, upon the council of Chalcedon; and
                    the episcopate of Tuscany caused his name to be removed from the diptychs. This
                    elicited from him a circular, in which he asserted his loyalty to the four
                    general councils, and declared that in their action against the holy see the
                    hostile bishops had been guilty of schism. The bishops of Liguria and Aemilia,
                    headed by the archbishop of Milan, and those of Istria and Venice, headed by
                    Paulinus of Aquileia, also withheld their fellowship from one who had taken part
                    in the council of Constantinople; but Narses resisted the appeals of Pelagius,
                    who would fain have invoked the secular arm. Childebert, king of the Franks,
                    also, even after the pope had sent a confession of his faith, refused to
                    interfere. Pelagius died on 3d March 560, and was succeeded by John III.</p>
