                    drive several mills within a few yards of their source. The most prominent
                    building is the cathedral, the western part of which dates from the 11 th, the
                    central part from the 12th, and the eastern part from the 13th century. The
                    exterior is imposing, but heavy, and marred by a want of harmony arising from
                    the successive stages of its construction. Among other treasures of art it
                    contains the silver coffin of St Liborius, a substitute for one which was coined
                    into dollars in 1622 by Duke Christian of Brunswick. The externally
                    insignificant chapel of St Bartholomew ranks among the most interesting
                    buildings in Westphalia, dating as it does from 1017, and possessing the
                    characteristic features of the architecture of that early period. The old Jesuit
                    church and the chapel of the convent of Abdinghof are also interesting. The
                    town-hall is a picturesque edifice of the Renaissance. Paderborn formerly
                    possessed a university, with the two faculties of theology and philosophy, but
                    it was closed in 1819. The Roman Catholic gymnasium, however, enjoys a
                    considerable reputation, and there are several other schools, hospitals, and
                    religious endowments, as well as an historical and antiquarian society. The
                    manufactures of Paderborn are unimportant, but the trade in grain, cattle,
                    fruit, and wool has attained considerable dimensions since the opening of the
                    Westphalian railway. The population in 1880 was 14,689 (12,602 Roman
                    Catholics).</p>
                <p>Paderborn is indebted for its development to Charlemagne, who discerned the
                    favourable situation of the village of Patrisbrunnen, and made it the capital of
                    a bishopric. He frequently visited it, receiving the conquered Saxons hefre at a
                    diet in 777 and at a later period the Saracen ambassadors from Saragossa and the
                    suppliant Pope Leo III. Several diets were also held here by the Saxon emperors.
                    About the year 1000 the town was enlarged by Bishop Meinwerk and surrounded with
                    walls. It afterwards joined the Hanseatic League, received many of the
                    privileges of a free imperial town, and endeavoured to assert its independence
                    of the bishops. The citizens gladly embraced the doctrines of the Reformation,
                    but the older faith was re-established by Bishop Theodore, who took the town by
                    force in 1604. The ecclesiastical principality of Paderborn, which had an area
                    of close on 1000 square miles, was secularized in 1803 and handed over to
                    Prussia. The bishop, however, was allowed to retain his spiritual jurisdiction.
                    From 1807 to 1814 the territory was included in the kingdom of Westphalia.</p>
