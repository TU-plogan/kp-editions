                    works, though it is of course impossible for any one in cold blood to concur in
                    all the friendly praises of Ausonius and Jerome, the latter of whom compares him
                    as a letter-writer to Cicero. In 378 he was raised to the rank of consul
                    suffectus, and in the following year he appears to have been sent as consularis
                    into Campania. Here, whether in an official capacity or not, he certainly
                    remained for some time; and, according to his own account, it was at this
                    period, while present at a festival of St Felix of Nola, that he first entered
                    upon his lifelong devotion to the cultus of that saint. Probably before this
                    time he had married a wealthy Spanish lady named Therasia; the union appears to
                    have been a sympathetic and happy one, though not unclouded by domestic sorrows,
                    among which may be mentioned the death in infancy of their only child, —a
                    bereavement which, combined with the many disasters by which the empire was
                    being visited, did much to foster in them that world-weariness to which they
                    afterwards gave such emphatic expression. From Campania Paulinus returned to his
                    native place and came into correspondence or personal intimacy with men like
                    Martin of Tours and Ambrose of Milan, whose example could not fail to keep
                    before him the claims of Christianity as conceived by them; and ultimately
                    (about 389) he was formally received into the church by Bishop Delphinus of
                    Bordeaux, whence shortly afterwards he withdrew with his wife beyond the
                    Pyrenees. This withdrawal from the pursuits and pleasures of the world called
                    forth the playful banter and serious remonstrances with which alternately he was
                    plied by Ausonius; all appeals, however, to the common memories of an old
                    friendship and to the claims of patriotism and of ambition were made in vain. It
                    is impossible, of course, to say what precise amount of truth may underlie the
                    poet’s hint at an undue feminine ascendency over his friend, which is implied in
                    the expression “Tanaquil tua.” Therasia was certainly at least not behind her
                    husband in eagerness to have done with the fast-failing friendship and help of
                    “the world”; but Paulinus is unflinching in his reply to every reproach and
                    entreaty: “Negant Camaenis, nec patent Apollini dicata Christo pectora. . . .
                    Nunc alia mentem vis agit, major deus. . . . O beata injuria, displicere cum
                    Christo.” The personal asceticism of Paulinus and his liberality towards the
                    poor soon brought him into great repute among all the devout of the region in
                    which he had settled; and while he was spending Christmas at Barcelona the
                    enthusiasm of the people rose to such a pitch that they insisted on his being
                    forthwith ordained to the priesthood. The irregularity of this step, however,
                    was resented by many of the clergy, and the occurrence is still passed lightly
                    over by his Roman Catholic panegyrists. In the following year he went into
                    Italy, and after visiting Ambrose at Milan and Siricius at Rome—the latter of
                    whom, however, jealous probably of the growing monkish spirit and mindful also
                    of the irregular ordination, received him somewhat coldly—he proceeded into
                    Campania, where, in the neighbourhood of Nola, he settled among the rude
                    structures which on his former visit he had caused to be built around the tomb
                    and relics of his “dominaedius” (lord of the edifice) and patron saint. Along
                    with Therasia (now a sister, not a wife), while leading a life of rigid
                    asceticism, he devoted the whole of his vast wealth to the <pb break="no"

                    the debts of the insolvent, and to public works of utility or ornament; besides
                    building basilicas at Fondi and Nola, he provided the latter place with a
                    much-needed aqueduct. At the next vacancy, not later than 409, he succeeded to
                    the bishopric of Nola, and this office he held with ever-increasing honour until
                    his death, which occurred shortly after that of Augustine in 431. He is
                    commemorated by the Church of Rome on 22d June.</p>
                <p>The extant writings of Paulinus consist of some fifty <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epistolae,</hi> addressed to Sulpicius Severus, Delphinus, Augustine, Jerome,
                    and others; thirty-twc <hi rend="italic">Carmina</hi> in a great variety of
                    metre, including a series of hexameter “natales,’’begun about 393 and continued
                    annually in honour of the festival of St Felix, metrical epistles to Ausonius
                    and Gestidius, and paraphrases of three psalms; and a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Passio</hi><hi rend="italic">S. Geηesii.</hi> They reveal to us a kindly and
                    cheerful soul, well versed in the literary accomplishments of the period, but
                    without any strength of intellectual grasp and peculiarly prone to superstition.
                    The somewhat conspicuous place in church history occupied by Paulinus is chiefly
                    due to the effect his great influence had in promoting the practice of
                    pilgrimage, relic - hunting, and picture - worship, as well as the uncritical
                    acceptance of every alleged miracle; to the intellectual development of
                    Christianity he contributed nothing and it may well be questioned whether the
                    manner in which he discharged the stewardship of his wealth was as judicious and
                    beneficial as it certainly was generous.</p>
                <p>His works were edited by Rosweyde and Fronton le Due in 1622 (Antwerp, 8vo), and
                    their text was reprinted in the <hi rend="italic">Bibi. max. pair.</hi> (1677).
                    The next editor was Le Brun des Marettes (Paris, 1685, 2 vols. 4to), whose text
                    was reproduced in substance by Muratori (Verona, 1736), and reprinted by
                    Migne.</p>
