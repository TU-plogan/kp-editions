                <p><label type="entry">PETERHEAD</label>, a seaport, market town, burgh of barony,
                    and parliamentary burgh of Aberdeenshire, Scotland, is situated on a rocky
                    peninsula on the North Sea, about 30 miles north-north-east of Aberdeen and 2
                    north of Buchan Ness. It has railway communication by a section of the Great
                    North of Scotland line, opened in 1862. The town is built of the red granite of
                    the district. At the extremity of the peninsula is the insular suburb of
                    Keith-Inch. Among the principal buildings are the town-hall (1788), with a
                    granite spire 125 feet high, the music hall, and the court-house. The reading
                    society (1808) possesses a library with upwards of 5000 volumes, and the
                    mechanics’ institute one with about 1000 volumes. The Arbuthnot Museum contains
                    natural history specimens, a collection of coins, and objects of antiquarian
                    interest. In front of the town-hall is a statue to Field-Marshal Keith (1696-
                    1758), presented to the burgh by William I. of Prussia in 1868. A market cross
                    was erected in 1832 when the town was created a parliamentary burgh. Peterhead
                    at an early period had an extensive trade with the ports of the Baltic, the
                    Levant, and America. Formerly it was a bonding subport to Aberdeen, but was made
                    independent in 1832. The north and south harbours lie between the town and
                    Keith-Inch, and the isthmus dividing them is pierced by a canal, which is
                    crossed by an iron swing-bridge. In the north harbour are two graving-docks. A
                    new harbour was completed in 1878, and the south harbour has been deepened and
                    enlarged. The south bay is to be converted into a national harbour of refuge.
                    The Arctic seal and whale fishing, which in 1802 was prosecuted by only one
                    vessel, employed in 1857 as many as 32 vessels, but since that time it has
                    declined somewhat. The herring fishing, in which the port has long held a
                    leading position (631 boats in 1883), was begun in 1818 by a joint-stock
                    company. The general trade is of considerable importance. The chief exports are
                    herrings (£180,000 in 1883), granite, cattle, and agricultural produce. In 1883
                    the number of vessels that entered the port with cargoes and in ballast was 864
                    of 87,839 tons, the number that cleared 840 of 86,318 tons. The town possesses
                    ship and boat building <pb break="no"

                    a distillery. In the neighbourhood there are extensive granite and polishing
                    works. The limits of the police burgh and the parliamentary burgh are identical,
                    with a population in 1871 of 8535 and in 1881 of 10,922.</p>
                <p>The town and lands of Peterhead belonged anciently to the abbey of Deer, built by
                    William Cumming, earl of Buchan, in the 13th century. When the abbey was erected
                    into a temporal lordship in the family of Keith, the superiority of the town
                    fell to the earl marischal, with whom it continued till the forfeiture of the
                    earldom in 1715. The town and lands were purchased in 1720 by a fishing company
                    in England, and on their failure by the Merchant Maiden Hospital of Edinburgh
                    for £3000, who are still the superiors of the town. Peterhead was made a burgh
                    of barony in 1593 by George Keith, fourth earl marischal of Scotland. It was the
                    scene of the landing of the Pretender, 25th December 1715. Peterhead is included
                    in the Elgin district of burghs.</p>
