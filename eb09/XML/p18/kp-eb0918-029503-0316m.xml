                    single township or vill, and to be conterminous with the manor within the ambit
                    of which it is comprised. Before the process of subinfeudation became prevalent,
                    the most ancient manors were the districts which we call by that name when
                    speaking of the tenants, or “townships” when we regard the inhabitants, or
                    “parishes” as to matters ecclesiastical. The parish as an institution is in
                    reality later in date than the township. The latter has been in fact the unit of
                    local administration ever since the country was settled by the English in their
                    several states and kingdoms; the beginnings of the parochial system are
                    attributed to Theodore of Tarsus, who was archbishop of Canterbury towards the
                    close of the 7th century. The system was extended in the reign of Edgar, and it
                    appears not to have been complete until the reign of Edward III. It has been
                    considered that the intimate connexion of church and state militates against the
                    view that the parochial system was founded as a national institution, since any
                    legislation on the subject of the township and parochial systems would probably
                    have resulted in the merging of the one into the other. “The fact that the two
                    systems, the parish and the township, have existed for more than a thousand
                    years side by side, identical in area and administered by the same persons, and
                    yet separate in character and machinery, is a sufficient proof that no
                    legislative Act could have been needed in the first place; nor was there any lay
                    council of the whole nation which could have sanctioned such a measure” (Stubbs,
                    <hi rend="italic">Const. Hist.,</hi> i. 227). The boundaries of the old
                    ecclesiastical parishes are usually identical with those of the township or
                    townships comprised within its precinct; they are determined by usage, in the
                    absence of charters or records, and are evidenced by perambulations, which
                    formerly took place on the “gang-days” in Rogation week, but are now for the
                    most part held triennially, the Poor-Law Act of 1844 permitting the parish
                    officers to charge the expense on the poor-rate, “provided the perambulations do
                    not occur more than once in three years.” The expense of preserving the boundary
                    by land-marks or bound-stones is chargeable to the same rate. Many parishes
                    contain more than one township, and this is especially the case in the northern
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n317/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0317-0296"/> counties, where the separate townships are
                    organized for administrative purposes under an Act passed in 1662. In the
                    southern and midland districts the parishes are for the most part subdivided
                    into hamlets or other local divisions known as “tythings,” “boroughs,” and the
                    like; the distinction between a parish and a subordinate district lies chiefly
                    in the fact that the latter will be found to have never had a church or a
                    constable to itself. The select committee of 1873, appointed to inquire into
                    parochial boundaries, reported to the effect that the parish bears no definite
                    relation to any other administrative area, except indeed to the Poor-Law Union.
                    It may be situated in different counties or hundreds, and in many instances it
                    contains, in addition to its principal district, several outlying portions
                    intermixed with the lands in other parishes. Since the abolition of compulsory
                    church rates in 1868 (subject to certain exceptions as to rates which had
                    already been mortgaged), the old ecclesiastical parish has ceased to be of
                    importance as an instrument of local government. Its officers, however, have
                    still important duties to perform. The rector, vicar, or incumbent is a
                    corporation-sole, in whom is vested the freehold of the church and churchyard,
                    subject to the parishioners’ rights of user; their rights of burial have been
                    enlarged by the Burial Laws Amendment Act, 1880, and an Act passed in 1882 to
                    regulate the interment of suicides. The churchwardens are the principal lay
                    officers. Their duties consist in keeping the church and churchyard in repair
                    and in raising a voluntary rate for the purpose to the best of their power; they
                    have also the duty of keeping order in church during divine service; and by Acts
                    passed in 1860 and 1877 they are required to furnish annual accounts to the
                    Local Government Board. The other officials are the parish-clerk and sexton.
                    They have freeholds in their offices, and are paid by customary fees. The office
                    of the clerk is regulated by an Act of 1844, enabling a curate to undertake its
                    duties, and providing facilities for vacating the office in case of misconduct.
                    It is said that the only civil function of the parish-clerk now remaining is to
                    undertake the custody of maps and documents, which may be deposited under the
                    provisions of the Railway Clauses Act, 1845.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The· New Ecclesiastical Parish.—</hi> Under the powers given by
                    the Church Building Acts, many populous parishes have been subdivided into
                    smaller ecclesiastical parishes. This division has not affected the parish in
                    its civil aspect (Chalmers, <hi rend="italic">Local Government,</hi> 39). The
                    change has helped to increase the distinction between the ecclesiastical and
                    civil parishes. Mr Chalmers estimates that there are now about 15,000 civil and
                    13,000 ecclesiastical parishes in England, and that in 1871 not more than 10,000
                    civil parishes coincided with the ecclesiastical districts of the same
                    names.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Poor-Law Parish.—</hi> For the purposes of civil government
                    the term “parish” means a district for which a separate poor-rate is or can be
                    made, or for which a separate overseer is or can be appointed; and by the Poor
                    Law Amendment Act, 1866, this definition is to be used in interpreting all
                    statutes except where the context is inconsistent therewith. This district may
                    of itself constitute a poor law union; but in the great majority of cases the
                    unions, or areas under the jurisdiction of boards of guardians according to the
                    Poor-Law Amendment Act of 1834, are made up of aggregated poor-law parishes.
                    Each of these poor-law parishes may represent the extent of an old
                    ecclesiastical parish, or a township separately rated by custom before the
                    practice was stayed in 1819 or separated from a large parish under the Act of
                    1662, or it may represent a chapelry, tything, borough, ward, quarter, or
                    hamlet, or other subdivision of the ancient parish, or an area formed by the
                    merger of an extra-parochial place with an adjoining district under the Acts of
                    1857 and 1869, or by the union of detached portions with adjoining parishes
                    under the Acts of 1876 and 1879, or by the subdivision of a large parish for the
                    better administration of the relief of the poor under the Poor Law Amendment Act
                    of 1867 and the Local Government Board Act of 1871. The civil importance of the
                    poor-law parishes may be dated from the introduction of the poor law by the
                    statute of 43 Elizabeth, which directed overseers of the poor to be appointed in
                    every parish, and made the churchwardens into <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi>
                    overseers. The statute was preceded by tentative provisions of the same kind
                    enacted in the reigns of Edward the VI. and Mary and in the fifth year of
                    Elizabeth, and after several renewals was made perpetual in the reign of Charles
                    L The chief part of the parochial organization is the vestry-meeting. It derives
                    its name from the old place of assembly, which in parishes exceeding two
                    thousand in population may now be replaced by a vestryhail. The vestry
                    represents the old assembly of the township, and retains so much of its business
                    as has not been insensibly transferred to the court-baron and court-leet. The
                    freemen, now appearing as the ratepayers, elect the “parish officers,” as the
                    churchwardens and way-wardens, the assessors, the overseers, and (if required)
                    paid assistantoverseers, a secretary or vestry-clerk, and a collector of rates
                    if the guardians apply for his appointment. A meeting for the election of
                    guardians is held in April every year, subject to the rules laid down by the
                    Local Government Board as to the number of guardians for each parish, and the
                    union of parishes for voting purposes. In case of a contest the election is
                    conducted under Sturges Bourne’s Act. Common vestries are meetings of all the
                    ratepayers assembled on a three days’ notice; the minister of the ecclesiastical
                    parish is chairman, if present; the meeting acts by show of hands unless a poll
                    is demanded; if demanded, the poll is conducted by plural voting according to
                    payment of rates. Select vestries are regulated by the local custom, or may
                    derive their power from Hobhouse’s Act passed in 1831, now repealed in the
                    Metropolitan District, and not much used elsewhere. The functions of the vestry,
                    apart from elections, are practically confined to the management of the property
                    of the parish. The vestry, however, has power to adopt the Free Libraries Act,
                    or the Lighting and Watching Act of 1833, and may appoint a new burial board if
                    a new burial-ground is required; but with these exceptions, most of its active
                    powers and duties have now been taken away by the Acts relating to the poor laws
                    and public health.</p>

                    There can be little doubt that about the beginning of the 13th century the
                    whole, or almost the whole, of the kingdom of Scotland was parochially divided.
                    It seems probable (though the point is obscure) that the bishops presided at the
                    first formation of the parishes—the parish being a subdivision of the
                    diocese—and at any rate down to the date of the Reformation they exercised the
                    power of creating new parishes within their respective dioceses (Duncan, <hi
                    rend="italic">Parochial Law,</hi> p. 4). After the Reformation the power of
                    altering parishes was assumed by the legislature. The existing parochial
                    districts being found unsuited to the ecclesiastical requirements of the time, a
                    general Act was passed in 1581, which made provision for the parochial clergy,
                    and, <hi rend="italic">inter alia,</hi> directed that “a sufficient and
                    competent” district should be appropriated to each church as a parish (1581,
                    cap. 100). Thereafter, by a series of special Acts in the first place, and,
                    subsequent to the year 1617, by the decrees of parliamentary commissions, the
                    creation of suitable parochial districts was proceeded with. The powers
                    conferred on the parliamentary commissions embraced what are technically known
                    as (1) the disjunction and erection of parishes, (2) the union of parishes, and
                    (3) the disjunction and annexation of parishes. In altering and defining
                    parochial areas in those several ways, the object which the commissioners had in
                    view was to provide for the spiritual wants of particular districts of the
                    country, and to procure from the lands in the parish a proper stipend for the
                    clergy. In the year 1707 the powers exercised by these commissioners were
                    permanently transferred to the Court of Session, whose judges were appointed to
                    act in future as “Commissioners for the Plantation of Kirks and Valuation of
                    Teinds” (Act, 1707, cap. 9). Under this statute the areas of parishes continued
                    to be altered and defined down to 1844, when the Act commonly known as Graham’s
                    Act was passed, (7 &amp; 8 Vict. c. 44). This Act, which applies to the
                    disjunction and erection of parishes, introduced a simpler form of procedure,
                    and to some extent dispensed with the consent of the heritors, which had been
                    required under the earlier statute. Since 1844 proceedings for disjunction and
                    erection of parishes have been taken under it.</p>
                <p>The main division of parishes iu Scotland as they now exist is into civil and
                    ecclesiastical, or, to speak more accurately, into parishes proper <hi
                    rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> for all purposes, civil and ecclesiastical) and
                    ecclesiastical parishes. This division is expressed in legal language by the
                    terms, parishes <hi rend="italic">quoad omnia (i.e., quoad</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >civilia</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">sacra)</hi> and parishes
                    <hi rend="italic">quoad sacra—</hi><hi rend="italic">civilia</hi> being such
                    matters as church rates, education, poor law, and sanitary purposes, and <hi
                    rend="italic">sacra</hi> being such as concern the administration of church
                    ordinances, and fall under the cognizance of the church courts. There are other
                    minor divisions which will be noticed below. (1) <hi rend="italic">The Parish
                    Proper.—</hi> In a number of instances it is difficult to determine the exact
                    areas of such parishes at the present day. The boundaries of the old
                    ecclesiastical parish were nowhere recorded, and the descriptions in the titles
                    of private properties which appear to lie in the parish have sometimes to be
                    taken as evidence, and sometimes the fact that the inhabitants attended a
                    particular church or made payments in favour of a particular minister. Where
                    there has been a union or disjunction and erection of parishes the evidence of
                    the boundaries is the relative statute, order in council, or decree of
                    commission or of Court of Teinds. The total number of parishes proper in
                    Scotland is eight hundred and eighty-six, and they vary to a great degree both
                    in size and population. For ecclesiastical purposes, the minister and
                    kirk-session constitute the parochial authority. The minister is vested with the
                    manse and glebe, to be held by him for himself and his successors in office, and
                    along with the kirk-session he administers church ordinances and exercises
                    church discipline. For purposes of local government, on the other hand, the
                    Scottish parish, unlike that of England, has been largely utilized by modern
                    legislation. The oldest governing authority is the meeting of the heritors or
                    landowners of the parish. Though shorn of much of its old importance, the
                    heritors’ meeting has still the power of imposing an assessment for the purpose
                    of providing and maintaining a church and churchyard and a manse and glebe for
                    the minister. It also possesses power to assess under the Parochial Buildings
                    Acts of 1862 and 1866. In a certain number of parishes also, which have not
                    adopted a parochial board under the Poor-Law Act, 1845, the heritors along with
                    the kirk-session provide for the relief of the poor, and administer the funds
                    legally destined for that purpose. In the great majority, however, of civil
                    parishes the chief governing authority is the parochial board, which in
                    non-burghal parishes is composed of owners of land of £20 annual value and
                    upwards, and representatives of the kirk-session and of the magistrates of any
                    burgh within the parish and of the rate-payers—the number of representative
                    members being in each case fixed by the Board of Supervision. Another local
                    authority of great importance is the school board, created by the recent
                    Education Acts. Speaking generally, the matters administered in the civil parish
                    are poor relief, education, public health, burial, registration, and church
                    rates. (2) <hi rend="italic">Quoad Sacra Parishes.—</hi> The ecclesiastical or
                    <hi rend="italic">quoad sacra</hi> parish is a modem creation. Under Graham’s
                    Act, above mentioned, a parish may be disjoined and erected <hi rend="italic"
                    >quoad sacra</hi><hi rend="italic">tantum</hi> on the application of persons who
                    have built and endowed a church, and who offer securities for its proper
                    maintenance. The creation is made purely on a consideration of the spiritual
                    interests of a particular district, and not for any purposes of civil
                    administration. By the Education Act of 1872, however, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >quoad sacra</hi> parish has been adopted as a separate school district. There
                    are three hundred and twenty-five such parishes in Scotland. (3) <hi
                    rend="italic">Extra-Burghal Parishes.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> For sanitary
                    purposes, highways, and some others, certain classes of burghs have been made
                    separate areas from the parishes in which they lie. This fact creates a set of
                    incomplete parishes, which are called extra-burghal. (4) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Burghal, Landward, and Burghal-Landward (or Mixed) Parishes.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> This division of parishes depends, as the names imply, upon
                    local character and situation of the parochial districts. The importance of the
                    distinction arises in connexion with the rule of assessment which is to be
                    adopted for various parochial burdens, and the nature of the rights of the
                    minister and corresponding obligations of the parishioners. (5) <hi
                    rend="italic">Combined Parishes.—</hi> Under the Poor-Law, Education, and
                    Registration Acts power is given to the central authority to combine parishes
                    for purposes of local administration.</p>

                    The term “parish” is not in use as a territorial designation except in
                    Louisiana, the fifty-eight parishes of which correspond to the counties of the
                    other States of the Union.</p>
                <p>The principal records from which information may be gained as to the oldest
