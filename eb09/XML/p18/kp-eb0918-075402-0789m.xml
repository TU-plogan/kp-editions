                    subjects as translated “Persian Tales” and a summary of Hacket’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Archbishop Williams.</hi> The first product really
                    characteristic of the author, after his settlement in London, is the series of
                    <hi rend="italic">Pastorals</hi> which opened the sixth volume of Tonson’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> (1709). Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Pastorals,</hi>
                    curiously enough, closed the same volume, and the emphatic preference expressed
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Guardian,</hi> in 1713, for Philips’s pastoral style
                    over all other successors to Spenser gave rise to Pope’s trenchant ironical
                    paper in No. 40 of the same periodical. The breach between these two wits
                    speedily λvidened, and Philips was at length concerned in the great quarrel
                    between Pope and Addison. He had come to be a man of some note both for literary
                    work and political activity. The <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> had loaded
                    with praises the drama of <hi rend="italic">The Distress'd Mother,</hi> which
                    Philips adapted from Racine’s <hi rend="italic">Androτnaque</hi> and brought
                    upon the stage in 1712, and he was thus a recognized member of Addison’s
                    following. There is some doubt as to the particular part he played in the
                    notorious contest of the two chiefs, but, whether he threatened to beat Pope or
                    not (with the rod which he is said to have hung up at Button’s for that
                    purpose), there is ample evidence to show that both Pope and his friends had a
                    bitter feeling towards him. Not only is he honoured with two separate lines in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Dunciαd,</hi> but he figures for illustrative purposes in
                    <hi rend="italic">Martinus Scrιblerus,</hi> and he receives considerable
                    attention in the letters of both Pope and Swift. The latter found occasion for
                    special allusion to Philips during Philips’s stay in Ireland, whither he had
                    gone as secretary to Archbishop Boulter. He had done good work in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Freethinker</hi> (1711) along with Boulter, whose services to the
                    Government in that paper gained him preferment from his position as clergyman in
                    Southwark, first to the bishopric of Bristol and then to the primacy of Ireland.
                    Up to this time Philips had shown disinterested zeal in the Hanoverian cause,
                    though he had received no greater reward than the positions of justice of peace
                    and commissioner of the lottery (1717). He had also written some of his best
                    epistles, while in 1722 he published two more dramatic works— <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Briton</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Humphry, Duke of Gloucester</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> neither of which has had the fortune, like their
                    predecessor, to be immortalized by romantic criticism. It was, no doubt, a
                    grateful change for Philips to go to Ireland under the patronage of Archbishop
                    Boulter, and to represent, through the same influence, the county of Armagh in
                    the Irish Parliament, while his sense of his own political worth must have been
                    flattered when he became secretary to the lord chancellor in 1726, and in 1733
                    judge of the prerogative court. After the archbishop’s death he by and by
                    returned to London, and dedicated a collected edition of his works to the duke
                    of Newcastle. He died in 1749.</p>
                <p>ΛVlιile it can hardly be said that Philips’s <hi rend="italic">Pastorals</hi>
                    show poetic quality of a high order, they must be commended—and perhaps the
                    third in particular—for ease and fluency and rhetorical vigour. In these
                    features they are not surpassed by the pastorals in <hi rend="italic">The
                    Shepherd's Week,</hi> which Gay wrote, at Pope’s instigation, as a burlesque on
                    Philips’s work; but the grasp of rustic simplicity and the exquisite play of
                    fancy possessed by Gay are manifest advantages in his performance. The six
                    epistles evince dexterous management of the heroic couplet, an energetic
                    directness of purpose, and (particularly the “winter piece” addressed to the
                    earl of Dorset) a noticeable appreciation of natural beauty. Similar felicitous
                    diction and sympathetic observation, together with a determined bias towards
                    weakness of sentiment, are characteristic of the poet’s odes, some of
                    which—addressed to children—gave occasion for various shafts from both Swift and
                    Pope, as well as for the nickname of “Namby-Pamby,” coined by Henry Carey as a
                    descriptive epithet for Philips. The epigrams, and the translations from Pindar,
                    Anacreon, and Sappho, need merely be named as completing the list of the
                    author’s works.</p>
