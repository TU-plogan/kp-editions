                <p><label type="entry">PETERBOROUGH</label>, a city and municipal and parliamentary
                    borough, chiefly in Northamptonshire, but partly in Huntingdonshire, is situated
                    on the river Nene, 76 miles north of London by the Great Northern Railway. The
                    town is also a station on the London and North-Western, the Great Eastern, and
                    the Midland systems. It is built chiefly along the river on the north side, the
                    streets being straight and wide, and containing many good houses. The first
                    bridge over the Nene at Peterborough was erected in 1140, the present bridge in
                    1872. The cathedral of St Peter is the third church that has occupied the site;
                    the first, founded by Peada, king of the Mercians, in 656, was entirely
                    destroyed by the Danes in 870, and the second, founded by King Edgar in 971, was
                    accidentally burnt in 1116. The present building, founded in the following year,
                    was, inclusive of the west front, 120 years in building, being consecrated on
                    4th October 1237. It is one of the three Norman cathedrals in England, and,
                    though scarcely entitled to a place among cathedrals of the first rank,
                    possesses special features rendering it second almost to none in point of
                    architectural interest. It embraces in all eight periods of construction, and in
                    no other building can the transition be better studied through the various
                    grades of Norman to Early English, while the later addition is an admirable
                    example of Perpendicular. The edifice proceeded as usual from east to west, and,
                    while an increase in elegance and elaboration is observable in the later parts,
                    the character of the earlier buildings has been so carefully kept in mind that
                    no sense of incongruity is produced. A series of uniform Decorated windows were
                    added throughout the church in the 14th century, and the effect has been rather
                    to enhance than detract from the unity of design. The choir, Early Norman, was
                    founded on 12th March 1117 (or 7th March 1118) by John de Sez, and dedicated in
                    1140 or 1143; the aisles of both transepts and the whole of the south transept
                    were built by Martin of Bec, 1140-55; the remaining portions of the transepts
                    and the central tower, of three stories, were completed by William de
                    Waterville, 1155-75; the nave, Late Norman, was completed by Abbot Benedict,
                    1177-93, who added a beautiful painted roof of wood; the western transepts,
                    Transition Norman, were the work of Abbot Andrew, 1193-1200; the western front,
                    with its magnificent triple arch, the unique feature of the building, and one of
                    the finest specimens of Early English extant, must have been built between 1200
                    and 1250; but there exists no record of its construction. The lady chapel, built
                    parallel with the choir by William Parys, prior, was consecrated in 1290; the
                    belltower was erected by Abbot Richard between 1260 and 1274; the south-west
                    spire, the pinnacles of the flanking tower of the west portal, and the
                    enlargement of the windows of the nave and aisles were the work of Henry de
                    Morcot in the beginning of the 14th century; the new building or eastern chapel
                    in the Perpendicular style, be gun in 1438, was not completed till 1528. In 1541
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n731/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0918-0731-0700"/> church was converted into a cathedral, the
                    abbot being made the first bishop. The extreme length of the building is 471
                    feet, and of the nave 211 feet, the breadth of the west front being 156; the
                    height of the central tower, as reconstructed in the 14th century, was 150, that
                    of the spires and tower of the west front is 156 feet. In 1643 the building was
                    defaced by the soldiers of Cromwell, who destroyed nearly all the brasses and
                    monuments, burnt the ancient records, levelled the altar and screen, defaced the
                    windows, and demolished the cloisters. To obtain materials for repairs the lady
                    chapel was taken down. In the latter part of the 18th century the church was
                    repaved. In 1831 a new throne, stalls, and choir-screen were erected and other
                    restorations completed. On account of the insecure state of the central tower in
                    1883, it was taken down; but it is now (1884) being rebuilt. Catherine of Aragon
                    was interred in the cathedral in 1536, and Mary queen of Scots in 1588, but the
                    body of the Scottish queen was removed to Westminster Abbey in 1612. Of the
                    monastic buildings there are some interesting remains. The cathedral is
                    approached by a Norman gateway, above which is the chapel of St Nicholas, built
                    by Abbot Benedict, and now used as the music school, and on the left the chapel
                    of St Thomas a Becket, built by Abbot Ashton in the 15th century, and now used
                    as the grammar-school. The gateway to the bishop’s palace, formerly the abbot’s
                    house, was built by Abbot Godfrey de Croy land in 1319, and the deanery gate by
                    Abbot Kirton in 1515. One of the canonry houses is formed partly from a hall of
                    the 13th century. To the north of the cathedral is Touthill, said to have been
                    erected for the defence of the monastery.</p>
                <p>Peterborough is included for civil purposes in the parish of St John the Baptist,
                    but for ecclesiastical purposes it is divided into four, the additional parishes
                    being St Mary’s Boongate (1857), St Mark’s (1858), and St Paul’s (1869). The old
                    parish church of St John originally stood to the east of the cathedral, but was
                    rebuilt on its present site in the centre of the city (1401-7) in the
                    Perpendicular style. It consists of chancel, nave, aisles, and an embattled
                    tower adorned with pinnacles. The educational establishments include the Henry
                    VIII. grammar or chapter school; the St Peter’s training college for
                    schoolmasters for the dioceses of Peterborough, Ely, and Lincoln, erected from
                    designs of Sir Gilbert Scott (1864), and attended by forty-six pupils; the
                    practising school attached to the training college, attended by 250 boys; and
                    Deacons and Ireland’s charity school, established in 1721 for the clothing and
                    educating of twenty poor boys, but lately reorganized. The principal public
                    buildings are the market-house (1671), used as a townhall, the corn exchange
                    (1848) in the Italian style, the liberty jail and house of correction in the
                    Norman style (erected in 1848 and enlarged in 1855 and 1870), the assembly rooms
                    (1853), and the county court and probate office (1873). A cattle-market, 5 acres
                    in extent, was opened in 1867. The benevolent institutions include the
                    dispensary and infirmary, several almshouses, and the union workhouse. The
                    modern prosperity and rapid growth of the town are chiefly due to the trade
                    caused by the junction of so many railway lines. Adjoining the town are
                    extensive works and sheds connected with the Great Northern and Midland
                    Railways. Important cattle-markets and fairs are held, and there is a large
                    transit of meat and cattle to London and elsewhere. An extensive trade in corn,
                    coal, and timber is also carried on. The principal manufacture is that of
                    agricultural implements. The entire parliamentary city of Peterborough has an
                    area of 6558 acres (of which 6310 are in Northamptonshire), with a population of
                    22,394 (of whom 20,123 are in Northamptonshire). The population of the municipal
                    borough (area, 1818 acres) in 1871 was 16,310, and in 1881 it was 21,228...
                    Since 1841 it has more than trebled.</p>
                <p>The ancient name of Peterborough was <hi rend="italic">Medeshamstede.</hi> The
                    foundation of the great Benedictine abbey of St Peter was laid in 655 by 0swy,
                    king of Northumbria, and Peada, the first Christian king of Mercia. It was the
                    first of the Benedictine abbeys in Gyrwa land (Fenland). In 870 it was plundered
                    by the Danes, after which it remained desolate till 966, when it was restored to
                    its former splendour by Athwald, bishop of Winchester. From that time the town
                    was called a borough, being probably then surrounded by walls; and under Abbot
                    Leofric, nephew of Earl Leofric of Mercia, the abbey became one of the
                    wealthiest in England. In 1169 it was plundered by Hereward. Since the first of
                    Edward IV. the borough has returned two members to parliament. Until 1874 the
                    city was included in the liberty or soke of Peterborough, the government of
                    which was vested in the lord paramount, the custos rotulorum, and magistrates
                    appointed by the crown, with powers equal to those of judges of assize; a high
                    bailiff oí the city was appointed by the dean and chapter as lords of the manor,
                    who acted as returning officer till the incorporation of the city in 1874.
                    Peterborough is divided into three wards; for municipal and sanitary purposes it
                    is governed by a mayor, six aidermen, and eighteen councillors, but for
                    magisterial and sessional purposes is still included in the liberty of
                    Peterborough.</p>
