                    rend="italic">Reliques,</hi> was born at Bridgnorth 13th April 1729 and baptized
                    at St Leonard’s Church 29th April. His father, Arthur Lowe Percy, a grocer by
                    trade, lived in a large house at the bottom of the street called “The Cartway,”
                    and acquired sufficient means to send his son, who had received the rudiments of
                    his education at Bridgnorth grammar-school, to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1746.
                    He graduated in 1750 and proceeded Μ. A. in 1753. In the latter year he was
                    appointed to the vicarage of Easton Maudit, Northamptonshire, and three years
                    later instituted to the rectory of Wilby in the same county, benefices which he
                    retained until 1782. On the 24th of April 1759 Percy was married at Desborough,
                    Northamptonshire, to Anne, daughter of Barton Gutteridge. During his residence
                    in the delightful but secluded neighbourhood of Easton Maudit most of the
                    literary work for which he is now remembered—including the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reliques</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> was completed. When his name became
                    famous through his publications he complied with the request of the duke and
                    duchess of Northumberland that he would reside with them as their domestic
                    chaplain, and was tempted into the belief that he belonged to the illustrious
                    house of Percy. Through this connexion he became dean of Carlisle in 1778 and
                    bishop of Dromore in Ireland in 1782, from which date he was a constant resident
                    in his adopted country. His wife predeceased him at Dromore Palace, 30th
                    December 1806; the good bishop, blind but otherwise in sound health, lived until
                    30th September 1811; both of them were buried in the transept which he added to
                    Dromore Cathedral.</p>
                <p>For many years Dr Percy enthusiastically laboured in the fields of literature. He
                    translated the Song of Solomon and published a key to the New Testament, a work
                    often reprinted; he edited poetry from the Icelandic language and translated
                    Mallet’s <hi rend="italic">Northern Antiquities.</hi> His reprint of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Household Book of the Earl of Northumberland in</hi> 1512 is
                    of the greatest value for the illustrations of domestic life in England at that
                    period. But all of these works are of little estimation when compared with the
                    <hi rend="italic">Reliques</hi><hi rend="italic">of Ancient English Poetry,</hi>
                    a publication which has entranced successive generations of schoolboys and
                    students since its first appearance in February 1765. It was based on an old
                    manuscript collection of poetry, but, unfortunately for the editor’s peace of
                    mind, it was modernized in style, a circumstance which exposed him to the sneers
                    and suspicions of Ritson. The work as originally issued by Percy has been
                    re-edited by many British antiquaries, whilst selections have been issued for
                    boys and girls, and the manuscript on which he worked has been edited in its
                    complete form by J. W. Hales and F. J. Furnivall. The bishop was possessed of
                    great poetic feeling. His ballad of “The Hermit of Warkworth” was too simple for
                    the austere taste of Dr Johnson, but it has always and deservedly been popular;
                    and his song now generally known as “0 Nanny, wilt thou gang wi’ me?” is a
                    universal favourite, from its own merits as well as from the musical setting of
                    an Irishman called Thomas Carter. The greater part of the seventh volume of
                    Nichols’s <hi rend="italic">∏lιιstrations of the Literary History of the</hi>
                    18ZAe <hi rend="italic">Century</hi> is filled with Bishop Percy’s
                    correspondence.</p>
