                    (1504-1575), archbishop of Canterbury, the eldest surviving son of William
                    Parker and Alice Monins, his wife, was born at Norwich 6th August 1504. His
                    father was an artisan, a calenderer of woollen stuffs, but through his mother he
                    could afterwards trace his descent from the earls of Nottingham. He was
                    instructed in reading by Thomas Benis, rector of St Clement’s, Norwich, and in
                    the elements of Latin by one William Neve; in the latter he found (a somewhat
                    exceptional experience in those days) a kind and sympathizing teacher. When
                    Matthew was twelve years of age he lost his father; but his mother was,
                    notwithstanding, able to send him at the commencement of the Michaelmas term,
                    1521, to Cambridge, and to maintain him there until his merits secured some
                    recognition. He was educated partly in St Mary’s Hostel and partly in Corpus
                    Christi College. In March 1523 he was elected to a bible-clerkship in the
                    college, an office which involved reading the Bible aloud on prescribed
                    occasions, and waiting at the fellows’ table at dinner. In the March of the
                    following year he was admitted B.A.; he was subsequently made a deacon and a
                    priest, in 1527 was elected to a fellowship, and in 1528 commenced Μ. A.</p>
                <p>His industry as a student and his general ability marked him out for early
                    notice; and when, in 1521, Wolsey was founding Cardinal College (afterwards
                    Christ Church), Oxford, Parker was one among a number of rising Cambridge
                    students who were invited to become fellows of the new society. Fortunately,
                    however, for himself and for Cambridge he elected to stay at Corpus. The
                    university was at this time becoming a great centre of the Reformation movement,
                    and he found himself attracted to the meetings held at the White Horse (an inn
                    in the town), which the Catholic party derisively styled “Germany,” from the
                    fact that it was the known rendezvous of the supporters of Lutheran tenets.
                    Among those with whom he was thus brought into contact was Bilney, the martyr;
                    and when, in 1531, the latter was burned at Norwich, Parker attended him in his
                    last hours, and afterwards bore testimony to his constancy. On Cranmer’s
                    election to the archbishopric of Canterbury, Parker received a licence to
                    preach, and soon became known in Cambridge and its neighbourhood as a divine of
                    considerable oratorical power. He was summoned to preach at court; and in 1535
                    the queen, Ann Boleyn, appointed him her chaplain. He shortly after received a
                    further mark of her favour by being made dean of the college of St John the
                    Baptist, at Stoke, near Clare, Suffolk—an institution for the training of the
                    secular clergy. Here he gave the earliest indication of his skill as an
                    administrator; and the new statutes which he drew up for the college were deemed
                    so judicious that the duke of Norfolk, in 1540, adopted them as a model for the
                    code which he gave to a similar foundation at Thetford. Parker’s retired life at
                    Stoke did not altogether secure him from attack on account of his courageously
                    avowed sympathies with the Reformation, and in the year 1539 he was accused by
                    the townsmen of Clare of manifesting undue contempt for the Catholic ritual.</p>
                <p>At Stoke Parker continued to reside more or less until the year 1545. His
                    disposition throughout life was naturally retiring. In one of his letters to
                    CeciL written <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n320/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0918-0320-0299"/> about 1543, he confesses to a “natural
                    ∙viciosity of overmuch shamefacedness and this constitutional defect would seem,
                    at this time, to have been aggravated by a state of health which made it
                    necessary for him to obtain the permission of the university, when preaching in
                    St Mary’s, Cambridge, to do so with his head covered. In the year 1538 he was
                    created D.D. Although his indifferent health and love of study alike inclined
                    him to a retired life, his seclusion was frequently broken in upon by honours
                    and preferment which came unsought. He was selected by Thomas Cromwell to preach
                    at Paul’s Cross, on account of “his learning in holy letters and uncorrupt
                    judgment in the same.” He was appointed one of the king’s chaplains, and in the
                    year 1541 was made a canon of Ely. In 1542 his own college of Stoke presented
                    him to an Essex living. About this time it began to be rumoured that the
                    dissolution of Stoke College could not be averted, and the arguments for
                    Parker’s return to his university, in whose welfare his interest had continued
                    undiminished, were such as he could no longer resist. The mastership of Corpus
                    having fallen vacant, he consented to be elected to the post, at that time
                    scarcely of the annual value of £10; to this, however, the society shortly after
                    added the rectory of Landbeach. In January 1545 he was elected to the
                    vice-chancellorship of the university by a large majority. The colleges of both
                    universities were at this period in continual fear of being, sooner or later,
                    handed over, as the monasteries had been, to the greed of the despoiler. It was
                    accordingly resolved, in order to anticipate a commission consisting of
                    unscrupulous courtiers and lawyers, that the university should obtain the royal
                    authority for a commission composed of those who were intimately acquainted with
                    the real state of affairs, and, through the good offices of Catherine Parr,
                    Parker, along with two other heads of colleges, was selected for the task. When
                    their survey had been completed, they repaired to Hampton Court, and laid their
                    statement before the king. Henry, on reading the report, expressed his emphatic
                    admiration at the economical management of the colleges, and dismissed the
                    commission with assurances which completely baffled the expectations of the
                    courtiers. The fate which was averted from Cambridge fell, however, upon Stoke
                    College. Its estate was confiscated, but subject to a charge of £40 per annum as
                    compensation. The purchaser was Sir John Cheke, Parker’s personal friend, by
                    whom the money was regularly paid to the former dean. Parker now entered upon
                    the married state, and espoused a Norfolk lady named Margaret Harleston. His
                    choice appears to have been singularly fortunate. His wife proved a true
                    helpmate, and was distinguished for the graceful hospitality she extended to the
                    poor clergy whom Parker was in the habit of inviting to the college lodge at
                    Cambridge.</p>
                <p>In the measures which marked the further progress of the Reformation during
                    Edward’s reign Parker seems to have cordially co-operated. But he had no
                    sympathy with the bigotry which now began to characterize the contending sects
                    of Protestantism abroad; and when Martin Bucer was fain, to quit Strasburg,
                    after the failure of his efforts to mediate between the Lutherans and the
                    Zwinglians, the master of Corpus extended to that eminent theologian a cordial
                    welcome to England. During the short time that the latter filled the post of
                    regius professor of divinity at Cambridge, he found in Parker a firm friend, and
                    it was by Parker that his funeral sermon was preached. Parker’s services to his
                    party were not unrecognized. He was occasionally appointed to preach before the
                    young king, and was promoted to the deanery of Lincoln and to the prebend of
                    Corringham in that cathedral. On the occasion of Kett’s rebellion in Norfolk,
                    happening to be in Norwich, he visited the rebels’ camp and ventured to preach
                    submissioh to the constituted authorities.</p>
                <p>When Queen Mary ascended the throne, most of the college heads at Cambridge were
                    deprived of office, and Parker only forestalled a like fate by resignation. The
                    fact of his being a married man alone sufficed to entail the loss of all his
                    ecclesiastical preferments. He did not, however, like many of the leaders of his
                    party, fly from the country, but lived in strict retirement, his place of
                    residence being a secret which appears to have died with him. This feature in
                    his career is deserving of note, as offering an important point of contrast to
                    the experiences of those other eminent churchmen who, known as the Marian
                    exiles, returned to England after a long sojourn at the chief centres of the
                    Reformed party on the Continent, strongly prejudiced in favour of Calvinistic
                    doctrine, and bigotedly intolerant of everything approaching to the Roman
                    discipline and ritual. Parker, like Whitgift, stayed in England, and was thus
                    probably better able afterwards to maintain a fairly impartial position in
                    relation to contending religious parties. He himself speaks of these years of
                    his life, passed as they were in solitude among his books and in meditation, but
                    cheered by the possession of a clear conscience, as productive of far more solid
                    enjoyment than he afterwards found in the varied duties and anxieties of the
                    episcopal office.</p>
                <p>A fall from horseback, when he was on one occasion compelled to flee by night
                    from Mary’s emissaries, resulted in a permanent injury (his language appears to
                    imply a rupture) which still further disinclined him to active and laborious
                    public duties; and upon Elizabeth’s accession he evinced little readiness to
                    avail himself of prospects of preferment held out by Sir Nicholas Bacon, the
                    lord keeper. He believed himself to be summoned by duty to return to his former
                    sphere of labour at Cambridge, at that time, like Oxford, in a singularly
                    depressed and unsatisfactory condition. “Of all places in England,” he writes to
                    Bacon, “I would wish to bestow most of my time in the university, the state
                    whereof is miserable at this present.” His services were needed, however, for a
                    wider sphere of action; and in December 1558 he was summoned by royal command to
                    London, where it was intimated to him that he was to be appointed to the
                    primacy. His election to the office took place on the first of the following
                    August, and his consecration on the 17th December, in the chapel at Lambeth
                    Palace. He was consecrated by Bishop Barlow, formerly bishop of Bath and Wells,
                    bishopelect of Chichester; John Scory, formerly bishop of Chichester,
                    bishop-elect of Hereford; Miles Coverdale, late bishop of Exeter; and John
                    Hodgkin, suffragan bishop of Bedford. The delay which took place in his
                    consecration arose from the fact that the three bishops named in the original
                    warrant (Tonstal, Bourne, and Poole) refused to act, and a second warrant was
                    consequently found necessary. In the following century the Romanist party
                    sought, by circulating the “Nag’s Head fable,” to throw discredit on Parker’s
                    consecration by representing that he, together with certain other bishops, was
                    simply ordained, and that too in an irreverent and uncanonical fashion, at a
                    tavern in Fleet Street. The evidence which contravenes this story (see Pocock’s
                    edition of Burnet’s <hi rend="italic">History of the Reformation,</hi> vol. v.)
                    is, however, singularly full and satisfactory.</p>
                <p>During the fifteen years of his primacy, Parker’s best energies were devoted to
                    defining more accurately the discipline and belief of the newly constituted
                    Church of England, and to bringing about a general conformity. The Thirty-Nine
                    Articles were passed by convocation under his presidency in 1562. In the year
                    1566 he issued his celebrated “Advertisements,” “for the due order in the <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n321/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0918-0321-0300"/> public administration of common prayers and
                    using the holy sacraments, and for the apparel of all persons ecclesiastical.”
                    Notwithstanding that they related mainly to questions of detail and ceremonial,
                    these new regulations excited strenuous opposition from the Puritan party, owing
                    to the fact that, although they enjoined the discontinuance of “gorgeous
                    vestments” and the cope, they prescribed the use of the surplice. It is asserted
                    that they were promulgated by the command of Elizabeth, who subsequently
                    withheld her formal sanction, and permitted the obloquy they evoked to fall on
                    Parker. It is certain that they added materially to the embarrassment of his
                    position. The revised translation of the Scriptures known as the Bishops’ Bible
                    (1568 and 1572) owed its origin to Parker, and is regarded by English Churchmen
                    as a valuable service to their communion, from the fact that it served to
                    prevent the adoption of the Geneva Bible until superseded by the authorized
                    version.</p>
                <p>The determination which Parker showed to withstand, and if possible repress, the
                    growing boldness of the Puritan party, involved him during the latter years of
                    his primacy in a struggle which was detrimental to his health, his temper, and
                    his reputation. In August 1570 his wife died, and the blow was severely felt. He
                    was still able, however, to discharge with efficiency the duties of his office;
                    and in. 1573 he entertained Elizabeth with great splendour and sumptuousness in
                    the grand hall of his palace at Canterbury. Among his last measures of reform
                    are to be noted his personal visitation of the church and chapter at Canterbury,
                    and the drawing up of a series of injunctions for their more efficient
                    regulation, the issuing of a commission for the visitation of his diocese, and
                    the publication of new constitutions for the Court of Arches. In 1575 his health
                    began rapidly to give way, and he died on the 17th May in that year, giving
                    evidence almost to the last of that vigorous intellect and strong will by which
                    he was distinguished throughout life.</p>
                <p>As an author, Parker cannot be held entitled to any high place. He compiled a
                    Latin treatise, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Antiquitate</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Bvitannicae Ecclesiae</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                        Privilegiis</hi><hi rend="italic">Ecclesiae Cantuariensis,</hi> printed by
                    John Day in 1572, which shows considerable research in connexion with the
                    circumstances under which Christianity was introduced into Britain. In this,
                    however, as in most of his more learned works, he was probably largely assisted
                    by his secretary, Josselin. His letters, which have been published under the
                    title of the <hi rend="italic">Parker Correspondence</hi> (Parker Society,
                    1853), are marked throughout by his usual natural good sense and sobriety of
                    judgment, but are characterized neither· by originality nor brilliancy of
                    thought. His other writings are chiefly statutes for various ecclesiastical or
                    collegiate foundations, sermons, forms of prayer, and ordinances for the
                    church.</p>
                <p>As an editor, while his industry must be admitted by all, he had but an imperfect
                    sense of the responsibilities attaching to such a function and of the limits to
                    be observed in its exercise. He edited Aelfric’s <hi rend="italic">Anglo-Saxon
                        Homily,</hi> a treatise much valued by religious controversialists as
                    exhibiting the theory of the early English Church in relation to the doctrine of
                    transubstantiation. The treatise of Gildas, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Excidio</hi><hi rend="italic">Britanniae,</hi> next appeared;
                    but this was mainly, if not entirely, the work of Josselin. The <hi
                        rend="italic">Flores</hi><hi rend="italic">Historiarum</hi> (probably the
                    work of Boger of Wendover) was edited by Parker under the belief that it was the
                    work of an unknown “Matthew of Westminster.” The other chronicles which he
                    published were the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">Major</hi>
                    of Matthew Paris, the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Anglicana</hi> of Walsiηgham, the life of Alfred <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Gesta</hi><hi rend="italic">Aelfredi)</hi> of Asser, and the <hi
                        rend="italic">Itinerarium</hi> of Giraldus Cambrensis. The extreme licence
                    in which he indulged in altering the texts of these writers, and especially that
                    of Matthew Paris, renders his editions, however, almost worthless, and has met
                    with the severest censures from succeeding historical scholars.</p>
                <p>But, notwithstanding these errors and defects, Parker’s memory must ever be
                    venerated by Englishmen and by scholars; and his country, his university, and
                    his college were alike laid by him under no ordinary debt of gratitude. He
                    revived the study of Saxon literature and of the <hi rend="italic">origines</hi>
                    of our national history; and the <hi rend="italic">scriptorium</hi> which he
                    maintained at Lambeth (after the fashion of the mediaeval monasteries) was a
                    busy scene where the transcriber, the illuminator, the engraver, and the
                    bookbinder each plied his craft, to the no small after advantage of letters and
                    of art. Among the printers whom he patronized were Eichard Jugge, John Day, and
                    Richard Grafton. As a collector of books and manuscripts he was indefatigable;
                    and one of his numerous agents, named Batman, is stated to have collected in
                    four years no less than 6700 volumes, chiefly works which had been scattered on
                    the dissolution of the monasteries. The greater part of this splendid
                    collection, styled by Fuller “the sun of English antiquity,” Parker bequeathed
                    to Corpus Christi College. His interest in his university at large did not
                    diminish after his elevation to the archbishopric, and the Regent Walk (an
                    improved approach to the public schools) and the univeι ’ sity library were
                    long-standing memorials of his munificence. He also founded a grammar school at
                    Rochdale, and numerous scholarships and annual charities elsewhere. That he died
                    rich cannot be denied; and his ençmies have asserted that he was far from
                    scrupulous in the means which he employed in acquiring wealth, especially in
                    “admitting children to cures.” On the other hand, it must be allowed that he
                    made a good and generous use of his wealth, and his contemporary biographer
                    claims for him the rare merit of combining strict economy with liberality.
                    Parker had five children. Of these the eldest, John, who was knighted by King
                    James in 1603, alone survived him; he died at Cambridge in 1620, in great want,
                    the cost of his funeral being defrayed by Corpus Christi College.</p>
                <p>The best source of information in all that relates to Parker is his <hi
                        rend="italic">Life anil Acts,</hi> by Strype (3 vols., Oxford, 1824), a
                    performance on which that distinguished antiquary bestowed even more than his
                    usual amount of painstaking research. A copy of the folio edition (1711),
                    preserved in the library of St John’s College, Cambridge, is enriched with
                    numerous and valuable MS. notes by the donor, the eminent Thomas Baker. The
                    titles of the books which he presented to his own college will be found in
                    Nasmith's <hi rend="italic">Cat. of the C.C. ΛfSS.</hi> (1777). (J. B. Μ.)</p>
