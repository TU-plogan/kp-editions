                    14th century. Though it has lost its importance as a fortified town, and no
                    longer deserves the designation of “City of the Hundred Towers,” Pavia is still
                    for the most part surrounded by its ramparts, which in a circuit of about 3∣
                    miles enclose an area of 400 acres. Several of its buildings are of great
                    architectural interest. The basilica of San Michele is one of the finest
                    specimens extant of the Lombard style (cf. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Architecture,</hi> vol. ii. p. 435), and as it was within its walls that the
                    crown was placed on the head of the “kings of Italy,” from whom the house of
                    Savoy claims to be descended, it has received the legal title of Basilica Reale
                    (royal decree of 1863). A careful restoration has since been effected. The
                    cathedral of San Stefano, of which the first stone was laid by Bishop Ascanio
                    Sforza in 1488, is still unfinished, the original design by Cristoforo Rocchi, a
                    pupil of Bramante, consisting of a central octagon from which four arms
                    projected so as to form a cross. In the interior is the tomb of St Augustine, a
                    remarkable specimen of 14th-century sculpture, which presents the saint
                    life-size in pontifical robes, and is surrounded by a profusion of bas-reliefs
                    and minor figures representing saints of his order, liberal arts, and cardinal
                    virtues—in all, 420 heads. The relics which it enshrines are said to have been
                    brought from Hippo to Sardinia by African refugees, purchased in 724 by
                    Liutprand, and deposited in the now ruined church of San Pietro in Ciel d’Oro,
                    and thence transferred to the cathedral subsequent to their rediscovery in 1695.
                    Beneath the high altar is the tomb of Boetius, whose remains were also brought
                    from San Pietro; and from the roof of the building is suspended the lance of
                    Roland (Orlando).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    famous Certosa of Pavia, one of the most magnificent monasteries in the world,
                    is not situated within the city, but at a distance of about 5 miles towards the
                    north. Its founder, Gian Galeazzo Visconti (to whom we also owe the Milan
                    cathedral), laid the first stone on 27th August 1396, and the building was
                    nominally finished in 1542. A parallelogram, about 140 yards long by 110 broad,
                    is surrounded on all sides by a lofty cloister formed of 123 arches. The church,
                    whose marble façade is more richly decorated than any other in north Italy, is
                    in the form of a Latin cross, 253 feet long by 177 feet wide, with three naves
                    and a vast octagonal dome. In the south transept stands the mausoleum, in
                    Carrara marble, of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, designed by Galeazzo Pellegrini in
                    1490; and in the north transept are the marble statues of Lodovico Sforza il
                    Moro and his consort Beatrice by Cristoforo Solari. The Carthusian monks, to
                    whom the monastery was entrusted from the first by its founder, were bound to
                    employ a certain proportion of their annual revenue in prosecuting the work till
                    its completion; and even after 1542 they voluntarily continued to expend large
                    sums on further decoration. The Certosa of Pavia is thus a practical text-book
                    of Italian art for well-nigh three centuries (see Durelli, <hi rend="italic"

                    in 1843, and was exempted from confiscation in 1866. The lead was all stripped
                    from the roof in 1797 by order of the French Directory; but the building as a

                    emperor Charles IV., but claiming to have its first origin in a school founded
                    by Charlemagne) has faculties of law, medicine, and science. The professors
                    number between forty and fifty, but the students have decreased from 1475 in
                    1860 to 604 in 1881-82. Among its subsidiary establishments are two colleges—the
                    Borromeo and the Ghislieri—founded respectively by Archbishop Borromeo (1563)
                    and Pope Pius V. (1569) for the gratuitous maintenance of a certain number of
                    poor students; a museum of natural history, instituted in 1772 under
                    Spallanzani; a botanical garden, commenced in 1774; an agricultural garden,
                    bestowed on the university by Napoleon in 1806; and the oldest anatomical
                    cabinet in Italy. The university library was founded by Maria Theresa in 1754;
                    the famous collection of books which Gian Galeazzo brought together by the aid
                    of Petrarch was carried off to Blois by the French in 1500. The civil hospital
                    of San Matteo is a large and flourishing institution, dating from 1449; like the
                    Borromeo and Ghislieri colleges, it has large landed estates in the circondario.
                    Comparatively few manufactures are prosecuted in Pavia, but there is
                    considerable trade by water as well as by rail, barges being able to pass down
                    the Po to the Adriatic and along the canal to Milan. The population of the city
                    was 27,885 in 1871 and 27,792 in 1881, or, including the suburbs Ticino,
                    Calvenzano, and Borgorato, 29,836; that of the commune was 29,618 in 1871 and
                    29,941 in 1881.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Ticinum—it was not till the close of the 7th
                    century that the city was called Papia or Pavia—was a place of some importance
                    under the Roman empire, having, according to Pliny, been founded by two Gallic
                    tribes at the time of the first Gallic immigration into Italy. It was at Ticinum
                    that Augustus met the funeral procession of Drusus; and Claudius II. was first
                    saluted emperor by the garrison in the city. Ravaged by Attila in 452 and by
                    Odoacer in 476, Ticinum was, after 489, raised to much more than its former
                    position by Theodoric the Goth, who restored its fortifications and made it the
                    seat of a royal palace. From Theodoric’s successors it was recovered for the
                    Eastern empire by Narses; but the imperial garrison, after a siege of more than
                    three years, was obliged by famine to surrender to the Lombards in 573, and
                    Ticinum-Pavia became, as the capital of the Lombard kingdom, one of the leading
                    cities of Italy. By the conquest of Pavia and the capture of Desiderius in 774
                    Charlemagne completely destroyed the Lombard supremacy; but the city continued
                    to be the centre of the Carolingian power in Italy, and a royal residence was
                    built in the neighbourhood (Corteolona on the Olona). It was in San Michele
                    Maggiore in Pavia that Berengar of Friuli and his quasi-regal successors down to
                    Berengar II. and Adalbert II. were crowned “kings of Italy.” Under the reign of
                    the first the city was sacked and burned by the Hungarians, and the bishop was
                    among those who perished in the flames. At Pavia was celebrated in 951 the
                    marriage of Otto I. and Adelheid (Adelaide), which exercised so important an
                    influence on the relations of the empire and Italy; but, when the succession to
                    the crown of Italy came to be disputed between the emperor Henry II. and Harduin
                    of Ivrea, the city sided strongly with the latter. Laid in ruins by Henry, who
                    was attacked by the citizens on the night after his coronation in 1004, it was
                    none the less ready to close its gates on Conrad the Salic in 1026. The jealousy
                    which had meanwhile been growing up between Pavia and Milan having in 1056
                    broken out into open war, Pavia in the long run had recourse to the hated
                    emperors to aid her against her now more hated rival; and for the most part she
                    remained, through all the broils and revolutions of the time, attached to the
                    Ghibelline party till the latter part of the 14th century. From 1360, when
                    Galeazzo was appointed imperial vicar by Charles IV., Pavia became practically a
                    possession of the Visconti family, and in due course formed part of the duchy of
                    Milan. For the success which attended its insurrection against the French
                    garrison in 1499 it paid a terrible penalty in 1500, being both given over to
                    pillage and forced to furnish a contribution of 50,000 gold crowns. Having been
                    strongly fortified by Charles V., the city was in 1525 able to bid defiance to
                    Francis I., who was so disastrously beaten in the vicinity; but two years later
                    the French under Lautrec subjected it to a sack of seven days. In 1655 Prince
                    Thomas of Savoy invested Pavia with an army of 20,000 Frenchmen, but had to
                    withdraw after fifty-two days’ siege. During the 18th century the city had its
                    full share of the wars. The Austrians under Prince Eugène occupied it in 1706,
                    the French in 1733, and the French and Spaniards in 1745; and the Austrians were
                    again in possession from 1746 till 1796. In May of that year it was seized for
                    the French republic by Napoleon, who, to punish it for an insurrection,
                    condemned it to three hours’ pillage. The revolutionary movement of February
                    1848 was crushed by the Austrians and the university was closed; and, though the
                    Sardinian forces obtained possession in March, the Austrians soon recovered
                    their ground. It was not till 1859 that Pavia passed with the rest of Lombardy
                    to the Sardinian crown.</p>
                <p>At several periods Pavia has been the centre of great intellectual activity. It
                    was in a tower which, previous to 1584, stood near the church of Dell’

                    printing was introduced in 1471. Two of the bishops of Pavia have been raised to
                    the papal throne as John XIV. and Julius III. Lanfranc, Pope John XIV., Porta
                    the anatomist, and Cremona the mathematician were born in the city.</p>
