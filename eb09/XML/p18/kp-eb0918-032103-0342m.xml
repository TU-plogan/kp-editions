                    type="authorial"><p>“Parakeet” (in Shakespeare, 1 <hi rend="italic">Hen.
                    IV.,</hi> ii. 3, 88, “Paraquito ”) is said by the same authority to be from the
                    Spanish <hi rend="italic">Periquito</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Perroqueto,</hi> a
                    small Parrot, diminutive of <hi rend="italic">Peri,co,</hi> a Parrot, which
                    again may be a diminutive from <hi rend="italic">Pedro,</hi> the proper name.
                    Parakeet (spelt in various ways in English) is usually applied to the smaller
                    kinds of Parrots, especially those which have long tails, not as <hi
                    rend="italic">Perroquet</hi> in French, which is used as a general term for all
                    Parrots, <hi rend="italic">Perruche,</hi> or sometimes <hi rend="italic"
                    >Perriehe,</hi> being the ordinary name for what we call Parakeet. The old
                    English “Popinjay” and the old French <hi rend="italic">Pαpegαut</hi> have
                    almost passed out of use, but the German <hi rend="italic">Papagei</hi> and
                    Italian <hi rend="italic">Papagaio</hi> still continue in vogue. These names can
                    be traced to the Arabic <hi rend="italic">Babaghã·,</hi> but the source of that
                    word is unknown. The Anglo-Saxon name of the Parret, a river in Somerset, is
                    Pedreda or Pedrida, which at first sight looks as if it had to do with the
                    proper name, Petrus; but Prof. Skeat believes there is no connexion between
                    them—the latter portion of the word being <hi rend="italic">rid,</hi> a
                    stream.</p></note> the name given generally to a large and very natural group of
                    Birds, which for more than a score of centuries have attracted attention, not
                    only from their gaudy plumage, but, at first and chiefly, it would seem, from
                    the readiness with which many of them learn to imitate the sounds they hear,
                    repeating the words and even phrases of human speech with a fidelity that is
                    often astonishing. It is said that no representation of any Parrot appears in
                    Egyptian art, nor does any reference to a bird of the kind occur in the Bible,
                    whence it has been concluded that neither painters nor writers had any knowledge
                    of it. Aristotle is commonly supposed to be the first author who mentions a
                    Parrot; but this is an error, for nearly a century earlier Ctesias in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Indica</hi> (cap. 3),<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The passage seems to have escaped the notice of all
                    naturalists except Broderip, who mentioned it in his article “Psittacidae,” in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Penny Cyclopaedia</hi> (vol. xix. p. 83).</p></note> under
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">βlττακoς (Bittacus),</hi> so neatly described a
                    bird which could speak an “Indian” language—naturally, as he seems to have
                    thought—or Greek—if it had been taught so to do—about as big as a Sparrow-Hawk
                    <hi rend="italic">(Hierax),</hi> with a purple face and a black beard, otherwise
                    blue green <hi rend="italic">(cyaneus)</hi> and vermilion in colour, so that
                    there cannot be much risk in declaring that he must have had before him a male
                    example of what is now commonly known as the Blossom-headed Parakeet, and to
                    ornithologists as <hi rend="italic">Palaeοrnis cyanocephalus,</hi> an inhabitant
                    of many parts of India. Much ingenuity has been exercised in the endeavour to
                    find the word whence this, and the later form of the Greek name, was derived,
                    but to little or no purpose. After Ctesias comes Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >ψιττdκη</hi><hi rend="italic">(Psittace),</hi> which Sundevall supposes him to
                    have described only from hearsay, a view that the present writer is inclined to
                    think insufficiently supported. But this matters little, for there can be no
                    doubt that the Indian conquests of Alexander were the means of making the Parrot
                    better known in Europe, and it is in reference to this fact that another Eastern
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Palaeornis</hi> now bears the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">P. alexandri,</hi> though from the localities it inhabits it could
                    hardly have had anything to do with the Macedonian hero. That Africa had Parrots
                    does not seem to have been discovered by the ancients till long after, as Pliny
                    tells us (vi. 29) that they were first met with beyond the limits of Upper Egypt
                    by explorers employed by Nero. These birds, highly prized from the first,
                    reprobated by the moralist, and celebrated by more than one classical poet, in
                    the course of time were brought in great numbers to Rome, and ministered in
                    various ways to the luxury of the age. Not only were they lodged in cages of
                    tortoise-shell <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n343/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0343-0322"/> and ivory, with silver wires, but they were
                    professedly esteemed as delicacies for the table, and one emperor is said to
                    have fed his lions upon them! But there would be little use in dwelling longer
                    on these topics. With the decline of the Roman empire the demand for Parrots in
                    Europe lessened, and so the supply dwindled, yet all knowledge of them was not
                    wholly lost, and they are occasionally mentioned by one writer or another until
                    in the 15th century began that career of geographical discovery which has since
                    proceeded uninterruptedly. This immediately brought with it the knowledge of
                    many more forms of these birds than had ever before been seen, for whatever
                    races of men were visited by European navigators—whether in the East Indies or
                    the West, whether in Africa or in the islands of the . Pacific—it was almost
                    invariably found that even the most savage tribes had tamed some kind of Parrot;
                    and, moreover, experience soon showed that no bird was more easily kept alive on
                    board ship and brought home, while, if it had not the merit of “speech,” it was
                    almost certain to be of beautiful plumage. Yet so numerous is the group that
                    even now new species of Parrots are not uncommonly recognized, though, looking
                    to the way in which the most secluded parts of the world are being ransacked, we
                    must soon come to an end of this.</p>
                <p>The home of the vast majority of Parrot-forms is unquestionably within the
                    tropics, but the popular belief that Parrots are tropical birds only is a great
                    mistake. In North America the Carolina Parakeet, <hi rend="italic">Conurus
                    carolinensis,</hi> at the beginning of the present century used to range in
                    summer as high as the shores of Lakes Erie and Ontario— a latitude equal to that
                    of the south of France; and even within the last forty years it reached,
                    according to trustworthy information, the junction of the Ohio and the
                    Mississippi, though now its limits have been so much curtailed that its
                    occurrence in any but the Gulf States is doubtful. In South America, at least
                    four species of Parrots are found in Chili or La Plata, and one, <hi
                    rend="italic">Conurus patagonus,</hi> is pretty common on the bleak coast of the
                    Strait of Magellan. In Africa, it is true that no species is known to extend to
                    within some ten degrees of the tropic of Cancer; but <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pionias</hi><hi rend="italic">robustus</hi> inhabits territories lying quite as
                    far to the southward of the tropic of Capricorn. In India the northern range of
                    the group is only bounded by the slopes of the Himalaya, and further to the
                    eastward Parrots are not only abundant over the whole of the Malay Archipelago,
                    as well as Australia and Tasmania, but two very well-defined Families are
                    peculiar to New Zealand and its adjacent islands (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Kak
                    apo,</hi> vol. xiii. p. 825; and <hi rend="smallcaps">Nestor,</hi> vol. xvii. p.
                    354). No Parrot has recently inhabited the Palaearctic Region<note

                    one (the <hi rend="italic">Conurus carolinensis,</hi> just mentioned) probably
                    belongs to the Nearctic; nor are Parrots represented by many different forms in
                    either the Ethiopian or the Indian Regions. In continental Asia the distribution
                    of Parrots is rather remarkable. None extend further to the westward than the
                    valley of the Indus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    statements that have been made, and even repeated by writers of authority, as to
                    the occurrence of “a green parrot” in Syria (Chesney, <hi rend="italic">Exped.
                    Survey Euphrates and Tigris,</hi> i. pp. 443, 537) and of a Parrot in Turkestan
                    <hi rend="italic">(Jour. As. Soc. Bengal,</hi> viii. p. 1007) originated with
                    gentlemen who had no ornithological knowledge, and are evidently
                    erroneous.</p></note> which, considering the nature of the country in
                    Baluchistan and Afghanistan, is perhaps intelligible enough: but it is not so
                    easy to under stand why none are found either in Cochin China or China proper;
                    and they are also wanting in the Philippine Islands, which is the more
                    remarkable and instructive when we find how abundant they are in the groups a
                    little further to the southward. Indeed Air Wallace has well remarked that the
                    portion of the earth’s surface which contains the largest number of Parrots, in
                    proportion to its area, is undoubtedly that covered by the islands extending
                    from Celebes to the Solomon group. “The area of these islands is probably not
                    one-fifteenth of that of the four tropical regions, yet they contain from
                    one-fifth to onefourth of all the known Parrots” <hi rend="italic">(Geogr.
                    Distr. Animals,</hi> ii. p. 330). He goes on to observe also that in this area
                    are found many of the most remarkable forms—all the red Lories, the great black
                    Cockatoos, the pigmy <hi rend="italic">Nasi-ternae,</hi> and other
                    singularities. In South America the species of Parrots, though numerically
                    nearly as abundant, are far less diversified in form, and all of them seem
                    capable of being referred to two or, at most, three sections. The species that
                    has the widest range, and that by far, is the common Ring-necked Parakeet, <hi
                    rend="italic">Palaeornis</hi><hi rend="italic">torquatus,</hi> a well-known
                    cage-bird which is found from the mouth of the Gambia across Africa to the coast
                    of the Red Sea, as well as throughout the whole of India, Ceylon, and Burmah to
                    Tenasserim.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tt is right
                    to state, however, that the African examples of this bird are said to be
                    distinguishable from the Asiatic by their somewhat shorter wings and weaker
                    bill, and hence they are considered by some authorities to form a distinct
                    species or subspecies, <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic">docilis</hi>;
                    but in thus regarding them the difference of locality seems to have influenced
                    opinion, and without that difference they would scarcely have been separated,
                    for in many other groups of birds distinctions so slight are regarded as barely
                    evidence of local races.</p></note> On the other hand there are plenty of cases
                    of Parrots which are restricted to an extremely small area—often an island of
                    insignificant size, as <hi rend="italic">Conurus xantholaemus,</hi> confined to
                    the island of St Thomas in the Antilles, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Palaeornis</hi><hi rend="italic">exsul</hi> to that of Rodriguez in the Indian
                    Ocean—to say nothing of the remarkable instance of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nestor</hi><hi rend="italic">productus</hi> before mentioned (vol. xvii. p.
                    355).</p>
                <p>The systematic treatment of this very natural group of birds has long been a
                    subject of much difficulty, and the difference of opinion among those who have
                    made it their study is most striking, for there is hardly an approach to
                    unanimity to be found, beyond the somewhat general belief which has grown up
                    within the last forty years that the Parrots should be regarded as forming a
                    distinct Order of the Class, though there are some men, justly accounted
                    authorities, who even question this much. A few systematists, among whom
                    Bonaparte was chief, placed them at the top of the Class, conceiving that they
                    were the analogues of the <hi rend="italic">Primates</hi> among mammals. Prof.
                    Huxley has recognized the <hi rend="italic">Psittacomorphae</hi> as forming 'one
                    of the principal groups of Carinate birds, and, by whatever name we call them,
                    that much seems to be evident. It will here, however, be unnecessary to discuss
                    the exact rank which the Parrots as a group should hold, for sufficient on that
                    score has already been said above <hi rend="smallcaps">(Ornithology,</hi> p.
                    47), and it is quite enough of a task to consider the most natural or—if we
                    cannot hope at present to reach that—at least the most expedient way of
                    subdividing them. It must be admitted as a reproach to ornithologists that so
                    little satisfactory progress has been made in this direction, for of that the
                    existing differences of opinion—differences as wide as have ever existed in any
                    branch of ornithic taxonomy—are sufficient proof. Moreover, the result is all
                    the more disheartening, seeing that there is no group of exotic birds that
                    affords equal opportunities for anatomical examination, since almost every genus
                    extant, and more than two-thirds of the species, have within recent times been
                    kept in confinement in one or another of our zoological gardens, and at their
                    death have furnished subi ects for dissection. Y et the laudable attempt <pb

                    successful, and it cannot be affirmed positively that the latest arrangement of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Psittaci</hi> is really much more natural than that
                    planned by Buffon one hundred and twenty years ago. He was of course unaware of
                    the existence of some of the most remarkable forms of the group, in particular
                    of <hi rend="italic">St rig ops</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Nestor·,</hi> but he
                    began by making two great divisions of those that he did know, separating the
                    Parrots of the Old World from the Parrots of the New, and subdividing each of
                    these divisions into various sections somewhat in accordance with the names they
                    had received in popular language—a practice he followed on many other occasions,
                    for it seems to have been with him a belief that there is more truth in the
                    discrimination· of the unlearned than the scientific are apt to allow. The
                    result is that he produced a plan which is comparatively simple and certainly
                    practical, while as just stated it cannot be confidently declared to be
                    unnatural. However, not to go so far back as twenty years, in 1867-68 Dr Finsch
                    published at Leyden an elaborate monograph of the Parrots,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Family, in which he admitted 26 genera, forming 5 Subfamilies:—(1) that composed
                    of <hi rend="italic">Strigops</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(Kakapo,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ut supr.)</hi> only; (2) that containing the crested forms or
                    Cockatoos; (3) one which he named <hi rend="italic">Sittacinae,</hi> comprising
                    all the long-tailed species—a somewhat heterogeneous assemblage, made up of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Macaws</hi> (vol. xv. p. 130) and what are commonly known as
                    Parakeets; (4) the Parrots proper with short tails; and (5) the so-called
                    “brush-tongued” Parrots, consisting of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lories</hi>
                    (vol. xv. p. 7) and <hi rend="smallcaps">Nestors</hi><hi rend="italic">(ut
                    sup.).</hi> Except in the characters of the last group he recognized none that
                    were not external, and that fact is sufficient to cast suspicion on his scheme
                    being natural.</p>
                <p>In 1874 the late Prof. Garrod communicated to the Zoological Society the results
                    of his dissection of examples of 82 species of Parrots, which had lived in its
                    gardens, and these results were published in its <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proceedings</hi> for that year (pp. 586-598, pls. 70, 71). The principal points
                    to which he attended were the arrangement of the carotid artery, and the
                    presence or absence of an ambiens muscle, an oil-gland, and a furcula; but
                    except as regards the last character he unfortunately almost wholly neglected
                    the rest of the skeleton, looking upon such osteological features as the
                    formation of an orbital ring and peculiarities of the atlas as “of minor
                    importance ”—an estimate to which nearly every anatomist will demur; for, though
                    undoubtedly the characters afforded by blood-vessels and muscles are useful in
                    default of osteological characters, it is obvious that these last, drawn from
                    the very framework of any vertebrate’s structure, cannot be inferior in value to
                    the former. Indeed the investigations of Prof. A. Milne-Edwards <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ann. Sc. Nat.</hi><hi rend="italic">Zoologie,</hi> ser. 5, vi.
                    pp. 91-111; viii. pp. 145-156) on the bones of the head in various Psittacine
                    forms make it clear that these alone present features of much significance, and
                    if his investigations had not been carried on for a special object, but had been
                    extended to other parts of the skeleton, there is little doubt that they would
                    have removed some of the greatest difficulties. The one osteological character
                    to which Garrod trusted, namely, the condition of the furcula, cannot be said to
                    contribute much towards a safe basis of classification. That it is wholly absent
                    in some genera of Parrots had long been known, but its imperfect ossification,
                    it appears, is not attended in some cases by any diminution of volant powers,
                    which tends to shew that it is an unimportant character, an inference confirmed
                    by the fact that it is found wanting in genera placed geographically so far
                    apart that the loss must have had in some of them an independent origin.
                    Summarilv expressed, Garrod’s scheme was to divide the Parrots into two
                    Families, <hi rend="italic">Palaeornithidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Psittacidae,</hi> assigning to the former three Subfamilies <hi rend="italic"
                    >Palaeornithinae, Cacatuinae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">String opinae,</hi> and
                    to the latter four, <hi rend="italic">Arinae, Pyrrhurvnae, Platycercinae,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Chrysotinae.</hi> That each of these sections, except the
                    <hi rend="italic">Cacatuinae,</hi> is artificial any regard to osteology would
                    shew, and it would be useless here to further criticize his method, except to
                    say that its greatest merit is that, as before mentioned <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(Love-Bird,</hi> vol. xv. p. 28), he gave sufficient reasons for distinguishing
                    between the genera <hi rend="italic">Agapornis</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Psittacula.</hi> In the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">für
                    Ornithologie</hi> for 1881 Dr Reichenow published a <hi rend="italic"

                    external characters only. He makes 9 Families of the group, and recognizes 45
                    genera, and 442 species, besides subspecies. His grouping is generally very
                    different from Garrod’s, but displays as much artificiality; for instance, <hi
                    rend="italic">Nestor</hi> is referred to the Family which is otherwise composed
                    of the Cockatoos. Still more recently we have the arrangement followed by Mr
                    Sclater in the <hi rend="italic">List</hi> of those exhibited of late years in
                    the gardens of the Zoological Society, and published in 1883. This is more in
                    accordance with the views that the present writer is inclined to hold, and these
                    views may here, though with much diffidence, be stated. First there is <hi
                    rend="italic">Strigops,</hi> which must stand alone, unless, as before hinted
                    (vol. xiii. p. 826), <hi rend="italic">Geopsittacus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pezoporus</hi> may have to be placed with it in a Family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Strigopidae.</hi> Next <hi rend="italic">Nestor,</hi> from its osteological
                    peculiarities, seems to form a very separate type, and represents a second
                    Family <hi rend="italic">Nestoridae.</hi> These two Families being removed, all
                    the Parrots that remain will be found to have a great resemblance among
                    themselves, and perhaps it is impossible justifiably to establish any more
                    Families. For the present at any rate it would seem advisable to keep them in a
                    single Family <hi rend="italic">Psittacidae,</hi> but there can be no objection
                    to separating them into several Subfamilies. The Cockatoos, for instance, can be
                    without much difficulty defined, and may stand as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cacatuinae,</hi> and then the brush-tongued Lories as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lorünae,</hi> after which the Macaws, <hi rend="italic">Arinae—</hi> including
                    possibly <hi rend="italic">Conurus</hi> and its allies. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Platycercus</hi> and its neighbours may form another section, and the same with
                    <hi rend="italic">Palaeornis·,</hi> but for the rest there is not yet material
                    for arriving at any determination, though <hi rend="italic">Chrysotis</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Psittacus</hi> seem to furnish two different types, to the
                    former of which <hi rend="italic">Psittacula</hi> appears to bear much the same
                    relation as <hi rend="italic">Agapornis</hi> does to the latter. Amongst the
                    genera <hi rend="italic">Chrysotis, Palaeornis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Psittacus</hi> are probably to be found the most highly organized forms, and it
                    is these birds in which the faculty of so-called “speech” reaches its maximum
                    development. But too much importance must not be assigned to that fact; since,
                    while <hi rend="italic">Psittacus</hi><hi rend="italic">erithacus—</hi> the
                    well-known Grey Parrot with a red tail—is the most accomplished spokesman of the
                    whole group, it is fairly approached by some species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chrysotis</hi> —usually styled Amazons—and yet its congener <hi rend="italic"
                    >P. timneh</hi> is not known to be at all loquacious.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In connexion with the “speaking” of Parrots,
                    one of the most curious circumstances is that recorded by Humboldt, who in South

                    literally dead language, the whole tribe of Indians, Atures by name, who alone
                    had spoken it having become extinct.</p></note></p>
                <p>Considering the abundance of Parrots both as species and individuals, and their
                    wide extent over the globe, it is surprising how little is known of their habits
                    in a wild state. Even the species with which Englishmen and their descendants
                    have been more in contact than any other has an almost unwritten history,
                    compared with that of many other birds; and, seeing how it is oppressed by and

                    and will probably be accomplished before several interesting and some disputed
                    points in its economy have been decided. The same fate possibly awaits several
                    of the Australian species and all those in New Zealand—indeed the experience of
                    small islands only foreshadows what will happen in tracts of greater extent,
                    though there more time is required to produce the same result; but, the result
                    being inevitable, those who are favourably placed for observations should
                    neglect no opportunities of making them ere it be too late. <hi rend="smallcaps"
