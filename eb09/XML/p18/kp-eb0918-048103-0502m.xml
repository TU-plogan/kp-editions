                    George’s Channel, and on the N. by Cardigan Bay. Its length from Strumble Head
                    to St Gowan’s Head is about 30 miles, and its average breadth a little over 20.
                    The area is 393,682 acres, or about 615 square miles.</p>
                <p>The coast-line is extremely irregular and extends to over 100 miles, the
                    principal inlets being Newport Bay; Fishguard Bay, 3 miles in breadth, with an
                    average depth of from 30 to 70 feet, and possessing a good anchorage-ground of
                    mud and sand; St Bride’s Bay, 8 miles long by 8 broad; and Milford Haven, a
                    splendid landlocked natural harbour, having a length of about 20 miles, and
                    including numerous small bays and creeks. A considerable number of islands
                    adjoin the coast, the largest being Ramsey, which (excepting some small rocks)
                    includes the most westerly land in Wales; Skomer and Stockham, between St
                    Bride’s Bay and Milford Haven; and Caldy, south of Tenby. The southern coast,
                    consisting of bare, broken, and beetling limestone cliffs, in many cases 200
                    feet in height, is exposed to the full force of the Atlantic, which in several
                    places has hollowed out long funnel-shaped cavities into which the sea has
                    entrance, the most remarkable being Bosheston Mere, near St Gowan’s Head. Owing
                    to the ocean storms the county is almost bare of trees, and the bareness is not
                    relieved or atoned for by mountains, although in many parts of the coast the
                    scenery is wildly picturesque. For the most part the surface is gently
                    undulating, the small rounded hills rising in height towards the north, until
                    they merge in the Preseley range, which runs from east to west and divides the
                    county into two parts, the highest summits being Cwm-Cerwyn, 1754 feet, in the
                    centre of the chain, the lesser eminences of Moel Trigarn and Carn-meyn in the
                    east, and Bwlch-gwnt and Foel Eryr in the west. The principal rivers are the
                    Teifi, which forms for a short distance the north-eastern boundary of the county
                    with Cardiganshire; the Cleddy or Cleddou, of which there are two branches, an
                    eastern and a western, both flowing south and mingling their waters in Milford
                    Haven; the Nevern, which flows north into Newport Bay; and the Gwaen, which
                    flows through a narrow and beautifully-wooded glen to Fishguard Bay.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology and Minerals.—</hi> Three-fourths of the county,
                    including the northern portion stretching westwards to the western Cleddou
                    river, and, with certain exceptions, to the Channel, is formed of Llandeilo
                    flags. The Carboniferous strata from the South-Wales coal-field extend across
                    the centre of the county from east to west, their area narrowing towards the
                    west. The Pembrokeshire coal-field differs entirely from the South-Wales
                    coal-field both in the lie of the strata and in the character of its beds, due
                    to the occurrence of volcanic action. It is separated also from the main field
                    by an interpolation of Old Red Sandstone. North, east, and north-west it is
                    bounded by beds of mountain limestone and millstone grit, and on the south by
                    Cambrian beds and by the ocean, below which the Coal-measures extend. The strata
                    are composed of Coal-measures, Carboniferous Limestone, and Old Red Sandstone,
                    and are frequently extremely contorted. Igneous stratified rocks also occur in
                    the Preseley range, and in the neighbourhood of St David’s Head. The coal is
                    anthracite, and when put on the fire in a wet state emits a blue flame without
                    smoke. About 80,000 tons are now dug annually, the coal being used for furnaces
                    and for smelting and brewing purposes. There is a lead mine at Llanfyrnach, from
                    which a considerable yield of silver is obtained, the annual value of the ore
                    raised being about £15,000. In caves explored near Tenby and on Caldy Island
                    there have been found remains of various species of extinct mammals.</p>

                    in most other districts of the United Kingdom. Towards the north, especially on
                    the higher ground, it is much colder, and damp fogs and rain are frequent. The
                    most common soil is a dark-grey loam, which is much improved by admixture with
                    lime and sand. The sandstone and limestone formation in the south produces an
                    excellent quick soil, admirably adapted for horticulture, which is generally
                    pursued in this district. In the more northerly and higher regions more
                    attention is given to cattle-rearing and dairy-farming than to the raising of
                    crops or sheep-farming. The farmhouses and buildings, which formerly were rude
                    and primitive in construction, with low mud-walls, are now generally built of
                    stone on improved methods. The cottages of the peasants are, however, still for
                    the most part uncomfortable huts built of a clay and straw compound called
                    “clom.” Great improvements have late!y taken place in farming, owing in great
                    part to the enlightened encouragement of the landlords.</p>
                <p>From 5935 in 1875 the number of holdings had increased to 5999 in 1880 (the
                    latest return). Nearly four-fifths, 4222, were not above 50 acres eaeh in
                    extent, 837 were between 50 and 100 acres, 853 between 100 and 300, and only 87
                    above 300 acres. In 1883 there were 305,644 acres, or about 77 per cent, of the
                    total area, under tillage, com crops occupying 55,011 acres, green crops 13,266,
                    rotation grasses 28,409, peπnanent pasture 206,052, and fallow 2906. The
                    principal cereals are barley occupying 24,799 acres and oats (of which the black
                    species occupy a large area) 25,494 acres, wheat occupying only 4604 acres.
                    Potatoes were grown on 3042 acres, turnips and swedes on 8038, and mangolds on
                    1322. Horses in 1883 numbered 14,383 (of which 8665 were used solely for
                    purposes of agriculture), cattle 83,436 (of which 31,779 were cows and heifers
                    in milk or in calf), sheep 91,901, and pigs 27,623. The principal breed of
                    cattle are the native Castlemartins, black in colour, and well suited to the
                    climate and the system of farming, as they both fatten readily and yield large
                    supplies of milk. Herefords and Alderneys have lately been introduced on many
                    farms, but the old breed is still the favourite.</p>
                <p>According to the latest return the land was divided among 3121 owners, possessing
                    356,699 acres, at an annual valuation of £389,701, or about £1 Is. lOd. per
                    acre. The estimated amount of common or waste land was 11,260 acres. Of the
                    owners, 1492, or about 44 per cent., possessed less than one acre each. The
                    following owned over 5000 acres each, viz., C. E. G. Phillips, 18,729 acres;
                    earl of Cawdor, 17,736; Sir Owen Scourfield, Bart., 11,243; Lord Kensington,
                    6537; bishop of St David’s, 5651; George Harries, 5173; and Μ. A. Sawin,

                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> Flannels are woven in various towns, and
                    are the principal textile manufacture of the county; there are also rope and
                    sail works, and hat-making is practised. Many of the inhabitants are engaged in
                    coal-mining and in fishing. At Pater there is a very extensive dockyard, and
                    shipbuilding is carried on at several other ports. Since the opening up of
                    railway communication the shipping trade, and the mining and other industries,
                    have made extensive progress, but the railway connexion is still somewhat
                    imperfect.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> The county includes seven
                    hundreds; the municipal boroughs of Haverfordwest (6398), Pembroke (14,156), and
                    Tenby (4750), and part (2058) of the municipal borough of Cardigan, the
                    remainder of which is in Cardiganshire. In addition to Haverfordwest, Pembroke,
                    and Tenby, there are four other market towns,—Fishguard (2009), Milford (3812),
                    Narberth (2334), and Newport (1504). The county is divided into three poor-law
                    unions—Haverfordwest, Pembroke, and Narberth. It is included in the
                    south-western circuit. It has one court of quarter-sessions, and is divided into
                    seven petty and special sessional divisions. One member is returned to
                    parliament for the county, one for the Haverfordwest district of boroughs,
                    consisting of Fishguard, Haverfordwest, and Narberth, and one for the Pembroke
                    district of boroughs, consisting of Milford, Pembroke, Tenby, and Wiston.
                    Pembrokeshire contains 153 civil parishes, with part of one other. It
                    constitutes the archdeaconry of St David’s in the diocese of the same name, and
                    forms part of the province of Canterbury. From 56,280 in 1801 the population had
                    increased in 1821 to 74,009, in 1851 to 94,140, but in 1871 it had diminished to
                    91,998, and in 1881 to 91,824, of whom 43,449 were males and 48,375 females. The
                    number of inhabited houses in 1881 was 19,462, the average number of persons to
                    an acre 0'23, and of acres to a person 4 ’ 26.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History,</hi> &lt;f,∙c.—Although the limestone caves of
                    Pembrokeshire abound with relics of the Pleistocene fauna, no traces have as yet
                    been discovered of Palaeolithic man. Neolithic remains are plentiful. In caves,
                    cliff-castles, bogs, kitchen-middens, &amp;c., implements of the polished stone
                    age are frequently found, but, strange to say, the long barrows typical of this
                    period are wanting; dolmens or cromlechs, however, are very common: the ordnance
                    map gives eighteen, but this is by no means an exhaustive list. LΓecn-y-Drybedd
                    near Nevern, Pentre Evan near Newport, another one in the same town, Longhouse
                    near Mathry, Tre Llys on Pencair, are magnificent specimens of Megalithic work.
                    Stone circles, cairns, monoliths, and earthworks abound in the county; what
                    proportion of these are attributable to the dolichocephalic non-Aryan Silures
                    who used stone implements it is impossible to say.</p>
                <p>The Goidel or Gaelic branch of the Celtic family has the credit of having
                    introduced bronze and round tumuli with cremated bodies; of these latter there
                    are a great number in Pembrokeshire, and considerable quantities of bronze
                    implements have been discovered. A mixture of Silures and Goidels seem to have
                    held the country until they were conquered by the Romans about the year 70 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Roman remains are but scantily represented in
                    Pembrokeshire. Via Julia terminated at St David’s, but no traces of the peculiar
                    Roman roadmaking exist. Fenton, the county historian, fancied he discovered the
                    station <hi rend="italic">Ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Vigesimum</hi> of the
                    spurious <hi rend="italic">Itinerary</hi> of Antonine at Ambleston, and there
                    can be no doubt that a large Roman building of some sort did exist at that
                    place. The late Professor Rolleston and Mr E. Laws discovered Samian ware in the
                    cave of Longbury near Tenby, and Roman coins, ranging from Vespasian, 78 A.D.,
                    to Constantine II., 340 A.D., have been found very plentifully in the
                    county.</p>
                <p>When the Saxons pressed the Cymric tribe of Brythonic Celts in Cumbria, the
                    latter appear to have migrated into Wales, and to have conquered the
                    inhabitants; the Pembrokeshire Goidels seem to have held out for some time.
                    During this troubled period there was a great incursion of missionaries, both
                    Goidel and Cymric; to these we owe the nomenclature of many villages. To this
                    period must be attributed the sepulchral inscriptions in that strange character
                    which has been called Ogam. Of these so many are to be found in Pembrokeshire
                    that it has been considered probable they were invented in the district. They
                    are usually in base Latin; good specimens are to be seen on Caldy Island, St
                    Dogmel’s, Cwmgloyπe near Nevern, and Treffgarne near Haverfordwest. Most of the
                    crosses must be attributed to this period, though probably the inscribed ones at
                    Carew and Nevern are of later date.</p>
                <p>After Wales had been completely conquered by the Cymry, Rhodri Mawr divided it
                    among his sons, and Pembrokeshire fell to Cadell in 877. From that period until
                    its complete incorporation with England it suffered terribly from the family
                    feuds of the Welsh princes. The Scandinavians also proved a fearful scourge.
                    Their first incursion, according to the Brut-y-Tywysogion, took place in 795.
                    The creeks of Pembrokeshire were peculiarly adapted to the wants of the vikings,
                    and they seem to have formed a strong colony in the county, of which such names
                    as Asgard, Fishguard, Grafsholm, Freystrop, Goodwich, Milford Haven (Midfjord
                    Havn), Haverfordwest (Havards Fjord), &amp;c., are an abiding evidence.</p>
                <p>During the reign of William Rufus, Arnulph de Montgomery, son of Roger de
                    Belesme, invaded the southern portion of the county with the king’s sanction; he
                    gained a district and built Pembroke Castle; Manorbier was most likely erected
                    at the same time. In 1107 a colony of Flemings was sent into Pembrokeshire by
                    the king (Henry I. ); they settled at Haverford and Tenby. A second party of
                    Flemings and other adventurers was despatched to Pembroke by Henry II.; these
                    were mercenaries who had served in the civil war between Stephen and Maud. In
                    April 1170 a party of Pembrokeshire men invaded and overran the eastern shores
                    of Ireland.</p>
                <p>In 1405 Owen Glendower harried the country; he occupied Tenby with 10,000
                    Welshmen, and was joined by a French force of 12,000 men who had landed in
                    Milford Haven. In 1456 Henry VIL was born in Pembroke Castle, the residence of
                    his uncle Jasper Tudor, earl of Pembroke. After a long exile he landed at Brunt
                    near Dale with French troops; here he was joined by Sir Rhys ap Thomas at the
                    head of a large number of Welshmen, with whom he marched to Bosworth field. When
                    the church property was disposed of under Henry VIII., Lamphey Court, once a
                    bishop’s seat, fell to the Devereux family, and it was the residence of the
                    three Devereux carls of Essex. These noblemen were extremely popular, and it was
                    most likely in ct&gt;nsequence of the political views held by Robert the third
                    earl that when the civil war broke out Pembrokeshire was found to be “the most
                    seditious county in all Wales, or rather of England, for the inhabitants were
                    like English corporations, unlike loyal Welshmen” <hi rend="italic">(Mercurius
                    Aulicus,</hi> 29th week, 20th July 1644). Pembroke and Tenby held out until
                    1648, when the Presbyterians rebelled against the Independents; then under Mayor
                    and Colonel Poyer the royal standard was hoisted on Pembroke keep. Cromwell
                    himself besieged Pembroke, which yielded to him on 17th July 1648.</p>

                <p>The most important ecclesiastical building is the cathedral of St David’s. Some

                    now remaining is that of Bishop Peter de Leia (1180). This was seriously injured
                    by the fall of the tower in 1220; the damage had scarcely been repaired when the
                    church was wrecked by an earthquake in 1248. In 1328 Henry Gower succeeded to
                    the bishopric, the most munificent benefactor the church of St David’s ever saw;
                    he transformed the cathedral, introducing the Decorated style throughout the
                    edifice. After the Reformation the building was permitted to fall gradually into
                    decay, until it had become little better than a ruin. But in 1863 the edifice,
                    more especially the tower, was thoroughly restored under the late Sir Gilbert
                    Scott.</p>
