                    (1785-1866), novelist and poet, was born at Weymouth, 18th October 1785. His
                    father, a glass merchant in London, died soon after his son’s birth, and young
                    Peacock received his education at a private school at Englefield Green, where he
                    distinguished himself by unusual precocity. After a brief experience of business
                    he elected to devote himself to study and the pursuit of literature, living with
                    his mother on their private means. His first books were poetical, <hi
                        rend="italic">The Monks of St Mark</hi> (1804), <hi rend="italic"
                        >Palmyra</hi> (1806), <hi rend="italic">The Genius of the Thames</hi>
                    (1810), <hi rend="italic">The Philosophy of Melancholy</hi> (1812),— works of no
                    great merit. He also made several dramatic attempts, which did not find their
                    way to the stage. He served for a short time as secretary to Sir Home Popham at
                    Flushing, and paid several visits to Wales. In 1812 he became acquainted with
                    Shelley, who made him his executor together with Lord Byron. In 1815 he evinced
                    his peculiar power by writing <hi rend="italic">Headlong Hall,</hi> the
                    prototype of all his subsequent novels. It was published in 1816, and <hi
                        rend="italic">Melincourt</hi> followed in the ensuing year. During 1817 he
                    lived at Great Marlow, enjoying the almost daily society of Shelley, and writing
                        <hi rend="italic">Nightmare Abbey</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Rhododaphne,</hi> by far the best of his long poems. In 1819 he received
                    the appointment of assistant examiner at the India House, at the same time as
                    Mill and Strachey. Peacock’s nomination appears to have been due to the
                    influence of his old schoolfellow Peter Auber, secretary to the East India
                    Company, and the papers he prepared as tests of his ability were returned to him
                    with the high encomium, “Nothing superfluous and nothing wanting.” This was
                    characteristic of the whole of his intellectual work; and equally characteristic
                    of the man was his marriage about this time to a Welsh lady, to whom he proposed
                    by letter, not having seen her for eight years. His official duties greatly
                    interfered with independent composition. <hi rend="italic">Maid Marian</hi>
                    nevertheless appeared in 1822, <hi rend="italic">The Misfortunes of Elphin</hi>
                    in 1829, and <hi rend="italic">Crotchet Castle</hi> in 1831; and he would
                    probably have written more but for the death in 1833 of his mother, to whom he
                    was deeply attached. He also contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Westminster
                        Review</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Examiner.</hi> His services to the
                    East India Company, outside the usual official routine, were considerable. He
                    defended it successfully against the attacks of Mr J. S. Buckingham and the
                    Liverpool salt interest, and made the subject of steam navigation to India
                    peculiarly his own. He represented the company before the various parliamentary
                    committees on this question; and in 1839 and 1840 superintended the construction
                    of iron steamers, <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n466/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0918-0466-0445"/> which not only made the voyage round the Cape
                    successfully, but proved very useful in the Chinese war. He also framed
                    instructions for the Euphrates expedition, pronounced by General Chesney to be
                    models of sagacity. In 1836 he succeeded Mill as chief examiner, and in 1856 he
                    retired upon a pension. During his later years he contributed several papers to
                        <hi rend="italic">Fraser's Magazine,</hi> including reminiscences of
                    Shelley. He also wrote in the same magazine his last novel, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Gryll Grange</hi> (1860), inferior to his earlier writings in humour and
                    vigour, but still a surprising effort for a man of his age. He died 23d January
                    1866 at Lower Halliford, near Chertsey, where, so far as his London occupations
                    would allow him, he had resided for more than forty years.</p>
                <p>Peacock’s position in English literature is unique. There was nothing like his
                    type of novel· before his time; though there might have been if it had occurred
                    to Swift to invent a story as a vehicle for the dialogue of his <hi
                        rend="italic">Polite Conversation.</hi> But, while Swift’s interlocutors
                    represent ordinary types, Peacock’s are highly exceptional; while the humour of
                    the former consists in their stereotyped conventionality or unconscious folly,
                    the talk in Peacock’s novels is brilliant; and, while Swift’s characters utter
                    proverbs, Peacock’s are equipped from the author’s own stores of humorous
                    observation or reflexion. He speaks as well in his own person as through his
                    puppets; and perhaps no writer since Pope has enriched English literature with
                    such an abundance of quotable things. This pithy wit and sense, combined with
                    remarkable grace and accuracy of natural description, atone for the primitive
                    simplicity of plot and character. There is just enough of both to keep the story
                    going, and the author’s plan required no more. Of his seven fictions, <hi
                        rend="italic">Nightmare Abbey</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Crotchet
                        Castle</hi> are perhaps on the whole the best, the former displaying the
                    most <hi rend="italic">vis comica</hi> of situation, the latter the fullest
                    maturity of intellectual power, and the most skilful grouping of the motley
                    crowd of “perfectibilians, deteriorationists, statu-quo-ites, phrenologists,
                    transcendentalists, political economists, theorists in all sciences, projectors
                    in all arts, morbid visionaries, romantic enthusiasts, lovers of music, lovers
                    of the picturesque, and lovers of good dinners,” who constitute the <hi
                        rend="italic">dramatis personae</hi> of that comedy in narrative, the
                    Pea-cockian novel. <hi rend="italic">Maid Marian</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
                        Misfortunes of Elphin</hi> are hardly less entertaining, but are somewhat
                    cramped by the absence of portraiture from the life and the necessity for
                    historical colouring. Both contain descriptive passages of extraordinary beauty.
                        <hi rend="italic">Melincourt</hi> is a comparative failure, the excellent
                    idea of an orangoutang mimicking humanity being insufficient as the sole
                    groundwork of a novel. <hi rend="italic">Headlong Hall,</hi> though more than
                    foreshadowing the author’s subsequent excellence, is marred by a certain bookish
                    awkwardness characteristic of the recluse student, which reappears in <hi
                        rend="italic">Gryll Grange</hi> as the pedantry of an old-fashioned scholar,
                    whose likes and dislikes have become inveterate and whose sceptical liberalism,
                    always rather inspired by hatred of cant than enthusiasm for progress, has
                    petrified into only too earnest conservatism. Pianos and perspective equally
                    with competitive examinations and “panto-pragmatism” are the objects of the
                    writer’s distaste, and for the first time in his career we feel inclined to
                    laugh at him, being no longer able to laugh with him. The book’s quaint resolute
                    paganism, however, is very refreshing in an age eaten up with introspection; it
                    is the kindliest of Peacock’s writings, and contains the most beautiful of his
                    poems, “Years Ago,” the reminiscence of an early attachment. In general the
                    ballads and songs interspersed through his tales are models of exact and
                    melodious diction, and instinct with true feeling. His more ambitious poems are
                    worth little, except <hi rend="italic">Rhododaphne,</hi> attractive as a story
                    and perfect as a composition, but destitute of genuine poetical inspiration. His
                    critical and miscellaneous writings are always interesting, especially the
                    restorations of lost classical plays in the <hi rend="italic">Horae
                        Drαmαticae,</hi> but the only one of great mark is the witty and crushing
                    exposure in the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> of Moore’s ignorance
                    of the manners and belief he has ventured to portray in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Epicurean.</hi> Peacock resented the misrepresentation of his favourite
                    sect, the good and ill of whose tenets were fairly represented in his own
                    person. Somewhat sluggish and self-indulgent, incapable of enthusiasm or
                    self-sacrifice, he yet possessed a deep undemonstrative kindliness of nature; he
                    could not bear to see any one near him unhappy or uncomfortable; and his
                    sympathy, no less than his genial humour, gained him the attachment of children,
                    dependants, and friends. His feelings were steady rather than acute; he retained
                    throughout life with touching fidelity the memory of an early affection. In
                    official life he was upright and conscientious; his judgment was shrewd and
                    robust, and the quaint crotchets and prejudices which contrasted so curiously
                    with his usual sagacity were in general the exaggeration of .sound ideas held
                    with undue exclusiveness. As a candidate for literary immortality he should be
                    safe. The same causes which restrict his popularity ensure his permanence. His
                    novels depend but slightly on temporary phases of manners, but are vitally
                    associated with standard literature, and with general tendencies innate in the
                    human mind. Neither his intellectual liberalism nor his constitutional
                    conservatism will ever be out of date; and what Shelley justly termed “the
                    lightness, strength, and chastity” of his diction secures him an honourable rank
                    among those English writers whose claims to remembrance depend not only upon
                    matter but upon style.</p>
                <p>Peacock’s works were collected, though not completely, and published in three
                    volumes in 1875, at the expense of his friend and former protégé, Sir Henry
                    Cole, with an excellent memoir by his grand-daughter Mrs Clarke, and a critical
                    essay by Lord Houghton. Other criticisms have been written, by Mr Spedding in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Bdin-bιιrgh Review</hi> and by James Hannay in the <hi
