                    limited to a few practical notes on the methods of painting in oil and water
                    colour, other methods being dealt with under the headings <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Enamel, Encaustic Painting, Fresco,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Tempera.</hi><hi rend="italic">Painting-Room.—</hi> The painting-room or
                    atelier should be of sufficient dimensions to allow the artist space to retire
                    from his work, if it is on a scale large enough to require viewing from a
                    distance. For large decorative paintings the room must be spacious. The size and
                    altitude of the window is of great importance. If the opening is contracted, the
                    light and shade on the model will be broad and intense, and the colouring
                    sombre, especially in the shadows. If abundance of light is admitted, the
                    tendency will be more towards brightness and purity. Painters generally prefer a
                    window with a northern or eastern aspect.</p>
                <p>The painting-room has a great influence in determining not only the effects in
                    the works of individual artists, but the characteristics of whole schools.
                    Leonardo da Vinci was among the first to show partiality to indoor effects and
                    deep shadows. Correggio, the artists of the Bolognese school, Caravaggio,
                    Spagnoletto, and other Neapolitan and Spanish painters followed: the Dutch
                    painter Rembrandt perhaps carried these extreme contrasts of light and shade to
                    the greatest length. The effects thus obtained are, however, more or less
                    artificial, and very unlike the ordinary aspect of the open daylight face of
                    nature.</p>
                <p>Painters, unless there happens to be some special reason to the contrary, usually
                    work with the light to the left to prevent the shadow cast from the brush
                    falling inwards. Some artists who seek to represent open air effects paint from
                    their models in glass-houses, specially constructed for the purpose. The
                    practice has much to recommend it, the diffused light enabling them to
                    approximate more nearly to the truth of nature.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Implements used in Painting.—</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >easel</hi> is a frame, or rest, which supports the picture during its progress.
                    Easels are of various kinds:—the triangular, supplied with pegs for the
                    adjustment of the height of the work; the square, or rack easel, which is much
                    more convenient; and the French studio easel, having a screw at the back and
                    worked by a handle in the front, by which arrangement pictures of considerable
                    size and weight can be raised or lowered or inclined forward with great ease.
                    There is also a variety of light portable easels used for out-door
                    sketching.—The <hi rend="italic">palette</hi> is the board on which the colours
                    are arranged to paint from; it is usually either of . an oval or oblong square
                    form, of light-coloured wood, and, to avoid inconvenience being felt from its
                    weight, it should be thin and well balanced on the thumb. It ought to be kept
                    clean and the colour never allowed to dry on it.—The <hi rend="italic"
                    >palette-knife</hi> has a pliable blade, and is used for arranging the colours
                    on the palette, mixing tints, &amp;c. With some painters it not unfrequently
                    takes the place of the brush in the application of colour.—The larger kinds of
                    <hi rend="italic">brushes</hi> are made of hog-hair. They are either round or
                    flat, but the latter are generally preferred, though for some purposes round
                    ones are found to be useful. Brushes are also made of sable; these should have
                    the property of coming to a fine point when required. Brushes of badger’s hair
                    are used for “softening” or “sweetening,” —that is, blending the colours by
                    sweeping lightly to and fro over them while freshly laid (a practice to be
                    avoided as much as possible). Brushes should be carefully washed after use,
                    either in spirits of turpentine or with soap and tepid water, dried, and the
                    hairs laid smooth with the finger and thumb. A brush in which the colour has
                    been allowed to dry is difficult to clean, and is much injured, if not rendered
                    entirely useless, by such negligence. Not a little depends on the good condition
                    in which the brushes are kept.—The <hi rend="italic">mahl-stick</hi> is used to
                    steady the hand while painting details. It is held in the left hand, and the end
                    of the stick, properly wadded, rests on the canvas. It should be light and firm.
                    The old painters never used the mahl-stick when working on large pictures, and
                    many artists dispense with it altogether. Rubens mentions being obliged to have
                    recourse to one in his old age.—The <hi rend="italic">dais</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">throne</hi> is a platform varying from a foot to 18 inches in
                    height. Portrait painters, and artists who generally stand while at work, find
                    it desirable to have the sitter or model nearly on a level with the eye.—A <hi
                    rend="italic">mirror</hi> hung in a convenient place in the painting-room will
                    be found of great use. It enables the artist to detect faults in drawing to
                    which he might otherwise be blinded from too long gazing at his work. The
                    picture is seen in the mirror reflected in reverse, and errors consequently
                    appear greater than they really are.—The <hi rend="italic">lay-figure,</hi> a
                    wooden or stuffed doll, usually life-size, is very serviceable in painting
                    elaborate dresses and draperies. The best kinds are so constructed that they can
                    be made to assume and retain any posture. Fra Bartolommeo first brought the
                    lay-figure into use.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Materials used in Painting.—</hi> These consist of canvases,
                    prepared panels and mill-boards, oils, varnishes, and colours.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Canvas</hi> is the material now generally used. It is kept
                    in rolls of various width and of three qualities—plain cloth, Roman, and ticken.
                    It is prepared with two kinds of grounds—the hard or oil ground, and the
                    absorbent ground. The ground is generally of a light colour; many artists prefer
                    pure white. The grounds employed by the first oil painters were identical with
                    those of tempera; the surface of the panel was prepared with two or three coats
                    of size, a layer of coarse gesso was then applied, and on this at least eight
                    layers of a finer description were spread, and the surface carefully scraped
                    till it became smooth and white. In the Italian school of a later period, the
                    grounds were generally composed of pipe-clay mixed with chalk. It is generally
                    acknowledged that white grounds are in every way preferable, although it matters
                    little whether the brightness reside in the ground or is reproduced at a
                    subsequent stage by painting with a solid body of opaque colour over a dark
                    ground. Velazquez and other Spanish painters used canvases prepared with a red
                    earthy ground. The intention of priming the ground is to prevent the very rapid
                    absorption of colours. Canvas prepared with the object of partially abstracting
                    the oil from the first layers of colour is called “absorbent.” For small cabinet
                    pictures panels of well-seasoned mahogany are used; mill-boards, academy boards,
                    and oil paper are serviceable for sketching from nature.</p>

                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Oils and Varnishes.—</hi> The introduction of oil painting
                    on the modern methods dates from the time of John Van Eyck. This artist
                    introduced a varnish, probably composed of linseed or nut oil mixed with some
                    resinous substance, which was more siccative than the oil vehicles previously in
                    use, and possessed the property of drying without exposure to the sun or to
                    artificial heat. The oil painting of the early Flemish masters was, strictly
                    speaking, (oil) varnish painting: an oleo-resinous substance, such as amber
                    varnish, was mixed with the colours, and rendered final varnishing unnecessary.
                    The Venetian painters also adopted this vehicle. The term “vehicle” is borrowed
                    from pharmacy. In art it is applied to the fluid used for bringing the pigments
                    into a proper working state. Painters differ greatly as to the vehicles they
                    employ: some use oil only; others peculiar compounds of their own, made of
                    linseed, poppy, or walnut oils, copal or amber varnishes, drying oil and mastic,
                    &amp;c. Siccatif, a medium specially prepared for oil painting, is now largely
                    used; mixed with spirits of wine, it forms a beautiful transparent varnish.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Colours.—</hi> The permanent colours are the earths and
                    ochres and those mineral colours which bear the test of fire and lime. Colours
                    prepared from lead and animal and vegetable substances are more or less
                    fugitive. Artist’s colours were originally kept in a dry state, and afterwards
                    in small bladders; they are now enclosed in very convenient collapsable metal
                    tubes.</p>
                <p>The discoveries of modern chemistry have added largely to the simple list of
                    colours known to the old masters, but perhaps with little advantage to their
                    successors, for their is much truth in the maxim that “the shortest way to good
                    colouring is through a simple palette.” Pliny asserts that the ancient Greek
                    painters employed but four colours in their works.</p>
                <p>A large proportion of colours, such as the ochres, vermilion, ultramarine,
                    &amp;c., is derived from minerals; indigo, madder, gamboge, tfcc., from
                    vegetable, and carmine, Indian yellow, sepia, &amp;c., from animal substances.
                    The artificial or chemical preparations include Prussian blue, Naples yellow,
                    zinc white, French blue, cobalt, the lakes, &lt;fcc.</p>
                <p>The natural or true pigments are prepared for use by calcining and washing, and
                    for oil painting are ground up in poppy or linseed oils. With two or three
                    exceptions the pigments derived from the mineral kingdom are .the most
                    permanent, especially those containing iron or copper. Those derived*from animal
                    and vegetable substances have less permanence, but they form an important
                    acquisition to the palette, as they not unfrequently possess a purity and
                    brilliancy of colour which makes it almost impossible to dispense with them.</p>
                <p>Colours are opaque or transparent. The former, on account of their solidity and
                    opacity, are employed to represent light. For shadows and glazing transparent
                    pigments are used. Yellow, red, and blue cannot be composed, and are called
                    primary colours. The union of two of these in the three combinations of which
                    alone they admit produces secondary colours. White represents light, and in oil
                    painting the only white pigment used is white lead, prepared with great care.
                    The ochres are the most permanent yellows. Their composition is very variable,
                    but they may be considered true chemical combinations of clay and oxide of iron.
                    The native ochres are yellow and red. By calcination the yellow ochres become
                    red. Other yellows are prepared from arsenic, lead, and vegetable substances.
                    Iron is the great colouring principle of red in nature. All the three
                    kingdoms—mineral, animal, and vegetable—contribute to the red pigments. The
                    first supplies vermilion and the red ochres; the second carmine, obtained from
                    the cochineal insect; the third the madder pigments. The principal blue pigments
                    are ultramarine (native and artificial), cobalt, smalt, Prussian blue, and
                    indigo. Ultramarine is the only pure primary colour; the finer specimens have
                    neither a tinge of green on the one hand nor of purple on the other. It is
                    obtained from the mineral lazulite or lapis-lazuli, and is probably a volcanic
                    product, as it resists the action of fire. Its scarcity, and consequent high
                    price, have produced many artificial imitations. These are of many qualities.
                    The inferior are used in paper staining, the finer alone being reserved for
                    artists’ use. Cobalt is now prepared in a state of great purity, but it has the
                    objection of appearing violet in artificial light.</p>
                <p>In “guides to oil painting” long lists of pigments are generally given; but these
                    serve only to perplex and embarrass. About a dozen colours, judiciously chosen,
                    will be quite sufficient to supply the palette.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Processes and Manipulations.—</hi> There are various technical
                    distinctions in the modes of applying the colours to a picture in its successive
                    stages. <hi rend="italic">Glazing</hi> is the laying of thinly transparent
                    colours, diluted with a considerable quantity of vehicle, which allows the work
                    beneath to appear distinctly through, but tinged with the colour of the glaze.
                    The Venetian painters, Titian especially, largely employed this process,
                    advancing their pictures as far as possible with solid, opaque colour, and upon
                    this ground glazing repeatedly the richest and purest colours. The process of
                    glazing is generally effected by the application of diluted transparent colour,
                    but semi-transparent colours are also used when rendered sufficiently
                    transparent by the admixture of a large proportion of vehicle. When carried to
                    excess, the result is a “horny” impure dulness of surface and a heavy and dirty
                    tone of colour. Much practice and experience are required for its proper
                    performance. <hi rend="italic">Scumbling</hi> resembles glazing in that a very
                    thin coat is spread lightly over portions of the work, but the colour used is
                    opaque instead of transparent. A hoghair brush sparingly charged with the tint
                    is employed. Carried to excess, scumbliιjg produces a “smoky” appearance. <hi
                    rend="italic">Impasting</hi> is the term applied to laying colours in thick
                    masses on the lights. The shadows or dark portions of a picture are painted
                    thinly and transparently, the lights solidly, with opaque colours. Impasting
                    gives “texture” and “surface” to the latter, and helps to produce the appearance
                    of roundness and relief. When carried too far it produces an appearance of
                    coarseness and affords a lodgment for dirt and varnish in what should be the
                    brightest and purest passages in the colouring.</p>
                <p>Irregularities of surface in such passages of a picture as it may be desirable to
                    repaint are removed by using an instrument especially made for the purpose; but
                    an old razor, an ordinary pocket-knife, or a piece of window glass, properly
                    broken, will, in skilful hands, answer the purpose equally well. This process
                    should not be attempted till the colour to be removed has hardened, otherwise
                    the pigment will tear off and leave the surface in a condition which it will be
                    found difficult to remedy.</p>
                <p>It is the practice of some artists to lay the colours at first cold and pale,
                    gradually strengthening the light and shade, and enforcing the colour in
                    subsequent paintings. When this practice is adopted, the colours used should be
                    as few and as simple as possible. It sometimes happens that considerable
                    portions of the first painting are apparent through all the subsequent
                    processes, and this early part of the work should be done with great care and
                    judgment.</p>
                <p>The first principle in the application of paint is to avoid unnecessary mixing,
                    or, as it is called, “troubling” or saddening the tints, the result of which is
                    a waxy surface and muddiness of colour. When this is avoided the touches are
                    clear and distinct, but when the principle is carried to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n154/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0154-0139"/> excess it degenerates into manner; or it may
                    serve as a convenient screen for the want of accurate observation and thorough
                    execution.</p>
                <p>Among the masters most remarkable for precision and rapidity of handling are
                    Velazquez, Tintoretto, Veronese, and Rubens. The execution of Leonardo da Vinci
                    is laboured. Vanderwerf, Mengs, and Denner are also instances of laboured
                    smoothness. The three last-named belong to a class designated “the
                    polishers,”—“little men, who did not see the whole at a time, but only parts of
                    a whole, and thus vainly essayed to make up the whole by a smooth union of
                    parts.”</p>
                <p>No two artists employ the same method in painting. Some attain the result aimed
                    at by involved and complicated, others by direct and simple methods. The
                    difference in <hi rend="italic">technique</hi> between the work of an English
                    artist and artists trained in French or German ateliers may be seen at a glance,
                    and it is of little use attempting to lay down hard and fast rules on the
                    subject. Even among the great Italian painters a wide variety of practice
                    existed. It has been pretty well ascertained, partly from unfinished works, that
                    Titian’s method was to work out the effect of his pictures, as far as possible,
                    with pure white, red, and black, the shadows being left cold. To prevent the
                    yellowing of the oil, and to harden the colour, the picture was exposed to the
                    sun, months were sometimes allowed to elapse, and then the surface of this <hi
                    rend="italic">dead</hi> or first colouring was rubbed down with pumice stone and
                    fresh colours and the glazings applied, a considerable period—during which the
                    picture was exposed to the sun—elapsing between successive applications of
                    colour. Titian is said to have been very partial to the use of his fingers when
                    laying on paint, particularly on flesh and glazings.</p>
                <p>The practice of Paul Veronese was quite opposed to that of Titian. He sought
                    almost the full effect a∣ once by direct means and simple mixture of tints,
                    seldom repeating his colours, and using few glazings. When the work was well
                    advanced in this way he covered the whole with a thin coat of varnish to bring
                    up the colours, and then retouched the lights and enforced the shadows with
                    dexterous touches.</p>
                <p>It is said of Reynolds, who spent half his life in experiments, that in order to
                    discover their technical secrets he deliberately scraped away and destroyed
                    Venetian pictures of value. The decay of so many of his works shows with how
                    little success these experiments were rewarded.</p>
                <p>Numerous “guides to oil painting” exist, but little real instruction or benefit
                    is to be gained from their perusal. They abound in minute directions how to
                    paint “trunks of trees, heaths, fields, roads, skies (grey, blue, and stormy),
                    sunsets, sunrises, running streams and waterfalls, mountains, the smoke or steam
                    of steamers, and chimneys of cottages,” as well as “heads, flesh, backgrounds,
                    draperies (blue, red, and black),” with lists of the proper colours to be
                    employed for each. All this, it is hardly needful to say, is worse than useless.
                    The surest and safest way for any one who intends to study painting seriously,
                    or to make it his profession, is to place himself under the instruction of an
                    artist of repute, either in his own country or in some foreign atelier; but,
                    even after acquiring a sound technical knowledge of the processes employed in
                    painting, it will be found that much remains to learn which no master can teach.
                    It is said of Velazquez that “he discovered that nature herself is the artist’s
                    best teacher, and industry his surest guide to perfection, and he very early
                    resolved neither to sketch nor to colour any object without having the thing
                    itself before him.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Water-Colour Painting.—</hi> The use, in painting, of earths
                    and minerals of different colours, diluted with water, is of great antiquity.
                    Painting with oils or oleo-resinous vehicles is a comparatively modern
                    invention. Tempera, encaustic, and fresco were ancient modes of water painting.
                    Several of the early Dutch and Flemish oil painters attained to considerable
                    technical excellence in the separate practice of water-colour painting; little
                    more than simple washings of water colour were employed by them, the processes
                    which have in modern times so greatly raised and extended its scope being then
                    unknown.</p>
                <p>Painting in water colour owes much of its development to English artists, and may
                    be regarded as a peculiarly national school of art. The first English
                    water-colour painter of note, Paul Sandby, used Indian ink in the earlier stages
                    of his drawings, finishing them with a few tints of thin colour. At this period
                    paintings in water colour were little more than flat washes, and in the early
                    catalogues of the Royal Academy Exhibition were designated “water-tinted” or
                    “water-washed drawings.” Improvements were gradually effected, first by varying
                    the ground-work tint with blue and sepia, over which washes of colour,
                    commencing with a warm generalizing tint, were struck. John Cozens was the first
                    to substitute a mixture of indigo and Indian red in place of Indian ink as a
                    neutral tint in the early stages of his work, a practice which was long
                    retained. The <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> old water-colour painters used the
                    lead pencil or the reed pen in finishing their drawings. The first to break away
                    from this conventional method was Girtin, who painted objects at once with the
                    tints they appeared to possess in nature. Turner, perhaps the greatest master of
                    the art, was closely associated with Girtin in early life, and in the course of
                    his long career he carried water-colour painting to a degree of perfection which
                    can scarcely be surpassed. Nearly all the great improvements which have taken
                    place of late years in water-colour painting are due more or less to him. John
                    Lewis, De Wint, Prout, Hunt, Cox, Harding, and Copley Fielding have all
                    contributed to the development of the art.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Materials used in Water-Colour Painting.—</hi> 1. <hi
                    rend="italic">Paper.—</hi> A great variety of papers is used, varying in texture
                    from the extreme of roughness to hot-pressed smoothness. In many of Turner’s
                    drawings the paper is tinted. Nothing, however, seemed to come amiss to him;
                    papers of almost any surface or texture were used. David Cox, in many of his
                    later works, employed a rough paper made from old sailcloth. The paper most
                    generally used is known as “Imperial,” and is made of various degrees of texture
                    and thickness. Whatman’s papers are also much esteemed.</p>
                <p>The proper sizing of the paper is of great importance; if it is too strongly done
                    the colours will not float or work freely, if too little they are absorbed into
                    the fabric and appear poor and dead. In this last case, gum-arabic dissolved in
                    warm water will improve the effect by bringing up the colour and giving greater
                    depth and richness of tone. The paper is prepared to receive the drawing by
                    being well sponged and stretched upon a drawing-board.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Pigments.—</hi> The permanent earthy minerals were chiefly
                    used in ancient works, and these, with the addition of a few transparent
                    colours, such as sepia, indigo, and Indian ink, satisfied the early water-colour
                    painters of England. Richer and more delicate colours were gradually added, and
                    of late years chemistry has supplied many entirely new ones. No method of giving
                    permanency to some of the transparent yellows, carmine, and other colours
                    obtained from the cochineal insect has yet been discovered, but the improved
                    methods of preparing pigments from the root of the madder plant have rendered
                    the use of carmine not so necessary. The earths and minerals are the most
                    permanent pigments, but when employed with water they are more, unmanageable,
                    and flow less freely than the fugitive vegetable colours. Among the earlier
                    water-colour <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n155/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0155-0140"/> painters the use of opaque or “body” colour was
                    generally considered illegitimate. Turner was the first to break through this
                    restraint, and since his time the use of opaque colour has been carried perhaps
                    to excess, many modern artists wilfully resigning much of the peculiar freshness
                    and brilliancy of pure water colour for the sake of rivalling the richness and
                    depth of oil painting.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Brushes.—</hi> Brown sable is the hair generally used; but
                    brushes are also made of red sable and squirrel or “camel” hair. The brushes are
                    made by the insertion of the hair into quills, the various sizes of brush being
                    recognized by the names of the birds which supply them —eagle, swan, goose,
                    crow, &lt;fcc. Flat brushes in German-silver ferules are also used.</p>
                <p>Perhaps as great a variety of practice exists among water-colour painters as
                    among those working in oils; each arrives at his own peculiar method by the
                    teaching of experience. As in the case of oil painting, it would serve little
                    purpose if the attempt was made to lay down rules and methods. All men cannot be
                    painters, and a knowledge of the nature of the materials and of the processes
                    employed does not necessarily carry with it ability to paint. Such essentials as
                    a knowledge of composition, drawing, light and shade, and colour are all
                    requisite, and these can only be obtained after years of study. If possible the
                    guidance of some good master should be sought for at first; this will shorten
                    the way and prevent the making of some awkward mistakes. <hi rend="smallcaps"
