                    Burmah, Siam, and Cambodia. Laloubère <hi rend="italic">(Rel. de Siam)</hi> is
                    the first European writer who mentions the name, towards the end of the 17th
                    century. Various opinions have been advanced as to the etymology—from <hi
                    rend="italic">path,</hi> to read (Mason, Minayeff), or <hi rend="italic"
                    >pâli</hi><hi rend="italic">= pra +</hi><hi rend="italic">âli</hi> (J. D’Alwis,
                    E. Kuhn)—and original meaning of the word. The latter, given as “row,” “range,”
                    “line,” is applied by Trenckner <hi rend="italic">(Pâli Mise.,</hi> i. 69) to
                    the “series” of teachers by whom the text of the sacred tradition was handed
                    down, and, according to the Burmese conception of the word (see Forchhammer’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> for 1879-80, p. 6), to the sacred texts simply,
                    irrespectively <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> of the language or dialect in
                    which they are written; whereas Pali scholars generally use the word less in the
                    sense of sacred canon than in that of the language in which the canon is written
                    (Childers, D’Alwis, Fausböll, Oldenberg). The same applies to the synonymous
                    term <hi rend="italic">Tanti.</hi> When and where that language was formed is
                    still a matter of controversy. We quote here only the opinions of the two
                    principal writers on the subject, Professors E. Kuhn and H. Oldenberg. The
                    former, following Westergaard, holds that Pâli was the Sanskritic vernacular
                    spoken at Ujjain, the capital of Mâlava, at the time when Mahendra, the son and
                    successor of the great Asoka, took the sacred canon with him to Ceylon in the
                    form in which it had two years previously received the sanction of the third
                    general council <hi rend="italic">(Beitr.</hi><hi rend="italic">zur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Pâli-Gramm.,</hi> Berlin, 1875). On the other hand, Professor
                    Oldenberg, rejecting that tradition, considers the naturalization of the Pâli
                    language in Ceylon to have been the fruit of a period of long and continued
                    intercourse between that island and the adjacent parts of India, more especially
                    the Kalinga country. Though he does not state within what limits of time that
                    gradual naturalization took place, he records his opinion that at least one
                    portion of the Buddhist canon, the <hi rend="italic">Vinaya,</hi> in its present
                    form existed in the Pâli language about a hundred and fifty years before
                    Mahendra, that is, about 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> This is in all
                    probability the earliest period that may be assigned to Pâli as a literary
                    language <hi rend="italic">(The Vinayapitakam,</hi> edited by Oldenberg, vol.
                    i., 1879, Introduction). Both scholars have discussed the question as to the
                    Pâli being identical with the Mâgadhî dialect, and have satisfactorily disposed
                    of it. There can be no doubt that some considerable time must have elapsed
                    before the Pâli recension of the canon was completed, and that, as regards the
                    locality of the language, through the contiguity of cognate vernaculars a
                    palpable number of words and word-forms found their way into Pâli, enriching
                    alike its vocabulary and its grammatical resources <hi rend="italic">; or</hi>
                    how else could we account for the occurrence of such doublets and triplets as
                    adda, alia (Sanskrit, ârdra), âvata, âvuta (S. âvrita), isa, issa, ikka, accha
                    (S. riksha), kiccha, kasira (S. kricchra), gaddha, giddha, gijjha (S. gridhra),
                    kîlâ, khelâ, khiddâ (S. Krîdâ), tanhâ, tasinâ (trishnâ), tikkhina, tikkha, tinha
                    (S. tîkshna), dosinâ, junhâ (S. jyotsnâ), rukkha, vaccha (S. vriksha), sita,
                    mihita (S. smita), sinâna, nahâna (S. snâna), sunisâ, sunhâ, husâ (S. snushâ),
                    and for the many alternative forms in the declensions, some of which will
                    presently be specified? It is also certain that the very belief in the sacred
                    character of the canon must have tended to preserve the text unchanged in form
                    and substance from the time that it was received in Ceylon till the present day.
                    There is, however, a voluminous literature which has grown around and out of the
                    sacred texts, such as Buddhaghosa’s great commentary on them (beginning of the
                    5th century), and several historical works and their commentaries. In this
                    secondary stage many new words and hybrid grammatical forms, due to what
                    Childers appropriately calls false analogy, have found admission into the
                    language (see Fausböll’s <hi rend="italic">Dhammapada,</hi> Introduction); and
                    the grammarians who at this period appear to have treated of language after the
                    Sanskrit models enrol them in their scheme as correct and legitimate.</p>
                <p>Though tradition (<hi rend="italic">Mahâvansa,</hi> xii. 6 <hi rend="italic">;
                    Buddhavansa,</hi> xxii.) makes the introduction of Buddhism into Burmah
                    contemporaneous with the conversion of Ceylon, there is every probability that
                    the event took place at a much later period. It must, however, have taken firm
                    root in Burmah at the time that in consequence of religious persecutions
                    Buddhist priests from Ceylon went to Burmah to obtain a copy of the sacred canon
                    and Buddhaghosa’s commentary thereon (5th century of our era). Thence an
                    uninterrupted religious intercourse has been kept up between the two countries
                    up to the present, notwithstanding which certain discrepancies between the Pâli
                    texts of Burmah and those of Ceylon point to the fact that the latter retain
                    older forms and expressions, whereas the former replace these by more modern,
                    more common, or more regular ones (Fausböll, <hi rend="italic">Ten</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Jâtakas,</hi> Introd.). This fact, however, can only be
                    established on a scientific basis when good old copies of grammatical works,
                    both in the Sinhalese and Burmese character, shall have been carefully examined
                    and compared <hi rend="italic">ad hoc.</hi> It is certainly true that in Ceylon,
                    where the study of Sanskrit flourishes, and where the people have spoken for
                    upwards of two thousand years an Indo-Aryan idiom, Pâli learning has obtained a
                    far firmer and more favourable footing than in Burmah, where the nature of the
                    vernacular places considerable difficulties in the path of the student of the
                    sacred language.</p>
                <p>As regards the status of Pâli in Siam, no trustworthy information is available.
                    It would appear, however, that Pâli MSS. from that country—invariably written in
                    the Cambodian character—are more remarkable for caligraphy than for correctness.
                    Both in Burmah and Ceylon Pâli is written in the character of the vernacular.
                    The well-known <hi rend="italic">Manual</hi> used at the admission of a novice
                    into the monastic order is almost the only book in which the so-called square
                    character is customary (see Burnouf and Lassen, <hi rend="italic">Essai sur
                    le</hi><hi rend="italic">Pali,</hi> Paris, 1826).</p>
                <p>Since the days of Prinsep the name of Pâli has also been given to the various
                    local dialects, and the name of Pâli character to the monumental alphabet, or
                    rather alphabets, in which the so-called Asoka inscriptions are written. The
                    language of these records, it is true, comes nearer to the Pâli than to any
                    other early Sanskritic idiom; still it is sufficiently distinct from the
                    language Of Buddhist literature to be treated by itself (see E. Senart, <hi
                    rend="italic">Les Inscriptions de Piyadasi,</hi> vol. i., Paris, 1881; and G.
                    Bühler, in <hi rend="italic">Z. D. Μ. G.,</hi> vol. xxxvii.).</p>
                <p>Pâli has aptly been said to stand phonetically in the same position to Sanskrit
                    as Italian does to Latin. There is the same tendency to smooth down all sounds
                    difficult of utterance, to assimilate or otherwise simplify compound consonants,
                    and to substitute vocalic or nasal for consonantal word-terminations. More
                    especially, Pâli lacks the <hi rend="italic">ri</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >li</hi> vowels and the diphthongs <hi rend="italic">ai</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">au.</hi> The Sanskrit vowel <hi rend="italic">ri</hi> generally
                    passes in Pâli into <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n201/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0201-0184"/> sometimes also into <hi rend="italic">i</hi> or
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">μ;</hi> as <hi rend="italic">isi</hi> (S. rishi), <hi
                    rend="italic">dalha</hi> (S. dridha), <hi rend="italic">putha</hi> (S. prithag).
                    <hi rend="italic">E</hi> and <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> representing S. <hi
                    rend="italic">ai</hi> and <hi rend="italic">au</hi> respectively, can before
                    double consonants be further shortened into <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">u,</hi> just as other long vowels may be shortened under the same
                    circumstances; thus <hi rend="italic">ussukka</hi> (S. autsukya), <hi
                    rend="italic">rattha</hi> (S. râshtra). Some anomalous vowel changes are
                    exhibited in the following examples :— <hi rend="italic">kondanna</hi> (S.
                    kauηdinya), <hi rend="italic">pana</hi> (S. punar), <hi rend="italic"
                    >purisa</hi> (S. purusha), <hi rend="italic">usu (S.</hi> ishu), <hi
                    rend="italic">vinîiû</hi> (S. vijfiâ), <hi rend="italic">hetthâ</hi> (S.
                    adhastât). As regards consonants, Pâli has only the dental sibilant, and
                    replaces by anusvâra most final consonants of Sanskrit words; as <hi
                    rend="italic">manam,</hi> (S. manâk), <hi rend="italic">sanirn</hi> (S. sanais),
                    <hi rend="italic">khattum,</hi> (S. kritvas). Two or more consonants meeting
                    in.the middle of a word are mostly assimilated, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >ummagga</hi> (S. unmârga), <hi rend="italic">pabbhâra</hi> (S. prâgbhâraj.
                    Other changes are <hi rend="italic">panha</hi> (S. praçna), <hi rend="italic"
                    >pallanka</hi> (S. paryanka), <hi rend="italic">dâthâ</hi> (S. damslitra), and
                    of initial consonants <hi rend="italic">latthî</hi> (S. yashti), <hi
                    rend="italic">ludda</hi> (rudra), <hi rend="italic">nàngala</hi> (S. lângala),
                    <hi rend="italic">kipillika</hi> (S. pipîlika), <hi rend="italic">khdnu</hi> (S.
                    sthânu). Contraction is very frequent, as well as metathesis, as the following
                    examples will show :— <hi rend="italic">kho</hi> (S. khalu), <hi rend="italic"
                    >acceka</hi> (S. atyayika), <hi rend="italic">âcera</hi> (S. âcârya), <hi
                    rend="italic">cuddasa</hi> (S. caturdaçan), <hi rend="italic">issera</hi> (S.
                    aiçvarya), <hi rend="italic">abbohâra</hi> (S. avyavahâra). ' In the Scenic
                    Prakrits and in the Mâgadhî of the Jains the consonantal decay has reached a
                    much higher stage than it has in Pâli, showing that the latter holds its place
                    between the former and the Sanskrit. This applies also to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sandhi,</hi> which in Pâli is indeed sporadically and irregularly attended to,
                    but shows a tendency to being altogether neglected.</p>
                <p>There is no dual in the declension any more than in the conjugation; the only
                    remnants of it appear to be <hi rend="italic">to</hi> (S. tau) and <hi
                    rend="italic">ubho</hi> (S. ubhau). The old dative case is rarely used, and the
                    genitive take⅞ its place. The declension of nouns has in some cases been
                    encroached upon by the pronominal declension. According to the nature of Pâli
                    phonology, there cannot be any real consonantal stems, and therefore no regular
                    consonantal declension. Final consonants are either dropped or have an <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> added to them. In the former case the final consonants
                    reappear l&gt;efore the vowel terminations, in the latter the declension
                    folloλvs the false analogy of the «-declension. Thus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >dhîmâ</hi> (S. dhimat) is declined as follows :— <hi rend="italic">Sing.—</hi>
                    nom. dhîmâ, dhîmanto; voc. dhîmaip, dhîma, dhîmâ; acc. dhîmantaip, dhîmarn;
                    instr, dhîmatâ, dhhnan-tena; dat. gen. dhîmato, dhîmantassa, dhîmassa; abl.
                    dhîmatâ; loc. dhîmati, dhîmante, dhîmantasmim, dhîmantamhi; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plur.—</hi> nom. voc. dhîmanto, dhîmantâ; acc. dhîmante; instr, abl.
                    dhîmantebhi, dhîmantehi; dat. gen. dhîmataip, dhîmantânarp; loc. dhîmantesu.
                    Examples of multiform cases are the loc. sing, of <hi rend="italic">nadt,</hi>
                    which exhibits the forms nadiyâ, nadiyam, najjam; the voc. plur. of the.
                    honorific pronoun <hi rend="italic">bhavam</hi> (S. bhavat), which has bhavanto,
                    bhonto, bhante; the gen. dat. sing, of pitâ, which has pitu, pituno, pitussa,
                    and in the plur. pitûnaip, pitunnaιp, pitarâ-naιp, pitânam; the loc. sing, of
                    mano, manaιp (S. manas), which has manasi, mane, manasmiπι, manàmhi. The
                    personal pronouns also show a variety of forms, some of which are still
                    traceable in the modern Prâkrits. Thus <hi rend="italic">aham</hi> has in the
                    plural—nom. vayam, mayam, amhe; acc. asme, amhe, amhâkam; instr, abl. amhebhi,
                    amnehi; dat. gen. amhâkam, amhânarp, amhaιp; loc. amhesu. Similarly, the gen.
                    dat. sing. fem. of the demonstrative pronoun has the forms imissâ, imissâya,
                    imâya, assâ, assâya.</p>
                <p>The Pâli verb shows even more than does the noun a tendency to break with the
                    analogy of the Sanskrit. Though native grammarians arrange the conjugations on a
                    plan similar to that of the Sanskrit, the disorganizing process which pervades
                    the whole of Pâli grammar is in no part so advanced as in this particular. Thus,
                    the present tense of the verb <hi rend="italic">thâ</hi> (S. sthâ) is thâti as
                    well as titthati; of <hi rend="italic">dhâ</hi> it is dadhâti, dahati, and dhâti
                    of <hi rend="italic">dâ</hi> dadâti, 4eti, dâti, and (by false analogy from the
                    optative dajjarp) dajjati; of <hi rend="italic">ji</hi> jayati, jeti, and
                    jinâti; of <hi rend="italic">bhî</hi> bhâyati; of <hi rend="italic">rudh</hi>
                    rundhati, rundhiti, randhiti, and rundheti; of <hi rend="italic">mar</hi> (S.
                    mri) marati and miyati; and of <hi rend="italic">kar</hi> (S. kri) the plural
                    has karoma, karotha, karonti, and also regularly kubbanti, from which form again
                    by false analogy a 3d person singular kubbati has been derived. The termination
                    <hi rend="italic">re</hi> of tne 3d person plural perfect âtmanepada has been
                    transferred to the present tense, where it is used along with <hi rend="italic"
                    >ante.</hi> But there is a general predilection for the parasmaipada
                    terminations, even in the passive. While the perfect sensibly recedes before the
                    other tenses, and is of rare occurrence, the use of the aorist largely
                    encroaches on that of the imperfect, the conjugation of which is in many verbs
                    influenced by the former, as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the verb <hi
                    rend="italic">as,</hi> in which the imperfect is:—1st sing., âsim or âsi’; 2d
                    and 3d, âsi; 1st plur., âsimha; 2d, âsittha; 3d, âsiipsu. In the imperative par.
                    the 1st sing, and 2d plur. do not differ from the corresponding forms of the
                    present. The affixes of the future (-ssα) and passive <hi rend="italic"
                    >(-ya)</hi> may also be added to the special base; thus we have the forms
                    dakkhati and passissati, “he will see,” and gamîyati and gacchiyati, “he is gone
                    to.” In the causative verb the form with <hi rend="italic">p</hi> greatly
                    preponderates, and may even be added to the special base, as, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> sunapeti (S. çrâvayati), “he informs”; ganhâpeti (S. grâhayati).
                    Lastly, the gerund in <hi rend="italic">-tvâ</hi> is not only used in compound
                    verbs in preference to the one in <hi rend="italic">-ya,</hi> but may also
                    occasionally be superadded to the latter for the sake of greater precision.
                    Thus, sajjitvâ—sad + ya+i + tvâ; and abhiruyhitvâ = abhiruh + ya + i ¼T <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> va∙ Instead of <hi rend="italic">tvâ</hi> the forms
                    <hi rend="italic">tvâna</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tûna</hi> often occur. There
                    are two forms of the infinitive, there being besides the usual form in <hi
                    rend="italic">-turn,</hi> one in <hi rend="italic">-taυe,</hi> which appears to
                    have lingered in the vernacular long after it was disused in Sanskrit
                    literature.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Literature.—</hi> The study of Pâli by Europeans is of
                    comparatively recent date; in fact, our knowledge of the very existence of an
                    extensive Pâli literature dates scarcely half a century back. It is true that in
                    1826 Professors Burnouf and Lassen were enabled, from an examination of certain
                    Pâli MSS. which had fallen under their notice, to give a general account of the
                    language; but it was reserved for the late Mr G. Tumour, colonial secretary of
                    Ceylon, to collect the first trustworthy information concerning the sacred books
                    of the island, and to edit and translate the first Pâli text of any extent. His
                    choice of the <hi rend="italic">Mahâvansa,</hi> one of the oldest chronicles,
                    was all the more fortunate, as, in the almost total absence of historical works
                    in Sanskrit literature, these annals were calculated to yield a vast amount of
                    information regarding the origin and earlier history of the Buddhistic religion
                    in India. The book had been ready for the press many years, but was not
                    published till 1837, while a series of articles by the same author, embodying
                    the results of his examination of the <hi rend="italic">Mahâvansa</hi> and its
                    commentary and of the contemporaneous <hi rend="italic">Dτpavansa (Jour. Bengal
                    As.</hi><hi rend="italic">Soc.,</hi> vols. v. and vi.), had been received by
                    Oriental scholars with the utmost interest. The thirtyeight chapters published
                    by him bring the history of Ceylon down to 477 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.;</hi>
                    they comprise the original work of <hi rend="italic">Mdhânâma.</hi> Six more
                    chapters, ready for the press in text and translation, were found among Tumour’s
                    papers at his early death in 1842, and are now in the India office library. The
                    whole <hi rend="italic">Mahâvansa,</hi> in Pâli and Sinhalese, has since been
                    printed at the Government press, Colombo, 1877-83, and an English translation is
                    in progress. However, a critical edition of the earlier part, and more
                    especially of the commentary upon it, is still a desideratum. There is an
                    excellent edition and translation of the <hi rend="italic">Dipaυansa</hi> by
                    Professor Oldenberg (London, 1879), according to whom the work was written
                    between the beginning of the 4th and the first third of the 5th century. Among
                    the historical works may also be classed the <hi rend="italic">Dâthâvansa,</hi>
                    a poetical history of the tooth-relic of Buddha, composed by Dhammakitti early
                    in the 13th century. The work was printed at Colombo in 1882, and an English
                    translation by Μ. Kumâraswâmi appeared in London in 1874. Further, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Attanagaluvansa,</hi> the history of a temple, likewise of the
                    13th century, edited and translated by J. D’Alwis at Colombo in 1866. Other
                    historical works are described in the catalogues of Pâli MSS. Lastly, there
                    exist many mediaeval Pâli inscriptions, some of considerable extent, as, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> those of Kalyânî in Burmah, which are now in course of
                    publication, and are likely to yield valuable historical results. Many of them
                    are accompanied by a translation in Burmese or Talaing,—a language now all but
                    extinct. It is worth noting that neither in Ceylon nor in Cambodia have any old
                    Pâli inscriptions been found; in the island the old inscriptions are in
                    Sinhalese, in Cambodia they are in Sanskrit, frequently with a translation in
                    Khmer.</p>
                <p>Though there is an old ninefold division (navanga, see Dr R. Morris’s “Report on
                    Pâli Literature,” in <hi rend="italic">Philological Society's Proceedings,</hi>
                    1880) of the canonical scriptures, it is the general practice of Pâli scholars
                    to abide by the division into three “baskets” (tipitaka, pitakattaya), first
                    specified by G. Tumour, and then more correctly in Childers’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionary,</hi> p. 507, viz., the <hi rend="italic">Vinayapitaka,</hi> the <hi

                    earliest, has been published in a critical edition in five volumes by Professor
                    Oldenberg, London, 1879-83, while a translation by the same and Mr Rhys Davids
                    is in progress in the <hi rend="italic">Sacred Books of the East.</hi> One of
                    its constituent parts, the <hi rend="italic">Pâtimokkha,</hi> mentioned already
                    by Laloubère, was edited and translated into Russian by Minayeff (1869); an
                    English translation by Gogerly had appeared thirty years previously in vol. iii.
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Ceylon Friend,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Journal
                    of the Royal Asiatic Society</hi> for 1875 brought out a new translation,
                    accompanied by the Pâli text, by J. F. Dickson. Editions of the text have also
                    appeared in Ceylon and Burmah. A ritualistic manual, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kammavacιι,</hi> the first chapter of which was edited by Spiegel with a Latin
                    translation in 1841, was the first Pâli text published in Europe. The first of
                    the numerous works composing the <hi rend="italic">Suttapitaka</hi> that was
                    made accessible to Pâli scholars in Europe was the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dhammapada,</hi> or Path to Virtue, a critical edition of which, with a Latin
                    translation and copious extracts from Buddhaghosa’s commentary, was brought out
                    by Professor Fausböll, of Copenhagen, in 1855. So popular has this work proved
                    as a type of Buddhistic sentiment that no less than two English translations (by
                    Professor F. Max Müller in 1870 and 1881, and by Professor J. Gray, of Rangoon,
                    in 1881), βne in German (by Professor À. Weber, 1860), and one in French (by Μ.
                    F. Hû, 1878) have appeared, besides various editions printed at Colombo and
                    Rangoon, with translations into the respective vernaculars. Other collections of
                    moral maxims also, such as <hi rend="italic">Lokaniti</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dhammaniti,</hi> appear to be favourite books in Burmah. Of the other works of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Suttapitaka,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Jcιtaka Book,</hi>
                    an account of the five hundred and fifty previous births of Buddha, has till
                    quite recently absorbed the lion’s share of attention on account of its being
                    the oldest extant collection of fables and popular stories, many of which have
                    at an early date found their way to the West, and are still current amongst us.
                    Three volumes of the text of this extensive work, edited by Professor Fausböll,
                    and one volume of the translation, by Professor Rhys Davids, have up to the
                    present appeared, while many of the most interesting tales, in groups of from
                    two to twelve, were separately published by the same editor between the years
                    1858 and 1872. Other works belonging to the same division which have been
                    published are <hi rend="italic">Khuddakapatha</hi> (by Professor Childers,
                    1869), <hi rend="italic">Buddhavansa</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cariyapitaka</hi> (by Dr Morris, 1882), <hi rend="italic">Anguttaranikâya</hi>
                    (by the same, 1884), and <hi rend="italic">Majjhimanikâya</hi> (by Trenckner,
                    1884); and a number of others, such as <hi rend="italic">Itivuttaka,</hi><hi

                    >gâthâ,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Apaddna,</hi> are, thanks to the active zeal
                    of the working members of the newly founded Pâli Text Society, either in
                    progress or in preparation. An edition of <hi rend="italic">Sutta-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nipâta,</hi> by Professor Fausböll, whose translation of the work
                    appeared in 1881, is also passing through the press. Seven suttas from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ωighanikaya,</hi> prepared for publication by the late P.
                    Grimblot, appeared in Paris in 1876; and a number of others, from various
                    collections, edited and translated by L. Feer, are to be found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">Asiatique.</hi> An edition, by
                    Professor Childers, of the <hi rend="italic">Mahâparinibbânasutta,</hi> from the
                    <hi rend="italic">Dighanikdya,</hi> was published in 1876, and a translation of
                    the same and other suttas, by Professor Rhys Davids, forms vol. xi. of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sacred Books of the East.</hi> Lastly, Dr Morris has in the press
                    an edition and translation of “the Six Jewels of the Law,” one of which is the
                    <hi rend="italic">Mahâsatipatthânasutta,</hi> a favourite text-book in Burmah
                    and Ceylon. The <hi rend="italic">Milinda-panha,</hi> a work of the middle of
                    the 2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> a scholarly edition of which we
                    owe to Trenckner (1880), though obviously not a canonical book, may well be
                    classed with this second division. The <hi rend="italic">Abhidharnrnapitaka</hi>
                    has so little in it to attract the European student of Pâli that an edition of
                    any of its components parts is not likely to be forthcoming for some time. A
                    compendium of its tenets, the <hi rend="italic">A bhidhammatthasangaha,</hi> has
                    been frequently printed in the Burmese and in the Sinhalese character.</p>
                <p>While in Siam and Ceylon the law-books are in the vernacular, they are in Burmah
                    in the original Pâli, which is generally accompanied by a Burmese gloss. San
                    Germano translated one of them (see his work on <hi rend="italic">Burmah,</hi>
                    p. 173 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>) in the end of last century. Several of them
                    have in recent years been brought out at Rangoon by Colonel H. Browne, and the
                    oldest of them, by King Wagaru, is passing through the press. The editor,
                    Professor Forchhammer, has also supplied valuable translations to the series of
                    Mr Jardine’s <hi rend="italic">Notes on Buddhist Laιo,</hi> which are appearing
                    at Rangoon. A critical edition of the <hi rend="italic">Laws of Manurdja,</hi>
                    by Dr Führer, is in the press at Bombay.</p>
                <p>The age of the oldest Pâli grammarian, Kaccâyana, is still under dispute; it is
                    far more likely, however, that it has to be placed towards the end of the 11th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> (see Colonel Fryer’s paper in <hi
                    rend="italic">Jour. Beng. As. Soc.</hi> for 1882) than with J. D’Alwis in the
                    6th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> While his system is the one which has
                    long been &lt;aιrrent in Burmah, the grammar by Moggallâna (second half of the
                    12th century) represents the leading grammatical school of Ceylon. Round both a
                    large number of grammatical works have grown up, more than sixty of which are
                    specified and fully described by Subhuti in the introduction to his book on the
                    Pâli declensions <hi rend="italic">(Nâmamâlâ,</hi> Colombo, 1876). Μ. E. Senart
                    has given an excellent edition and exposition of Kaccâyana’s grammar Paris,
                    1871), some chapters of which had previously been made the subject of separate
                    treatises by J. D’Alwis and Professor E. Kuhn. The first five chapters of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Bâlâvatâra</hi> were edited and translated by L. F. Lee <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ceylon As.</hi><hi rend="italic">Soc.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Jour,</hi> for 1870-71), and the sixth chapter of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rûpasiddhi,</hi> another old grammar, was recently published by Dr Grünwedel
                    (Berlin, 1883). The oldest Pâli vocabulary, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abhidhànappadipikâ,</hi> and compiled by the above-mentioned Moggallâna on the
                    model of the <hi rend="italic">Amarakosha,</hi> was first printed at Colombo in
                    1824 as an appendix to Clough’s grammar. A better edition, by Subhuti, with
                    English and Sinhalese interpretations, notes, and appendices, appeared in 1865,
                    of which a much improved reissue has just appeared at Colombo, to be followed in
                    a second volume by full alphabetical indices. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dhâtumanjûsâ,,</hi> a dictionary of Pâli radicals, by Silavansa, was edited
                    with English and Sinhalese translation at Colombo in 1872. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vuttodaya,</hi> a work on metre by Sangharakkhita, who is identified with
                    Moggallâna, was first edited and translated by Professor Minayeff of St
                    Petersburg in 1869, and in 1877, as No. II. of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pâli</hi><hi rend="italic">Studies,</hi> by Colonel G. E. Fryer, who had
                    previously, in the first essay (1875), given the text with a full analysis of a
                    work on rhetoric, called <hi rend="italic">Subodhâlankàra,</hi> by the same
                    author.</p>
                <p>There are great facilities in Europe for the study of Pâli and its extensive
                    literature. The British Museum, the University Library of Cambridge, and the
                    library of the India Office are rich in Pâli MSS., and a catalogue raisonné of
                    the last-mentioned collection, by Professor Oldenberg, is accessible to
                    students. The Royal Library of Copenhagen contains the MSS. which the late
                    Professor E. Ra&gt;k had brought from India, probably the finest collection in
                    Europe, a catalogue of which was published in 1846. The National Library of
                    Paris is the only one in Europe that possesses, in addition to a large number of
                    MSS. in the Sinhalese and Burmese characters, a fine assemblage of MSS. in
                    Cambodian letters. There are also Pâli MSS. in the museums of learned societies
                    and in private hands, and it would be well if means could be devised for
                    bringing these hidden treasures to light and utilizing them for literary
                    purposes, for the study of the Pâli language and literature has been making
                    rapid strides within the last ten years. Lectures on Pâli are delivered at
                    Cambridge, in Paris, and in most of the German universities, and the number of
                    publications of Pâli texts increases year by year. It is already admitted that
                    Childers's <hi rend="italic">Dictionary,</hi> the publication of which in 1875
                    formed an epoch in the study of Pâli, no longer suffices to supply the want, and
                    that a more comprehensive work, or at least a supplementary dictionary, is

                    tardily that it was still unknown to the authors of the <hi rend="italic">Essai

                    it in 1827, and it has always been a scarce book. In 1872 Professor Minayeff
                    brought out at St Petersburg a Pâli grammar, written in Russian, which was
                    translated into French by Μ. S. Guyard five years later. An English translation
                    made from that French version, by C. G. Adams, appeared at Maulmain in 1882.
                    Meantime Professor E. Kuhn of Munich published his valuable <hi rend="italic"

                    (Berlin, 1875), a mine of wealth for all students of the language. It is from
                    this book and from Dr Ed. Muller’s grammar, to be named presently, that most of
                    the examples in the above grammatical sketch have been culled. In 1881 there
                    appeared at Christiania <hi rend="italic">Die Flexion</hi><hi rend="italic">des

                    published, deserves to be called a pattern of critical scholarship. Much
                    valuable information on grammatical and etymological questions may also be
                    gained from Professor Fr. Müller’s <hi rend="italic">Beiträge zur Kenntnis*
