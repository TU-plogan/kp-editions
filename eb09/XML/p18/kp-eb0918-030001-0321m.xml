                    eleven children. His father, John Parker, a small farmer and skilful mechanic,
                    was a typical New England yeoman, a man of sterling moral worth, of strong
                    intellect, meditative, and fond of reading,—a strict disciplinarian in his
                    house, a Unitarian in his theology before Unitarianism was known in New England
                    as a system, and a Federalist in his politics when there were but four
                    Federalists in Lexington. His mother, “an imaginative, delicate-minded, poetic,
                    yet very practical woman,” took great pains with the religious education of her
                    children, “caring, however, but little for doctrines,” and making religion to
                    consist of love and good works. Theodore’s paternal grandfather, Captain John
                    Parker, fired the first shot upon the British at the battle of Lexington,
                    commanding on that occasion a troop of seventy men. The historic musket from
                    which that shot was fired became one of the most valued ornaments of the
                    grandson’s study. His mother taught him to listen to the monitions of conscience
                    as the voice of God, and from his infancy his life was dominated by moral and
                    religious emotions and ideas of overpowering force. The boy was richly endowed
                    intellectually and physically. His memory was marvellously retentive. The
                    acquisition of languages was a delight and recreation to him. He obtained the
                    elements of knowledge in the schools of the district, which were open during the
                    winter months only. During the rest of the year he worked on his father’s farm.
                    He was all the time an immense and omnivorous reader, and his powerful memory
                    enabled him to remember all that he read. At the age of seventeen he became
                    himself a winter schoolmaster, and in his twentieth year he entered himself at
                    Harvard, working on the farm as usual while he followed his studies, and going
                    over to Cambridge for the examination only. For the theological course he took
                    up in 1834 his residence in the college, meeting his expenses by a small sum
                    amassed by school-keeping and by help from a poor students’ fund. He studied
                    fourteen hours a day, not only following the usual course of the college, but
                    plunging deep into German theology and Biblical criticism, and especially the
                    history of non-Christian religions. At the close of his college career he began
                    his translation of De Wette’s <hi rend="italic">Introduction to the Old
                    Testament.</hi> His journal and letters show that he had made acquaintance with
                    a large number of languages, including Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, Arabic, Coptic,
                    Ethiopie, as well as the classical and the</p>
