                    Dordogne. It is 310 miles by rail south-south-west of Paris and 79 miles
                    east-north-east of Bordeaux. Périgueux is divided into three distinct parts. In
                    the middle, on the slope of the hill, is the town of the Middle Ages, with
                    narrow, crooked, and dirty streets, above which rises the cathedral of St Front;
                    higher up comes the modern town, its houses separated by gardens and public
                    walks; and at the foot of the hill and lying along the Isle are small houses of
                    modern construction, built on the fine ruins of the Roman town. Three bridges
                    connect Périgueux with the left bank of the Isle, where stood Vesunna, the
                    capital of the Petrocorii. Hardly a trace of this old Gallic oppidum remains,
                    but not far off, on the Plateau de la Boissière, the rampart of the old Roman
                    camp, 1970 feet long and half as wide, is still to be recognized. On the right
                    bank of the Isle, in the Roman city, there have been discovered some baths of
                    the 1st or 2d century, which had a frontage of 200 feet, and were supplied by an
                    aqueduct 4 miles long, which spanned the Isle. In several places numerous
                    mosaics have been found, some of which have been placed in the museum. A
                    circular building, called the “Tower of Vesunna,” 68 feet in diameter and 89
                    feet in height, stands at what was formerly the centre of the city, where all
                    the chief streets met. It is believed to have been originally the cella or main
                    part of a temple, of which the peristyle has disappeared, probably dedicated to
                    the tutelary deities of Vesunna. Of the amphitheatre there still remain huge
                    fragments of wall built of pebbles and cement, staircases, vomitories, and
                    partly uncovered vaults. The building, which held 40,000 spectators, had a
                    diameter of 1312 feet, that of the arena being 876 feet; judging from its
                    construction it must be as old as the 3d or even the 2d century. The counts of
                    Périgueux used it for their chateau, and lived in it from the 12th to the end of
                    the 14th century. In 1644 it was given over by the town to the Order of the
                    Visitation, and the sisters took from it the stones required for the
                    construction of their nunnery. At present it is private property. The most
                    remarkable, however, of the ruins of old Vesunna is the Chateau Barrière. It
                    rests on stones of great size, and dates in part from a very remote period. Two
                    tθλvers date from the 3d or 4th century, and formed part <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0560-0535"/> of the fortified enceinte; the highest tower is
                    of the 10th century; and the part now inhabited is of the 11th or 12th century,
                    and was formerly used as a burial chapel. The bulk of the chateau is of the
                    12th, and some of the windows of the 16th century. Lastly, there are still to be
                    traced the two tiers of wall of the enceinte, built round the city in the 5th
                    century; but these are partly hidden by restorations of a later date. Numerous
                    courses of stone are also to be seen, shafts of columns, and marbles of various
                    shapes and sizes. Of the mediaeval town the feature most worthy of notice is the
                    cathedral of St Front, which is indeed (or rather was) one of the most
                    interesting of sacred buildings. It bears a striking resemblance to the
                    Byzantine churches and to St Mark’s at Venice, and was built from 984 to 1047,
                    contemporaneously with the latter (977-1085). It consists of five great cupolas,
                    arranged in the form of a Greek cross, and conspicuous from the outside. The
                    arms of the cross are 69 feet in width, and the whole is 184 feet long. These
                    cupolas, 89 feet high from the keystone to the ground, and supported on a
                    vaulted roof with pointed arches after the manner characteristic of Byzantine
                    architecture, served as models for many other churches in Aquitania; thus St
                    Front is entitled to a prominent place in the history of art. The pointed arches
                    imitated from it prepared the way for the introduction of the Gothic style. The
                    restoration of the edifice, begun in 1865, resulted, unfortunately, in an almost
                    complete reconstruction, in which the old features have been largely lost. The
                    belfry of St Front is the only one in the Byzantine style now extant; it dates
                    from the 11th century, and is composed of two massive cubes, placed the one
                    above the other in retreat, with a circular colonnade surmounted by a dome. The
                    interior of the church has a fine altar-screen of carved oak. Near St Front are
                    the ruins of the old basilica built in the 6th century. The bishop’s palace, in
                    the grounds of the ancient abbey, has a curious subterranean cloister of the
                    12th, 13th, and 14th centuries. Périgueux has several old and curious houses of
                    the mediaeval and Renaissance periods; a large prefecture of some architectural
                    merit, built at great expense a few years ago in the style of the Renaissance
                    and of the 18th century; a museum which is singularly rich in Roman, Frank,
                    Egyptian, and pre-Celtic antiquities; and a library of 30,000 volumes. In the
                    squares are statues of Montaigne, Fénelon, General Daumesnil, the defender of
                    Vincennes (1814-15), and Marshal Bugeaud. The town has iron and copper
                    foundries, serge and born-basin factories, tanneries, and dye-works. It does a
                    large trade in flour, wine, brandy, hides, poultry, and in the celebrated patés
                    du Périgord. It is the junction of the railway from Paris to Agen with that from
                    Bordeaux to Lyons <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Clermont. The population in 1881
                    was 25,036. ·</p>
                <p>Vesunna, as has already been said, was the capital of the Petrocorii, allies of
                    Vercingetorix when Caesar invaded Gaul. The country was afterwards occupied by
                    the Romans, who built a second city of Vesunna on the right bank of the Isle
                    opposite the site of the Gallic oppidum. It contained public buildings, and
                    Roman roads led from it to Limoges, Agen, Bordeaux, and Saintes. The barbarian
                    invasion brought this prosperity to a close. In the 6th century St Front
                    preached Christianity here, and over his tomb there was raised in the 10th
                    century an abbey, which became the centre of the new town, called Puy St Front.
                    The latter soon began to rival the old city in importance, and it was not until
                    1269 that they were united by a solemn treaty. After the time of Charlemagne
                    Périgord was governed by a line of counts. During the Hundred Years’ War
                    Périgueux was twice attacked by the English, who took the fortified town in
                    1356; and the town was ceded to them by the treaty of Bretigny, but returned to
                    the French crown in the reign of Charles V. The county passed by marriage into
                    the hands of Anthony of Bourbon, father of Henry IV., and was converted by the
                    latter into royal domain. During the Huguenot wars Périgueux was frequently a
                    Calvinist stronghold, and it also suffered during the troubles of the
                    Fronde.</p>
