                <p><label type="entry">PAMPHLETS</label>. The earliest appearance of the word is in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Philobiblon</hi> (1344) of Richard de Bury, who speaks of
                    “panfletos exiguos” (chap, viii.). In English we have Chaucer’s “this leud
                    pamflet” <hi rend="italic">(Test, of Love,</hi> bk. iii.), Occleve’s “go litil
                    pamfilet” (Mason’s ed., 1796, p. 77), and Caxton’s “paunflettis and bookys” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Book of Eneydos,</hi> 1490, Prologue). In all these examples
                    pamphlet is used to indicate the extent of the production, and in
                    contradistinction to book. In the 16 th century it became almost exclusively
                    devoted in English literature to short poetical effusions, and not till the 18th
                    century did pamphlet begin to assume its modern meaning of a prose political
                    tract. “Pamphlet” and “pamphlétaire” are of comparatively recent introduction
                    into French from the English, and generally indicate fugitive criticism of a
                    more severe, not to say libellous, character than with us. The derivation of the
                    word is a subject of contention among etymologists. The experts are also
                    undecided as to what is actually understood by a pamphlet. Some bibliographers
                    apply the term to everything, except periodicals, of quarto size and under, if
                    not more than fifty pages, while others would limit its application to two or
                    three sheets of printed matter which have first appeared in an unbound
                    condition. These are merely physical peculiarities, and include academical
                    dissertations, chap-books, and broadsides, which from their special subjects
                    belong to a separate class from the pamphlet proper. As regards its literary
                    characteristics, the chief notes of a pamphlet are brevity and spontaneity. It
                    has a distinct aim, and relates to some matter of current interest, whether
                    religious, political, or literary. Usually intended to support a particular line
                    of argument, it may be descriptive, controversial, didactic, or satirical. It is
                    not so much a class as a form of literature, and from its ephemeral character
                    represents the changeful currents of public opinion more closely than the bulky
                    volume published after the formation of that opinion. The history of
                    pamphlets^being the entire record of popular feeling, all that is necessary here
                    is to briefly indicate the chief families of political and religious pamphlets
                    which have exercised marked influence, and more particularly in those
                    countries—England and France—where pamphlets have made so large a figure in
                    influencing thought and events.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to point out much in ancient literature which precisely answers
                    to our modern view of the pamphlet. The <hi rend="italic">libelli famosi</hi> of
                    the Romans were simply abusive pasquinades. Some of the small treatises of
                    Lucian, the lost <hi rend="italic">Anti-Cato</hi> of Caesar, Seneca’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Apocolocyntosis</hi> written against Claudius, Julian’s Καισαρες
                    <hi rend="italic">η ^νμπόσων</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Άντίοχικος</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">η</hi> Mισoτrωγωv, from their general application, just escape the
                    charge of being mere satires, and may therefore claim to rank as early specimens
                    of the pamphlet.</p>
                <p>At the end of the 14th century the Lollard doctrines were widely circulated by
                    means of the tracts and leaflets of Wickliffe and his followers. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Ploughman's Prayer</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lanthome of
                    Light,</hi> which appeared about the time of Oldcastle’s martyrdom, were
                    extremely popular, and similar brief vernacular pieces became so common that it
                    was thought necessary in 1408 to enact that persons in authority should search
                    out and apprehend all persons owning English books. The printers of the 15th
                    century produced many controversial tractates, and Caxton and Wynkin de Worde
                    printed in the lesser form. It was in France that the printing press first began
                    to supply reading for the common people. During the last twenty years of the
                    15th century there arose an extensive popular literature of farces, tales in
                    verse and prose, satires, almanacs, àc., extending to a few leaves apiece, and
                    circulated by the itinerant booksellers still known as colporteurs. These
                    folk-books soon spread from France to Italy and Spain, and were introduced into
                    England at the beginning of the 16th century, doubtless from the same quarter,
                    as most of our early chap-books are translations or adaptations from the French.
                    Another form of literature even more transient was the broadside, or single
                    sheet printed on one side only, which appears to have flourished principally in
                    England, but which had been in use from the first invention of printing for
                    papal indulgences, royal proclamations, and similar documents. Throughout
                    western Europe, about the middle of the 16 th century, the broadside made a
                    considerable figure in times of political agitation. In England it was chiefly
                    used for ballads, which soon became so extremely popular that during the first
                    ten years of the reign of Elizabeth the names of no less than forty
                    ballad-printers appear in the Stationers’ Registers. The humanist movement of
                    the beginning of the 16th century produced the famous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epistolae</hi><hi rend="italic">Obscurorum Virorum,</hi> and the leading
                    spirits of the Reformation period—Erasmus, Hutten, Luther, Melanchthon,
                    Francowitz, Vergerio, Curio, and Calvin—found in tracts a ready method of widely
                    circulating their opinions.</p>
                <p>The course of ecclesiastical events was precipitated in England by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Supplicacyon for the Beggars</hi> (1523) of Simon Fish, answered
                    by Sir Thomas More’s <hi rend="italic">Sup-plycacwn of Soulys.</hi> In the time
                    of Edward VI. brief tracts were largely used as a propagandist instrument in
                    favour of the Reformed religion; political tracts were represented by the
                    address of the rebels in Devonshire (1549). The licensing of the press by Mary
                    greatly hindered the production of this kind of literature. From about 1570
                    there came an unceasing flow of Puritan pamphlets, of which more than forty were
                    reprinted under the title of <hi rend="italic">A parte of a register</hi>
                    (London, Waldegrave, 4to). To this publication Dr John Bridges replied by a
                    ponderous quarto, <hi rend="italic">A defence of the government established in
                    the church of England</hi> (1587), which gave rise to <hi rend="italic">Oh read
                    over D. John Bridges . . . by the reverend and ιvorthie Martin Marprelate
                    gentleman</hi> (1588), the first of the famous Martin Marprelate tracts, whose
                    titles sufficiently indicate their opposition to priestly orders and episcopacy.
                    Bishop Cooper’s <hi rend="italic">Admonition to the People of England</hi>
                    (1589) came next, followed on the other side by <hi rend="italic">Hay any tvorke
                    for Cooper . . . by Martin the</hi><hi rend="italic">Metropolitane,</hi> and by
                    others from both parties to the number of about twenty-three. The controversy
                    lasted about a year, and ended in the discomfiture of the Puritans and the
                    seizure of their secret press. The writers on the Marprelate side are generally

                    and Fenner, and their opponents Bishop Cooper, John Lilly, and Nash.</p>
                <p>As early as the middle of the 16th century we find ballads of news; and in the
                    reigns of Elizabeth and James I. small pamphlets, translated from the German and
                    French, and known as “news-books,” were circulated by the so-called
                    “Mercury-women.” These were the immediate predecessors of weekly newspapers, and
                    continued to the end of the 17th century. A proclamation was issued by Charles
                    II., May 12, 1680, “for suppressing the printing and publishing of unlicensed
                    news-books and pamphlets of news.”</p>
                <p>In the 17th century pamphlets began to contribute more than ever to the formation
                    of public opinion. Nearly one hundred were written by or about the restless John
                    Lilburne, but still more numerous were those of the undaunted Prynne, who
                    himself published above one hundred and sixty, besides many weighty folios and
                    quartos. Charles I. found energetic supporters in Peter Heylin and Sir Roger
                    LΕstrange, the latter noted for the coarseness of his pen. The most
                    distinguished pamphleteer of the period was John Milton, who began his career in
                    this direction by five anti-episcopal tracts (1641-42) during the Smectymnuus
                    quarrel. In 1643 his wife’s desertion caused him to publish anonymously <hi
                    rend="italic">Doctrine and discipline of divorce,</hi> followed by several
                    others on the same subject. He printed the <hi rend="italic">Tract on
                    Education</hi> in 1644, and, unlicensed and unregistered, his famous <hi
                    rend="italic">Areopagitica—a speech for the liberty of unlicensed printing.</hi>
                    He defended the trial and execution of the king in <hi rend="italic">Tenure
                    of</hi><hi rend="italic">längs</hi><hi rend="italic">and magistrates</hi>
                    (1648). The <hi rend="italic">Eikon Basilike</hi> dispute was conducted with
                    more ponderous weapons than the kind we are now discussing. When Monk held
                    supreme power Milton addressed to him <hi rend="italic">The present means of a
                    free commonwealth</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Readie and easie way</hi> (1660),
                    both pleading for a commonwealth in preference to a monarchy. John Goodwin, the
                    author of <hi rend="italic">Obstructors of Justice</hi> (1649), John Phillipps,
                    the nephew of Mil ton, and Abiezer Coppe were violent and prolific partisan
                    writers, the last-named specially known for his extreme Presbyterian principles.
                    The tract <hi rend="italic">Killing no murder</hi> (1657), aimed at Cromwell,
                    and attributed to Colonel Titus or Colonel Sexby, excited more attention than
                    any other political effusion of the time. The history of the civil war period is
                    told day by day in the well-known collection made by Thomason the bookseller,
                    now preserved in the British Museum. It numbers 30,000 separate books,
                    pamphlets, and broadsides, ranging from 1640 to 1662, and is bound in 2000
                    volumes. Each article was dated by Thomason at the time of acquisition. William
                    Miller was another bookseller famous for his collection of pamphlets, which were
                    catalogued by Tooker in 1693. Wm. Laycock printed a <hi rend="italic">Proposal
                    for raising a fund</hi> for buying them up for the nation.</p>
                <p>The Catholic controversy during the reign of James II. gave rise to a multitude
                    of books and pamphlets, which have been described by Peck <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Catalogue,</hi> 1735) and by Jones <hi rend="italic">(Catalogue,</hi> Chetham
                    Society, 1859-65, 2 vols.). Politics were naturally the chief feature of the
                    floating literature connected with the Revolution of 1688. The political tracts
                    of Lord Halifax are interesting both in matter and manner. He is supposed to
                    have written <hi rend="italic">The character of a political trimmer</hi> (1689),
                    sometimes ascribed to Sir W. Coventry. About the middle of the reign Defoe was
                    introduced to William III., and produced the first of his pamphlets on
                    occasional conformity. He issued in 1697 his two defences of standing armies in
                    support of the Government, and published sets of tracts on the partition treaty,
                    the union with Scotland, and many other subjects.</p>
                <p>His <hi rend="italic">Shortest way with the Dissenters</hi> (1702) placed him in
                    the pillory.</p>
                <p>Under Queen Anne pamphlets arrived at a remarkable degree of importance. Never
                    before or since has this method of publication been used by such masters of
                    thought and language. Political writing of any degree of authority was almost
                    entirely confined to pamphlets. If the Whigs were able to command the services
                    of Addison and Steele, the Tories fought with the terrible pen of Swift. Second
                    in power if not in literary ability were Bolingbroke, Somers, Atterbury, Prior,
                    and Pulteney. The Government viewed with a jealous eye the free use of this
                    powerful instrument, and St John seized upon fourteen booksellers and publishers
                    in one day for “libels” upon the administration (see <hi rend="italic">Annals of
                    Queen Anne,</hi> October 23, 1711). In 1712 a duty was laid upon newspapers and
                    pamphlets, displeasing all parties, and soon falling into disuse. Bishop
                    Hoadly’s sermon on the kingdom of Christ (1717), holding that the clergy could
                    claim no temporal jurisdiction, occasioned the Bangorian controversy, which
                    produced seventy or eighty pamphlets. Soon after this period party-writing
                    declined from its comparatively high standard and fell into meaner and venal
                    hands. Under George III. Bute took Dr Shebbeare from Newgate in order to employ
                    his pen. The court part received the support of a few able pamphlets, among
                    which may be mentioned <hi rend="italic">The consideration of the German
                    War</hi> against the policy of Pitt, and <hi rend="italic">The prerogative droit
                    de Roy</hi> (1764) vindicating the prerogative. We must not forget that although
                    Samuel Johnson was a pensioned scribe he has for an excuse that his political
                    tracts are his worst performances. Edmund Burke, on the other hand, has produced
                    in this form some of his most valued writings. The troubles in America and the
                    union between Ireland and Great Britain are subjects which are abundantly
                    illustrated in pamphlet literature.</p>
                <p>Early in the present century the rise of the quarterly reviews threw open a new
                    channel of publicity to those who had previously used pamphlets to spread their
                    opinions, and later on the rapid growth of monthly magazines and weekly reviews
                    afforded controversialists a much more certain and extensive circulation than
                    they could ensure by an isolated publication. Although pamphlets are no longer
                    the sole or most important factor of public opinion, the minor literature of
                    great events is never likely to be entirely confined to periodicals. The
                    following topics, which might be largely increased in number, have each been
                    discussed by a multitude of pamphlets, most of which, however, are likely to
                    have been hopeless aspirants for a more certain means of preservation:—the
                    Bullion Question (1810), the Poor Laws (1828- 34), <hi rend="italic">Tracts for
                    the Times</hi> and the ensuing controversy (1833-45), Dr Hampden (1836), the
                    Canadian Revolt (1837-38), the Corn Laws (1841-48), Gorham Controversy
                    (1849-50), Crimean War and Indian Mutiny (1854- 59), Schleswig-Holstein
                    (1863-64), Ireland (1868-69), the Franco-German War, with <hi rend="italic">Dame
                    Europa's School</hi> and its imitators (1870-71), Vaticanism, occasioned by Mr
                    Gladstone’s <hi rend="italic">Vatican Decrees</hi> (1874), the Eastern Question
                    (1877-80), and the Irish Land Laws (1880-82).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">France.—</hi> The activity of the French press in putting forth
                    small tracts in favour of the Reformed religion caused the Sorbonne in 1523 to
                    petition the king to abolish the diabolical art of printing. Even one or two
                    sheets of printed matter were found too cumbersome, and single leaves or
                    placards were issued in such numbers that they were the subject of a special
                    edict, September 28, 1553. An <hi rend="italic">ordonnance</hi> of February 1566
                    was specially directed against libellous pamphlets, and those who wrote,
                    printed, or even possessed them. The rivalry between Francis I. and Charles V.
                    gave rise to many political pamphlets, and under Francis II. the Guises were
                    attacked by similar means. Fr. Hotman directed his <hi rend="italic"

                    long series of imitations. Between Francis I. and Charles IX. the general tone
                    of the pamphlet-literature was grave, pedantic, and dogmatic, with few songs and
                    an occasional political satire. From the latter period to the death of Henry IV.
                    it became audacious, cruel, and dangerous, attended, however, with a
                    considerable increase of political songs.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Satyre Ménippée</hi> (1594), one of the most perfect models
                    of the pamphlet in the language, did more harm to the League than all the
                    victories of Henry IV. The pamphlets against the Jesuits were many and violent.
                    Père Richeome defended the order in <hi rend="italic">Chasse du</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">renard</hi><hi rend="italic">Pasquier</hi> (1603), the latter
                    person being their vigorous opponent Étienne Pasquier. On the death of the king
                    the country was filled with appeals for revenge against the Jesuits for his
                    murder; the best known of them was the <hi rend="italic">Anti-Coton</hi> (1610),
                    generally attributed to César de Plaix. During the regency of Mary de’ Medici
                    the pamphlet changed its severer form to a more facetious type. In spite of the
                    danger of such proceeding under the uncompromising ministry of Richelieu, there
                    was no lack of libels upon him, which were even in most instances printed in
                    France. These largely increased during the Fronde, but it was Mazarin who was
                    the subject of more of this literature than any other historical personage. It
                    has been calculated that from the Parisian press alone there came sufficient <hi
                    rend="italic">Mazarinades</hi> to fill 150 quarto volumes each of 500 pages.
                    Eight hundred were published during the siege of Paris (February 8 to March 11,
                    1649). A collection of satirical pieces, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tableau</hi><hi rend="italic">du gouvernement</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Richelieu, Mazarin, Fouquet,</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Colbert</hi> (1693) extends to 432 pages. Pamphlets dealing with the amours of
                    the king and his courtiers were in vogue in the time of Louis XIV., the most
                    caustic of them being the <hi rend="italic">Carte</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Géographique</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Cour</hi> (1668) of Bussy-Rabutin. The
                    presses of Holland and the Low Countries teemed with tracts against Colbert, Le
                    Tellier, Louvois, and Père Lachaise. The first of the ever-memorable <hi
                    rend="italic">Provinciales</hi> appeared on January 23, 1656, under the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">Lettre</hi><hi rend="italic">de, Louis de Montalie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">à un</hi><hi rend="italic">provincial</hi><hi rend="italic">de

                    irregular intervals during the next fifteen months. They excited extraordinary
                    attention throughout Europe. The Jesuit replies were feeble and ineffectual.
                    John Law and the schemes of the bubble period caused much popular raillery.
                    During the long reign of Louis XV. the distinguished names of Voltaire,
                    Rousseau, Montesquieu, Diderot, D’Alembert, D’Holbach, Helvetius, and
                    Beaumarchais must be added to the list of writers in this class.</p>
                <p>The preliminary straggle between the parliament and the crown gave rise to
                    hundreds of pamphlets, which grew still more numerous as the Revolution
                    approached. Linguet and Mirabeau began their appeals to the people. Camille
                    Desmoulins came into notice as a publicist during the elections for the
                    states-general; but perhaps the piece which caused the most sensation was the
                    <hi rend="italic">Qu'est ce que le Tiers État</hi> (1789) of the Abbé Sieyès.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Domine</hi><hi rend="italic">salvum fac</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Regem</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pange</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lingua</hi> (1789) were two royalist brochures of unsavoury memory. The
                    financial disorders of 1790 occasioned the <hi rend="italic">Effets</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des assignats</hi><hi rend="italic">sur le prix du pain</hi> of
                    Dupont de Nemours; Necker was attacked in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Criminelle</hi><hi rend="italic">Neckerologie</hi> of Marat; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vrai miroir</hi><hi rend="italic">de la noblesse</hi> dragged the
                    titled names of France through the mire. The massacre of the Champ de Mars, the
                    death of Mirabeau, and the flight of the king in 1791, the noyades of Lyons and
                    the crime of Charlotte Corday in 1793, and the terrible winter of 1794 have each
                    their respective pamphlet literature, more Or less violent in tone. Under the
                    consulate and the empire the only writers of note who ventured to seek this
                    method of appealing to the world were Madame de Staël, B. Constant, and
                    Chateaubriand. The royalist reaction in 1816 was the cause of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pétition</hi> of Paul Louis Courier, the first of those brilliant
                    productions of a master of the art. He gained the distinction of judicial
                    procedure with his <hi rend="italic">Simple</hi><hi rend="italic">Discours</hi>
                    in 1821, and published in 1824 his last political work <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le</hi><hi rend="italic">pamphlet des pamphlets,</hi> the most eloquent
                    justification of the pamphlet ever penned. The <hi rend="italic">Mémoire</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic">consulter</hi> of Montlosier attacked the
                    growing power of the Congrégation. The year 1827 saw an augmentation of severity
                    in the press laws and the establishment of the censure. The opposition also
                    increased in power and activity, but found its greatest support in the songs of
                    Béranger and the journalism of Mignet, Thiers, and Carrel. Μ. de Comenin was the
                    chief pamphleteer of the reign of Louis-Philippe. His <hi rend="italic">Oui
                    et</hi><hi rend="italic">non</hi> (1845), <hi rend="italic">Feu, feu</hi>
                    (1846), and <hi rend="italic">Livre</hi><hi rend="italic">des orateurs,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">par</hi><hi rend="italic">Timon,</hi> were extremely successfuL
                    The events of 1848 gave birth to a number of pamphlets, chiefly pale copies of
                    the more virile writings of the first revolution. Among the few men of power
                    Louis Veuillot was the Père Duchesne of the clericals and Victor Hugo the
                    Camille Desmoulins or Marat of the republicans. After 1852 there was no lack of
                    venal apologies of the coup d’état. Within more recent times the second empire
                    suffered from many bitter attacks, among which may be mentioned the <hi
