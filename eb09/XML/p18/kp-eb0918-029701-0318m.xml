                    from the duke of Buccleuch. He was the seventh in a family of thirteen. Having
                    received a good education (at home from a private tutor, and afterwards at the
                    grammar school of Selkirk), he was apprenticed to a surgeon named Anderson, in
                    Selkirk, and then attended the university of Edinburgh for three sessions
                    (1789-91). By his brother-in-law, James Dickson, a botanist of repute, he was
                    introduced to Sir Joseph Banks, and through his good offices he obtained the
                    post of assistant-surgeon on board the “Worcester” East Indiaman. In this
                    capacity he made the voyage in 1792 toBencoolen in Sumatra, andon his return in
                    1793 he contributed a description of eight new Sumatran fishes to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions</hi> of the Linnean Society. Park next offered his
                    services to the African Association, then looking out for a successor to the
                    unfortunate Major Houghton, and, again supported by the influence of Sir Joseph
                    Banks, he was successful in his application. On the 21st June 1795 he reached
                    the Gambia, but it was not till December 2d that he started for Pisania with
                    only two Negro servants (Johnson and Demba) on the hazardous and difficult
                    expedition into the interior, from which he was to return with the proud
                    distinction of being the first of modern Europeans to reach the well-nigh
                    fabulous waters of the Niger. Striking north-eastward across the upper basin of
                    the Senegal, he advanced through Kaarta and El Hodh, and descended upon the
                    great river of his quest at Segu on the north bank, about 13° 5 ’ N. lat. and 6°
                    20' W. long. Though he was not able to proceed down stream any farther than
                    Mursan and Silla, he managed on his home journey to follow the river valley as
                    far up as Bammako, a distance of about 300 miles. By the 10th June he was again
                    at Pisania, but he did not reach England till December 22, 1796. An account of
                    his journey was at once· drawn up for the Association by Bryan Edwards, and a
                    detailed narrative from his own pen appeared in 1799 <hi rend="italic">(Travels

                    It seemed for a time as if Park was now to settle down quietly at home; he
                    married a daughter of his old master, Mr Anderson, and commenced practice as a
                    country doctor at Peebles, where at least he could enjoy “a glass of strong beer
                    and a peep at the sky through Mr Oman’s telescope”; but he was ill at ease—his
                    heart was in Africa. In 1804 the people of Peebles were amused and alarmed by
                    the vagaries of Sidi Omback Boubi from Mogador, who had come to teach their
                    doctor Arabic; and in autumn Park parted from Sir Walter Scott, who had been one
                    of his best friends, with the hopeful proverb on his lips, “Freits (omens)
                    follow those that look to them.” He had accepted Lord Hobart’s proposal that he
                    should take command of a Niger expedition. He sailed from Portsmouth on January
                    30, 1805; and the expedition started from Pisania on May 4th. Unfortunately the
                    rainy season soon afterwards commenced; by the time Bammako was reached the
                    party was reduced from forty-four Europeans to eleven, and from Sansanding the
                    leader had to report “five only are at present alive, viz., three soldiers (one
                    deranged in his mind), Lieutenant Martyn, and myself.” Among those who had died
                    at Sansanding was his brother-in-law Mr Anderson. On November 19th he set sail
                    down the river from Sansanding with the “fixed resolution to discover the
                    termination of the Niger or perish in the attempt.” Isaaco, the Mandingo guide
                    who had accompanied the expedition up to this point, was afterwards sent on a
                    mission to find out the fate of the voyagers; it was learned that they had
                    managed to make their way through countless perils to Bussa (Boussa) between 9°
                    and 10° N. lat., and that they were there attacked by the natives, and were
                    drowned in endeavouring to escape. Park was 6 feet in height, active and robust;
                    his countenance was prepossessing, his manner in company plain and simple, but
                    somewhat cold and reserved.</p>
