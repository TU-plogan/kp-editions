                    disposition towards Christianity.</p>
                <p>Though we know so little of Philo’s own life, his numerous extant writings give
                    the füllest information as to his views of the universe and of life, and his
                    religious and scientific aims, and so enable us adequately to estimate his
                    position and importance in the history of thought. He is quite the most
                    important representative of Hellenistic J udaism, and his writings give us the
                    clearest view of what this development of Judaism was and aimed at. Since the
                    time of Alexander many Jews had been led to settle beyond Palestine either with
                    commercial objects or attracted by the privileges conferred by the diadochi on
                    the inhabitants of the cities they founded. In the great towns of Syria, Asia
                    Minor, and Egypt there were Jewish communities many thousands strong, but the
                    Jews were most numerous in Alexandria, where from its first foundation they
                    formed a considerable part of the population. The development of Judaism in the
                    diaspora differed in important points from that in Palestine, where, since the
                    successful opposition of the Maccabee age to the Hellenization which Antiochus
                    Epiphanes had sought to carry through by force, the attitude of the nation to
                    Greek culture had been essentially negative. In the diaspora, on the other hand,
                    the Jews had been deeply influenced by the Greeks; they soon more or less forgot
                    their Semitic mother-tongue, and with the language of Hellas they appropriated
                    much of Hellenic culture. They were deeply impressed by that irresistible force
                    which was blending all races and nations into one great cosmopolitan unity, and
                    so the Jews too on their dispersion became in speech and nationality Greeks, or
                    rather “Hellenists.” Now the distinguishing character of Hellenism is not the
                    absolute disappearance of the Oriental civilizations before that of Greece, but
                    the combination of the two with a preponderance of the Greek demerit. So it was
                    with the Jews, but in their case the old religion had much more persistence than
                    in other Hellenistic circles, though in other respects they too yielded to the
                    superior force of Greek civilization. This we must hold to have been the case
                    not only in Alexandria but throughout the diaspora from the commencement of the
                    Hellenistic period down to the later Roman empire. It was only after ancient
                    civilization gave way before the barbarian immigrations and the rising force of
                    Christianity that rabbinism became supreme even among the Jews of the diaspora.
                    This Hellenistico-Judaic phase of culture is sometimes called “Alexandrian,” and
                    the expression is justifiable if it only means that in Alexandria it attained
                    its highest development and flourished most. For here the Jews began to busy
                    themselves with Greek literature even under their clement rulers, the first
                    Ptolemies, and here the law and other Scriptures were first translated into
                    Greek; here the process of fusion began earliest and proceeded with greatest
                    rapidity; here, therefore, also the Jews first engaged in a scientific study of
                    Greek philosophy and transplanted that philosophy to the soil of Judaism. We
                    read of a Jewish philosopher Aristobulus in the time of Ptolemy VI. Philometor,
                    in the middle of the 2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> of whose
                    philosophical commentary on the Pentateuch fragments have been preserved by
                    Clement of Alexandria and Eusebius. So far as we can judge from these, his aim
                    was to put upon the sacred text a sense which should appeal even to Greek
                    readers, and in particular to get rid of all anthropomorphic utterances about
                    God. Eusebius regards him as a Peripatetic. We may suppose that this
                    philosophical line of thought had its representatives in Alexandria between the
                    times of Aristobulus and Philo, but we are not acquainted with the names of any
                    such. Philo certainly, to judge by his historical influence, was the greatest of
                    all these Jewish philosophers, and in his case we can follow in detail the
                    methods by which Greek culture was harmonized with Jewish faith. On one side he
                    is quite a Greek, on the other quite a Jew. His language is formed on the best
                    classical models, especially Plato. He knows and often cites the great Greek
                    poets, particularly Homer and the tragedians, but his chief studies had been in
                    Greek philosophy, and he speaks of Heraclitus, Plato, the Stoics, and the
                    Pythagoreans in terms of the highest veneration. He had appropriated their
                    doctrines so completely that he must himself be reckoned among the Greek
                    philosophers; his system was eclectic, but the borrowed elements are combined
                    into a new unity with so much originality that at the same time he may fairly be
                    regarded as representing a philosophy of his own, which has for its
                    characteristic feature the constant prominence of a fundamental religious idea.
                    Philo’s closest affinities are with Plato, the later Pythagoreans, and the
                        Stoics.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The fathers

                            tendencies. Recent writers, especially Zeller, lay weight also on his
                            Stoic affinities, and with justice, for the elements which he borrows
                            from Stoicism are as numerous and important as those derived from the
                            other two schools.</p></note> Yet with all this Philo remained a Jew,
                    and a great part of his writings is expressly directed to recommend Judaism to
                    the respect and, if possible, the acceptance of the Greeks. He was not a
                    stranger to the specifically Jewish culture that prevailed in Palestine; in
                    Hebrew he was not proficient, but the numerous etymologies he gives show that he
                    had made some study of that language.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    above all his whole works prove on every page that he felt himself to be
                    thoroughly a Jew, and desired to be nothing else. Jewish “philosophy” is to him
                    the true and highest wisdom; the knowledge of God and of things divine and human
                    which is contained in the Mosaic Scriptures is to him the deepest and the
                    purest.</p>
                <p>If now we ask wherein Philo’s Judaism consisted, we must answer that it lies
                    mainly in the formal claim that the Jewish people, in virtue of the divine
                    revelation given to Moses, possesses the true knowledge in things religious.
                    Thoroughly Jewish is his recognition that the Mosaic Scriptures of the
                    Pentateuch are of absolute divine authority, and that everything they contain is
                    valuable and significant because divinely revealed. The other Jewish Scriptures
                    are also recognized as prophetic, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> as the writings
                    of inspired men, but he does not place them on the same line with the law, and
                    he quotes them so seldom that we cannot determine the compass of his canon. The
                    decisive and normative authority is to him the “holy laws” of Moses, and this
                    not only in the sense that everything they contain is true but that all truth is
                    contained in them. Everything that is right and good in the <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0918-0796-0761"/> doctrines of the Greek philosophers had
                    already been quite as well, or even better, taught by Moses. Thus, since Philo
                    had been deeply influenced by the teachings of Greek philosophy, he actually
                    finds in the Pentateuch everything which he had learned from the Greeks. From
                    these premises he assumes as requiring no proof that the Greek philosophers must
                    in some way have drawn from Moses,—a view indeed which is already expressed by
                    Aristobulus. To carry out these presuppositions called for an exegetical method
                    which seems very strange to us, that, namely, of the allegorical interpretation
                    of Scripture. The allegorical method had been practised before Philo’s date in
                    the rabbinical schools of Palestine, and he himself expressly refers to its use
                    by his predecessors, nor does he feel that any further justification is
                    requisite. With its aid he discovers indications of the profoundest doctrines of
                    philosophy in the simplest stories of the Pentateuch.<note anchored="true"

                <p>This merely formal principle of the absolute authority of Moses is really the one
                    point in which Philo still holds to genuinely Jewish conceptions. In the whole
                    substance of his philosophy the Jewish point of view is more or less completely
                    modified—sometimes almost extinguished— by what he has learned from the Greeks.
                    Comparatively speaking, he is most truly a Jew in his conception of God. The
                    doctrine of monotheism, the stress laid on the absolute majesty and sovereignty
                    of God above the world, the principle that He is to be worshipped without
                    images, are all points in which Philo justly feels his superiority as a Jew over
                    popular heathenism. But only over popular heathenism, for the Greek philosophers
                    had long since arrived at least at a theoretical monotheism, and their influence
                    on Philo is nowhere more .strongly seen than in the detailed development of his
                    doctrine of God. The specifically Jewish <hi rend="italic">tf.e.,</hi>
                    particularistic) conception of the election of Israel, the obligation of the
                    Mosaic law, the future glory of the chosen nation, have almost disappeared; he
                    is really a cosmopolitan and praises the Mosaic law just because he deems it
                    cosmopolitan. The true sage who follows the law of Moses is the citizen not of a
                    particular state but of the world. A certain attachment which Philo still
                    manifests to the particularistic conceptions of his race is meant only “in
                    majorem Judaeorum gloriam.” The Jewish people has received a certain preference
                    from God, but only because it has the most virtuous ancestry and is itself
                    distinguished for virtue. . The Mosaic law is binding, but only because it is
                    the most righteous, humane, and rational of laws, and even its outward
                    ceremonies always disclose rational ideas and aims. And lastly, outward
                    prosperity is promised to the pious, even on earth, but the promise belongs to
                    all who turn from idols to the true God. Thus, in the whole substance of his
                    view of the universe, Philo occupies the standpoint of Greek philosophy rather
                    than of national Judaism, and his philosophy of the world and of life can be
                    completely set forth without any reference to conceptions specifically
                    Jewish.</p>
                <p>His doctrine of God starts from the idea that God is Being absolutely bare of
                    quality. All quality in finite beings has limitation, and no limitation can be
                    predicated of God, who is eternal, unchangeable, simple substance, free,
                    self-sufficient, better than the good and the beautiful. To predicate any
                    quality <hi rend="italic">(ποιότης)</hi> of God would be to reduce Him to the
                    sphere of finite existence. Of Him we can say only <hi rend="italic">that</hi>
                    He is, not <hi rend="italic">what</hi> He is, and such purely negative
                    predications as to His being appear to Philo, as to the later Pythagoreans and
                    the Neo-Platonists, the only way of securing His absolute elevation above the
                    world. At bottom, no doubt, the meaning of these negations is that God is the
                    most perfect being·: and so, con versely, we are told that God contains all
                    perfection, that He fills and encompasses all things with His being.</p>
                <p>A consistent application of Philo’s abstract conception of God would exclude the
                    possibility of any active relation of God to the world, and therefore of
                    religion, for a Being absolutely without quality and movement cannot be
                    conceived as actively concerned with the multiplicity of individual things. And
                    so in fact Philo does teach that the absolute perfection, purity, and loftiness
                    of God would be violated by direct contact with imperfect, impure, and finite
                    things. But the possibility of a connexion between God and the world is reached
                    through a distinction which forms the most important point in his theology and
                    cosmology; the proper being of God is distinguished from the infinite
                    multiplicity of divine Ideas or Forces: God himself is without quality, but He
                    disposes of an infinite variety of divine Forces, through whose mediation an
                    active relation of God to the world is brought about. In the details of his
                    teaching as to these mediating entities Philo is guided partly by Plato and
                    partly by the Stoics, but at the same time he makes use of the concrete
                    religious conceptions of heathenism and Judaism. Following Plato, he first calls
                    them Ideas or ideal patterns of all things; they are thoughts of God, yet
                    possess a real existence, and were produced before the creation of the sensible
                    world, of which they are the types. But, in distinction from Plato, Philo’s
                    ideas are at the same time efficient causes or Forces (δwd∕zeιs), which bring
                    unformed matter into order conformably to the patterns within themselves, and
                    are in fact the media of all God’s activity in the world. This modification of
                    the Platonic Ideas is due to Stoic influence, which appears also when Philo
                    gives to the iδ∈αι or δwd∕z∈ιs the name of λόγοι, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    operative ideas,—parts, as it were, of the operative Reason. For, when Philo
                    calls his mediating entities λόγοι, the sense designed is analogous to that of
                    the Stoics when they call God the Logos, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the Reason
                    which operates in the world. But at the same time Philo maintains that the
                    divine Forces are identical with the “daemons” of the Greeks, and the “angels”
                    of the Jews, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> servants and messengers of God by
                    means of which He communicates with the finite world. All this shows how
                    uncertain was Philo’s conception of the nature of these mediating Forces. On the
                    one hand, they are nothing else than Ideas of individual things conceived in the
                    mind of God, and as such ought to have no other reality than that of immanent
                    existence in God, and so Philo says expressly that the totality of Ideas, the
                        <hi rend="italic">κόσμος νοητός,</hi> is simply the Reason of God as Creator
                    (θ∈ofi λόγο? <hi rend="italic">ηόη</hi><hi rend="italic">κoσμoπoιovντoς).</hi>
                    Yet, on the other hand, they are represented as hypostases distinct from God,
                    individual entities existing independently and apart from Him. This vacillation,
                    however, as Zeller and other recent writers have justly remarked, is necessarily
                    involved in Philo’s premises, for, on the one hand, it is God who works in the
                    world through His Ideas, and therefore they must be identical with God; but, on
                    the other hand, God is not to come into direct contact with the world, and
                    therefore the Forces through which He works must be distinct from Him. The same
                    inevitable amphiboly dominates in what is taught as to the supreme Idea or
                    Logos. Philo regards all individual Ideas as comprehended in one highest and
                    most general Idea or Force—the unity of the individual Ideas— which he calls the
                    Logos or Reason of God, and which is again regarded as operative Reason. The
                    Logos, therefore, is the highest mediator between God and the world, the
                    firstborn son of God, the archangel who is the vehicle of all revelation, and
                    the high priest who stands before God on behalf of the world. Through him the
                    world was created, and so he is identified with the creative Word of God in
                    Genesis (the Greek λoγos meaning both “reason” <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n797/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0918-0797-0762"/> and “word ”). Here again, we see, the
                    philosopher is unable to escape from the difficulty that the Logos is at once
                    the immanent Reason of God, and yet also an hypostasis standing between God and
                    the world. The whole doctrine of this mediatorial hypostasis is a strange
                    intertwining of very dissimilar threads; on one side the way was prepared for it
                    by the older Jewish distinction between the Wisdom of God and God Himself, of
                    which we find the beginnings even in the Old Testament (Job xxviii. 12 <hi
                        rend="italic">sq.</hi>; Prov. viii., ix.), and the fuller development in the
                    books of Ecclesiasticus and Wisdom, the latter of which comes very near to
                    Philo’s ideas if we substitute for the term “wisdom” that of (divine) “Reason.”
                    In Greek philosophy, again, Philo, as we have seen, chiefly follows the Platonic
                    doctrines of Ideas and the Soul of the World, and the Stoic doctrine of God as
                    the λoγos or Reason operative in the world. In its Stoic form the latter
                    doctrine was pantheistic, but Philo could adapt it to his purpose simply by
                    drawing a sharper distinction between the Logos and the world.</p>
                <p>Like his doctrine of God, Philo’s doctrine of the world and creation rests on the
                    presupposition of an absolute metaphysical contrast between God and the world.
                    The world can be ascribed to God only in so far as it is a cosmos or orderly
                    world; its material substratum is not even indirectly referable to God. Matter
                        <hi rend="italic">(vλη,</hi> or, as the Stoics said, <hi rend="italic"
                        >ουσία)</hi> is a second principle, but in itself an empty one, its essence
                    being a mere negation of all true being. It is a lifeless, unmoved, shapeless
                    mass, out of which God formed the actual world by means of the Logos and divine
                    Forces. Strictly speaking, the world is only formed, not created, since matter
                    did not originate with God.</p>
                <p>Philo’s doctrine of man is also strictly dualistic, and is mainly derived from
                    Plato. Man is a twofold being, with a higher and a lower origin. Of the pure
                    souls which fill airy space, those nearest the earth are attracted by the
                    sensible and descend into sensible bodies; these souls are the Godward side of
                    man. But on his other side man is a creature of sense, and so has in him a
                    fountain of sin and all evil. The body, therefore, is a prison, a coffin, or a
                    grave for the soul which seeks to rise again to God. From this anthropology the
                    principles of Philo’s ethics are derived, its highest maxim necessarily being
                    deliverance from the world of sense and the mortification of all the impulses of
                    sense. In carrying out this thought, as in many other details of his ethical
                    teaching, Philo closely follows the Stoics. But he is separated from Stoical
                    ethics by his strong religious interests, which carry him to very different
                    views of the means and aim of ethical development. The Stoics cast man upon his
                    own resources; Philo points him to the assistance of God, without whom man, a
                    captive to sense, could never raise himself to walk in the ways of true wisdom
                    and virtue. And as moral effort can bear fruit only with God’s help, so too God
                    Himself is the goal of that effort. Even in this life the truly wise and
                    virtuous is lifted above his sensible existence, and enjoys in ecstasy the
                    vision of God, his own consciousness sinking and disappearing in the divine
                    light. Beyond this ecstasy there lies but one further step, viz., entire
                    liberation from the body of sense and the return of the soul to its original
                    condition; it came from God and must rise to Him again. But natural death brings
                    this consummation only to those who, while they lived on earth, kept themselves
                    free from attachment to the things of sense; all others must at death pass into
                    another body; transmigration of souls is in fact the necessary consequence of
                    Philo’s premises, though he seldom speaks of it expressly.</p>
                <p>Philo’s literary labours have a twofold object, being directed either to expound
                    the true sense of the Mosaic law, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the philosophy
                    which we have just described, to his Jewish brethren, or to convince heathen
                    readers of the excellence, the supreme purity and truth, of the Jewish religion
                    whose holy records contain the deepest and most perfect philosophy, the best and
                    most humane legislation. Thus as a literary figure Philo, in conformity with his
                    education and views of life, stands between the Greeks and the Jews, seeking to
                    gain the Jews for Hellenism and the Greeks for Judaism, yet always taking it for
                    granted that his standpoint really <hi rend="italic">is</hi> Jewish, and just on
                    that account truly philosophical and cosmopolitan.</p>
                <p>The titles of the numerous extant writings of Philo present at first sight a most
                    confusing multiplicity. More than three-fourths of them, however, are really
                    mere sections of a small number of larger works. Three such great works on the
                    Pentateuch can be distinguished.</p>
                <p>(I.) The smallest of these is the <hi rend="italic">Ζητήματα καί</hi> λtiσεts <hi
                        rend="italic">(Quaestiones</hi><hi rend="italic">et solutiones),</hi> a
                    short exposition of Genesis and Exodus, in the form of question and answer. The
                    work is cited under this title by Eusebius (2f. <hi rend="italic">B.,</hi> ii.
                    18, 1, 5; <hi rend="italic">Praep. Ev.,</hi> vii. 13), and by later writers, but
                    the Greek text is now almost wholly lost, and only about one-half preserved in
                    an Armenian translation. Genesis seems to have occupied six books.<note

                    Aucher in 1826, are preserved four books on Genesis and two on Exodus, but with

                <p>(II.) Philo’s most important work is the Νόμων <hi rend="italic">ιερών</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">dλληyoριaι</hi> (Euseb., <hi rend="italic">∕f. E.,</hi> ii.
                    18,1; Phot., <hi rend="italic">Bibl.,</hi> Cod. 103), a vast and copious
                    allegorical commentary on Genesis, dealing with chaps, ii.-iv., verse by verse,
                    and with select passages in the later chapters. The readers in view are mainly
                    Jews, for the form is modelled on the rabbinic Midrash. The main idea is that
                    the characters which appear in Genesis are properly allegories of states of the
                    soul <hi rend="italic">{τρόποι τής ψυχής).</hi> All persons and actions being
                    interpreted in this sense, the work as a whole is a very extensive body of
                    psychology and ethics. It begins with Gen. ii. 1, for the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Be</hi><hi rend="italic">mundi opificio,</hi> which treats of the creation
                    according to Gen. i., ii., does not belong to this series of allegorical
                    commentaries, but deals with the actual history of creation, and that under a
                    quite different literary form. λV ith this exception, however, the Νόμων
                    άλλι/γορίαι includes all the treatises in the first volume of Mangey’s edition,

                    while he cites all that follow by their titles. The reason must be that all up

                    conclude with confidence that Philo published the continuous commentaries on

                <p>(III.) A work of a very different kind is the group of writings which we may call
                    “An Exposition of the Mosaic law for Gentiles,” which, in spite of their very
                    various contents, present on nearer examination indubitable marks of close
                    connexion. In them Philo seeks to give an orderly view of the chief points of
                    the Mosaic legislation in the Pentateuch, and to recommend it as valuable to
                    Gentile readers. The method of exposition is somewhat more popular than in the
                    allegorical commentaries, for, though that method of interpretation is not
                    wholly excluded, the main object is to give such a view of the legislation as
                    Philo accepted as historical. This work has three main divisions: (a) an Account
                    of the Creation <hi rend="italic">(κoσμoπoua),</hi> which Moses put first, to
                    show that his legislation was conformed to the will of nature, and that
                    therefore those who followed it were true cosmopolitans; (δ) the Biographies of
                    the Virtuous,—being, so to speak, the living unwritten laws which, unlike
                    written laws, present the general types of moral conduct; (c) Legislation
                    Proper, in two subdivisions — (a) the ten principal chapters of the law, <hi
                        rend="italic">(β)</hi> the special laws belonging to each of these ten. An
                    appendix adds a view of such laws as do not fall under the rubrics of the
                    decalogue, arranged under the headings of certain cardinal virtues.</p>
                <p>The treatises which belong to this work are the following. (1) Περί <hi
                        rend="italic">τής</hi> Mωii&lt;riωs <hi rend="italic">κoσμoπodaς (De</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">mundi opificio,</hi> Μ. i. 1-42). This work does not fall
                    within the number of the allegorical commentaries. On the other hand, the
                    introduction to the treatise <hi rend="italic">De Abrahamo</hi> makes clear its
                    immediate connexion with the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">mundi
                        opificio.</hi> The position of the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">mundi opificio</hi> at the head of the allegorical
                    commentaries, which is at present usual in the editions, seems indeed to go back
                    to a very early date, for even Eusebius cites a passage from it with the formula
                        <hi rend="italic">άπό του πρώτου των</hi><hi rend="italic">eis</hi><hi

                        of</hi> virtue as a thing learned. This biography of Abraham was followed by
                    that of Isaac as a type of <hi rend="italic">φυσική αρετή,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >i.e.,</hi> of innate or natural virtue, which in turn was succeeded by that

                        >i.e.,</hi> virtue acquired by practice; but both these are now lost. Hence
                    in the editions the next treatise is (3) Bios <hi rend="italic"

                        >specialibus legibus</hi>; the unabridged title is given by Eusebius, <hi
                        rend="italic">II. E.,</hi> ii. 18, 5). Here under the rubrics of the ten
                    commandments a systematic review of the special laws of the Mosaic economy is
                    given; for example, under the first and second commandments (divine worship) a
                    survey is taken of the entire legislation relating to priesthood and sacrifice;
                    under the fourth <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the Sabbath law, according to
                    Philo's reckoning) there is a survey of all the laws about feasts; under the
                    sixth (adultery) an account of matrimonial law; and so on. According to Eusebius
                    the work embraced four books, which seem to have reached us entire, but in the
                    editions have been perversely broken up into a considerable number of separate
                    tractates, (a) The first book (on the first and second commandments) includes
                    the following: <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">circumcisione</hi> (M∙
                    ii. 210-212); <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">monarchia,</hi> lib. i.

                    (on the third, fourth, and fifth commandments, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> on
                    perjury, Sabbatlι observance, and filial piety) is incomplete in Mangey (ii.
                    270-298), the section <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">septenario</hi>
                    (on the Sabbath and feasts in general) being imperfect, and that <hi
                        rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">colendis parentibus</hi> being
                    entirely wanting. Mai to a large extent made good the defect <hi rend="italic"
                        >(De</hi><hi rend="italic">cophini festo et</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi

                    the first to edit the full text <hi rend="italic">(Philonea,</hi> pp. 1-83). (c)
                    The third book relates to the sixth and seventh commandments (adultery and
                    murder; Μ. ii. 299-334). (d) To the fourth book (relating to the last three
                    commandments) belongs all that is found in Mangey, ii. 335-374, that is to say,
                    not merely the tractates <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">judice</hi>
                    (ii. 344-348) and <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">concupiscentia</hi>
                    (ii. 348-358), but also those <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >justitia</hi> (ii. 358-361) and <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >creatione</hi><hi rend="italic">principum</hi> (ii. 361-374). The
                    last-named is, properly speaking, only a portion of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >De</hi><hi rend="italic">justitia,</hi> which, however, certainly belongs
                    to the fourth book, of which the superscription expressly bears that it treats
                    also ττερί <hi rend="italic">δικαιοσύνης,</hi> with this tractate begins the
                    appendix to the work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">specialibus
                        legibus,</hi> into which, under the rubric of certain cardinal virtues, such
                    Mosaic laws are brought together as could not be dealt with under any of the
                    decalogue rubrics. The continuation of this appendix forms a book by itself. (6)
                    Περί <hi rend="italic">τριών αρετών ήτοι περί ανδρείας καί φιλανθρωπίας καί

                        poenitentia,</hi> ii. 405-407). Finally, in less intimate conAexion with
                    this entire work is another treatise still to be mentioned, (7) Περί <hi
                        rend="italic">άθλων καί επιτιμίων</hi><hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">praemiis</hi><hi rend="italic">et poenis,</hi> Μ. ii. 408-428)
                    and Περί <hi rend="italic">άρών</hi><hi rend="italic">(De exe-crationibus,</hi>
                    Μ. ii. 429-457), two parts which constitute a single whole and deal with the
                    promises and threatenings of the law.</p>
                <p>(IV.) Besides the above-named three great works on the Pentateuch, Philo was the
                    author of a number of isolated writings, of which the following have reached us
                    either in their entirety or in fragments. (1) Περί <hi rend="italic">βίου
                        Ν·.ωσέως</hi><hi rend="italic">(Vita</hi><hi rend="italic">Mosis,</hi> lib.
                    i.-iii., Μ. ii. 80-179). It is usual to group this, as being biographical in its
                    character, with the Βίοι <hi rend="italic">σοφών,</hi> and thus to incorporate
                    it immediately after the <hi rend="italic">De Josepho</hi> with the large work
                    on the Mosaic legislation. But, as has been seen, the Βίοι <hi rend="italic"
                        >σοφών</hi> are intended to represent the general types of morality, while
                    Moses is by no means so dealt with but as a unique individual. All that can be
                    said is that the literary character of the <hi rend="italic">Vita Mosis</hi> is
                    the same as that of the larger work. As in the latter the Mosaic legislation, so
                    in the former the activity of the legislator himself, is delineated for the
                    benefit of Gentile readers. (2) Περί <hi rend="italic">του πάντα</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">σπoυδdiov</hi><hi rend="italic">είναι ελεύθερον</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">(Quod omnis probus liber,</hi> Μ. ii. 445-470). In the
                    introduction to this treatise reference is made to an earlier book which had for
                    its theme the converse proposition. The complete work was still extant in the
                    time of Eusebius <hi rend="italic">(H. E.,</hi> ii. 18, 6): Περί ηpC <hi
                        rend="italic">δoυλov</hi><hi rend="italic">είναι πάντα</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    not undisputed; but see Lucius, <hi rend="italic">Der</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Essenismus</hi> (1881), pp. 13-23. (3) Eιs Φλάκκον <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Adversus Flaccum,</hi> Μ. ii. 517-544) and (4) Περί <hi rend="italic"
                        >αρετών καί πρεσβείας προς Γάϊον</hi><hi rend="italic">(De legatione ad
                        Caium,</hi> Μ. ii. 545-600). These two works have a very intimate connexion.
                    In the first Philo relates how the Roman governor Flaccus in Alexandria, towards
                    the beginning of the reign of Caligula, allowed the Alexandrian mob, without
                    interference, to insult the Jews of that city in the grossest manner and even to
                    persecute them to the shedding of blood. In the second he tells how the Jews had
                    been subjected to still greater sufferings through the command of Caligula that
                    divine honours should be everywhere accorded to him, and how the Jews of
                    Alexandria in vain sought relief by a mission to Rome which was headed by Philo.
                    But both together were only parts of a larger work, in five books, of which the
                    first two and the last have perished. For it is clear from the introduction to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Adversus Flaccum</hi> that it had been preceded by another
                    book in which the Jewish persecutions by Sejanus, under the reign of Tiberius,
                    were spoken of, and the <hi rend="italic">Chronicon</hi> of Eusebius (ed.
                    Schoene, vol. ii. pp. 150, 151) informs us that these persecutions of Sejanus
                    were related in the second book of the work now under discussion. But from the
                    conclusion of the <hi rend="italic">Legatio</hi><hi rend="italic">ad Caium,</hi>
                    which we still possess, we learn that it was also followed by another book which
                    exhibited the <hi rend="italic">παλινωδία,</hi> or change of Jewish fortunes for
                    the better. Thus we make out five books in all,—the number actually given by
                    Eusebius <hi rend="italic">(H. E.,</hi> ii. 5, 1). (5) Περί <hi rend="italic"

                    translation, by Aucher (see below). It is mentioned by its Greek title in
                    Eusebius <hi rend="italic">(H. E.,</hi> ii. 18, 6; <hi rend="italic">Praep.

                    gives two books, but of these the first, if genuine at all, at any rate appears
                    only in an abridged and somewhat revised state.<note anchored="true"

                    author’s name, so that Philo’s part in it is at least very problematical; nor
                    does its original form seem to be extant (see ^Orig., <hi rend="italic">Comm, in

                <p><hi rend="italic">Editions.</hi> —The first, very imperfect, edition of the Greek
                    text of Philo is by Turnebus (Paris, 1552). Some additional pieces were given by
                    Höschel (Frankfort, 1587; Augsburg, 1614). Other editions are those of Geneva,
                    1613; Paris, 1640; Frankfort, 1691 (a page-for-page reprint of the Paris
                    edition); but the best is still that of Mangey (2 vols., London, 1742), which
                    alone is based on a number of MSS. and gives a critical apparatus. Pfeiffer’s
                    unfinished edition, vols, i.-v., appeared at Erlangen in 1785-95, 2d ed. 1820.
                    An important supplement to Mangey is given by Aucher’s publications from the
                    Armenian— <hi rend="italic">Phil. Jud.</hi><hi rend="italic">sermones tres

                    The Greek pieces newly published since Mangey are less extensive. The editions
                    by Mai, Grossmann, and Tischendorf have been already noticed. Aucher’s
                    publications and Mai’s of 1818 are contained in the convenient edition of
                    Richter (Leipsic, 1828-30) and in the Tauchnitz stereotype edition (1851-53). Of
