                    sisters the Graeae (the Gray Women) by the great ocean, far aAvay in the Avest.
                    Guided by Hermes and Athene, Perseus came to the Graeae. They Avere three hags,
                    with but one eye and one tooth between them, which they handed one to the other.
                    Perseus stole the eye and tooth, and would not restore them till the Graeae had
                    guided him to the Nymphs, from whom he received the winged sandals, the Avallet
                    (κ∕∕3ισιs), and the cap of invisibility. These he put on, and, being armed by
                    Hermes with a scimitar (αpτn∕), came upon the Gorgons as they slept and cut off
                    Medusa’s head, while with averted eyes he looked at her image on his brazen
                    shield lest he should be turned to stone. Perseus put the Gorgon’s head in his
                    wallet and fled. Coming to Aethiopia he delivered and married <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Andromeda</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.vf).</hi> With her he
                    returned to Seriphus in time to rescue his mother and Dictys from Polydectes,
                    whom he turned to stone along with all his court by showing them the Gorgon’s
                    head. The island itself Avas turned to stone, and was still and lonely ever
                    after; the very frogs of Seriphus (so ran the proverb) were dumb. Perseus then
                    gave the head of Medusa to Athene, Avho put it on her shield, and, with Danae
                    and Andromeda, he hastened to Argos to see his grandfather, Acrisius,once more.
                    But he, fearing the oracle, had gone to Larissa in Thessaly. Thither his
                    grandson followed him, but at some games given by Teutamias, king of Larissa, he
                    threw a quoit Avhich lighted on his grandfather’s foot and caused his death.
                    Ashamed to return to Argos, Perseus gave his kingdom to Megapenthes, and
                    received from him Tiryns in return. There he reigned and founded Midea and the
                    famed Mycenae, and became the ancestor of the Persides, amongst whom Avere
                    Eurystheus and Heracles.</p>
                <p>The legend of Perseus was a favourite theme of Greek poetry and art. Sophocles
                    and Euripides had each several dramas on the subject, and sculptor and painter
                    vied with each other in depicting the rescue of Andromeda from the sea-monster.
                    The story was localized in various places. Italy claimed that the ark with Danae
                    and Perseus had drifted to the Latin coast (Servius on Virg., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aen.,</hi> vii. 372, and viii. 345). The Persian kings were said to have sprung
                    from a son of Perseus (Apollod., ii. 4, 5; Herod., vii. 61); and, according to
                    Pausanias Damascenus, Perseus taught the Persians to Avorshιp fire, and founded
                    the Magian priesthood. The tale of the rescue of Andromeda by Perseus from the
                    sea-beast is akin to that of Heracles and Hesione. Both have been interpreted of
                    the sun slaying the darkness, Andromeda or Hesione being the moon, Avhom the
                    darkness is about to devour. According to one version Heracles rescued Hesione
                    from the sea-beast by leaping into its mouth, from which he came forth after
                    three days spent in the belly of the beast. This points to a connexion with the
                    Semitic story of Jonah and the fish. Greek sculptures of Andromeda’s monster
                    Avere the models for Jonah’s fish in early Christian art, and on a rock at Joppa
                    they shθAved the chains which had bound Andromeda, and the bones of the
                    sea-beast (Pliny, <hi rend="italic">II. N.,</hi> v. 13; Mela, i. 11). Tarsus in
                    Cilicia was said to have been founded by Perseus, <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    Cappadocia.</p>
