                    classics—English as well as Greek and Latin—played a notable part, at home under
                    the wise and genial care of his father. In 1819 we find him exhibiting both at
                    the Royal Academy and the British Institution; and shortly afterwards he became
                    intimate with John Linnell, who gave him excellent counsel and assistance,
                    advising drawing from the figure and from the antique in the British Museum, and
                    introducing him to Varley, Mulready, and, above all, to William Blake, whose
                    strange and mystic genius had the most powerful effect in impressing on Palmer’s
                    art its solemn and poetic character. Before very long the studies of this period
                    were interrupted by an illness which led to a residence of seven years at
                    Shoreham in Kent. Here the artist sought a closer acquaintance with nature, and
                    the characteristics of the scenery of the district are constantly recurrent in
                    his works. Among the more important productions of this time are the Bright
                    Cloud and the Skylark, paintings in oil, which was Palmer’s usual medium in
                    earlier life, but one with which he is now hardly at all associated in the
                    popular mind. In 1839 he married a daughter of LinnelΓs. The wedding tour was to
                    Italy, where he spent over two years in study. Returning to London, he was in
                    1843 elected an associate and in 1854 a full member of the Society of Painters
                    in Water Colours, a method to which he afterwards adhered in his painted work.
                    His productions are distinguished by an excellent command over the forms of
                    landscape, and by mastery of rich, glowing, and potent colouring. He delighted
                    in the more exceptional and striking moments of nature, and especially in her
                    splendours of sunrise and sunset. His paintings are less literal transcripts
                    than poetic and imaginative renderings. They are admirably composed and
                    well-considered pastorals, which find a singularly accurate literary parallel in
                    the landscape work of Milton in his minor poems; indeed among the best and most
                    important paintings executed by Palmer during his later years was a noble series
                    of illustrations to <hi rend="italic">L</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Allegro</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Il Penseroso,</hi> now in the possession of Mr L. R.
                    Valpy.</p>

                <p>In 1853 the artist was elected a member of the English Etching Club; and his work
                    with the needle is no less individual and poetic than his work with the brush.
                    Mr Hamerton has pronounced him “one of the few really great English etchers,”
                    “one of the most accomplished etchers who ever lived.” Considering his
                    reputation and success in this department of art, his plates are few in number.
                    They are executed with care and elaboration. Their virtues are not those of a
                    rapid and vivid sketch, depending on force and selection of line, and adopting a
                    frankly interpretative treatment; they aim rather at truth and completeness of
                    tonality, and embody many of the characteristics of other modes of engraving—of
                    mezzotint, of line, and of woodcut. Readily accessible and sufficiently
                    representative plates may be studied in the Early Ploughman, in <hi
                    rend="italic">Etching and Etchers</hi> (1st ed.), and the Herdsman’s Cottage, in
                    the third edition of the same work. In 1861 Palmer removed to Reigate, where he
                    spent an honoured and productive old age, till his death on the 24th of May
                    1881. One of his latest efforts was the production of a series of etchings to
                    illustrate his English metrical version of Virgil’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eclogues,</hi> which was published in 1883, illustrated with reproductions of
                    the artist’s water-colours and with etchings, of which most were left unfinished
                    at his∙ ^leath, and completed by his son, A. H. Palmer. A collection of Palmer’s
                    works was brought together by the Fine Arts Society in the year of his death.
                    The descriptive and critical catalogue of this exhibition, and the memoir by his
                    son, may be consulted for particulars of the painter’s life and art.</p>
