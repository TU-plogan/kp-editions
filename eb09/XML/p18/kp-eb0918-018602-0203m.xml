                    powers of observation, gained a knowledge, remarkable for that time, of
                    chemistry, geology, botany, and other branches of natural history. Bernard
                    Palissy’s father was a painter of stained glass, and taught his son the practice
                    of this important craft; he thus became a skilful draughtsman, learned the
                    manipulation of colours, and gained that training of the eye which in after
                    years helped to bring him success and reward as a potter. After a period of
                    travelling apprenticeship, Palissy married and settled in Saintes. At first he
                    practised his craft of glass-painter, varied by portrait-painting and
                    land-surveying. The search for subjects for his window-pain tings led Palissy to
                    extend his already wide course of study to history and classical mythology. He
                    had not long been married when the whole course of his life was changed by a new
                    ambition. He happened to see a fine piece of enamelled pottery, probably
                    majolica ware from Italy, and thereupon resolved to spend any time and labour to
                    discover for himself the secret of the beautiful enamelled surface that he
                    admired so much in that piece of pottery. His trade as a glasspainter had taught
                    him something of the methods of painting and firing enamel colours, and at the
                    neighbouring village of La Chapelle des Pots he learned the rudiments of the
                    potter’s art in its simplest form; but this was all the help he had. He knew
                    nothing whatever of the manufacture of the finer sorts of faience, or of the
                    composition of the white enamel which was to form the covering of his clay
                    vessels and the ground for his coloured ornament.</p>
                <p>Year after year, through a succession of utter failures, and almost without a
                    gleam of hope, he laboured on, working often blindly and at random in search for
                    the secret of the white enamel. Almost starving for want of food, his wife in
                    rags bitterly and not unreasonably reproaching him for his cruelty, his
                    furniture broken up to feed his kilns, and without a hand to help, Palissy
                    struggled on for nearly sixteen years before success came. A truly tragic story
                    is this, for after all it was no new discovery that Palissy ever reached or even
                    aimed at.</p>
                <p>The secret of the white enamel was known to every potter of northern Italy, and
                    there, if he had but known, he might have learned that process on the
                    rediscovery of which he wasted so many of the best years of his life. All those
                    struggles and failures are most vividly told by Palissy himself in one of the
                    most thrilling pieces of autobiography ever written. The nearest parallel to it
                    is perhaps (widely different as the two men are) that of his contemporary the
                    Florentine Cellini.</p>
                <p>For a few years Palissy enjoyed untroubled reward for his years of toil and
                    unflinching constancy of purpose. His works were bought and appreciated by the
                    queen, Catherine de’ Medici, and many of the great nobles of her court, who were
                    eager for specimens of his skill. But before long Palissy, who had always been
                    something of a theologian and a constant Bible student, became irresistibly
                    enthralled by the new doctrines of the Reformation, and enrolled himself an
                    enthusiastic member of the Huguenot party. He could do nothing by halves; he
                    devoted himself heart and soul to the cause, and, in 1558, while engaged in
                    making plaques, tiles, and rustic figures in faience to decorate the Constable
                    de Montmorency’s Château d’Ecouen, Palissy was arrested and imprisoned at
                    Bordeaux, while his kilns and the materials of his trade were destroyed by
                    command of the magistrates.</p>
                <p>Through the intervention of the French court Palissy was, after a time,
                    liberated, and about 1563, under the protection of the king, set up his
                    pottery-works in Paris, on a plot of ground afterwards occupied by part of the
                    gardens of the Tuileries. Here Palissy lived and worked in comparative peace and
                    prosperity till 1588, when a fresh outburst of religious zeal against the
                    Huguenots proved too strong even for the royal patronage, which for so long had
                    sheltered him. He was thrown into the Bastille, and, though Henry HL, who was
                    then king, offered him rewards and freedom if he would recant, Palissy preferred
                    death to falsehood. Henry III., though not unmindful of the forty-five years
                    during which Palissy had faithfully served the court of France, was too timid or
                    too weak to save his old servant, then nearly eighty years of age. Palissy was
                    condemned to death, but died shortly after, in one of the dungeons of the
                    Bastille, in the year 1589. This martyr’s death was a not unfitting end for one
                    whose whole life had been a sacrifice to noble aims, and who, years before, had
                    suffered a protracted martyrdom in the to him sacred cause of art.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Palissy's Pottery.—</hi> Though very varied in design,
                    Palissy’s pottery is for the most part executed after one technical process.
                    Hard well-burnt earthenware, sometimes fired at so high a temperature as to have
                    almost a metallic ring, was covered with a white enamel, formed of the usual
                    ingredients of glass, to which opacity and creamy whiteness were given by the
                    addition of an oxide of tin. On this white ground various colours were applied
                    in enamelpigments, and the whole finally covered with a thin plumbo-vitreous
                    glaze. The potter’s wheel was but little, if at all, used by Palissy, who, in
                    his pieces, aimed less at purity and beauty of outline than at elaborate
                    surface-decoration in high relief, formed by pressing the clay into a mould.</p>
                <p>Palissy’s best-known productions are large plates, ewers, vases, and other forms,
                    decorated in alto-relief, with very realistic figures of reptiles, fish,
                    insects, shells, plants, and other objects, executed with wonderful truth and
                    accuracy from moulds formed by taking casts of the objects themselves (see
                    λvoodcut). Thus we see reproduced every scale on a snake’s or fish’s back, and
                    the minutest peculiarities of the fossil shells and living plants which Palissy
                    saw around him and delighted in copying with the scientific accuracy of a
                    student of natural history and geology. Casts from these· objects were fixed on
                    to a metal dish or vase of the shape required, and a fresh cast from the whole
                    formed a mould from which Palissy could reproduce many articles of the same
                    kind. After being covered with the long-sought-for white enamel, the various
                    parts of the piece were painted in realistic colours, or as near truth as could
                    be reached by the pigments Palissy was able to discover and prepare. These
                    colours were mostly various shades of blue from indigo to ultramarine, some
                    rather crude greens, several tints of browns <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n204/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0204-0187"/> and greys, and, more rarely, yellow. Other
                    pieces, such as dishes and plaques, were ornamented by figure subjects treated
                    after the same fashion, generally Scriptural scenes or subjects from classical
                    mythology. These were in many cases copied from works in sculpture by
                    contemporary artists.</p>
                <p>Another class of designs used by Palissy were plates, tazze and the like, with
                    geometrical patterns moulded in relief and pierced through, forming a sort of
                    open network. Perhaps the most successful as works of art were those plates and
                    ewers which Palissy moulded in exact facsimile of the rich and delicate works in
                    pewter for which Francois Briot and other Swiss metal-workers were so
                    celebrated. These are in very slight relief, and are executed with cameo-like
                    finish, mostly of good design, after the style of the Italian silversmiths of
                    the 16th century. Palissy ’ s ceramic reproductions of these metal plates are
                    not improved by the colours with which he picked out the designs.</p>
                <p>Some enamelled and painted earthenware statuettes, full of life and expression,
                    have been attributed to Palissy; but it is doubtful whether he ever worked in
                    the round. On the whole his productions cannot be assigned a very high rank as
                    works of art, though they are certainly remarkable as objects of curiosity and
                    marvels of ingenious skill. They have always been highly valued, and in the 17th
                    century attempts were made both at Delft and Lambeth to copy his “rustic” plates
                    with the reliefs of animals and human figures. These imitations are very blunt
                    in modelling, and coarsely painted. They are generally marked on the back in
                    blue with initials and a date—showing them to be honest copies, not attempts at
                    forgery, such as have been produced in the present century.</p>
                <p>The best collections of Palissy ware are those in the museums of the Louvre, the
                    Hôtel Cluny, and Sevres; and in England that at Narford Hall, with a few
                    specimens in the South Kensington and British Museums.</p>
                <p>As an author Palissy was perhaps even more successful than as a potter. A very
                    high position among French writers is assigned to him by Lamartine <hi
                    rend="italic">{B. Palissy,</hi> 8vo, Paris, 1852). He wrote on a great variety
                    of subjects, such as agriculture, natural philosophy, religion, and especially
                    his <hi rend="italic">L'Art de terre,</hi> in which he gives an account of his
                    processes and how he discovered them. A complete edition of his works was
