                    Baleares, the residence of a captain general, a bishop’s see, and a flourishing
                    seaport, is situated 135 miles from Barcelona, on the south west coast of
                    Majorca, at the head of the fine Bay of Palma, which stretches inland for about
                    10 miles between Capes Cala Figuera and Regana. It is the meeting place of all
                    the highways in the island, and the terminus of the railway which (opened in
                    1875) runs to Inca and (1879) Manacor, and will be extended to Alcudia. The
                    ramparts, which enclose the city on all sides except towards the port (where
                    they were thrown down in 1872), have a circuit of a little more than 4 miles.
                    Though begun in 1562, after the plans of Georgio Fretin, they were not finished
                    till 1836. Palma has undergone considerable change since 1860; streets have been
                    widened and houses built in the ordinary modern style, and the fine old-world
                    Moorish character of the place has suffered accordingly. The more conspicuous
                    buildings are the cathedral, the exchange, the palace, now occupied by the
                    captain-general and the law courts, the general hospital (1456), the town-house
                    (end of the 16th century), the picture gallery, and the college. At the time of
                    the partial suppression in 1835 there were twenty-five monastic buildings in
                    Palma; none of those still extant are of much note. The church of San Francisco
                    is interesting for the tomb of Raymond Lully, a native of Palma. The cathedral,
                    a fine Gothic building with massive buttresses, crowns the summit of the hill on
                    which the city stands. It was erected and dedicated to the Virgin in terms of a
                    vow made by King Jayme as he sailed to the conquest of Majorca, but, though
                    commenced in 1230, it was not finished till 1601. The older and more interesting
                    portions are the royal chapel (1232), with the tomb (1779) of Jayme II., and the
                    south front with the doorway known as <hi rend="italic">del</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mirador</hi> (1389). The principal dimensions of the edifice are—
                    length from the door to the high altar, 347 feet; width, including the chapels,
                    190 feet; height of the central nave, 147 feet; height of the side naves, 78
                    feet; and height of the belfry tower, 166. Of the architecture of the exchange
                    <hi rend="italic">(lonja'),</hi> a Gothic building begun in 1426, the people of
                    Palma are particularly proud, as it excited the admiration of the emperor
                    Charles V. The columns of the windows, in black and grey marble, are of almost
                    unexampled slimness. The harbour (formed by a mole constructed to a length of
                    387 yards in the 14th century and afterwards extended to more than 650 yards),
                    has been greatly improved and enlarged since 1875 by dredging operations and a
                    further addition to the mole of 136 yards. Previously it was not accessible to
                    vessels drawing more than 18 feet, and men-of-war and large merchant steamers
                    were obliged to anchor in the bay, which is sometimes rendered dangerous by
                    violent storms. Porto Pi, about 2 miles from the city, was once a good harbour,
                    but is now fit only for small craft. Shoemaking, tanning, and ropespinning are
                    prosecuted on a very extensive scale; and direct commerce is carried on with
                    Valencia, Barcelona, Algeria, Marseilles, Cuba, Porto Rico, &amp;c. Many of the
                    Majorcan vessels used to be Palma-built, but the increase of steam navigation
                    has changed the character of the trade. The population of the ayuntamiento,
                    53,019 in 1860, was 58,224 in 1877. There is a considerable number of Christian
                    Jews (Chuetas) who were formerly confined to their own quarter.</p>
                <p>Palma probably owes, if not its existence, at least its name (symbolized on the
                    Roman coins by a palm branch), to Metellus Balearicus, who in 123 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> settled three thousand Roman and Spanish colonists cn
                    the island. The bishopric dates only from the 14th century, its foundation
                    having been strongly opposed by the bishop of Barcelona. About a mile south-west
                    of Palma is the castle of Bellver, where Jovellanos and Arago were
                    imprisoned.</p>
