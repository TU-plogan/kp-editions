                    Odysseus (Ulysses), immortalized by Homer in the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey.</hi>
                    She was the daughter of the Spartan Icarius and Peribaea. Shortly before
                    Odysseus left his native island of Ithaca to war against Troy, Penelope bore him
                    a son, Telemachus. When her husband tarried long many chieftains of Ithaca and
                    the islands round about wooed her to wife; they behaved wantonly, wasting the
                    substance of Odysseus, insulting his son, and corrupting the maidservants. The
                    heart of Penelope yearned for Odysseus, and, to rid herself of the importunities
                    of the wooers, she bade them wait till she had woven a winding-sheet for old
                    Laertes, the father of Odysseus. But every night she undid the piece which she
                    had woven by day, so that the web was always unfinished. This she did for three
                    years, till her maids revealed the secret to the wooers. Robbed of her pretext
                    for delay she was in sore straits, till she was relieved by the arrival of
                    Odysseus after an absence of twenty years. He slew the wooers, and the
                    long-parted husband and wife were united once more.</p>
                <p>Such is the story of Penelope in Homer. Later writers add other particulars about
                    her. She was won by Odysseus in a race proposed by Icarius to his daughter’s
                    suitors. When Icarius would fiιin that Odysseus should bide with him in Sparta,
                    or at least leave him his daughter, and Odysseus let Penelope choose whether she
                    would go with him to Ithaca or stay with her father in Sparta, she silently drew
                    her veil over her face. Her father understood her and let her go (Pausan., iii.
                    12, 20). Some said that she bore a son, Ptoliporthes, to Odysseus after his
                    return from Troy. Others (marring Homer’s picture of her as a true and loving
                    wife) said that in her husband’s absence she bore Pan to Hermes or the suitors.
                    Another story was that on his return Odysseus repu&lt;liated her as <pb

                    Mantinea, where she died and where her tomb was shown (Pausan., viii. 12).
                    According to others, after the death of Odysseus she married Telegonus (son of
                    Odysseus and Circe) in Aeaea, or in the Islands of the Blest. The name is
                    connected with <hi rend="italic">πηvos, πhvη,</hi> “woof,” and hence means
                    “weaver.” The Homeric form is Penelopeia.</p>
