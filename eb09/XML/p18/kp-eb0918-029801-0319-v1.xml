                    (1806-1884), architectural archaeologist, was the son of a London merchant, and
                    was born in 1806. He was educated at Manor House School, Chiswick, and in 1821
                    entered business as a bookseller. Succeeding his uncle Joseph Parker as a
                    bookseller at Oxford in 1832, he conducted the business with great success, the
                    most important of the firm’s publications being perhaps the series of the
                    “Oxford Pocket Classics.” The cares of business did not prevent him from
                    devoting, in the earlier period of his life, much of his time to those
                    architectural studies which latterly engaged his chief attention. In 1836 he
                    brought out his <hi rend="italic">Glossary of Architecture,</hi> which,
                    published in the earlier years of the Gothic revival, had considerable influence
                    in extending the movement, and supplied a valuable help to young architects. In
                    1848 he edited the fifth edition of Rickman’s <hi rend="italic">Gothic
                        Architecture,</hi> and. in 1849 he published a handbook based on his earlier
                    volume, and entitled <hi rend="italic">Introduction to the Study of Gothic
                        Architecture.</hi> The completion of Hudson Turner’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Domestic Architecture of the Middle Ages</hi> next engaged his attention,
                    three volumes being published (1853-60). In 1858 he published <hi rend="italic"
                        >Medieval Architecture of Chester.</hi> Parker was one of the chief
                    advocates of the “restoration” of ecclesiastical buildings, and published in
