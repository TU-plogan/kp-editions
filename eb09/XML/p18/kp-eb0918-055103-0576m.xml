                <p><label type="entry">PERNAMBUCO, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Recife</hi></label>, a
                    city and seaport of Brazil and the chief town of the extensive province of
                    Pernambuco. As it is situated on the coast in 8° 3' 27" S. lat. and 34° 50' 14"
                    W. long. (Fort Picao), not far from the point where the continent begins to
                    trend towards the south-west, it is naturally the first port visited by steamers
                    from Lisbon to Brazil. The reef, which can be traced more or less distinctly
                    along the Brazilian seaboard for several hundred miles, rises at Pernambuco into
                    a perfectly straight artificial-looking Avail, 3} miles long, Avith even sides
                    and a smooth and almost level top from 30 to 60 yards in width. It is of a hard
                    pale-coloured sandstone, breaking Avith a very smooth fracture; and a tough
                    layer of calcareous matter, generally several inches thick, produced by the
                    successive growth and death of the small shells of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Serpnlae</hi> with some feAv barnacles and nullipores, proves so effectual a
                    protection of the outer surface that though it is exposed to the full force of
                    the Avaves of the open Atlantic the oldest pilots know of no tradition of change
                    in its appearance.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    within the reef is about a mile in Avidth and forms a safe but rather shallow
                    harbour; vessels drawing 19∣ feet can enter, and there is abundant room for
                    mooring along the shore and reef, but mail-steamers usually anchor in the roads
                    and discharge by means of lighters. Sir John HaAvkshaw’s scheme for the
                    improvement of the harbour (1874) was rejected by the Government as too costly;
                    but extensive dredging operations are being prosecuted. The city of Pernambuco
                    lies <hi rend="smallcaps">1oav,</hi> and is surrounded by a swampy stretch of
                    country, with no high ground nearer than the hill on Avhich Olinda is built, 8
                    miles to the north. It used to be considered the most pestilential of Brazilian
                    seaports; but its sanitary condition has greatly improved, partly owing to
                    drainage-Avorks executed by an English company. There are three natural
                    divisions in the city—Recife (“the Reef ”), situated not on the reef proper but
                    on an island forming the southern end of a sandbank that stretches north
                    tθAvards Olinda; Sant’ Antonio, on a peninsula separated from the island by the
                    united Avaters of the Capibaribe and the Biberibe; and Boa Vista, the
                    fashionable residential district on the mainland opposite Sant’ Antonio. In
                    Recife the streets are narroAV and crooked and many of the houses are of great
                    age and present Dutch characteristics; but Sant’ Antonio has broad straight
                    streets, with well-paved side-walks, tramways (Avorked by mules), and
                    modernlooking houses. Among the public buildings in Pernambuco it is enough to
                    mention the governor’s palace, the episcopal palace, the hospital of Pedro II.
                    (5000 patients per annum, with French sisters of mercy as nurses), the foundling
                    hospital, the poorhouse, the neAV lunatic asylum (1881), the university (18
                    professors and 530 students in 1879), the normal school, and the provincial
                    library (13,000 A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> ols., 11,581 readers, in 1880).
                    The great commercial staple is sugar, and the broAvn sticky mud of the streets
                    OAves its peculiar character to the juice of the cane; 825,711 bags of sugar
                    Avere brought to the market in 1875-76 and 1,715,637 bags in 1879-80. Cotton,
                    which Avas first exported in 1778 and continued a small item till 1781, now
                    holds the second place,—130,925 bales in 1875-76 and 60,117 in 1879-80. Coal
                    began to be imported in 1834,— 25,314 tons in 1879-80. The total value of the
                    exports and imports has greatly increased.</p>

                <p>The port Avas opened to British vessels in 1808, and goods, which formerly had to
                    pass through Portugal, began to be brought to England direct. A cemetery for
                    British subjects Avas opened in 1814, a British hospital in 1821, and a British
                    chapel in 1836. In 1880, out of a total of 1047 vessels (674,227 tons) calling

                    the Recife and San Francisco Railway (1856-62) runs 78 miles to Una, and is

                    opening in the reef. In 1532 Duarte Coelho founded the city of Olinda, which
                    continued to be the capital of the captaincy of Pernambuco till 1710. When in
                    1580 the country passed into the hands of Spain it had 700 stone houses, 4000 to
                    5000 negro slaves were employed in its sugar-plantâtions, and from 40 to 50
                    vessels came annually to load with sugar and Brazil wood, often called simply
                    Pernambuco or Fernambuk. Recife, which was a mere collection of fishers’ huts
                    when occupied by the French under Villegagnon in 1561, shortly afterwards began
                    to attract attention as a port. It was captured and held for thirty-four days in
                    1595 by Sir <hi rend="smallcaps">James Lancaster</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >{q.v.</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi> who did not, however, succeed in his attack
                    on Olinda. In the 17th century this part of Brazil was the scene of a great
                    struggle between the Spaniards and the Dutch. Olinda and Recife were captured by
                    the Dutch under Admiral Loncq in 1630, and in the following year, when they were
                    obliged to retreat to the reef, they left Olinda in flames. Fort Brun was built
                    in 1631. In 1639 (Recife already containing 2000 houses) Count Maurice laid out
                    a new town (Mauritsstad) on the island of Antonio Vaz, and built himself a
                    palace (Vrijburg or Sans Souci) of materials obtained by the demolition of
                    Olinda. A bridge was thrown across from Recife to Mauritsstad, and another· from
                    Mauritsstad to the mainland, where the count had his summer palace of Schoonzigt
                    or Boa Vista. An observatory was erected under Marcgraf and De Laet. In 1654 the
                    Dutch garrison, neglected by the authorities at home, who were at war with
                    Cromwell, was obliged to capitulate to the Portuguese (26th January).</p>
