                    and so maintained himself whilst learning French, improving himself in Latin and
                    Greek, and studying mathematics and other sciences. On his return to England he
                    seems to have had for a short time a place in the royal navy. He went abroad
                    again in 1643, and remained for three years in France and the Netherlands,
                    pursuing his studies at L <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> trecht, Leyden,
                    Amsterdam, and Paris. In the last-named city he read Vesalius with the
                    celebrated Hobbes. The philosopher was then preparing his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tractatus</hi><hi rend="italic">Opticus,</hi> and it is said that Petty drew
                    the diagrams for him. In 1647 Petty obtained a patent for the invention of
                    double writing, or, in other words, of a copying machine. In politics he
                    espoused the side of the Parliament. His first publication was a letter to
                    Samuel Hartlib in 1648, entitled <hi rend="italic">Advice for the Advancement of
                    some Particular Parts of Learning,</hi> the object of which was to recommend
                    such a change in education as would give it a more practical character. In the
                    same year he took up his residence at Oxford, where he was made deputy professor
                    of anatomy, and where he gave instruction in that science and in chemistry. In
                    1649 he obtained the degree of doctor of physic, and was soon after elected a
                    fellow of Brasenose College. He gained some notoriety in 1650 by restoring to
                    life a woman who had been hanged for infanticide. ïn 1651 he was made professor
                    of anatomy at Oxford, and also became professor of music at Gresham College. In
                    1652 he went to Ireland, having been appointed physician to the army in that
                    country. In 1654, observing that the admeasurement and division of the lands
                    forfeited in 1641 and granted to the soldiers had been (to use his own words)
                    “most inefficiently and absurdly managed,” he entered into a contract to execute
                    a fresh survey, which he completed in thirteen months. By this he gained £9000,
                    and part of the money he invested profitably in the purchase of soldiers’
                    debentures. He thus became possessor of so large a domain in the county of Kerry
                    that, according to Aubrey, he could behold from Mount Mangerton 50,000 acres of
                    his own land. He set up iron-works in that neighbourhood, opened lead-mines and
                    marble-quarries, established a pilchard-fishery, and commenced a trade in
                    timber. In Macaulay’s <hi rend="italic">History of England</hi> there is an
                    account ofthe settlement which he founded at Kenmare. Besides the office of
                    commissioner of distribution of the lands he had surveyed, he held that of
                    secretary to the lord lieutenant, Henry Cromwell, and was also during two years
                    clerk of the council. In January 1658 he was elected to Richard Cromwell’s
                    parliament as member for West Looe in Cornwall. He was accused by Sir Jerome
                    Sankey before the House of Commons of malversation and fraud in the conduct of
                    his survey; but the matter did not come to an issue in consequence of the
                    dissolution of the parliament, and Petty afterwards published tracts in his
                    defence. After the Restoration he returned to England and was favourably
                    received and knighted by Charles II., who was “much pleased with his ingenious
                    discourses,” and who, it is said, intended to create him earl of Kilmore. He
                    obtained from the king a new patent constituting him surveyor-general of
                    Ireland. In 1663 he attracted much notice by the success of his invention of a
                    double-bottomed ship, which twice made the passage between Dublin and Holyhead,
                    but was afterwards lost in a violent storm. He was one of the first members of
                    the Royal Society, and sat on its council. He died at London on the 16th of
                    December 1687, and was buried in the church of his native place. His will, a
                    curious and characteristic document, is printed in Chalmers’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Biographical Dictionary.</hi></p>
                <p>Petty was a man of remarkable versatility, ingenuity, and resource. Evelyn
                    declared he had “never known such another genius,” and said of him, “If I were a
                    prince I would make him my second councillor at least.” His character does not
                    seem to have been an elevated one, though Henry Cromwell, who knew him well,
                    appears to have esteemed him highly.</p>
                <p>The survey executed by Petty was, somewhat whimsically, called the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> ‘ Down Survey,” because the results λvere set <hi
                    rend="italic">down</hi> in maps; it is called by that name in Petty’s will. He
                    left in MS. a full account of the proceedings in connexion with it, which was
                    edited by the late Major-General Sir Thomas A. Larcom for the Irish
                    Archaeological Society in 1851. The maps, some of which were injured by a fire
                    in 1711, are preserved in the Public Record Office, Dublin. The survey “stands
                    to this day,” says Larcom, “with the accompanying books of distribution, the
                    legal record of the title on which half the land of Ireland is held; and for the
                    purpose to which it was and is applied it remains sufficient.” Petty’s name is
                    associated with the foundation, or, as it is safer to say, the successful
                    prosecution of what has been somewhat too ambitiously termed “the science of
                    political arithmetic.” It is essentially the same with what is called
                    comparative statistics. In Petty’s time trustworthy numerical expressions of
                    social facts could seldom be directly obtained, and thus large room was left for
                    more or less probable inference from the available data. As we might have
                    expected from his intellectual character, the expedients to which he resorts in
                    seeking to arrive at determinations of this kind are very ingenious, but often
                    unsatisfactory and even delusive. Whilst, however, he sometimes makes too much
                    of the defective materials he could command, he strongly insists on accurate and
                    continued observation as the only sure basis.</p>
                <p>Petty was not merely a statistician, he was also a political economist, and one
                    of no mean rank. He is one of the first in whom we find a tendency to a view of
                    industrial phenomena which was at variance with the then dominant mercantilist
                    ideas, and he exhibits a statesmanlike sense of the elements in which the
                    strength of a nation really consists. Roscher names him as having, along with
                    Locke and Dudley North, raised the English school to the highest point it
                    attained before the time of Hume. His <hi rend="italic">Treatise of
                    Taxes</hi><hi rend="italic">and Contributions</hi> has been recently pronounced
                    to be “the first great work on economic theory, which it may fairly be said to
                    have founded.” However this may be, it certainly contains a clear statement of
                    the doctrine that price depends on the labour necessary for production. Petty is
                    much concerned to discover a fixed unit of value, and he thinks he has found it
                    in the necessary sustenance of a man for a day. He understands the cheapening
                    effect of the division of labour. He states correctly the notion of “natural and
                    true” rent as the remainder of the produce of land after payment of the cost of
                    production; but he seems to have no idea of the “law of diminishing returns.” He
                    has much that is just on the subject of money: he sees that there may be an
                    excess of it as well as a deficiency, and regards the prohibition of its
                    exportation as contrary to sound policy. But he errs in attributing the fall of
                    the rate of interest which takes place in the progress of industry to the
                    increase in the quantity of money. He protested against the fetters imposed on
                    the trade of Ireland, and advocated a union of that country with Great Britain.
                    Whilst the general tendency in his day was to represent England as in a state of
                    progressive decline— an opinion put forward particularly in the tract entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Britannia</hi><hi rend="italic">Languens</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> Petty declared her resources and prospects to be not inferior to those
                    of France.</p>
                <p>A complete list of his works is given in the <hi rend="italic">Athcnae
                    Oxonienses.</hi> The most important are: the <hi rend="italic">Treatise of Taxes
                    and Contributions</hi> (1662, 1667, and 1685); <hi rend="italic">Political
                    Arithmetic,</hi> presented in MS. to Charles II., but, because it contained
                    matter likely to be offensive to France, kept unpublished till 1691, when it was
                    edited by Petty’s son Charles; <hi rend="italic">Quantulumcunque,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">or</hi><hi rend="italic">a Tract concerning</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    It is much to be regretted, as M <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Culloch long
