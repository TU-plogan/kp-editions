                <p><label type="entry">PANATHENAeA</label>, the most splendid and brilliant of all
                    the Athenian festivals, with perhaps the exception of the Great Dionysia. The
                    mythic foundation is ascribed to Erechtheus; and Pausanias declares that the
                    Olympia, the Lycaea, and the Panathenaea were the three oldest feasts in Greece.
                    It was originally a religious celebration in honour of the patron goddess of the
                    city, celebrated by her own worshippers. It is said that when Theseus united the
                    whole land under one government he made this festival of the city-goddess common
                    to the entire country, and the older name Athenaea was then changed to
                    Panathenaea. In addition to the religious rites there is said to have been a
                    chariot race from the earliest time; Erechtheus himself won the prize in the
                    race. The Panathenaea were modified and rendered far more magnificent by
                    Pisistratus and his sons. It is probable that the distinction of Greater and
                    Lesser Panathenaea dates from this period. Every fourth year the festival was
                    celebrated with peculiar magnificence; gymnastic sports were added to the horse
                    races; and there is little doubt that Pisistratus aimed at <pb break="no"

                    Ionian festival in rivalry to the Dorian Olympia. The penteteric festival was
                    celebrated in the third year of each Olympiad. The annual festival consisted
                    solely of the sacrifices and rites proper to this season in the cultus of the
                    goddess. One of these rites originally consisted in carrying a new peplus to the
                    temple to serve as the clothing of the image, a ceremonial known in other cities
                    and represented by the writer of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> (vi.) as being
                    in use at Troy; but it is probable that this rite was afterwards restricted to
                    the great penteteric festival. Even the religious rites were celebrated with
                    much greater splendour at the Greater Panathenaea. The whole empire shared in
                    the great sacrifice; every colony and every subject state sent a deputation and
                    sacrificial animals. On the great day of the feast there was a procession of the
                    priests, the sacrificial assistants of every kind, the representatives of every
                    part of the empire with their victims, the cavalry, in short of the population
                    of Attica and great part of its dependencies. The peplus was borne in the
                    procession and presented to the goddess, and the hecatomb was sacrificed. At
                    least as early as the 3d century before Christ the custom was introduced of
                    spreading the peplus like a sail on the mast of a ship, which was rolled on a
                    machine in the procession. The subject of the frieze of the Parthenon is an
                    idealized treatment of this great procession.</p>
                <p>The festival which had been beautified by Pisistratus was made still more
                    imposing under the rule of Pericles. He introduced a regular musical contest in
                    place of the old recitations of the rhapsodes, which were an old standing
                    accompaniment of the festival. The order of the <hi rend="italic">agones</hi>
                    from this time onwards was—first the musical, then the gymnastic, then the
                    equestrian contest. Many kinds of contest, such as the chariot race of the <hi
                    rend="italic">apobatai,</hi> which were not in use at Olympia, were practised in
                    Athens. The season of the festival was the last days of Hecatombaeon, and the
                    great day was the 28th, third from the end of the month <hi rend="italic"
                    >(τρίτη</hi><hi rend="italic">φθlvovτo&lt;s,</hi> called by Euripides <hi
                    rend="italic">φθωάς</hi><hi rend="italic">aμεpa).</hi> The prize in the games
                    was an amphora full of olive oil produced from the holy olives, the property and
                    gift of the goddess herself. Only one Panathenaic amphora has been found in
                    Attica itself; and, though many have been discovered outside of Attica,
                    especially in Cyrene, it has been maintained that the latter are not really
                    prizes in the games, but imitations made in the export trade as a sort of mark
                    that the oil sold in them was of the very finest quality.</p>
