                    was born at Great Snoring in the county of Norfolk, on the 28th of February
                    1612. After attending Eton, he entered Queens’ College, Cambridge, 10th June
                    1631, and was elected a scholar of King’s in April following and a fellow in
                    1634. Entering holy orders in 1639, he was collated to the prebend of Nether-A
                    von, in the church of Sarum. In 1640 he was appointed chaplain to the
                    lord-keeper Finch, by whom he was presented to the living of Thorington in
                    Suffolk during the same year. In 1650 he was made preacher of St Clement’s,
                    Eastcheap, in London. Seven years later he and Peter Gunning had a dispute with
                    two Roman Catholics upon the subject of schism, a one-sided account of which was
                    printed at Paris by one of the Roman Catholic disputants, under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">Schism Unmasked,</hi> 1658. In 1659 Pearson published at London
                    his celebrated <hi rend="italic">Exposition of the Creed,</hi> dedicated to his
                    parishioners of St Clement’s, Eastcheap, to whom the substance of that now
                    standard work had been preached several years before, and by whom he had been
                    desired to make it public. The same year he likewise published the <hi
                    rend="italic">Golden Remains of the ever-memorable Mr John Hales of Eton,</hi>
                    to which he prefixed a preface containing a character of that eminent man, with
                    whom he had been acquainted for many years, drawn up with great elegance and
                    force. Pearson had also a principal share in the editing of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Critici Sacri,</hi> first published in 1660. Soon after the
                    Restoration he was presented by Juxon, then bishop of London, to the rectory of
                    St Christopher’s in that city; and he was also in 1660 created doctor of
                    divinity at Cambridge, in pursuance of the king’s letters mandatory, installed
                    prebendary of Ely, archdeacon of Surrey, and made master of Jesus College,
                    Cambridge. In 1661 he was appointed Lady Margaret professor of divinity <pb

                    ensuing year he was nominated one of the commissioners for the review of the
                    liturgy in the conference held at the Savoy. On the 14th of April 1662 he was
                    elected master of Trinity College, Cambridge, and in August resigned his rectory
                    of St Christopher’s and his prebend of Ely. In 1667 he was admitted a Fellow of
                    the Royal Society. In 1672 he published at Cambridge <hi rend="italic"

                    Wilkins in 1672, Pearson was appointed his successor in the see of Chester. In
                    1682 his <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">Gyprianici</hi> were
                    published at Oxford, with Fell’s edition of that father’s works. Pearson was
                    disabled from all public service by ill health a considerable time before his
                    death at Chester on the 16th of July 1686. His last work, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Two Dissertations on the Succession and Times of the First Bishops of
