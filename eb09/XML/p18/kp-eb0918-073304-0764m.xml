                    Ageladas of Argos. It is tempting to believe that it was still under the
                    influence of this master that he executed (between 469 and 463) the Athenian
                    monument at Delphi commemorating the battle of Marathon; for Ageladas had
                    sculptured at Delphi also a monumental group serving a similar purpose. In the
                    group of Phidias was a portrait statue of Miltiades, and from this circumstance
                    it is rightly inferred that the work had been commissioned at the time when
                    Cimon, the son of Miltiades, was at the head of affairs in Athens. It was
                    apparently at this same period that Phidias was employed to execute for the
                    acropolis of Athens a statue of Athena. This statue, known in after times as
                    “the Lemnian” and also as “the beauty,” seems to have represented the goddess in
                    the attitude of standing at rest, helmet in hand, as in a terra-cotta statuette
                    from Cyprus in the British Museum.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the administration of affairs, and it was determined to erect new temples and
                    other public buildings worthy of the new glory which Athens had acquired in the
                    Persian wars, it was to Phidias that the supervision of all these works was
                    entrusted, with an army of artists and skilled workmen under him. By 438 the
                    Parthenon was completed, with its colossal statue of Athena in gold and ivory by
                    Phidias himself, and with its vast extent of sculpture in marble, executed at
                    least under his direction and reflecting in most parts his genius.<note

                    Meantime the enormous expense of these undertakings had involved Phidias in the
                    public discontent which was growing up round Pericles (Aristoph., <hi
                    rend="italic">Peace,</hi> 605). The story related by Plutarch <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Pericles,</hi> 31) is that Menon, a former assistant of Phidias, had brought a
                    charge against him of having appropriated part of the gold and ivory allowed him
                    for the statue of Athena, and that, being acquitted on this charge, he was next
                    denounced for introducing portraits of himself and of Pericles on the shield of
                    Athena, and in consequence of this charge died in prison, either a natural death
                    or by poison. But these statements cannot be reconciled with the tradition that,
                    after completing his Athena, he was invited to undertake at Olympia what proved
                    to be the grandest work of his life, the colossal gold and ivory statue of Zeus
                    in the newly-erected temple. According to this same tradition he died at
                    Olympia, and it may be inferred that he died much honoured there from the fact
                    that his workshop was preserved in after times as a show-place for visitors, and
                    that his descendants obtained an hereditary right to look after the great statue
                    of Zeus. As a means of reconciling these conflicting statements it has been
                    supposed that the charge of appropriating the gold had been made before he went
                    to Olympia, and the charge of sacrilege when he had returned thence to Athens.
                    Others again prefer to accept the story of Plutarch as it stands, and to assign
                    the stay of Phidias in Olympia to an early period of his life—previous to 455.
                    As to the charge of theft, it could never have reached a public trial, because
                    every one acquainted with the management of the public treasures knew that the
                    gold of the Athena was so sculptured that it could be removed annually and
                    weighed by the officials of the treasuries. Pericles told the Athenians (Thuc.,
                    ii. 13) that it could be removed and utilized for the war. The other charge of
                    having placed portraits of himself as a bald-headed old man (438) and of
                    Pericles on the shield of Athena is incredible. Pericles with the helmet which
                    he always wore was almost an ideal Greek in appearance. Among the Greeks
                    fighting with the</p>
                <p>Amazons on the shield of Athena it was probably easy to find a figure not unlike
                    him. The same may be said of the bald-headed old man who was identified with
                    Phidias. But there is a wide difference between idle gossip and a criminal
                    charge. It is true that there is in the British Museum a marble fragment of what
                    professes to be a copy of the shield, and on it there are portraits of Phidias
                    and of Pericles; but these portraits answer so minutely to the description of
                    Plutarch that there can hardly be a doubt of their having been produced
                    subsequently to illustrate some current story on which that description was
                    founded. The workmanship is several centuries later than Phidias, and it would
                    be strange if the portraits for which he had paid with his life had been left
                    for so long a time on the shield, or had even been allowed at any moment to be
                    perpetuated in a copy. In answer to this objection it was fabled that the
                    portraits had been so fixed on the shield that they could not be removed without
                    bringing down the whole work!</p>
                <p>To obtain something like a fair judgment of the style of Phidias it is to the
                    sculptures of the Parthenon now in the British Museum that we must turn (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Archaeology,</hi> vol. ii. p. 356). Though executed in what was
                    to him an inferior material, marble, it yet happened that the elevated position
                    which these sculptures were to occupy on the temple was such as to give scope
                    for the highest powers of composition, and so far they may be regarded as a
                    worthy monument of his genius. Alike in the frieze, the metopes, and the
                    remaining figures of the pediments we have the same perfect rendering of the
                    true effects of light and shade, which above all reveals the artist who can
                    compose his figures and his groups so as to make the spectator feel that nature
                    would not have done otherwise had nature been a sculptor. For composition of
                    this kind there was necessary a most complete knowledge of form in all its
                    details, since no part was so minute as not to affect the aspect of the whole.
                    In this respect Phidias was famed in antiquity, and the Parthenon sculptures
                    justify that fame. He must, however, have found finer opportunities in the
                    colossal statues of gold and ivory, where the greater difficulty of duly
                    distributing light and shade was rewarded with greater splendour of effect. In
                    these statues the nude parts, such as the face, hands, and feet, were of ivory,
                    the drapery of gold; and in the statue of Zeus at Olympia the gold was enriched
                    with enamelled colours, and the impression of the whole is described by ancient
                    writers with unbounded praise (see vol. ii. p. 355, and A. S. Murray, <hi
                    rend="italic">Gr. Sculpt.,</hi> ii. p. 123). Of the Athena in the Parthenon
                    there exist two small copies in marble found in Athens, but so rude in execution
                    as to be of no service in conveying a notion of the style of the original. On
                    the acropolis, and not far from the Parthenon, stood a colossal bronze statue of
                    Athena Promachos by Phidias, the attitude and to some extent the type of λvhich
                    may be gathered from the small bronze found at Athens, and figured in vol. ii.
                    p. 355. In Elis he executed a statue of Aphrodite in gold and ivory, and at
                    Plataea a colossal Athena of wood gilt, with the face, hands, and feet of
                    Pentelic marble. Bright but simple colours had been traditional in art before
                    the time of Phidias. It is not supposed that he had sought to refine upon them
                    as a colorist. What he did was to combine with their simplicity and brightness
                    the ideal largeness and dignity of conception which he shared with the great
                    painters of his day, and the perfection of execution which he shared with the
                    greatest of contemporary sculptors. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. s. μ.)</hi></p>
