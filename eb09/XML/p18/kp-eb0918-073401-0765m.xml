                    latter is uncertain.</p>
                <p>In 659 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Phigalia was taken by the Lacedaemonians,
                    but soon after recovered its independence; it was on the whole unfortunate
                    during the Peloponnesian War; and, in common with the other cities of Arcadia,
                    it appears from Strabo to have fallen into utter decay under the Roman rule. The
                    notices of it in Greek history are rare and scanty. Though its existing ruins of
                    city-wall and forts and the description of Pausanias show it to have been a
                    place of considerable strength and importance, yet no autonomous coins of
                    Phigalia are known. Nothing now remains above ground of the temples of Artemis
                    or Dionysus and the numerous statues and other works of art which still existed
                    at the time of Pausanias’s visit, about 170 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> A
                    great part of the city-wall, built in fine Hellenic “isodo-mous” masonry, and a
                    large square central fortress with a circular projecting tower, are the only
                    remains now traceable,—at least without the aid of excavation. The walls, once
                    nearly 2 miles in circuit, are strongly placed on rocks, which slope down to the
                    little river Neda.</p>
                <p>One very important monument of the wealth and artistic taste of the Phigalians
                    still exists in a fairly perfect state; this is a temple dedicated to Apollo
                    Epicurius (the Preserver), built, not at Phigalia itself, but at the village of
                    Bassae, 5 or 6 miles away, on one of the peaks of Mount Cotylium; it
                    commemorates the aid rendered by Apollo in stopping the progress of a plague
                    which in the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> was devastating
                    Phigalia. This temple is mentioned by Pausanias (viii. 41) as being (next to
                    that at Tegea) the finest in the Peloponnesus, “from the beauty of its stone and
                    the symmetry of its proportions.” It has also a special interest in having been
                    designed by Ictinus, who, with Callicrates, was joint architect of the Parthenon
                    at Athens. Though visited by Chandler, Dodwell, Gell, and other English
                    travellers, the temple was neither explored nor measured till 1811-12, when
                    Chas. Rob. Cockerell and some other archaeologists spent several months in
                    making excavations there. After nearly fifty years’ delay, Professor Cockerell
                    published the results of these labours, as well as of his previous work at
                    Aegina, in <hi rend="italic">Temples of Aegina and Bassae</hi> (1860), one of
                    the most careful and beautifully illustrated archaeological works that has ever
                    been produced. The labours of Professor Cockerell and his companions were richly
                    rewarded; not only were sufficient remains of the architectural features
                    discovered to show clearly what the whole design had been, but the internal
                    sculptured frieze of the cella was found almost perfect. This and other
                    fragments of its sculpture are now in the British Museum.</p>
                <p>Fig. 1 shows the plan of the temple, which is of the Doric order, hut has an
                    internal arrangement of its cella quite unlike that of any other known temple.
                    It stands on an elevated and partly artificial plateau, which commands a most
                    glorious and extensive view of the oak-clad mountains of Arcadia, reaching away
                    to the blue waters of the Messenian Gulf. Unlike other Doric temples, which
                    usually stand east and west, this is placed north and south; but it has a side
                    entrance on the east. It is hexastyle, with fifteen columns on its flanks;
                    thirty-four out of the thirty-eight columns of the peristyle are still standing,
                    with the greater part of their architrave, but the rest of the entablature and
                    both pediments have fallen, together with the greater part of the internal
                    columns of the cella. It will be seen from the plan that these are very
                    strangely placed, apparently without symmetry, as regards the interior, though
                    they are set, for what reason it is hard to say, regularly opposite the voids in
                    the peristyle.</p>
                <p>With the exception of one at the south end, which is Corinthian, the internal
                    columns are of the Ionic order, and are built, not free, but engaged with the
                    cella-wall, forming a series of recesses, which may have been designed to
                    contain statues. Another peculiarity of this interior is that these columns
                    reach to the top of the cella in one order, not in two ranges of columns, one
                    over the other, as was the usual Doric fashion. These inner columns carried an
                    Ionic entablature, of which the frieze now in the British Museum formed a part.
                    The pediments and external metopes of the peristyle appear to have contained no
                    sculpture, but the metopes within the peristyle on the exterior of the cella had
                    sculptured subjects; only a few fragments of these were, however, discovered.
                    The position occupied by the great statue of Apollo is a difficult problem.
                    Cockerell, with much probability, places it in the vestibule of the cella,
                    opposite the eastern side door, so that it would be lighted up by the rays of
                    the rising sun. The main entrance is at the northern end through the pronaos,
                    once defended by a door in the end of the cella and a metal screen, of which
                    traces were found on the two columns of the pronaos. There was no door between
                    the posticum and the cella. The general proportions of the fronts resemble those
                    of the Theseum at Athens, except that the entablature is less massive, the
                    columns thicker, and the diminution less,—all proportionally speaking. In plan
                    the temple is long in proportion to its width,—measuring, on the top of the
                    stylobate, 125 feet 7 inches by 48 feet 2 inches, while the Theseum (built
                    probably half a century earlier) is about 104 feet 2 inches by 45 feet 2
                    inches.</p>
                <p>The material of which the temple is built is a fine grey limestone (once covered
                    with painted stucco), except the roof-tiles, the capitals of the cella columns,
                    the architraves, the <hi rend="italic">lαcunαriα</hi> (ceilings) of the posticum
                    and pronaos, and the sculpture, all of which are of white marble. The
                    roof-tiles, specially noticed by Pausanias, are remarkable for their size,
                    workmanship, and the beauty of the Parian marble of which they are made. They
                    measure 2 feet 1 inch by 3 feet 6 inches, and are fitted together in the most
                    careful and ingenious manner. Unlike those of the Parthenon and the temple of
                    Aegina, the <hi rend="italic">αρμοί</hi> or “joint-tiles” are worked out of the
                    same piece of marble as the flat ones, at a great additional cost of labour and
                    material, for the sake of more perfect fitting and greater security against
                    wet.</p>
                <p>Traces of painting on various architectural members were found by Professor
                    Cockerell, but they were too much faded for the colours to be distinguished. The
                    designs are the usual somewhat stiff and monotonous Greek patterns,—the fret,
                    the honeysuckle, and the egg and dart.</p>
                <p>The sculpture is of the greatest interest, as being an important example of the
                    school of Phidias, designed to decorate one of the finest buildings in the
                    Peloponnesus in the latter half of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>; see <hi rend="italic">Phigaleian Marbles,</hi> Brit. Mus.
                    Publications. .</p>
                <p>The frieze, now in the British Museum, is quite complete; it is nearly 101 feet
                    long by 2 feet high, carved in relief on twenty-three slabs of marble 4⅜ to 5
                    inches thick (see fig. 2). The subjects are the battle of the Lapithae and the
                    Centaurs, and that between the Amazons and the Greeks, the two favourite
                    subjects in Greek plastic art of the best period. They are designed with
                    wonderful fertility of invention, and life-like realism and spirit; the
                    composition is arranged so as to form a series of diagonal lines or zigzags
                    ∕W&gt; thus forming a pleasing contrast to the unbroken horizontal lines <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n767/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0767-0736"/> of the cornice and architrave. The various groups
                    are skilfully united together by some dominant line or action, so that the whole
                    subject forms one unbroken composition.</p>
                <p>The relief is very high, more than 3⅛ inches in the most salient parts, and the
                    whole treatment is quite opposite to that of the Parthenon frieze, which is a
                    very superior work of art to that at Bassae. Many of the limbs are quite
                    detached from the ground; the drill has been largely used to emphasize certain
                    shadows, and in many places, for want of due calculation, the sculptor has had
                    to cut into the flat background behind the figures. From this it would appear
                    that no finished clay-model was prepared, but that the relief was sculptured
                    with only the help of a drawing. The point of sight, more than 20 feet below the
                    bottom of the frieze, and the direction in which the light fell on it have
                    evidently been carefully considered. Many parts, invisible from below, are left
                    comparatively rough. The workmanship throughout is unequal, and the hands of
                    several sculptors can be detected. On the whole, it must be admitted that the
                    execution is not equal to the beauty of the design, and the whole frieze is
                    somewhat marred by an evident desire to produce the maximum of effect with the
                    least possible amount of labour,—very different from the almost gem-like finish
                    of the Parthenon frieze. Even the design is inferior to the Athenian one; most
                    of the figures are ungracefully short in their proportions, and there is a great
                    want of refined beauty in many of the female hands and faces. It is in the fire
                    of its varied action and its subtlety of expression that this sculpture most
                    excels. The noble movements of the heroic Greeks form a striking contrast to the
                    feminine weakness of the wounded Amazons, or the struggles with teeth and hoofs
                    of the brutish Centaurs; the group of Apollo and Artemis in their chariot is
                    full of grace and dignified power. The marble in which this frieze is sculptured
                    is somewhat coarse and crystalline; the slabs appear not to have been built into
                    their place but fixed afterwards, with the aid of two bronze bolts driven
                    through the face of each.</p>
                <p>Of the metopes, which were 2 feet 8 inches square, only one exists nearly
                    complete, with eleven fragments; the one almost perfect has a relief of a nude
                    warrior, with floating drapery, overcoming a long-haired bearded man, who sinks
                    vanquished at his feet. The relief of these is rather less than that of the
                    frieze figures, and the work is nobler in character and superior in execution.
                    The other pieces are too fragmentary to show what were their subjects.</p>
                <p>No modern Greek village exists now on the site either of Bassae or of
                    Phigalia.</p>
