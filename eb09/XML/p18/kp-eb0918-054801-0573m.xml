                    Criminal Law,</hi> Art. 135). In the early stages of legal history perjury seems
                    to have been regarded rather as a sin than as a crime, and so subject only to
                    supernatural penalties. The injury caused by a false oath was supposed to be
                    done not so much to society as to the Divine Being in whose name the oath was
                    taken (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Oath).</hi> One of the practical effects of this
                    view -was to make perjury so common in the Middle Ages that the probable reason
                    for preserving trial by combat was the difficulty of securing a just cause
                    against the perjury of witnesses (Hallam, <hi rend="italic">Middle Ages,</hi>
                    ch. ix. pt. 1). The almost universal existence of compurgation was no doubt
                    another explanation of the frequency of perjury. In cases of compurgation, or in
                    cases where wager of law was allowed, it is difficult to imagine that the
                    defence could as a rule have been an honest one. In Roman law, even in the time
                    of the empire, the perjurer fell simply under divine reprobation, and was not
                    dealt with as a criminal, except where he had been bribed to withhold true or
                    give false evidence, or where the oath was by the genius of the emperor. In the
                    latter case punishment was no doubt inflicted more for the insult to the emperor
                    than for the perjury. False testimony leading to the conviction of a person for
                    a crime punishable with death constituted the offence of homicide rather than of
                    perjury. In England, perjury, as being a sin, was originally a matter of
                    ecclesiastical cognizance. At a later period, when it had become a crime, the
                    jurisdiction uf the spiritual courts became gradually confined to such perjury
                    as was committed in ecclesiastical proceedings, and did not extend to perjury
                    committed in a temporal court. The only perjury which was for a long time
                    noticed at common law was the perjury of jurors. Attaint of jurors (who were
                    originally rather in the position of witnesses than of judges of fact)
                    incidentally subjected them to punishment for perjury. Criminal jurisdiction
                    over perjury by persons other than jurors seems to have been first assumed by
                    the Star Chamber, acting under the powers supposed to have been conferred by 3
                    Hen. VIL ch. 1. After the abolition of the Star Chamber by the Long Parliament
                    in 1641 and the gradual diminution of the authority of the spiritual courts,
                    perjury (whether in the strict sense of the word or the taking of a false oath
                    in non-judicial proceedings) practically fell entirely within the jurisdiction
                    of the ordinary criminal tribunals. The jurisdiction of the spiritual courts
                    over perjury may now be considered obsolete. An unsuccessful attempt was made as
                    lately as 1876 to induce the Court of Arches to entertain a criminal suit
                    against a layman for a false oath taken before a surrogate (Phillimore <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Machon, <hi rend="italic">Law Peρ.,</hi> 1 Prob. Div.,
                    481). See further, for the history of the law of perjury, Stephen, <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Criminal Laιν,</hi> vol. ii. p. 408; vol. iii. p.
                    240. At common law only a false oath in judicial proceedings is perjury. But by
                    statute the penalties of perjury have been extended to extra-judicial matters,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> false declarations made for the purpose of
                    procuring marriage (19 and 20 Vict. c. 119, s. 18), and false affidavits under
                    the Bills of Sale Act, 1878 (41 and 42 Vict. c. 31, s. 17). False affirmation by
                    a person permitted by law to affirm is perjury (32 and 33 Vict. c. 68, s. 4; 33
                    and 34 Vict. c. 49). In order to support an indictment for perjury the
                    prosecution must prove the authority to administer the oath, the occasion of
                    administering it, the taking of the oath, the substance of the oath, the
                    materiality of the matter sworn, the falsity of the matter sworn, and the
                    corrupt intention of the defendant. The indictment must allege that the perjury
                    was wilful and corrupt, and must set out the false statement or statements on
                    which perjury is assigned, subject to the provisions of 23 Geo. II. c. 11 (which
                    also applies to subornation of perjury). By that Act it is sufficient to set out
                    the substance of the offence, without setting forth the bill, answer, &amp;c.,
                    or any part of the record, and without setting forth the commission or authority
                    of the court before whom the perjury was committed. The matter sworn to must be
                    one of fact and not of mere belief or opinion. It is not homicide, as in Roman
                    law, to procure the death of another by false evidence, but the Criminal Code,
                    ss. 118, 164, proposes to make such an offence a substantive crime of greater
                    gravity than ordinary perjury, and punishable by penal servitude for life. It is
                    a rule of evidence, founded upon obvious reasons, that the testimony of a single
                    witness is insufficient to convict on a charge of perjury. There must be
                    corroboration of his evidence in some material particular. Perjury is a common
                    law misdemeanour, not triable at quarter-sessions. Proceedings may also be taken
                    under 5 Eliz. c. 9, but this Act is of little practical importance, as the
                    common law is more extensive than the statute. Most persons in a judicial
                    position have the right of directing the prosecution of any witness, if it
                    appears to them that he has been guilty of perjury (14 and 15 Vict. c. 100, s.
                    19). The provisions of the Vexatious Indictments Act (22 and 23 Vict. c. 17)
                    extend to perjury and subornation of perjury. By that Act no indictment for
                    either of such offences can be preferred unless the prosecutor or accused is
                    bound by recognizance, or the accused is in custody, or the consent of a judge
                    is obtained, or (in the case of perjury) a prosecution is directed under 14 and
                    15 Vict. c. 100.</p>
                <p>Subornation of perjury is procuring a person to commit a perjury which he
                    actually commits in consequence of such procurement. If the person attempted to
                    be suborned do not take the oath, the person inciting him, though not guilty of
                    subornation, is liable to fine and corporal punishment. Perjury and subornation
                    of perjury are punishable at common law with fine and imprisonment. By the
                    combined operation of 2 Geo. II. c. 25 and later statutes, the punishment at
                    present appears to be penal servitude for any term, or imprisonment with or
                    without hard labour for a term not exceeding seven years (see Stephen, <hi
                    rend="italic">Digest,</hi> Art. 137). Perjury or prevarication committed before
                    a committee of either House of Parliament may be dealt with as a contempt or
                    breach of privilege as well as by prosecution. As to false oaths not perjury, it
                    is a <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n574/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0574-0549"/> misdemeanour at common law, punishable by fine
                    and imprisonment, to swear falsely before any person authorized to administer an
                    oath upon a matter of common concern, under such circumstances that the false
                    swearing, if committed in judicial proceedings, would have amounted to perjury.
                    There are some cases of making false declarations which are punishable on
                    summary conviction, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> certain declarations under the
                    Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1874, and the Customs Consolidation Act,
                    1876. A conviction for perjury subjects the person convicted to certain
                    disqualifications. He cannot hold a parish office (4 and 5 Will. IV. c. 76, s.
                    48). If a solicitor, and he attempt to practise after conviction, he is liable
                    on summary conviction by a judge to seven years’ penal servitude (12 Geo. I. c.
                    29, s. 4). If the prosecution be under the statute of Elizabeth, the person
                    convicted is disabled from giving evidence for the future (5 Eliz. c. 9, s. 2).
                    The provisions of the last two Acts may, however, be regarded as virtually
                    obsolete. The perjury of a witness may be a ground for pardon where the perjury
                    has taken place in a criminal trial in which accused was convicted, or for a new
                    trial in a civil action. In order to procure a pardon or a new trial it is
                    generally necessary to show that the witness was a material one, and also that
                    the perjurer has been prosecuted to conviction.</p>
                <p>In Scotland the law, as a general rule, agrees with that of England. Perjury may
                    be committed by a party on reference to oath as well as by a witness. A witness
                    making a false affirmation is guilty of perjury (28 Vict. c. 9). The Acts 14 and
                    15 Vict. c. 100 and 22 and 23 Vict. c. 17 do not extend to Scotland. The trial,
                    though usually by the Court of Justiciary, may be by the Court of Session if the
                    perjury is committed in the course of an action before that court. The
                    punishment is penal servitude or imprisonment at the discretion of the court.
                    Formerly a person convicted of perjury was disabled from giving evidence in
                    future; this disability was abolished by 15 Vict. c. 27, s. 1.</p>
                <p>In the United States the common law has been extended by most States to embrace
                    false affirmations and false evidence in proceedings not judicial. Perjury in
                    the United States courts is dealt with by an Act of Congress of 3d March 1825,
                    by which the maximum punishment for perjury or subornation of perjury is a fine
                    of $2000 or imprisonment for five years. The jurisdiction of the States to
                    punish perjury committed in the State courts is specially preserved by the same
                    Act. Statutory provisions founded upon 23 Geo. II. c. 11 have been adopted in
                    some States, but not in others. In the States which have not adopted such
                    provisions, the indictment must set out the offence with the particularity
                    necessary at common law. (J. W+.)</p>
