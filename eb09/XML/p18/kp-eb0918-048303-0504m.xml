                    growing in marshy lands, was the true ancient representative of the modern pen;
                    hollow joints of bamboo were similarly employed. The use of such pens can be
                    traced to a remote antiquity among the civilized nations of the East, where
                    reeds and canes are to this day in common use as writing instruments. The
                    earliest specific allusion to the quill pen occurs in the writings of St Isidore
                    of Seville (early part of the 7th century).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“Instrumenta scribae calamus et penna; ex his enim verba
                    paginis infiguntur; sed calamus arboris est, penna avis, cujus acumen dividitur
                    in duo.”</p></note> But there is no reason to assume that the quill pen was not
                    in use at an earlier period, and, indeed, remains have been found which prove
                    that even metal pens were not altogether unknown to the ancient Romans.</p>
                <p>The quilis, formerly in exclusive use, and still largely employed among Western
                    communities as writing instruments, are obtained principally from the wings of
                    the goose. Swan-quills are also highly prized, and for special purposes
                    crow-quills and the wing-feathers of certain other birds are adopted. For the
                    method of preparing quills, &amp;c., see <hi rend="smallcaps">Feathers,</hi>
                    vol. ix. p. 60. In 1809 Joseph Bramah, the famous inventor, devised and patented
                    a machine for cutting up the quill into separate nibs by dividing the barrel
                    into three or even four parts, and cutting these transversely into “two, three,
                    four, and some into five lengths.” Bramah’s invention first familiarized the
                    public with the appearance and use of the nib and holder in place of the
                    complete quill or barrel, and in that sense he anticipated the form of pen now
                    most commonly used. In 1818 Charles Watt obtained a patent for gilding and
                    preparing quills and pens by manual labour and chemical means, which may be
                    regarded as the precursor of the gold pen. But a more distinct advance in this
                    direction was effected in 1822, when Hawkins and Mordan patented the application
                    of horn and tortoise-shell to the formation of pen-nibs, the points of which
                    were rendered durable by impressing into them small pieces of diamond, ruby, or
                    other very hard substance, or by lapping a small piece of thin sheet gold over
                    the end of the tortoise-shell, and by various other ways securing a hard
                    unalterable point to the pen.</p>
                <p>Metallic pens, though perhaps not altogether unknown even in classical times, did
                    not come into use till the present century, and indeed did not become common
                    till near the middle of the century. At the meeting of the British Association
                    in Birmingham in 1839 steel pens were scarcely known; ten years later the
                    manufacture had become an important local industry. In 1803 a steel pen was made
                    and sold in London by a Mr Wise, which was in the form of a tube or barrel pen,
                    the edges meeting to form the slit with sides cut away as in the case of an
                    ordinary quill. These sold at about five shillings each, and as they were hard,
                    stiff, and unsatisfactory instruments they were not in great demand. In 1808 a
                    metallic pen was patented by Bryan Donkin, made of two separate parts, flat or
                    nearly so, with the flat sides opposite each other forming the slit of the pen,
                    or, as an alternative, of one piece, flat and not cylindrical as in the usual
                    form, bent to the proper angle before being inserted into the tube which forms
                    its holder. In Birmingham a steel pen was made by a splitring manufacturer,
                    Harrison, for Dr Priestley towards the end of the 18th century. Harrison in
                    after years became associated in the split-ring business with Josiah Mason, who
                    was one of the great pioneers of the steel-pen trade. Mason developed the
                    manufacture on the basis of an invention by James Perry, who in 1830 obtained a
                    patent for improvements which must be regarded as the foundation of the
                    steel-pen industry. Perry’s improvements consisted in producing pens from hard,
                    thin, and elastic metal, the most suitable material being described as the very
                    best steel brought to a spring temper. The necessary flexibility was given to
                    the pen by a central hole formed in the pen between the nib and the shoulder in
                    connexion with a central slit, and by making between the nib and the shoulder
                    one or more lateral slits on each side of the central slit. Joseph Gillott, who
                    divides with Mason and Perry the credit of perfecting the metallic pen, does not
                    appear as a patentee till 1831, when he patented an improvement which consisted
                    in forming elongated points on the nibs of pens. These early pens lacked
                    softness, flexibility, and smoothness of action, and subsequent inventions of
                    Perry, Gillott, Mordan, and others were largely devoted to overcoming such
                    defects. Metals other than steel were also frequently suggested by inventors,
                    those most commonly <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n505/mode/1up"

                    aluminium, and aluminium bronze, the last-named having at one time come into
                    extensive use. The development of the gold pen cannot be traced through the
                    patent records in the same way as some others. Dr Wollaston, it is recorded,
                    used a gold pen composed of two thin slips of gold tipped with rhodium, made
                    apparently on the principle patented by Donkin in 1808. Messrs Mordan of London
                    have the credit of being the earliest regular makers of gold pens with tips of
                    osmiumiridium alloy, and that manufacture was subsequently developed by Messrs
                    Wiley of Birmingham. The gold pens now made are provided with iridium tips, and
                    their manufacture is a special industry, requiring processes and machines
                    different from those used in the steel-pen industry.</p>
                <p>Fountain pens and penholders in which considerable reservoirs of ink could be
                    carried ready for use were introduced by a patented invention of the ingenious
                    Joseph Bramah. Of his several plans for a fountain pen one proposal was a hollow
                    tube of silver or other metal, the tube being made so thin that it could readily
                    be compressed out of shape and so cause an escape of ink to the nib, and another
                    plan was to fit the tube with a piston which might slide down the interior and
                    so force out ink. John Scheffer in 1819 patented a device consisting of a
                    reservoir in the holder operated on by a stud, which, when pressed by the thumb,
                    yielded a flow of ink to the nib. Many forms of attachment and modifications of
                    the shape of the pen have also been introduced with the view of enabling the pen
                    itself to carry a considerable supply of ink, and to discharge it in writing in
                    a safe and equal manner. A highly original and comparatively successful form of
                    fountain pen of recent introduction is known as the stylograph, in which the
                    ordinary form of nib is dispensed with, and connected with the barrel or
                    reservoir is a finely-tapered point tipped with iridium pierced with a fine
                    aperture. Into the aperture is fitted an iridium needle or plug attached
                    internally to a delicate gold spring, and the act of writing sufficiently pushes
                    back the needle to allow the escape of the requisite flow of ink by the
                    aperture. The two principal forms of stylograph are that of Mackinnon, patented
                    first in the United States in March 1879, and that of Cross, the United States
                    patent for which was secured in January 1878.</p>
                <p>The finish which the common steel pen now shows, and the low price at which it
                    can be sold, are triumphs of manufacturing skill, the credit of which is largely
                    due to Birmingham. For the fraction of a farthing there can now be purchased an
                    article incomparably superior to that which in the early years of the century
                    cost five shillings. The metal used consists of rolled sheets of cast steel of
                    the finest quality, made from Swedish charcoal iron. These sheets are cut into
                    strips of suitable width, annealed in a muffle furnace, and pickled in a bath of
                    dilute sulphuric acid to remove the oxidized scale from the surface. The stnps
                    so cleaned are next rolled between steel rollers till they are reduced to
                    ribbons the thickness of the pens to be made. At this stage the raw material is
                    ready for the series of manufacturing operations, most of which are performed
                    with the aid of hand fly-presses, moving suitable cutting, stamping, and
                    embossing attachments. The pen blanks are first cut out of the ribbon so as to
                    leave as little scrap as possible. These blanks are next pierced, that is, the
                    central perforation and the side or shoulder slits by which flexibility is
                    secured are made at one operation... After again annealing, they are marked and
                    embossed with maker*s name, trade-mark, or any of the endless variety of marks
                    by which pens are distinguished from each other. Up to this point the blanks are
                    flat; they are now raised or rounded into the semi-cylindrical form in which
                    pens are used. At this stage the pens are tempered by heating in iron boxes in a
                    muffle, plunging in oil, and heating over a fire in a rotating cylindrical
                    vessel till their surfaces attain the dull blue colour characteristic of spring
                    steel elasticity. They are then scoured and polished by being revolved in large
                    tin cylinders, in which they are mixed with sand, pounded crucibles, or such
                    substances. The grinding of the points next follows, an operation performed by
                    small rapidly-revolving emery-wheels, on which the points are first ground
                    lengthwise and then across the nib, the object of the process being to increase
                    the elasticity of the point. The slitting process which follows—that is, the
                    cutting of the pen-slit from the perforation to the point—is effected with a
                    chisel-cutter worked by a hand screwpress. On the precision with which the slit
                    divides the point depends the perfection of the pen, to finish which it now only
                    remains to colour the surface in a revolving cylinder over a charcoal fire, and
                    to varnish it in a solution of shellac.</p>
                <p>Birmingham, which was the first home of the steel-pen industry, continues to be
                    its principal centre, but steel pens are also made in the United States and in
                    France and Germany. (J. PA.)</p>
