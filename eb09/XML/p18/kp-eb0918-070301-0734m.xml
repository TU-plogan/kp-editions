                    rend="italic">Essai sur le Mariage,</hi> in which he advocated the marriage of
                    priests, confirmed his position as a bold reformer, and when the elections to
                    the States-General took place in 1789 he was elected a deputy to the Tiers Etat
                    for Chartres. Both in the assembly of the Tiers Etat and in the Constituent
                    Assembly Pétion showed himself a radical leader. He supported Mirabeau on 23d
                    June, attacked the queen on 5th October, and was elected president on 4th
                    December 1790. On 21st June 1791 he was chosen one of three commissioners
                    appointed to bring back the king from Varennes. After the last meeting of the
                    assembly on 30th September 1791 Robespierre and Pétion were made the popular
                    heroes and were crowned by the populace with civic crowns. Pétion received a
                    still further proof of the affection of the Parisians for himself on 14th
                    November 1791, when he was elected second mayor of Paris in succession to
                    Bailly. In his mayoralty he exhibited clearly his republican tendency and his
                    hatred of the old monarchy, especially on 20th June 1792, when he allowed the
                    mob to overrun the Tuileries and insult the royal family. For neglecting to
                    protect the Tuileries he was suspended from his functions by the Directory of
                    the department of the Seine, but the leaders of the Legislative Assembly felt
                    that Pétion’s cause was theirs, and rescinded the suspension on 13th July. On 3d
                    August, at the head of the municipality of Paris, Pétion demanded the
                    dethronement of the king, and on 10th August, while the monarchy was falling
                    with the Tuileries, he patiently underwent a form of detention in his own
                    mairie. He was still mayor of Paris when the massacres of September in the
                    prisons took place, and must bear the blame of not having endeavoured to
                    interfere. He was elected to the Convention for Eure-et-Loir, and became its
                    first president. Manuel then had the folly to propose that the president of the
                    Assembly should have the same authority as the president of the United States;
                    his proposition was at once rejected, but Pétion got the nickname of “Roi
                    Pétion,” which contributed to his fall. His jealousy of Robespierre allied him
                    to the Girondin party, as did also his assiduous attention at Madame Roland’s
                    salon. With the Girondins he voted for the king’s death and for the appeal to
                    the people, as one of them he was elected to the first committee of general
                    defence in March 1793, as their representative he attacked Robespierre on 12th
                    April, and it is no matter of wonder, therefore, that his name was among those
                    of the twenty-two Girondin deputies proscribed on 2d June. Pétion was one of
                    those who escaped to Caen and raised the standard of provincial insurrection
                    against the Convention; and when the Norman rising failed he fled with Guadet,
                    Buzot, Barbaroux, Salle, and Louvet to the Gironde, and hid in a grotto at St
                    Émilion. At last, but a month before Robespierre’s fall in June 1794, the
                    escaped deputies felt themselves tracked down, and deserted the grotto; Louvet
                    found his way to Paris, Salle and Guadet to Bordeaux, where they were soon
                    taken; Barbaroux committed suicide; and the bodies of Pétion and Buzot were
                    found in a field, half-eaten by wolves.</p>
