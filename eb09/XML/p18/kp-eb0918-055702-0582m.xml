                    fermentation of the juice of pears. The manufacture is in all essentials

                    >(q.vf,</hi> though there are some variations in detail arising from the more
                    abundant mucilage of the pear. The clearest and most concise account of making
                    cider and perry is contained in the fourth part of the <hi rend="italic"

                    fruits are either taken at once to the crushing mill or allowed, like apples, to
                    remain in heaps so as to ripen uniformly; they are then crushed between rollers
                    of granite or millstone grit, and the must or juice poured into casks. In making
                    the better kinds of perry only the best sorts of pears are used without
                    admixture; but for ordinary purposes pears of various kinds are mixed
                    indiscriminately, although, as in the case of the apple, the fruits used for the
                    manufacture of perry are not those which are the most suitable for dessert. It
                    is considered better not to crush the pips, as the flavour of the perry is
                    thereby deteriorated. The most scrupulous cleanliness is absolutely requisite,
                    and all the metal-work of the machinery should be sedulously kept bright,
                    otherwise the acids of the juice dissolve the oxides, and, in the case of lead,
                    produce poisonous salts. Pear-juice contains grape-sugar, tannic, malic, and
                    tartaric acids, albumen, lime, pectin, mucilage, and other ingredients. The
                    quantity of potash and phosphoric acid in the juice is relatively large. At a
                    temperature ranging from 50° to 80° the juice undergoes natural fermentation
                    without the addition of yeast. This fermentation, however, is brought about by
                    the agency of a “ferment” (saccharomyces), which feeds on the grape-sugar of the
                    juice, decomposing it, and causing the rearrangement of its constituents in the
                    form of alcohol, carbonic-acid gas, glycerin, Ac. The saccharomyces ferments in
                    the first instance absorb oxygen and liberate carbonic acid, as in the process
                    of respiration, but the air of the fluid in which they live speedily becomes
                    exhausted of its oxygen, and then the ferments obtain further supplies from the
                    glucose, in effecting the decomposition of which they set free more oxygen than
                    they require, and this, uniting with the hydrogen and the carbon, forms the
                    products of fermentation.</p>
                <p>In practice the pulp is removed from the mill and placed in open vats for
                    forty-eight hours or longer. Gentle fermentation sets in, as shown by the
                    formation of froth and bubbles of carbonic-acid gas. The pulp is then placed in
                    layers separated by hair-cloths, which act as sieves or filters when the mass is
                    placed in a press like a cheesepress. The pressure is gradual at first and
                    afterwards increased. The juice or must is poured into hogsheads, leaving an
                    unfilled space as “ullage.” The hogsheads are placed in a cool cellar, when
                    fermentation begins as above explained, and a thick scum forms on the surface
                    called the “upper lees.” At the same time mucilage and ferment-cells with the
                    more solid particles sink to the bottom and form the “lower lees” at the bottom
                    of the barrel. When the fermentation has subsided the liquor between the upper
                    and lower lees should be bright, but in the case of perry, owing to the large
                    quantity of mucilage, the juice has to be filtered through filters of Forfar
                    linen,— a tedious process. The clear liquor is now racked off into clean casks,
                    not quite filled, but leaving space for “ullage,” and kept uncorked at a <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">1oλv</hi> temperature. A better practice is to close the cask
                    with a bung, through which a curved siphon-like tube is passed, one end of it
                    being in the “ullage” and the portion of it outside the cask being bent
                    downwards and then upwards; then either the bend of the tube may be filled with
                    one or two tablespoonfuls of water, or the outer end of the bent tube may be
                    plunged in a cup of water,—the object in all cases being to provide for the
                    escape of gas from the cask and to prevent the passage of air into it. In a week
                    or so the fermentation ceases or nearly so, the liquor becomes clear and quiet,
                    when isinglass is added in the proportion of one ounce to a hogshead of 100 to
                    115 gallons. (In Devonshire, the hogshead contains uniformly fifty gallons.) In
                    January or February the bungs are driven in firmly. While fermentation is going
                    on, a temperature of 50° to 70° is most propitious, but after the liquor has
                    been racked off it should be kept in a uniformly cool cellar as near to 40°
                    Fahr, as can be done. When it is desirable to restrain over-violent or hasty
                    fermentation, sulphur or salicylic acid is employed. The latter, being the
                    simpler and cleaner, is the better agent to be adopted. An ounce or an ounce and
                    a half to a hundred gallons should be poured into the fermenting liquor
                    immediately after it has been racked. It is very effectual, and leaves no
                    sensible effects on the liquor if carefully used, being tasteless and free from
                    smell. Great care should be taken, however, not to allow the acid to come into
                    contact with any metal such as iron, or a black colour will result. Perry
                    contains about 7 per cent, of alcohol, and will keep in casks if well made for
                    three or four years, or longer if in bottle. It does not, however, travel
                    well.</p>
