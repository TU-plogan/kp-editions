                    were Moslems, 68,992 Hindus, 6724 Sikhs, 4390 Christians, and 88
                    others.</p></note> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Peshawur,</hi> a district in the
                    lieutenant-governorship of the Punjab, with an area of 2504 square miles,
                    situated in the extreme north-western corner of British India, between 33° 50'
                    and 34° 30' N. lat. and 71° 30' and 72° 50' E. long. Except on the south-east,
                    where the Indus flows, it is encircled by mountains, and is bounded on the N. by
                    the Mohmand, Utman Khel, and other hills, E. by the Indus, S. by the Khatak and
                    Afridi Hills, and W. by the Khyber Mountains. It forms an important part of the
                    frontier of the Punjab, being crossed by the great route from India to Cabul.
                    The only hills of any consequence in the district are the Khatak Hills, a
                    continuation of the Afridi Hills, which are themselves a spur of the great Sufed
                    Koh range. The plain consists of alluvial deposits of silt and gravel, and
                    throughout the whole valley its surface is studded with water-worn shingle or
                    boulders. The district presents, especially in its western and central portions,
                    an appearance of great beauty: it is covered with luxuriant vegetation, which is
                    relieved by the meanderings of the numerous canals and set off by its bare stony
                    surroundings and the far distant snowy peaks. Its rivers, all tributaries of the
                    Indus, are the Cabul, Swat, Bara, Budni, and Ludnai. The district is naturally
                    fertile and well watered, and the valley is entirely drained by the Cabul river.
                    The temperature ranges from a minimum of 17° in February to a maximum of 137° in
                    July. The average rainfall is about 14 inches.</p>
                <p>According to the census of 1881 the population was 592,674, of whom 329,524 were
                    males and 263,150 females. The people are mostly Afghans and almost entirely of
                    the Moslem religion, no less than 546,117 being Mohammedans, while Hindus
                    numbered only 39,321, Christians 4088, Sikhs 3103, and others 45. The largest
                    tribe in the district is that of the Pathans, of whom in 1881 there were
                    276,656. The Moslem portion of the population is occupied chiefly in agriculture
                    and the rearing of cattle, while the Hindus are engaged in trade as bankers,
                    merchants, and shopkeepers. The prevailing languages are the Urdu and
                    Pushtu.</p>
                <p>Out of the total area of 2504 square miles 1414 are cultivated and 470 are
                    returned as cultivable. The chief products are wheat, barley, maize, millet.
                    Peshawar also produces some of the finest rice in the world, known as “Bara
                    rice,” named after the river by which the ground yielding it is irrigated. Since
                    the district came into British possession its trade has increased considerably.
                    The principal foreign markets with which it deals are Cabul and Bokhara; the
                    imports from the former are chiefly silk, nuts and fruits, skins, timber, dyes,
                    and spices, and from the latter gold bullion and gold thread, which go
                    principally to Bombay. The exports consist mainly of piece goods, tea, fancy
                    wares, sugar, salt, and spices. The chief manufactures are Peshawar scarves,
                    celebrated throughout India for their fine texture and tasteful colouring,
                    leather goods, cutlery, the preparation of snuff, and a great deal of
                    broadcloth. . The gross revenue of the district in 1882-83 was £95,931, of which
                    the land revenue contributed £68,201.</p>
                <p>Peshawar in 1881 had five towns with a population exceeding 5000, namely Peshawar
                    (see below); Nowshera, 12,963; Tangi, 9037: Maira Parang, 8874; and Charsadda,
                    8363.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The first authentic
                    record of the tribes seated about Peshawar is in the time of Mahmud. What little
                    is heard of them before then points to their being a bold and independent race.
                    Buddhism was introduced into the district in the reign of Asoka, 263 B.C., and
                    one of his rock edicts still exists. From the time of Sabuktagin, governor of
                    Khorasan, in 978 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> who took possession of the
                    country up to the Indus, Peshawar became the scene of fierce contests. Mahmud,
                    his son, was the first Moslem conqueror of Hindustan, and succeeded in
                    converting the Pathans to the Mohammedan faith; and this tribe remained true to
                    him in all his subsequent engagements with the infidels. The last decisive
                    battle of Mahmud with the Hindus was fought on the plains of Chach in Rawal
                    Pindi, where he totally defeated Anang Pal, the last champion of the Hindu creed
                    and nationality in the north. For a century and more after Mahmud’s death (1028)
                    Peshawar continued to be a province of Ghazni; and under his numerous successors
                    it acquired great importance, becoming the centre of their dominions, which were
                    extended to Lahore. Timur’s invasion of India at the close of the 13th century
                    did not disturb the district or the tribes about it, but a century later the
                    Khakhai Pathans, a body of roaming adventurers, invaded the district in three
                    main clans—the Yusafzai, Gigianis, and Muhammadzai—and obtained permission from
                    the Dilazaks, who then held it, to settle on a portion of their waste lands.
                    Quarrelling with the Dilazaks, they routed them and swept them into the
                    neighbouring district of Hazara. The Gigianis then settled in the fertile strip
                    of land about the confluence of the Swat and the Cabul; the Muhammadzai took
                    Hashtnagar, and the Yusafzai the remainder of the country north of the Cabul
                    river. For some time these tribes remained unmolested, but in 1519 Babar,
                    fifteen years after his capture of Cabul, allied himself with the injured
                    Dilazaks and subdued the Afghans of Peshawar. After his death in 1530 the
                    country was the scene of constant feuds, which ended in the Dilazaks being
                    completely ousted. The yeaι∙ 1553 marks the last immigration of Afghans into the
                    district. In 1587 Akbar came to the throne. During the next three reigns the
                    valley rendered an unwilling allegiance to the central authority, and in the
                    reign of Aurangzeb the Pathans succeeded in freeing themselves from Mogul
                    supremacy. In 1738 Nadir Shah held possession of the district, and under the
                    succeeding Durani dynasty it was often the residence of the Cabul court. On the
                    death of Timur Shah in 1793 the throne was left to be contended for by his sons,
                    whose adventurous enterprises and varied fortunes form a romantic page in
                    Oriental history. In 1818 the Sikhs advanced into the valley and overran the
                    whole district to the foot of the hills; and the country continued to be ravaged
                    by them until it at last fell into their hands, when they ruled it with their
                    usual severity. In 1848 the district became an integral portion of British
                    India, and, except for its connexion with the mutiny in 1857, there is little
                    else of importance to notice.</p>
