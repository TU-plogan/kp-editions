                    (1658-1719), founder of the Bank of England, projector of the Darien scheme, and
                    a voluminous writer on subjects connected with finance, was born in April 1658
                    at the farmhouse of Skipmyre, parish of Tinwald, Dumfriesshire. His parents
                    occupied the farm there, and with them he resided till he was about seventeen. A
                    desire to escape the religious persecution then raging in Scotland, and a wish
                    to find a wider field for his energies than a poor district of a poor country
                    afforded, led him southward. He went through England with a pedlar’s pack
                    (“wherof the print may be seen, if he be alive,” says a pamphleteer in 1700),
                    settled for some time in Bristol, and then proceeded to America. There he lived
                    chiefly in the Bahamas, and is said by some to have been a predicant or
                    preacher, and by others to have been a buccaneer. The truth is that his
                    intellectual and moral superiority to the majority of the British settlers
                    naturally caused his selection as their spiritual guide, whilst his intense
                    eagerness for information led to intercourse with the buccaneers, from whom
                    alone much of the information he wanted could be had. It was here he formed that
                    vast design which is known in history as the Darien scheme. On his return to
                    England he was unable to induce the Government of James II. to engage in his
                    plan. He went to the Continent and pressed it in Hamburg, Amsterdam, and Berlin,
                    but unsuccessfully. A countryman of his own talks of him as a well-known figure
                    “in the coffee-houses of Amsterdam” in 1687, and gives us some idea of the
                    strange impression that this thoughtfullooking foreigner produced, as with
                    fluent speech he unfolded to his astonished hearers a scheme which seemed wild
                    and dazzling as a dream of Eastern romance. On his return to London he engaged
                    in trade and rapidly amassed a considerable fortune. His activity was not
                    confined to private business. About 1690 he was occupied in the formation of the
                    Hampstead Water Company, and in 1694 he founded the Bank of England. The
                    Government of the day required money, and the country, rapidly increasing in
                    wealth, required a bank. The subscribers lent their money to the nation, and
                    this debt became the bank stock. The credit of having formulated the scheme and
                    persuaded the Government to adopt it is certainly due to Paterson. He was one of
                    the original directors, but in less than a year, in consequence of some dispute
                    with his colleagues, he withdrew from the management. He had already propounded
                    a new plan for an orphan bank (so called because the debt due to the city
                    orphans by the corporation of London was to form the stock). This, they feared,
                    might prove a dangerous rival to their own undertaking, and besides they looked
                    with considerable suspicion and dislike on this Scotsman whose brain teemed with
                    new plans in constant succession.</p>
                <p>At that time the people of the northern kingdom were engaged in considering how
                    they might share in the benefits<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n381/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0381-0360"/> of that trade which was so rapidly enriching
                    their southern neighbours. Paterson embraced the opportunity thus offered. He
                    removed to Edinburgh, unfolded his Darien scheme, and soon had the whole nation
                    in favour of it. He, it is supposed, drew up the Act of 1695 which formed the
                    “Company of Scotland trading to Africa and the Indies.” This company, he
                    arranged, should establish a settlement on the isthmus of Darien, and “thus hold
                    the key of the commerce of the world.” There was to be free trade, the ships of
                    all nations were to find shelter in this harbour not yet erected, differences of
                    race or religion were to be made nothing of; but a small tribute was to be paid
                    to the company, and this and other advantages would so act that, at one supreme
                    stroke, Scotland was to be changed from one of the poorest to one of the richest
                    of nations.</p>
                <p>On the 26th of July 1698 the first ships of the expedition set sail “amidst the
                    tears and prayers and praises of relatives and friends and countrymen.” Some
                    financial transactions in which Paterson was concerned, and in which, though he
                    had acted with perfect honesty, the company had lost, prevented his nomination
                    to a post of importance. He accompanied the expedition as a private individual,
                    and was obliged to look idly on whilst what his enemies called his “golden
                    dream” faded away indeed like the “baseless fabric of a vision” before his eyes.
                    His wife died, and he was seized with a dangerous illness, “of which, as I
                    afterwards found,” he says, “trouble of mind was not the least cause thereof.”
                    One who knew him in this evil time tells us “he hath been so mightily concerned
                    in this sad disaster, so that he looks now more like a skeleton than a man.”
                    Still weak and helpless, and yet protesting to the last against the abandonment
                    of Darien, he was carried on board ship, and, after a stormy and terrible
                    voyage, he and the remnant of the ill-fated band reached home in December
                    1699.</p>
                <p>In his native air Paterson soon recovered some of his strength, and immediately
                    his fertile and eager mind was at work ón new schemes. First he did all he could
                    to prevent the Darien scheme already engaged in from being finally abandoned,
                    then he prepared an elaborate plan for developing Scottish resources by means of
                    a council of trade, and then he tried to induce King William to enter on a new
                    Darien expedition. About the beginning of the century he removed to London, and
                    here by conferences with statesmen, by writing, and by personal persuasion
                    helped on the Union, of which his far-reaching mind enabled him; perhaps better
                    than any other man then living, to see the advantages. At the Union one of the
                    last acts of the Scottish parliament was to recommend him to the consideration
                    of Her Majesty Queen Anne for all he had done and suffered. The united
                    parliament, to which he was returned as a member for the Dumfries burghs, though
                    he never took his seat, decided that his claim should be attended to, but it was
                    not till 1715 that an indemnity of £18,241 was ordered to be paid him. Even then
                    he found considerable difficulty in obtaining his due. His last years were spent
                    in Queen Square, Westminster, but he removed from his house, though probably to
                    some other part of London, shortly before his death, which happened 22d January
                    1719.</p>
                <p>As many as twenty-two works, all of them anonymous, are attributed to Paterson.
                    These are classified by Bannister under six heads, as dealing with (1) finance,
                    (2) legislative union, (3) colonial enterprise, (4) trade, (5) administration,
                    (6) various social and political questions. Of these the following deserve
                    special notice. (1) <hi rend="italic">Proposals and reasons for constituting a
                    Council of Trade</hi> (Edinburgh, 1701).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This work was attributed to John Law (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Law,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 367, note), who certainly borrowed some
                    of his ideas from it. To Law’s “system” Paterson was strongly opposed, and it
                    was chiefly due to his influence that it made no way in Scotland.</p></note>
                    This was a plan to develop the resources of his country. A council, consisting
                    of a president and twelve members, was to be appointed. It was to have a revenue
                    collected from a duty on sales, lawsuits, successions, &amp;c. With these funds
                    the council was to set the Darien scheme going again, to buil&lt;l workhouses,
                    to employ, relieve, and maintain the poor, and to encourage manufactures and
                    fisheries. It was to give loans -without interest to companies and shippers, it
                    was to remove monopolies, it was to construct all sorts of vast public works.
                    Encouragement was to be given to foreign Protestants and Jews to settle in the
                    kingdom, gold and silver were to be coined free of charge, and money was to be
                    kept up to its nominal standard. All export duties were to be abolished and
                    import regulated on a new plan. By means like these Paterson believed the
                    disasters lately undergone would be more than retrieved. (2) <hi rend="italic">A
                    proposal to plant a colony in Darien to protect the Indians against Spain, and
                    to open the trade of South A merica to all nations</hi> (1701). This was a
                    proposal to King William to establish the Darien scheme on a new and broader
                    basis. It points out in detail the advantages to be gained: free trade would be
                    advanced over all the world, and Great Britain would derive great profits. (3)
                    <hi rend="italic">Wednesday Club dialogues upon the Union</hi> (London, 1706).
                    These were imaginary conversations in a club in the city of London about the
                    union -with Scotland. Paterson’s real opinions were put into the mouth of a
                    speaker called May. The result of the discussion is that till the Darien
                    business all Scots were for the Union, and that they were so still if reasonable
                    terms were offered. Such terms ought to include an incorporating union with
                    equal taxes, freedom of trade, and a proportionate representation in parliament.
                    A union with Ireland “as likewise with other dominions the queen either hath or
                    shall have” is proposed. (4) Along with this another discussion of the same
                    imaginary body, <hi rend="italic">An inquiry into the state of the Union of
                    Great Britain and the trade thereof</hi> (1717), may be taken. This was a
                    consideration of the consequences o'f the Union, which, now “that its honeymoon
                    was past,” was not giving satisfaction in some quarters, and also a discussion
                    as to the best means of paying off the national debt,—a subject which occupied a
                    great deal of Paterson’s attention during the later years of his life.</p>
                <p>Paterson’s plans were vast and magnificent, but it is a great mistake to suppose
                    that he was a mere dreamer. Every one of his designs was worked out into minute
                    detail,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The books of the
                    Darien company were kept after a new and very much improved plan, which it is
                    believed was an invention of Paterson’s (Burton’s <hi rend="italic">Hist.
                    Scot.,</hi> vol. viii. p. 36, note).</p></note> and every one was possible and
                    practical. The Bank of England was a stupendous success. The Darien expedition
                    failed from hostile attacks and bad arrangements. But the original design was
                    that the English and Dutch should be partakers in it, and, if this had occurred,
                    and the arrangements, against many of which Paterson in letter after letter in
                    vain protested, had been different, Darien might have been to Britain another
                    India, whose history was shadowed by the memory of no wrong.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The revival of the Darien
                    scheme in our own day is a signal proof of Paterson’s foresight. Of a canal he
                    says: “From Venta Crucis to Panama upon the South Sea there is by land about
                    eight short French leagues, six whereof is so level that a canal might easily be
                    cut through, and the other two leagues are not so very high and impracticable
                    ground, but that a cut might likewise be made were it in these places of the
                    world, but considering the present circumstances of things in those it would not
                    be so easy” (<hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> Bannister’s ed., vol. i. p.
                    140).</p></note> Paterson was a zealous almost a fanatic free-trader long before
                    Adam Smith was born, and his remarks on finance and his argument against an
                    inconvertible paper - currency, though then novel, now hold the place of
                    economic axioms. In his description of the “merchants in an extended sense”
                    Paterson has drawn his own character for us. They are those “whose education,
                    genius, general scope of knowledge of the laws, governments, polity, and
                    management of the several countries of the world allow them sufficient room and
                    opportunity not only to understand trade as abstractly taken but in its greatest
                    extent, and who accordingly are zealous promoters of free and open trade, and
                    consequently of liberty of conscience, general naturalization, unions, and
                    annexions.”</p>
                <p>Paterson’s works are well written, and the form as well as the matter are
                    excellent. As already noticed, they are all anonymous, and they are quite
                    impersonal, for few men who have written so much ever said so little about
                    themselves. There is no reference to the scurrilous attacks made on him. They
                    are the true products of a noble and disinterested as well as vigorous mind.
                    Paterson was not rewarded for his labours. The Bank of England was a great
                    success, but he lost rather than gained by it. In the Darien scheme he was
                    ruined, and this ruin he never quite retrieved. The credit of his other schemes
                    has been usually ascribed to other and inferior men. There is thus singular
                    fitness in the motto “sic vos non vobis” inscribed under the only portrait of
                    him that we possess.</p>
