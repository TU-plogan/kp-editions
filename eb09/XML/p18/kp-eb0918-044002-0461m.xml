                <p><label type="entry">PAYMENT</label>, in English law, is one of the modes of
                    performance of an obligation, and consists in the discharge of a sum due in
                    money or the equivalent of money. In order that payment may extinguish the
                    obligation it is necessary that it should be made at a proper time and place, in
                    a proper manner, and by and to a proper person. If the sum due be not paid at
                    the appointed time, the creditor is entitled to sue the debtor at once, in spite
                    of the readiness of the latter to pay at a later date, subject, in the case of
                    bills and notes, -to the allowance of days of grace. In the common case of sale
                    of goods for ready money, a right to the goods vests at once upon sale in the
                    purchaser, a right to the price in the seller; but the seller need not part with
                    the goods till payment of the price.</p>
                <p>Payment may be made at any time of the day upon which it falls due, except in the
                    case of mercantile contracts, where the creditor is not bound to wait for
                    payment beyond the usual hours of mercantile business. If no place be fixed for
                    payment, the debtor is bound to find, or to use reasonable means to find, the
                    creditor, unless the latter be abroad. Payment must be made in money which is a
                    legal tender (see below), unless the creditor waive his right to payment in
                    money by accepting some other mode of payment, as a negotiable instrument or a
                    transfer of credit. If the payment be by negotiable instrument, the instrument
                    may operate either as an absolute or as a conditional discharge. In the ordinary
                    case of payment by cheque the creditor accepts the cheque conditionally upon its
                    being honoured; if it be dishonoured, he is remitted to his original rights. The
                    creditor has a right to payment in full, and is not bound to accept part payment
                    unless by special agreement. Part payment is sufficient to take the debt out of
                    the Statute of Limitations. It is a technical rule of English law that payment
                    of a smaller sum, even though accepted by the creditor in full satisfaction, is
                    no defence to a subsequent action for the debt. The reason of this rule seems to
                    be that there is no consideration for the creditor foregoing his right to full
                    payment. In order that payment of a smaller sum may satisfy the debt, it must be
                    made by a person other than the person originally liable, or at an earlier date,
                    or at another place, or in another manner than the date, place, or manner
                    contracted for. Thus a bill or note may be satisfied by money to a less amount,
                    or a money debt by a bill or note to a less amount; a debt of £100 cannot be
                    discharged by payment of £90 (unless the creditor execute a release under seal),
                    though it may be discharged by payment of £10 before the day appointed, or by a
                    bill for £10. Payment must in general be made by the debtor or his agent, or by
                    a stranger to the contract with the assent of the debtor. If payment be made by
                    a stranger without the assent of the debtor, it seems uncertain how far English
                    law regards such payment as a satisfaction of the debt. If the debtor ratify the
                    payment, it then undoubtedly becomes a satisfaction. Payment must be made to the
                    creditor or his agent. A <hi rend="italic">Iona fide</hi> payment to an apparent
                    agent may be good, though he has in fact no authority to receive it. Such
                    payment will usually be good where the authority of the agent has been
                    countermanded without notice to the debtor. The fact of payment may be presumed,
                    as from lapse of time. Thus payment of a testator’s debts is generally presumed
                    after twenty years. A written receipt is only presumptive and not conclusive
                    evidence of payment. If payment be made under a mistake of fact, it may be
                    recovered, but it is otherwise if it be made under a mistake of law, for it is a
                    maxim of law that <hi rend="italic">ignorantia legis neminem excusat.</hi> Money
                    paid under compulsion of law, even though not due, cannot generally be recovered
                    where there has been no fraud or extortion.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Appropriation of Payments.—</hi> Where the creditor has two
                    debts due to him from the same debtor on distinct accounts, the general law as
                    to the appropriation of payments made by the debtor is that the debtor is
                    entitled to apply the payments to such account as he thinks fit. <hi
                    rend="italic">Solvitur</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">modum
                    solventis.</hi> In default of appropriation by the debtor the creditor is
                    entitled to determine the application of the sums paid, and may appropriate them
                    even to the discharge of debts barred by the Statute of Limitations. In default
                    of appropriation by either debtor or creditor, the law implies an appropriation
                    of the earlier payments to the earlier debts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Payment into and out of Court.—</hi> Money is generally paid
                    into court to abide the result of pending litigation, as in interpleader
                    proceedings, or where litigation has already begun, as security for costs or as
                    a defence or partial defence to a claim. Payment into court does not necessarily
                    (except in actions for libel and slander) operate as an admission of liability.
                    Money may sometimes be paid into court where no litigation is pending, as under
                    the Trustee Relief Act, 1847. Payment of money out of court is obtained by the
                    order of the court upon petition or summons or otherwise, or simply on the
                    request or the written authority of the person entitled to it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Payment of Wages.—</hi> By the “Truck Act,” 1 and 2 Will. IV.
                    c. 37 (which applies to Great Britain), the payment of wages to most kinds of
                    labourers and workmen otherwise than in coin is prohibited. This Act does not
                    apply to domestic or agricultural servants. The provisions of the Act are
                    extended to the hosiery trade by 37 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n462/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0462-0441"/> and 38 Vict. c. 48. Payment of wages in
                    public-houses (except in the case of domestic servants) is illegal by the
                    combined effect of 35 and 36 Vict. cc. 76 and 77, and 46 and 47 Vict. c. 31.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tender.</hi> —This is payment duly proffered to a creditor, but
                    rendered abortive by the act of the creditor. In order that a tender may be good
                    in law it must as a rule be made under circumstances which would make it a good
                    payment if accepted. The money tendered must be a legal tender, unless the
                    creditor waive his right to a legal tender, as where he objects to the amount
                    and not the mode of tender. Bank of England notes are legal tender for any sum
                    above £5, except by the bank itself, 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 98, s. 6. Gold is
                    legal tender to any amount, silver up to 40s., bronze up to Is., 33 and 34 Vict.
                    c. 10. By 29 and 30 Vict. c. 65 the gold coinage of colonial mints may be made
                    legal tender by proclamation. Under the powers of this Act the gold coinage of
                    the Sydney mint has been declared to be legal tender. The effect of tender is
                    not to discharge the debt, but to enable the debtor, when sued for the debt, to
                    pay the money into court and to get judgment for the costs of his defence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> The law of Scotland as to payment agrees in
                    most points with that of England. Where a debt is constituted by writ payment
                    cannot be proved by witnesses; where it is not constituted by writ, payment to
                    the amount of £100 Scots may be proved by witnesses; beyond that amount it can
                    only be proved by writ or oath of party. The term tender seems to be strictly
                    applied only to a judicial offer of a sum for damages and expenses made by the
                    defender during litigation, not to an offer made by the debtor before
                    litigation. Bank of England notes are not a legal tender in Scotland, 8 and 9
                    Vict. c. 38, s. 15, or in Ireland, 8 and 9 Vict. c. 37, s. 6.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> In the United States the law as a rule
                    does not materially differ from English law. In some States, however, money may
                    be recovered, even when it has been paid under a mistake of law. The question of
                    legal tender has been an important one. In 1862 Congress passed an Act making
                    treasury notes legal tender. After much litigation, the Supreme Court of the
                    United States finally decided in 1870 in favour of the constitutionality of this
                    Act, both as to contracts made before and after it was passed (see 1 <hi
                    rend="italic">Kent's Comm.,</hi> p. 252). These notes are legal tender for all
                    purposes except duties on imports and interest on the public debt. All gold
                    coins, silver dollars, and silver coins below the value of a dollar coined
                    before 1854 are legal tender to any amount. Silver coins below the value of a
                    dollar of 1854 and subsequent years are legal tender for sums not exceeding five
                    dollars. Silver three-cent pieces of the dates 1851 to 1853 are legal tender for
                    sums not exceeding thirty cents, those of subsequent years for sums not
                    exceeding five dollars. Cents and foreign coins are not legal tender. Postage
                    currency is not legal tender for private debts (Bouvier’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Law</hi><hi rend="italic">Dich,</hi> “Legal Tender”). It falls exclusively
                    within the jurisdiction of Congress to declare paper or copper money a legal
                    tender. By the constitution of the United States, “no State . . . shall make
                    anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts” (art. i. s.
                    10).</p>
