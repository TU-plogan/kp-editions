                <p><label type="entry">PHILOLOGY</label><hi> PART</hi> I.—SCIENCE OF LANGUAGE IN
                    GENERAL.</p>
                <p><hi> PHILOLOGY</hi> is the generally accepted comprehensive name for the study of
                    the word; it designates that branch of knowledge which deals with human speech,
                    and with all that speech discloses as to the nature and history of man.
                    Philology has two principal divisions, corresponding to the two uses of “word”
                    or “speech,” as signifying either what is said or the language in which it is
                    said, as either the thought expressed—which, when recorded, takes the form of
                    literature—or the instrumentality of its expression: these divisions are the
                    literary and the linguistic. Not all study of literature, indeed, is
                    philological: as when, for example, the records of the ancient Chinese are
                    ransacked for notices of astronomical or meteorological phenomena, or the
                    principles of geometry are learned from the text-book of a Greek sage; while, on
                    the other hand, to study Ptolemy and Euclid for the history of the sciences
                    represented by them is philological more than scientific. Again, the study of
                    language itself has its literary side: as when the vocabulary of a community
                    (say of the ancient Indo-Europeans or Aryans) is taken as a document from which
                    to infer the range and grade of knowledge of its speakers, their circumstances,
                    and their institutions. The two divisions thus do not admit of absolute
                    distinction and separation, though for some time past tending toward greater
                    independence. The literary is the older of the two; it even occupied until
                    recently the whole field, since the scientific study of language itself has
                    arisen only within the present century. Till then, literary philology included
                    linguistic, as a merely subordinate and auxiliary part, the knowledge of a
                    language being the necessary key to a knowledge of the literature written in
                    that language. When, therefore, instead of studying each language by itself for
                    the sake of its own literature, men began to compare one language with another,
                    in order to bring to light their relationships, their structures, their
                    histories, the name “comparative philology” naturally enough suggested itself
                    and came into use for the new method; and this name, awkward and trivial though
                    it may be, has become so firmly fixed in English usage that it can be only
                    slowly, if at all, displaced. Continental usage (especially German) tends more
                    strongly than English to restrict the name philology to its older office, and to
                    employ for the recent branch of knowledge a specific term, like those that have
                    gained more or less currency with us also: as glottic, glossology, linguistics,
                    linguistic science, science of language, and the like. It is not a question of
                    absolute propriety or correctness, since the word philology is in its nature
                    wide enough to imply all language-study, of whatever kind; it is one, rather, of
                    the convenient distinction of methods that have grown too independent and
                    important to be any longer well included under a common name.</p>
                <p>Philology, in all its departments, began and grew up as classical; the history of
                    our civilization made the study of Greek and Latin long the exclusive, still
                    longer the predominant and regulating, occupation of secular scholarship. The
                    Hebrew and its literature were held apart, as something of a different order, as
                    sacred. It was not imagined that any tongue to which culture and literature did
                    not lend importance was worthy of serious attention from scholars. The first
                    essays in comparison, likewise, were made upon the classical tongues, and were
                    as erroneous in method and fertile in false conclusions as was to be expected,
                    considering the narrowness of view and the controlling prejudices of those who
                    made them; and the admission of Hebrew to the comparison only added to the
                    confusion. The change which this century has seen has been a part of the general
                    scientific movement of the age, which has brought about the establishment of so
                    many new branches of knowledge, both historical and physical, by the abandonment
                    of shackling prejudices, the freedom of inquiry, the recognition of the dignity
                    of all knowledge, the wide-reaching assemblage of facts and their objective
                    comparison, and the resulting constant improvement of method. Literary philology
                    has had its full share of advantage from this movement; but linguistic philology
                    has been actually created by it out of the crude observations and wild
                    deductions of earlier times, as truly as chemistry out of alchemy, or geology
                    out of diluvianism. It is unnecessary here to follow out the details of the
                    development; but we may well refer to the decisive influence of one discovery,
                    the decisive action of one scholar. It was the discovery of the special
                    relationship of the Aryan or Indo-European languages, depending in great measure
                    upon the introduction of the Sanskrit as a term in their comparison, and
                    demonstrated and worked out by the German scholar Bopp, that founded the science
                    of linguistic philology. While there is abundant room for further improvement,
                    it yet appears that the grand features of philologie study, in all its
                    departments, are now so distinctly drawn that no revolution of its methods, but
                    only their modification in minor respects, is henceforth probable. How and for
                    what purposes to investigate the literature of any people (philology in the more
                    proper sense), combining the knowledge thus obtained with that derived from
                    other sources; how to study and set forth the material and structure and
                    combinations of a language (grammar), or of a body of related languages
                    (comparative grammar); how to co-ordinate and interpret the general phenomena of
                    language, as variously illustrated in the infinitely varying facts of different
                    tongues, so as to exhibit its nature as a factor in human history, and its
                    methods of life and growth (linguistic science),—these are what philology
                    teaches. The first two subjects are mainly disposed of in this work in the
                    various articles devoted to countries and races, with their literatures and
                    dialects; the last was briefly touched upon in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Anthropology,</hi> but requires fuller treatment here, along with a general
                    view of the classification of languages, as thus far effected.</p>
                <p>The study of language is a division of the general science of anthropology, and
                    is akin to all the rest in respect of its objects and its methods. Man as we now
                    see him is a twofold being: in part the child of nature, as to his capacities
                    and desires, his endowments of mind and body; in part the creature of education,
                    by training in the knowledge, the arts, the social conduct, of which his
                    predecessors have gained possession. And the problem of anthropology is this:
                    how natural man has become cultivated man; how a being thus endowed by nature
                    should have begun and carried on the processes of acquisition which have brought
                    him to his present state. The results of his predecessors’ labout <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> s are not transmuted for his benefit into natural
                    instincts, in language or in anything else. The child of the most civilized
                    race, if isolated and left wholly to his own resources, aided by neither the
                    example nor the instruction of his fellows, would no more speak the speech of
                    his ancestors than he would build their houses, fashion their clothes, practise
                    any of their arts, inherit their knowledge or wealth. In fact, he would <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n801/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0801-0766"/> possess no language, no arts, no wealth, but
                    would have to go to work to acquire them, by the same processes which began to
                    win them for the first human beings. One advantage he would doubtless enjoy: the
                    descendant of a cultivated race has an enhanced aptitude for the reception of
                    cultivation; he is more cultivable; and this is an element that has to be
                    allowed for in comparing present conditions with past, as influencing the rate
                    of progress, but nothing more. In all other respects, it is man with the
                    endowments which we now find him possessed of, but destitute of the gradually
                    accumulated results of the exercise of his faculties, whose progress we have to
                    explain. And it is, as a matter of necessity, by studying recent observable
                    modes of acquisition, and transferring them, with due allowance for different
                    circumstances, to the more primitive periods, that the question of first
                    acquisition or origin is to be solved, for language as for tools, for arts, for
                    family and social organization, and the rest. There is just as much, and just as
                    little, reason for assuming miraculous interference and aid in one of these
                    departments as in another. If men have been left to themselves to make and
                    improve instruments, to form and perfect modes of social organization, by
                    implanted powers directed by natural desires, and under the pressure of
                    circumstances, then also to make and change the signs that constitute their
                    speech. All expressions, as all instruments, are at present, and have been
                    through the known past, made and changed by the men who use them; the same will
                    have been the case in the unknown or prehistoric past. And we command now enough
                    of the history of language, with the processes of its life and growth, to
                    determine with confidence its mode of origin—within certain limits, as will
                    appear below.</p>
                <p>It is beyond all question, in the first place, that the desire of communication
                    was the only force directly impelling men to the production of language. Man’s
                    sociality, his disposition to band together with his fellows, for lower and for
                    higher purposes, for mutual help and for sympathy, is one of his most
                    fundamental characteristics. To understand those about one and to be understood
                    by them is now, and must have been from the very beginning, a prime necessity of
                    human existence; we cannot conceive of man, even in his most undeveloped state,
                    as without the recognition of it. Communication is still the universally
                    recognized office of speech, and to the immense majority of speakers the only
                    one; the common man knows no other, and can only with difficulty and imperfectly
                    be brought to see that there is any other · of the added distinctness and reach
                    of mental action which the possession of such an instrumentality gives him, he
                    is wholly unconscious: and it is obvious that what the comparatively cultivated
                    being of to-day can hardly be made to realize, can never have acted upon the
                    first men as a motive to action. It may perhaps be made a question which of the
                    two uses of speech, communication or the facilitation of thought, is the higher;
                    there can be no question, at any rate, that the former is the broader and the
                    more fundamental. That the kind and degree of thinking which we do nowadays
                    would be impossible without language-signs is true enough · but so also it would
                    be impossible without written signs. That there was a time when men had to do
                    what mental work they could without the help of writing, as an art not yet
                    devised, we have no difficulty in realizing, because the art is of comparatively
                    recent device, and there are still communities enough that are working without
                    it; it is much harder to realize that there was a time when speaking also was an
                    art not yet attained, and that men had to carry on their rude and rudimentary
                    thinking without it. Writing too was devised for conscious purposes of
                    communication only; its esoteric uses, like those of speech, were at first
                    unsuspected, and incapable of acting as an inducement; they were not noticed
                    until made experience of, and then only by those who look beneath the surface of
                    things. There is no analogy closer and more instructive than this, between
                    speech and writing. But analogies are abundant elsewhere in the history of human
                    development. Everywhere it is the lower and more obvious inducements that are
                    first effective, and that lead gradually to the possession of what serves and
                    stimulates higher wants. All the arts and industries have grown out of men’s
                    effort to get enough to eat and protection against cold and heat—just as
                    language, with all its uses, out of men’s effort to communicate with their
                    fellows. As a solitary man now would never form even the beginnings of speech,
                    as one separated from society unlearns his speech by disuse and becomes
                    virtually dumb, so early man, with all his powers, would never have acquired
                    speech, save as to those powers was added sociality with the needs it brought.
                    We might conceive of a solitary man as housing and dressing himself, devising
                    rude tools, and thus lifting himself a step from wildness toward cultivation;
                    but we cannot conceive of him as ever learning to talk. Recognition of the
                    impulse to communication as the efficient cause of language-making is an element
                    of primary importance in the theory of the origin of language. No one who either
                    leaves it out of account or denies it will, however ingenious and entertaining
                    his speculations, cast any real light on the earliest history of speech. To
                    inquire under what peculiar circumstances, in connexion with what mode of
                    individual or combined action, a first outburst of oral expression may have
                    taken place, is, on the other hand, quite futile. The needed circumstances were
                    always present when human beings were in one another’s society; there was an
                    incessant drawing-on to attempts at mutual understanding which met with
                    occasional, and then ever more frequent and complete success. There inheres in
                    most reasoning upon this subject the rooted assumption, governing opinion even
                    when not openly upheld or consciously made, that conceptions have real natural
                    names, and that in a state of nature these will somehow break forth and reveal
                    themselves under favouring circumstances. The falsity of such a view is shown by
                    our whole further discussion.</p>
                <p>The character of the motive force to speech determined the character of the
                    beginnings of speech. That was first signified which was most capable of
                    intelligible signification, not that which was first in order of importance, as
                    judged by any standard which we can apply to it, or first in order of
                    conceptional development. All attempts to determine the first spoken signs by
                    asking what should have most impressed the mind of primitive man are and must be
                    failures. It was the exigencies and possibilities of practical life, in
                    conditions quite out of reach of our distinct conception, that prescribed the
                    earliest signs of communication. So, by a true and instructive analogy, the
                    beginnings of writing are rude depictions of visible objects; it is now
                    thoroughly recognized that no alphabet, of whatever present character, can have
                    originated in any other way; everything else is gradually arrived at from
                    that—as, indeed, in the ingeniously shaping hands of man, from any central body
                    of signs, though but of small extent, all else is attainable by processes of
                    analogy and adaptation and transfer. Now what is it that is directly signifiable
                    in the world about us? Evidently, the separate acts and qualities of sensible
                    objects, and nothing else. In writing, or signification to the eye, the first
                    element is the rude depiction of the outline of an object, or of that one of the
                    sum of its characteristic qualities which the eye takes note of and the hand is
                    capable of intelligibly reproducing; from that the mind understands the whole
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n802/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0802-0767"/> complex object itself, and then whatever further
                    may in the circumstances of its use be suggested by it. So, for example, the
                    picture of a tree signifies primarily a tree, then perhaps wood, something made
                    of wood, and so on; that of a pair of outstretched wings signifies secondarily
                    flight, then soaring, height, and whatever else these may lead to. No concrete
                    thing is signifiable in its totality, or otherwise than by a facile analysis of
                    its constituent qualities, and a selection of the one which is both sufficiently
                    characteristic in itself and capable of being called up by a sign before the
                    mind addressed.</p>
                <p>And what quality shall be selected depends in great measure upon the
                    instrumentality used for its signification. Of such instrumentalities, men are
                    possessed of a considerable variety. We must leave out of account that of
                    depiction, as just instanced, because its employment belongs to a much more
                    advanced state of cultivation, and leads the way to the invention not of speech
                    but of the analogous and auxiliary art of writing. There remain gesture, or
                    changes of position of the various parts of the body, especially of the most
                    mobile parts, the arms and hands; grimace, or the changes of expression of the
                    features of the countenance (in strictness, a variety of the preceding); and
                    utterance, or the production of audible sound. It cannot be doubted that, in the
                    first stages of communicative expression, all these three were used together,
                    each for the particular purposes which it was best calculated to serve. The
                    nearest approach to such action that is now possible is when two persons, wholly
                    ignorant of one another’s speech, meet and need to communicate— an imperfect
                    correspondence, because each is trained to habits of expression, and works
                    consciously, and with the advantage of long experience, towards making himself
                    understood <hi rend="italic">; yet</hi> it is good for its main purpose. What
                    they do, to reach mutual comprehension, is like what the first speechless men,
                    unconsciously and infinitely more slowly, learned to do: face, hands, body,
                    voice, are all put to use. It is altogether probable that gesture at first
                    performed the principal part, even to such extent that the earliest human
                    language may be said to have been a language of gesture-signs; indeed, there
                    exist at the present day such gesture-languages, as those in use between roving
                    tribes of different speech that from time to time meet one another (the most
                    noted example is that of the gesture-language, of a very considerable degree of
                    development, of the prairie tribes of American Indians); or such signs as are
                    the natural resort of those who by deafness are cut off from ordinary spoken
                    intercourse with their fellows. Yet there never can have been a stage or period
                    in which all the three instrumentalities were not put to use together. In fact,
                    they are still all used together; that is even now an ineffective speaking to
                    which grimace and gesture (“action,” as Demosthenes called them) are not added
                    as enforcers; and the lower the grade of development and culture of a language,
                    the more important, even for intelligibility, is their addition. But voice has
                    won to itself the chief and almost exclusive part in communication, insomuch
                    that we call all communication “language” <hi rend="italic">(i.e., “</hi>
                    tonguiness”) just as a race of mutes might call it “handiness,” and talk (by
                    gesture) of a handiness of grimace. This is not in the least because of any
                    closer connexion of the thinking apparatus with the muscles that act to produce
                    audible sounds than with those that act to produce visible motions; not because
                    there are natural uttered names for conceptions, any more than natural gestured
                    names. It is simply a case of “survival of the fittest,” or analogous to the
                    process by which iron has become the exclusive material of swords, and gold and
                    silver of money: because, namely, experience has shown this to be the material
                    best adapted to this special use. The advantages of voice are numerous and
                    obvious. There is first its economy, as employing a mechanism that is available
                    for little else, and leaving free for other purposes those indispensable
                    instruments the hands. Then there is its superior perceptibleness: its nice
                    differences impress themselves upon the sense at a distance at which visible
                    motions become indistinct; they are not hidden by intervening objects; they
                    allow the eyes of the listener as well as the hands of the speaker to be
                    employed in other useful work; they are as plain in the dark as in the light;
                    and they are able to catch and command the attention of one who is not to be
                    reached in any other way. We might add as the third advantage a superior
                    capability of variation and combination on the part of spoken sounds; but this
                    is not to be insisted on, inasmuch as we hardly know what a gesture-language
                    might have become if men’s ingenuity in expression had been expended through all
                    time upon its elaboration; and the superiority, however real, can hardly have
                    been obvious enough to serve as a motive: certainly, there are spoken languages
                    now existing whose abundance of resources falls short of what is attainable by
                    gesture. Oral utterance is the form which expression has inevitably taken, the
                    sum of man’s endowments being what it is; but it would be a mistake to suppose
                    that a necessity of any other kind is involved in their relation. The
                    fundamental conditions of speech are man’s grade of intellectual power and his
                    social instinct; these being given, his expression follows, availing itself of
                    what means it finds best suited to its purpose; if voice had been wanting, it
                    would have taken the next best. So, in certain well-known cases, a marked
                    artistic gift, on the part of individuals deprived of the use of hands, has
                    found means of exercise in the feet instead. But men in general have hands,
                    instruments of exquisite tact and power, to serve the needs of their intellect;
                    and so voice also, to provide and use the tools of thought; there is no error in
                    maintaining that the voice is given us for speech, if only we do not proceed to
                    draw from such a <hi rend="italic">dictum</hi> false conclusions as to the
                    relation between thought and utterance. Man is created with bodily instruments
                    suited to do the work prescribed by his mental capacities; therein lies the
                    harmony of his endowment.</p>
                <p>It is through imitation that all signification becomes directly suggestive. The
                    first written signs are (as already noticed) the depictions of visible objects,
                    and could be nothing else; and, by the same necessity, the first uttered signs
                    were the imitations of audible sounds. To reproduce any sound of which the
                    originating cause or the circumstances of production are known, brings up of
                    course before the conception that sound, along with the originator, or
                    circumstances of origination, or whatever else may be naturally associated with
                    it. There are two special directions in which this mode of sign-making is
                    fruitful: imitation of the sounds of external nature (as the cries of animals,
                    and the noises of inanimate objects when in motion or acted on by other objects)
                    and imitation of human sounds. The two are essentially one in principle,
                    although by some held apart, or even opposed to each other, as respectively the
                    imitative or onomatopoetic and the exclamatory or interjectional beginnings of
                    speech; they differ only in their spheres of significance, the one being
                    especially suggestive of external objects, the other of inward feelings. There
                    are natural human tones, indicative of feeling, as there are natural gestures,
                    poses, modes of facial expression, which either are immediately intelligible to
                    us (as is the warning cry of the hen to the day-old chicken), or have their
                    value taught us by our earliest experiences. If we hear a cry of joy or a shriek
                    of pain, a laugh or a groan, we need no explanation in words to tell us what it
                    signifies, any lucre than when we see a sad face or a drooping attitude. So also
                    the characteristic cry <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n803/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0803-0768"/> or act of anything outside ourselves, if even
                    rudely imitated, is to us an effective reminder and awakener of conception. We
                    have no reason to question that such were the suggestions of the beginnings of
                    uttered expression. The same means have made their contributions to language
                    even down to our own day; we call words so produced “onomatopoetic” <hi
                    rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> “name-making” ), after the example of the Greeks, who
                    could not conceive that actually new additions to language should be made in any
                    other way. What and how wide the range of the imitative principle, and what
                    amount of language-signs it was capable of yielding, is a subject for special
                    investigation—or rather, of speculation, since anything like exact knowledge in
                    regard to it will never be attained; and the matter is one of altogether
                    secondary consequence; it is sufficient for our purpose that enough could
                    certainly be won in this way to serve as the effective germs of speech.</p>
                <p>All the natural means of expression are still at our command, and are put to more
                    or less use by us, and their products are as intelligible to us as they have
                    been to any generation of our ancestors, back to the very first. They are
                    analogous also to the means of communication of the lower animals; this, so far
                    as we know, consists in observing and interpreting one another’s movements and
                    natural sounds (where there are such). But language is a step beyond this, and
                    different from it. To make language, the intent to signify must be present. A
                    cry wrung out by pain, or a laugh of amusement, though intelligible, is not
                    language; either of them, if consciously reproduced in order to signify to
                    another pain or pleasure, is language. So a cough within hearing of any one
                    attracts his attention; but to cough, or to produce any other sound, articulate
                    or inarticulate, for the purpose of attracting another’s attention, is to commit
                    an act of languagemaking, such as in human history preceded in abundance the
                    establishment of definite traditional signs for conceptions. Here begins to
                    appear the division between human language and all brute expression; since we do
                    not know that any animal but man ever definitely took this step. It would be
                    highly interesting to find out just how near any come to it; and to this point
                    ought to be especially directed the attention of those who are investigating the
                    communication of the lower animals in its relation to human communication. Among
                    the animals of highest intelligence that associate with man and learn something
                    of his ways, a certain amount of sign-making expressly for communication is not
                    to be denied; the dog that barks at a door because he knows that somebody will
                    come and let him in is an instance of it; perhaps, in wild life, the throwing
                    out of sentinel birds from a flock, whose warning cry shall advertise their
                    fellows of the threat of danger, is as near an approach to it as is anywhere
                    made.</p>
                <p>But the actual permanent beginnings of speech are only reached when the natural
                    basis is still further abandoned, and signs begin to be used, not because their
                    natural suggestiveness is seen in them, but by imitation, from the example of
                    others who have been observed to use the same sign for the same purpose. Then
                    for the first time the means of communication becomes something to be handed
                    down, rather than made anew by each individual; it takes on that traditional
                    character which is the essential character of all human institutions, which
                    appears not less in the forms of social organization, the details of religious
                    ceremonial, the methods of art and the arts, than in language. That all existing
                    speech, and all known recorded speech, is purely traditional, cannot at all be
                    questioned. It is proved even by the single fact that for any given conception
                    there are as many different spoken signs as there are languages—say a thousand
                    (this number is rather far within than beyond the truth), each of them
                    intelligible to him who has learned to use it and to associate it with the
                    conception to which it belongs, but unintelligible to the users of the nine
                    hundred and ninety-nine other signs, as these are all unintelligible to him;
                    unless, indeed, he learn a few of them also, even as at the beginning he learned
                    the one that he calls his own. λVhat single sign, and what set of signs, any
                    individual shall use, depends upon the community into the midst of which he is
                    cast, by birth or other circumstances, during his first years. That it does not
                    depend upon his race is demonstrated by facts the most numerous and various; the
                    African whose purity of descent is attested by every feature is found all over
                    the world speaking just that language, or jargon, into the midst of which the
                    fates of present or former slavery have brought his parents; every civilized
                    community contains elements of various lineage, combined into one by unity of
                    speech; and instances are frequent enough where whole nations speak a tongue of
                    which their ancestors knew nothing: for example, the Celtic Gauls and the
                    Germanic Normans of France speak the dialect of a geographically insignificant
                    district in central Italy, while we ourselves can hardly utter a sentence or
                    write a line without bringing in more or less of that same dialect. There is not
                    an item of any tongue of which we know anything that <hi rend="italic">is</hi>
                    “natural” expression, or to the possession of which its speaker is brought by
                    birth instead of by education; there is even very little that is traceably
                    founded on such natural expression; everywhere <hi rend="italic">θiι∏ς or</hi>
                    human attribution reigns supreme, and the original <hi rend="italic">φvσις</hi>
                    or natural significance has disappeared, and is only to be found by theoretic
                    induction (as we have found it above). It seems to some as if a name like <hi
                    rend="italic">cuckoo</hi> (one of the most striking available cases of
                    onomatopoeia) were a “natural” one; but there is just as much <hi rend="italic"
                    >θeσις</hi> in it as in any other name; it implies the observation of an
                    aggregate of qualities in a certain bird, and the selection of one among them as
                    the convenient basis of a mutual understanding when the bird is in question;
                    every animal conspicuous to us must have its designation, won in one way or
                    another; and in this case, to imitate the characteristic cry is the most
                    available way. If anything but convenience and availability were involved, all
                    our names for animals would have to be and to remain imitations of the sounds
                    they make. That the name of <hi rend="italic">cuckoo</hi> is applied also to the
                    female and young, and at other than the singing season, and then to related
                    species which do not make the same sound—all helps to show the essentially
                    conventional character of even this name. An analogous process of elimination of
                    original meaning, and reduction to the value of conventional designation merely,
                    is to be seen in every part of language, throughout its whole history. Since men
                    ceased to derive their names from signs having a natural suggestiveness, and
                    began to make them from other names already in use with an understood value,
                    every new name has had its etymology and its historical occasion— as, for
                    example, the name <hi rend="italic">quarantine</hi> from the two-score <hi
                    rend="italic">(quarantaine)</hi> of days of precautionary confinement, or <hi
                    rend="italic">volume</hi> from its being rolled up, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >book</hi> from a beech-wood staff, or <hi rend="italic">copper</hi> from
                    Cyprus, or <hi rend="italic">lunacy</hi> from a fancied influence of the moon,
                    or <hi rend="italic">finest</hi> from being an older <hi rend="italic"
                    >(πpeσβντepος)</hi> person, or <hi rend="italic">butterfly</hi> from the
                    butter-yellow colour of a certain common species: every part of our language, as
                    of every other, is full of such examples—but, when once the name is applied, it
                    belongs to that to which it is applied, and no longer to its relatives by
                    etymology; its origin is neglected,, and its form may be gradually changed
                    beyond recognition, or its meaning so far altered that comparison with the
                    original shall seem a joke or an absurdity. This is a regular and essential part
                    of the process of name-making in all human speech, and from <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n804/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0804-0769"/> the very beginning of the history of speech: in
                    fact (as pointed out above), the latter can only be said to have begun when this
                    process was successfully initiated, when uttered signs began to be, what they
                    have ever since continued to be, conventional, or dependent only on a mutual
                    understanding. Thus alone did language gain the capacity of unlimited growth and
                    development. The sphere and scope of natural expression are narrowly bounded;
                    but there is no end to the resources of conventional signmaking.</p>
                <p>It is well to point out here that this change of the basis of men’s communication
                    from natural suggestiveness to mutual understanding, and the consequent purely
                    conventional character of all human language, in its every part and particle,
                    puts an absolute line of demarcation between the latter and the means of
                    communication of all the lower animals. The two are not of the same kind, any
                    more than human society in its variety of organization is of the same kind with
                    the instinctive herding of wild cattle or swarming of insects, any more than
                    human architecture with the instinctive burrowing of the fox and nest-building
                    of the bird, any more than human industry and accumulation of capital with the
                    instinctive hoarding of bees and beavers. In all these cases alike, the action
                    of men is a result of the adaptation of means at hand to the satisfaction of
                    felt needs, or of. purposes dimly* perceived at first, but growing clearer with
                    gradually acquired experience. Man is the only being that has established
                    institutions— gradually accumulated and perfected results of the exercise of
                    powers analogous in kind to, but greatly differing in degree from, those of the
                    lower animals. The difference in degree of endowment does not constitute the
                    difference in language, it only leads to it. There was a time when all existing
                    human beings were as destitute of language as the dog; and that time would come
                    again for any number of human beings who should be cut off (if that were
                    practicable) from all instruction by their fellows: only they would at once
                    proceed to re-create language, society, and arts, by the same steps by which
                    their own remote ancestors created those which we now possess; while the dog
                    would remain what he and his ancestors have always been, a creature of very
                    superior intelligence, indeed, as compared with most, of infinite intelligence
                    as compared with many, yet incapable of rising by the acquisition of culture,
                    through the formation and development of traditional institutions. There is just
                    the same <hi rend="italic">saltus</hi> existent in the difference between man’s
                    conventional speech and the natural communication of the lower races as in that
                    between men’s forms of society and the instinctive associations of the lower
                    races; but it is no greater and no other; it is neither more absolute and
                    characteristic nor more difficult to explain. Hence those who put forward
                    language as <hi rend="italic">the</hi> distinction between man and the lower
                    animals, and those who look upon our language as the same in kind with the means
                    of communication of the lower animals, only much more complete and perfect, fail
                    alike to comprehend the true nature of language, and are alike wrong in their
                    arguments and conclusions. No addition to or multiplication of brute speech
                    would make anything like human speech; the two are separated by a step which no
                    animal below man has ever taken; and, on the other hand, language is only the
                    most conspicuous among those institutions the development of which has
                    constituted human progress, while their possession constitutes human
                    culture.</p>
                <p>With the question of the origin of man, whether or not developed out of lower
                    animal forms, intermediate to the anthropoid apes, language has nothing to do,
                    nor can its study ever be made to contribute anything to the solution of that
                    question. If there once existed creatures above the apes and below man, who were
                    extirpated by primitive man as his especial rivals in the struggle for
                    existence, or became extinct in any other way, there is no difficulty in
                    supposing them to have possessed forms of speech, more rudimentary and imperfect
                    than ours. At any rate, all existing human speech is one in the essential
                    characteristics which we have thus far noted or shall hereafter have to
                    consider, even as humanity is one in its distinction from the lower animals; the
                    differences are in non-essentials. All speech is one in the sense that every
                    human being, of whatever race he may be, is capable of acquiring any existing
                    tongue, and of using it for the same purposes for which its present possessors
                    use it, with such power and effect as his individual capacity allows, and
                    without any essential change in the mental operations carried on by means of
                    speech—even as he may acquire any other of the items of culture belonging to a
                    race not his own. The difference between employing one language and another is
                    like that between employing one instrument and another in mechanical arts; one
                    instrument may be better than another, and may enable its user to turn out
                    better work, but the human ingenuity behind both is the same, and works in the
                    same way. Nor has the making of language anything whatever to do with making man
                    what he is, as an animal species having a certain physical form and intellectual
                    endowment. Being what he is by nature, man has by the development of language
                    and other institutions become what he is by culture. His acquired culture is the
                    necessary result of his native endowment, not the contrary. The acquisition of
                    the first stumbling beginnings of a superior means of communication had no more
                    influence to raise him from a simian to a human being than the present high
                    culture and perfected speech of certain races has to lift them up to something
                    more than human, and specifically different from the races of inferior culture.
                    It cannot be too absolutely laid down that differences of language, down to the
                    possession of language at all, are differences only in respect to education and
                    culture.</p>
                <p>How long man, after he came into being such as he now is, physically and
                    intellectually, continued to communicate with imitative signs of direct
                    significance, when the production of traditional signs began, how rapidly they
                    were accumulated, and how long any traces of their imitative origin clave to
                    them—these and the like questions it is at present idle to try to answer even
                    conjecturally: just as it is to seek to determine when the first instruments
                    were used, how soon they were shaped instead of being left crude, at what epoch
                    fire was reduced to service, and so on. The stages of development and their
                    succession are clear enough; to fix their chronology will doubtless never be
                    found practicable. There is much reason for holding, as some do, that the very
                    first items of culture were hardest to win and cost most time, the rate of
                    accumulation (as in the case of capital) increasing with the amount accumulated.
                    Beyond all reasonable question, however, there was a positively long period of
                    purely imitative signs, and a longer one of mixed imitative and traditional
                    ones, the latter gradually gaining upon the former, before the present condition
                    of things was reached, when the production of new signs by imitation is only
                    sporadic and of the utmost rarity, and all language-signs besides are
                    traditional, their increase in any community being solely by variation and
                    combination, and by borrowing from other communities.</p>
                <p>Of what nature, in various respects, this earliest language-material was is
                    sufficiently clear. The signs, in the first place, were of the sort that we call
                    “roots.” By this is only meant that they were integral signs, significant in
                    their entirety, not divisible into parts, of which one signified one thing and
                    another another thing, or of which one gave the main significance, while another
                    was an added sign of kind or relation. In a 1anguage of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n805/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0805-0770"/> developed structure-like our own, we arrive at
                    such “roots” mainly by an artificial stripping-off of the signs of relation
                    which almost every word still has, or can be shown to have once had. In <hi
                    rend="italic">un-cost-li-ness,</hi> for example, <hi rend="italic">cost</hi> is
                    the centrally significant element; so far as English is concerned, it is a root,
                    about which cluster a whole body of forms and derivatives; if we could follow
                    its history no farther, it would be to us an ultimate root, as much so as <hi
                    rend="italic">bind</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sing</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >mean.</hi> But we can follow it up, to the Latin compound <hi rend="italic"
                    >con-sta,</hi> a root <hi rend="italic">sta</hi> with a prefixed formative
                    element <hi rend="italic">con.</hi> Then <hi rend="italic">sta,</hi> which in
                    slightly varied forms we find in a whole body of related tongues called “Aryan,”
                    having in them all the same significance “stand,” is an Aryan root, and to us an
                    ultimate one, because we can follow its history no farther; but there always
                    remains the possibility that it is as far from being actually original as is the
                    English root <hi rend="italic">cost:</hi> that is to say, it is not within our
                    power ever to get back to the really primitive elements of speech, and to
                    demonstrate their character by positive evidence. The reason for accepting a
                    primitive rootstage of language is in great part theoretical: because nothing
                    else is reconcilable with any acceptable view of the origin of language. The law
                    of the simplicity of beginnings is an absolute one for everything of the nature
                    of an institution, for every gradually developed product of the exercise of
                    human faculties. That an original speech-sign should be of double character, one
                    part of it meaning this and another part that, or one part radical and the other
                    formative, is as inconceivable as that the first instruments should have had
                    handles, or the first shelters a front room and a back one. But this theoretical
                    reason finds all the historical support which it needs in the fact that, through
                    all the observable periods of languagehistory, we see formative elements coming
                    from words originally independent, and not from anything else. Thus, in the
                    example just taken, the <hi rend="italic">-li-</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
                    >costliness</hi> is a suffix of so recent growth that its whole history is
                    distinctly traceable; it is simply our adjective <hi rend="italic">like,</hi>
                    worn down in both form and meaning to a subordinate value in combination with
                    certain words to which it was appended, and then added freely as a suffix to any
                    word from which it was desired to make a derivative adjective—or, later but more
                    often, a derivative adverb. The <hi rend="italic">ness</hi> is much older
                    (though only Germanic), and its history obscurer; it contains, in fact, two
                    parts, neither of them of demonstrable origin; but there are equivalent later
                    suffixes, as <hi rend="italic">ship</hi> in <hi rend="italic">hardship</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">dοm</hi> in <hi rend="italic">wisdom,</hi> whose derivation
                    from independent words <hi rend="italic">(shape, doom)</hi> is beyond question.
                    The <hi rend="italic">un-</hi> of <hi rend="italic">uncostliness</hi> is still
                    more ancient (being Aryan), and its probably pronominal origin hardly available
                    as an illustration; but the comparatively modern prefix <hi rend="italic"
                    >be-,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">become, belie,</hi> &lt;kc., comes from the
                    independent preposition <hi rend="italic">by,</hi> by the same process as <hi
                    rend="italic">-ly</hi> or <hi rend="italic">-li-</hi> from <hi rend="italic"
                    >like.</hi> And the <hi rend="italic">con</hi> which has contributed its part to
                    the making of the quasi-root <hi rend="italic">cost</hi> is also in origin
                    identical with the Latin preposition <hi rend="italic">cum</hi> “with.” By all
                    the known facts of later language-growth, we are driven to the opinion that
                    every formative element goes back to some previously existing independent word;
                    and hence that in analysing our present words we are retracing the steps of an
                    earlier synthesis, or following up the history of our formed words toward the
                    unformed roots out of which they have grown. The doctrine of the historical
                    growth of language-structure leads by a logical necessity to that of a
                    root-stage in the history of all language; the only means of avoiding the latter
                    is the assumption of a miraculous element in the former.</p>
                <p>Of what phonetic form were the earliest traditional speech-signs is, so far as
                    essentials are concerned, to be inferred with reasonable certainty. They were
                    doubtless articulate: that is to say, composed of alternating consonant and
                    vowel sounds, like our present speech; and they probably contained a part of the
                    same sounds which we now use. All human language is of this character; there are
                    no sounds in any tongue which are not learned and reproduced as easily by
                    children of one race as of another; all dialects admit a like phonetic analysis,
                    and are representable by alphabetic signs; and the leading sounds, consonant and
                    vowel, are even practically the same in all; though every dialect has its own
                    (for the most part, readily definable and imitable) niceties of their
                    pronunciation, while certain sounds are rare, or even met with only in a single
                    group of languages, or in a single language. Articulate sounds are such as are
                    capable of being combined with others into that succession of distinct yet
                    connectable syllables which is the characteristic of human speechutterance. The
                    name “articulate” belongs to this utterance, as distinguished from inarticulate
                    human sounds and cries, and from the sounds made by the lower animals. The word
                    itself is Latin, by translation from the Greek, and, though very widely
                    misunderstood, and even deliberately misapplied in some languages to designate
                    all sound, of whatever kind, uttered by any living creature, is a most happily
                    chosen and truly descriptive term. It signifies “jointed,” or broken up into
                    successive parts, like a limb or stem; the joints are the syllables; and the
                    syllabic structure is mainly effected by the alternation of closer or consonant
                    sounds with opener or vowel sounds. The simplest syllabic combination (as the
                    facts of language show) is that of a single consonant with a following vowel;
                    and there are languages even now existing which reject any other. Hence there is
                    much plausibility in the view that the first speech-signs will have had this
                    phonetic form, and been monosyllabic, or dissyllabic only by repetition
                    (reduplication) of one syllable, such as the speech of very young children shows
                    to have a peculiar ease and naturalness. The point, however, is one of only
                    secondary importance, and may be left to the further progress of phonetic study
                    to settle, if it can; the root-theory, at any rate, is not bound to any definite
                    form or extent of root, but only denies that there can have been any grammatical
                    structure in language except by development in connexion with experience in the
                    use of language. What particular sounds, and how many, made up the first spoken
                    alphabet, is also a matter of conjecture merely; they are likely to have been
                    the closest consonants and the openest vowels, medial utterances being of later
                    development.</p>
                <p>As regards their significant value, the first languagesigns must have denoted
                    those physical acts and qualities which are directly apprehensible by the
                    senses; both because these alone are directly signifiable, and because it was
                    only they that untrained human beings had the power to deal with or the occasion
                    to use. Such signs would then be applied to more intellectual uses as fast as
                    there was occasion for it. The whole history of language, down to our own day,
                    is full of examples of the reduction of physical terms and phrases to the
                    expression of nonphysical conceptions and relations; we can hardly write a line
                    without giving illustrations of this kind of linguistic growth. So pervading is
                    it, that we never regard ourselves as having read the history of any
                    intellectual or moral term till we have traced it back to a physical origin. And
                    we are still all the time drawing figurative comparisons between material and
                    moral things and processes, and calling the latter by the names of the former.
                    There has never been any difficulty in providing for new knowledge and more
                    refined thought by putting to new uses the earlier and grosser materials of
                    speech.</p>
                <p>As a matter of course, whatever we now signify by our simple expressions for
                    simple acts, wants, and the like, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n806/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0806-0771"/> was intended to be signified through the first
                    speech-signs by the users of them. But to us, with our elaborated apparatus of
                    speech, the sentence, composed of subject and predicate, with a verb or special
                    predicative word to signify the predication, is established as the norm of
                    expression, and we regard everything else as an abbreviated sentence, or as
                    involving a virtual sentence. With a view to this, we must have “parts of
                    speech”; that is, words held apart in office from one another, each usable for
                    such and such a purpose and no other, and answering a due variety of purposes,
                    so that when they are combined they fit together, as parts composing a λvhole,
                    and the desired meaning is made clear. Inflexions, too, lend their aid; or else
                    auxiliary words of various kinds answering the same purpose—namely, of
                    determining the relations of the members of the sentence. But all our success in
                    understanding the earliest stages of language depends upon our power to conceive
                    a state of things where none of these distinctions were established, where one
                    speech-sign was like another, calling up a conception in its indefinite
                    entirety, and leaving the circumstances of the case to limit its application.
                    Such a language is far below ours in explicitness; but it would suffice for a
                    great deal of successful communication; indeed (as will be shown farther on),
                    there are many languages even now in existence which are little better off. So a
                    look of approval or disgust, a gesture of beckoning or repulsion, a grunt of
                    assent or inquiry, is as significant as a sentence, means a sentence, is
                    translatable into a sentence, and hence may even in a certain way be called a
                    sentence; and in the same way, but only so, the original roots of language may
                    be said to have been sentences. In point of fact, between the holophrastic
                    gesture or uttered sign and the sentence which we can now substitute for it—for
                    example, between the sign of beckoning and the equivalent sentence, “I want you
                    to come here”—lies the whole history of development of inflective speech.</p>
                <p>What has been this history of development, how the first scanty and formless
                    signs have been changed into the immense variety and fulness of existing speech,
                    it is of course impossible to point out in detail, or by demonstration of facts,
                    because nearly the whole process is hidden in the darkness of an impenetrable
                    past. The only way to cast any light upon it is by careful induction from the
                    change and growth which are seen to have been going on in the recent periods for
                    which we have recorded evidence, or which are going on at the present time. Of
                    some groups of related languages we can read the life for three or four thousand
                    years back, and by comparison can infer it much farther; and the knowledge thus
                    won is what we have to apply to the explanation of periods and languages
                    otherwise unknown. Nothing has a right to be admitted as a factor in
                    language-growth of which the action is not demonstrable in recorded language.
                    Our own family of languages is the one of whose development most is known, by
                    observation and well-warranted inference; and it may be well here to sketch the
                    most important features of its history, by way of general illustration.</p>
                <p>Apparently the earliest class-distinction traceable in Aryan speech is that of
                    pronominal roots, or signs of position, from the more general mass of roots. It
                    is not a formal distinction, marked by a structural difference, but, so far as
                    can be seen, is founded only on the assignment by usage θf certain elements to
                    certain offices. Formal distinction began with combination, the addition of one
                    element to another, their fusion into a single word, and the reduction of the
                    one part to a subordinate value, as sign of a certain modification of meaning of
                    the other. Thus, doubtless by endings of pronominal origin, were made the first
                    verb-forms, or words used only when predication was intended (since that is all
                    that makes a verb), conveying at first a distinction of persons only, then of
                    persons and numbers, while the further distinctions of tense and mode were by
                    degrees added. To the nouns, which became nouns by the setting up of the
                    separate and special class of verbs, were added in like manner distinctions of
                    case, of number, and of gender. With the separation of noun and verb, and the
                    establishment of their respective inflexion, the creative work of languagemaking
                    is virtually done; the rest is a matter of differentiation of uses. For the noun
                    (noun substantive) and the adjective (noun adjective) become two parts of speech
                    only by a gradually deepened separation of use; there is no original or formal
                    distinction between them; the pronouns merely add the noun-inflexion to a
                    special set of stems; adverbs are a part of the same formation as nouncases;
                    prepositions are adverbs with a specialized construction, of secondary growth;
                    conjunctions are the products of a like specialization; articles, where found at
                    all, arc merely weakened demonstratives and numerals.</p>
                <p>To the process of form-making, as exhibited in this history, belong two parts:
                    the one external, consisting in the addition of one existing element of speech
                    to another and their combination into a single word; the other internal,
                    consisting in the adaptation of the compound to its special use and involving
                    the subordination of one element to the other. Both parts appear also abundantly
                    in other departments of language-change, and throughout the whole history of our
                    languages; nothing has to be assumed for the earliest formations which is not
                    plainly illustrated in the latest. For example, the last important addition to
                    the formative apparatus of English is the common adverb-making suffix <hi
                    rend="italic">-ly,</hi> coming, as already pointed out, from the independent
                    adjective <hi rend="italic">like.</hi> There was nothing at first to distinguish
                    a compound like <hi rend="italic">godl</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(godlike)</hi> from one like <hi rend="italic">storm-tossed,</hi>
                    save that the former was more adaptable than the other to wider uses;
                    resemblance is an idea easily generalized into appurtenance and the like, and
                    the conversion of <hi rend="italic">godlike</hi> to <hi rend="italic">godly</hi>
                    is a simple result of the processes of phonetic change described farther on. The
                    extension of the same element to combination with adjectives instead of nouns,
                    and its conversion to adverb-making value, is a much more striking case of
                    adaptation, and is nearly limited to English, among the Germanic languages that
                    have turned <hi rend="italic">like</hi> into a suffix. A similar striking case,
                    of combination and adaptation, is seen in the Romanic adverb-making suffix <hi
                    rend="italic">mente</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ment,</hi> coming from the Latin
                    ablative <hi rend="italic">mente,</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ii</hi>
                    with mind.” So, to make a Romanic future like <hi rend="italic"
                    >donnerai,</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ii</hi> I shall give,” there was
                    needed in the first place the pre-existing elements <hi rend="italic"
                    >donner,</hi> “to give,” and <hi rend="italic">ai,</hi> “I have,” and their
                    combination; but this is only a part; the other indispensable part is the
                    gradual adaptation of a phrase meaning “I have [something before me] for giving”
                    to the expression of simple futurity, <hi rend="italic">“donabo.”</hi> So far as
                    the adaptation is concerned, the case is quite parallel to that <hi
                    rend="italic">c&gt;ifai</hi><hi rend="italic">donne,</hi> “I have given,” Ac.
                    (equivalent phrases or combinations are found in many languages), where the
                    expression of possession of something that is acted on has been in like manner
                    modified into the expression of past action. Parallel in both combination and
                    adaptation is the past tense <hi rend="italic">loved,</hi> from <hi
                    rend="italic">love-did,</hi> while we have again the same adaptation without
                    combination in the equivalent phrase <hi rend="italic">did love.</hi></p>
                <p>That these are examples of the process by which the whole inflective structure of
                    Aryan language was built up admits of no reasonable question. Our belief that it
                    is so rests upon the solid foundation that we can demonstrate no other process,
                    and that this one is sufficient. It is true that we can prove such an origin for
                    our formative elements in only a small minority of instances; but this is just
                    what was to be expected, considering what we know <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n807/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0807-0772"/> of the disguising processes of language-growth.
                    No one would guess in the mere <hi rend="italic">y</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ably</hi> (for <hi rend="italic">able-ly)</hi> the presence of the adjective
                    <hi rend="italic">like,</hi> any more than in the altered final of <hi
                    rend="italic">sent</hi> and the shortened vowel of <hi rend="italic">led</hi>
                    the effect of a <hi rend="italic">did</hi> once added to <hi rend="italic"
                    >send</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lead.</hi> The true history of these forms can
                    be shown, because there happen to be other facts left in existence to show it;
                    where such facts are not within reach, we are left to infer by analogy from the
                    known to the unknown. The validity of our inference can only be shaken by
                    showing that there are forms incapable of having been made in this way, or that
                    there are and have been other ways of making forms. Of the former there is
                    evidently but small chance; if a noun-form meaning “with mind” can become the
                    means of conversion of all the adjectives of a language into adverbs, and a verb
                    meaning “have” (and, yet earlier, “seize ”) of signifying both future and past
                    time, there is obviously nothing that is impossible of attainment by such means.
                    As regards the latter, no one appears to have even attempted to demonstrate the
                    genesis of formative elements in any other way during the historical periods of
                    language; it is simply assumed that the early methods of language-making will
                    have been something different from and superior in spontaneity and fruitfulness
                    to the later ones; that certain forms, or forms at certain periods, were made
                    out-and-out, as forms; that signs of formal distinction somehow exuded from
                    roots and stems; that original words were manymembered, and that a formative
                    value settled in some member of them—and the like. Such doctrines are purely
                    fanciful, and so opposed to the teachings both of observation and of sound
                    theory that the epithet absurd is hardly too strong to apply to them. If the
                    later races, of developed intelligence, and trained in the methods of a fuller
                    expression, can only win a new form by a long and gradual process of combination
                    and adaptation, why should the earlier and comparatively untrained generations
                    have been able to do any better? The advantage ought to be, if anywhere, on our
                    side. The progress of language in every department, accompanying and
                    representing the advance of the race, on the whole, in the art of speaking as in
                    other arts, is from the grosser to the more refined, from the physical to the
                    moral and intellectual, from the material to the formal. The conversion of
                    compounds into forms, by the reduction of one of their elements to formative
                    value, is simply a part of the general process which also creates auxiliaries
                    and form-words and connectives, all the vocabulary of mind, and all the
                    figurative phraseology that gives life and vigour to our speech. If a copula,
                    expressive of the grammatical relation of predication, could be won only by
                    attenuation of the meaning of verbs signifying “grow,” “breathe,” “stand,” and
                    the like; if our auxiliaries of tense and mode all go traceably back to words of
                    physical meaning (as <hi rend="italic">have</hi> to “seize,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >may</hi> to “be great or strong,” <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> to “be under
                    penalty,” and so on); if <hi rend="italic">of</hi> comes from the comparatively
                    physical <hi rend="italic">off,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">for</hi> from
                    “be∕ore, ∕orward”; if relative pronouns are specialized demonstratives and
                    interrogatives; if <hi rend="italic">right</hi> means etymologically “straight,”
                    and <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> means “twisted”; if <hi rend="italic"
                    >spirit</hi> is “blowing,” and <hi rend="italic">intellect</hi> a “picking out
                    among,” and <hi rend="italic">understanding</hi> a “getting beneath,” and <hi
                    rend="italic">development</hi> an “unfolding”; if an event <hi rend="italic"
                    >takes place</hi> or <hi rend="italic">comes to pass,</hi> and then <hi
                    rend="italic">drops out</hi> of mind and is <hi rend="italic">forgotten</hi>
                    (opposite of <hi rend="italic">gotten:)—</hi> then it is of no avail to object
                    to the grossness of any of the processes by which, in earlier language or in
                    later, the expression of formal relations is won. The mental sense of the
                    relation expressed is entirely superior to and independent of the means of its
                    expression. He who, to express the plural of <hi rend="italic">man,</hi> says
                    what is equivalent to <hi rend="italic">man-man</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >heap-man</hi> (devices which are met with in not a few languages) has just as
                    good a sense of plurality as he who says <hi rend="italic">men</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">homines;</hi> that sense is no more degraded in him by the
                    coarseness of the phrase he uses to signify it than is our own sense of
                    eventuality and of pastness by the undisguised coarseness of <hi rend="italic"
                    >take place</hi> and <hi rend="italic">have been.</hi> In short, it is to be
                    laid down with the utmost distinctness and confidence, as a law of
                    language-growth, that there is nothing formal anywhere in language which was not
                    once material; that the formal is made out of the material, by processes which
                    began in the earliest history of language and are still in action.</p>
                <p>We have dropped here the restriction to our own or Aryan language with which we
                    began, because it is evident that what is true of this family of speech, one of
                    the most highly organized that exist, may also be true of the rest— must be true
                    of them, unless some valid evidence be found to the. contrary. The unity of
                    human nature makes human speech alike in the character of its beginnings and in
                    the general features of its after-history. Everywhere among men, a certain store
                    of expression, body of traditional signs of thought, being given, as used by a
                    certain community, it is capable of increase on certain accordant lines, and
                    only on them. In some languages, and under peculiar circumstances, borrowing is
                    a great means of increase; but it is the most external and least organically
                    important of all. Out-and-out invention (which, so far as we can see, must be of
                    the kind called by us onomatopoetic) is found to play only a very insignificant
                    part in the historical periods of language,—clearly because there are other and
                    easier modes of gaining new expression for what needs to be expressed. In the
                    course of phonetic change, a word sometimes varies into two (or more) forms, and
                    makes so many words, which are differently turned to account. Everything beyond
                    this must be the product of combination; there is no other way, so far as
                    concerns the externals of speech. Then, partly as accompanying and aiding this
                    external growth, partly as separate from and supplementing it, there is in all
                    language an internal growth, making no appearance in - the audible part of
                    speech, consisting in multiplication of meanings, their modification in the way
                    of precision or comprehension or correctness, the restriction of words to
                    certain uses, and so on. Along with these, too, a constant change of phonetic
                    form constitutes an inseparable part of the life of language. Speech is no more
                    stable with respect to the sounds of which it is composed than with respect to
                    its grammatical forms, its vocabulary, or the body of conceptions signified by
                    it. Even nearly related languages differ as much in their spoken alphabets and
                    the combinations of sounds they admit, and in their uttered forms of words
                    historically the same, as in any other part; and the same is true of local
                    dialects, and of class dialects within the same community. Phonetic change has
                    nothing whatever to do with change of meaning; the two are the product of wholly
                    independent tendencies. Sometimes, indeed, they chance to coincide, as in the
                    distinction of <hi rend="italic">minúte</hi> “small,” and <hi rend="italic"
                    >minute</hi> “moment”; but it is only by chance, as the spoken accordance of <hi
                    rend="italic">second</hi> in its two meanings (“next” and “sixtieth of a
                    minute”) shows; words that maintain their identity of value most obstinately,
                    like the numerals, are liable to vary indefinitely in form (so <hi rend="italic"
                    >four, fidvor,</hi><hi rend="italic">quatuor,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >τι(∏rαρ-eς,</hi> &amp;c., from an original <hi rend="italic">katwar; five,
                    quinque, πεντe, coic, &amp;,c.,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">penka—</hi> while,
                    on the other hand, <hi rend="italic">two</hi> and <hi rend="italic">three</hi>
                    show as striking an accordance of form as of meaning through all the same
                    languages); what is far the most common is that the word becomes very unlike its
                    former self in both respects, like <hi rend="italic">q&gt;riest</hi> from the
                    Greek <hi rend="italic">πpεσβυτεpoς {presbyter),</hi> literally “older man.”
                    Human convenience is, to be sure, the governing motive in both changes; but it
                    is convenience of two different kinds: the one mental, depending on the fact <pb

                    belongs to the thing to which it is applied, to the disregard of its
                    etymological connexions, does not need to be changed when the thing changes, and
                    is ready for new application to anything that can be brought into one class with
                    the latter; and the other physical, depending on the organs of speech and their
                    successive movements, by which the sounds that make up the word are produced.
                    Phonetic convenience is economy of effort on the part of those organs; and to no
                    other law than that of economy of utterance have any of the phenomena of
                    phonetic change been found traceable (though it is also to be noted that some
                    phenomena have not hitherto been successfully brought under it, and that the way
                    of effecting this is still unclear), “Euphony,” which used to be appealed to as
                    explanation, is a false principle, except so far as the term may be made an
                    idealized synonym of economy. The ear finds that agreeable which the organs of
                    utterance find facile. Economy in utterance is no isolated tendency; it is the
                    same that plays its part in all other kinds of human action, and in language
                    appears equally in the abbreviation of the sentence by leaving out parts that
                    can be spared without loss of intelligibility. It is an insidious tendency,
                    always lying in wait, like gravitation, to pull down what is not sufficiently
                    held up,—the holding-up force in language being the faithfulness of tradition,
                    or accurate reproduction by the learner and user of the signs which he has
                    acquired. No generation of men has any intention to speak otherwise than as its
                    predecessor has spoken, or any consciousness that it is doing so; and yet, from
                    generation to generation, words are shortened, sounds are assimilated to one
                    another, and one element passes out of use while a new one is introduced.
                    Abbreviation and assimilation are the most conspicuous departments of phonetic
                    change, and those in which the nature of the governing tendency is most plainly
                    seen. Taken by itself, one sound is as easy as another to the person who has
                    accustomed himself to it from childhood; and those which the young child most
                    easily acquires are not those which in the history of speech are least liable to
                    alteration; it is especially in the combinations and transitions of rapid
                    speaking that the tongue, as it were, finds out for itself easier ways of
                    performing its task, by dropping and slurring and adapting. To trace out the
                    infinitely varied items of this change, to co-ordinate and compare them and
                    discover their reasons, constitutes a special department of language-study,
                    which is treated under the head of <hi rend="smallcaps">Speech Sounds.</hi> It
                    only needs to be pointed out here that phonetic change plays a necessary part in
                    the structural development of language, by integrating compound words through
                    fusion and loss of identity of their component parts, and, what is of yet more
                    importance, by converting them into forms, through disguise of identity of one
                    of the parts and its phonetic subordination to the other part. It is this that
                    turns, for example, the compound <hi rend="italic">god-like</hi> into the
                    derivative <hi rend="italic">godly,</hi> the compound <hi rend="italic"
                    >love-dιd</hi> into the verbal form <hi rend="italic">loved.</hi> And yet one
                    further result sometimes follows: an internal change is wrought by phonetic
                    influence in the body of a word, which change then may in the further history of
                    the word be left as the sole means of distinction between one form and another.
                    It is thus that, in the most recent period, the distinction of <hi rend="italic"
                    >led</hi> from <hi rend="italic">lead</hi> and <hi rend="italic">met</hi> from
                    <hi rend="italic">meet</hi> and so on has been made; the added auxiliary which
                    originally made these preterites induced a shortening of the root-vowel, and
                    this was left behind when the auxiliary disappeared by the usual process of
                    abbreviation. It is in the same way that the distinctions of <hi rend="italic"
                    >men</hi> from <hi rend="italic">man,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">were</hi> from
                    <hi rend="italic">was,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">set</hi> from <hi rend="italic"
                    >sit,</hi> with all their analogues, were brought about: by a modification of
                    vowel-sound (Ger. <hi rend="italic">Umlauf)</hi> occasioned by the presence in
                    the following syllable of an /-vowel, which in the older stages of the language
                    is still to be seen there. And the distinctions of <hi rend="italic">sing, sang,
                    sung,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">song,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">bind, bound,
                    band,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bond,</hi> are certainly of the same kind,
                    though they go back so far in the history of our family of languages that their
                    beginnings are not yet clearly demonstrable; they were in their origin phonetic
                    accidents, inorganic, mere accompaniments and results of external combinations
                    which bore the office of distinction of meaning and were sufficient to it; in
                    some of our languages they have been disregarded and effaced, in others they
                    have risen to prominent importance. To regard these internal changes as primary
                    and organic is parallel with assuming the primariness of the formative apparatus
                    of language in general; like this, it ignores the positive evidence we have of
                    the secondary production of such differences; they are, like everything else in
                    linguistic structure, the outcome of combination and adaptation.</p>
                <p>Borrowing, or the taking-in of material out of another language, has been more
                    than once referred to above as sometimes an important element in
                    language-history, though less deep-reaching and organic than the rest. There is
                    nothing anomalous about borrowing; it is rather in essential accordance with the
                    whole process of language-acquisition. All our names were adopted by us because
                    they were already in use by others; and a community is in the same way capable
                    of taking a new name from a community with which it comes in contact as an
                    individual from individuals. Not that it seeks or admits in this way new names
                    for old things; but it accepts new things along with the names that seem to
                    belong to them. Hence any degree of intercourse between one community and
                    another, leading to exchange of products or of knowledge, is sure to lead also
                    to some borrowing of names; and there is hardly a language in the world, except
                    of races occupying peculiarly isolated positions, that does not contain a
                    certain amount of foreign material thus won, even as our English has elements in
                    its vocabulary from half the other tongues in the world. The scale of borrowing
                    is greatly increased when one people becomes the pupil of another in respect of
                    its civilization: hence the abundant classical elements in all the European
                    tongues, even the non-Romanic; hence the Arabic material in Persian and Turkish
                    and Malay; hence the Chinese in Japanese and Corean; and, as a further result,
                    even dead languages, like the Greek and Latin and the Sanskrit, become stores to
                    be drawn upon in that learned and conscious quest of new expression which in the
                    school-stage of culture supplements or even in a measure replaces the
                    unconscious growth of natural speech. So, in mixture of communities, which is a
                    highly-intensified form of contact and intercourse, there follows such mixture
                    of speech as the conditions of the case determine; yet not a mixture on equal
                    terms, through all the departments of vocabulary and grammar; the resulting
                    speech (just as when two individuals learn to speak alike) is essentially that
                    of the one constituent of the new community, with more oι <hi rend="superscript"
                    > ,</hi> less material borrowed from that of the other. What is most easily
                    taken in out of another language is the names of concrete things; every degree
                    of removal f om this involves additional difficulty—names of abstract things,
                    epithets, verbs, connectives, forms. Indeed, the borroλving of forms in the
                    highest sense, or forms of inflexion, is well-nigh or quite impossible; no
                    example of it has been demonstrated in any of the historical periods of
                    language, though it is sometimes adventurously assumed as a part of prehistoric
                    growth. How nearly it may be approached is instanced by the presence in English
                    of such learned plurals as <hi rend="italic">phenomena</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">strata.</hi> This extreme resistance to mixture in the department
                    of inflexion is the ground on which some deny the possibility of mixture in <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n809/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0809-0774"/> language, and liencè the existence of such a
                    thing as a mixed language. The difference is mainly a verbal one; but it would
                    seem about as reasonable to deny that a region is inundated so long as the tops
                    of its highest mountains are above water. According to the simple and natural
                    meaning of the term, nearly all languages are mixed, in varying degree and
                    within varying limits, which the circumstances of each case must explain.</p>
                <p>These are the leading processes of change seen at work in all present speech and
                    in all known past speech, and hence to be regarded as having worked through the
                    whole history of speech. By their operation, every existing tongue has been
                    developed out of its rudimentary radical condition to that in which we now see
                    it. The variety of existing languages is well-nigh infinite, not only in their
                    material but in their degree of development and the kind of resulting structure.
                    Just as the earlier stages in the history of the use of tools are exemplified
                    even at the present day by races which have never advanced beyond them, so is it
                    in regard to language also—and, of course, in the latter case as in the former,
                    this state of things strengthens and establishes the theory of a gradual
                    development. There is not an element of linguistic structure possessed by some
                    languages which is not wanting in others; and there are even tongues which have
                    no formal structure, and which cannot be shown ever to have advanced out of the
                    radical stage. The most noted example of such a rudimentary tongue is the
                    Chinese, which in its present condition lacks all formal distinction of the
                    parts of speech, all inflexion, all derivation; each of its words (all of them
                    monosyllables) is an integral sign, not divisible into parts of separate
                    significance; and each in general is usable wherever the radical idea is wanted,
                    with the value of one part of speech or another, as determined by the connexion
                    in which it stands: a condition parallel with that in which Aryan speech may be
                    regarded as existing prior to the beginnings of its career of formal development
                    briefly sketched above. And there are other tongues, related and unrelated to
                    Chinese, of which the same description, or one nearly like it, might be given.
                    To call such languages radical is by no means to maintain that they exhibit the
                    primal roots of human speech, unchanged or only phonetically changed, or that
                    they have known nothing of the combination of element with element. Of some of
                    them, the roots are in greater or less part dissyllabic; and we do not yet know
                    that all dissyllabism, and even that all complexity of syllable beyond a single
                    consonant with following vowel, is not the result of combination or
                    reduplication. But all combination is not formmaking; it needs a whole class of
                    combinations, with a recognized common element in them producing a recognized
                    common modification of meaning, to make a form. The same elements which (in
                    Latin, and even to some extent in English also) are of formal value in <hi
                    rend="italic">constant</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pre-diet</hi> lack that
                    character in <hi rend="italic">cost</hi> and <hi rend="italic">preach</hi>; the
                    same <hi rend="italic">like</hi> which makes adverbs in <hi rend="italic"
                    >tru-ly</hi> and <hi rend="italic">right-ly</hi> is present without any such
                    value in <hi rend="italic">such</hi> and <hi rend="italic">which</hi> (from <hi
                    rend="italic">so-like</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ιvhο-like); cost</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">preach,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">such</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >which,</hi> are as purely radical in English as other words of which we do not
                    happen to be able to demonstrate the composite character. And so a Chinese
                    monosyllable or an Egyptian or Polynesian dissyllable is radical, unless there
                    can be demonstrated in some part of it a formative value; and a language wholly
                    composed of such words is a root-language. Neither is the possibility to be
                    denied that a language like Chinese may have had at some period of its history
                    the weak beginnings of a formal development, since extinguished by the same
                    processes of phonetic decay which in English have wiped out so many signs of a
                    formal character, and brought back so considerable a part of the vocabulary to
                    monosyllabism; but it remains thus far a possibility merely; and the development
                    would need to have been of the scantiest character to be so totally destroyed by
                    phonetic influences. In languages thus constituted, the only possible external
                    alteration is that phonetic change to which all human speech, from the very
                    beginning of its traditional life, is liable; the only growth is internal, by
                    that multiplication and adaptation and improvement of meanings which is equally
                    an inseparable part of all language-history. This may include the reduction of
                    certain elements to the value of auxiliaries, particles, form-words, such as
                    play an important part in analytical tongues like English, and are perhaps also
                    instanced in prehistoric Aryan speech by the class of pronominal roots. Phrases
                    take the place of compounds and of inflexions, and the same element may have an
                    auxiliary value in certain connexions while retaining its full force in others,
                    like, for instance, our own <hi rend="italic">have.</hi> It is not easy to
                    define the distinction between such phrase-collocations and the beginnings of
                    agglutination; yet the distinction itself is in general clearly enough to be
                    drawn (like that in French between <hi rend="italic">donnerai</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ai donne),</hi> when the whole habit of the language is well
                    understood.</p>
                <p>Such languages, constituting the small minority of human tongues, are wont to be
                    called “isolating,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> using each element by itself,
                    in its integral form. All besides are “agglutinative,” or more or less
                    compounded into words containing a formal part, an indicator of classvalue. Here
                    the differences, in kind and degree, are very great; the variety ranges from a
                    scantiness hardly superior to Chinese isolation up to an intricacy compared with
                    which Aryan structure is hardly fuller than Chinese. Some brief characterization
                    of the various families of language in this respect will be given farther on, in
                    connexion with their classification. The attempt is also made to classify the
                    great mass of agglutinating tongues under different heads: those are ranked as
                    simply “agglutinative” in which there is a general conservation of the separate
                    identity of root or stem on the one hand, and of formative element, suffix or
                    prefix, on the other; while the name “inflective,” used in a higher and pregnant
                    sense, is given to those that admit a superior fusion and integration of the two
                    parts, to the disguise and loss of separate identity, and, yet more, with the
                    development of an internal change as auxiliary to or as substitute for the
                    original agglutination. But there is no term in linguistic science so uncertain
                    of meaning, so arbitrary of application, so dependent on the idiosyncrasy of its
                    user, as the term “inflective.” Any language ought to have the right to be
                    called inflective that has inflexion: that is, that not merely distinguishes
                    parts of speech and roots and stems formally from one another, but also
                    conjugates its verbs and declines its nouns; and the name is sometimes so used.
                    If, again, it be strictly limited to signify the possession of <hi rend="italic"
                    >inner flexion</hi> of roots and stems (as if simply agglutinated forms could be
                    called “exflective ”), it marks only a difference of degree of agglutination,
                    and should be carefully used as so doing. As describing the fundamental and
                    predominant character of language-structure, it belongs to only one family of
                    languages, the Semitic, where most of the work of grammatical distinction is
                    done by internal changes of vowel, the origin of which thus far eludes all
                    attempts at explanation. By perhaps the majority of students of language it is,
                    as a generally descriptive title, restricted to that family and one other, the
                    Indo-European or Aryan; but such a classification is not to be approved, for, in
                    respect to this characteristic, Aryan speech ranks not with Semitic but with the
                    great body of agglutinative tongues. To few of these can the name be altogether
                    denied, since there is hardly a body of related dialects in existence that does
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n810/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0810-0775"/> not exhibit some items of “inflective” structure;
                    the Aryan is only the one among them that has most to show. Outside the Semitic,
                    at any rate, one should not speak of inflective and non-inflective languages,
                    but only of languages more inflective and less inflective.</p>
                <p>To account for the great and striking differences of structure among human
                    languages is beyond the power of the linguistic student, and will doubtless
                    always continue so. We are not likely to be able even to demonstrate a
                    correlation of capacities, saying that a race which has done this and that in
                    other departments of human activity might have been expected to form such and
                    such a language. Every tongue represents the general outcome of the capacity of
                    a race as exerted in this particular direction, under the influence of
                    historical circumstances which we can have no hope of tracing. There are
                    striking apparent anomalies to be noted. The Chinese and the Egyptians have
                    shown themselves to be among the most gifted races the earth has known; but the
                    Chinese tongue is of unsurpassed jejuneness, and the Egyptian, in point of
                    structure, little better, while among the wild tribes of Africa and America we
                    find tongues of every grade, up to a high one, or to the highest. This shows
                    clearly enough that mental power is not measured by language-structure. But any
                    other linguistic test would prove equally insufficient. On the whole, the value
                    and rank of a language are determined by what its users have made it do. The
                    reflex action of its speech on the mind and culture of a people is a theme of
                    high interest, but of extreme difficulty, and apt to lead its investigators away
                    into empty declamation; taking everything together, its amount, as is shown by
                    the instances already referred to, is but small. The question is simply one of
                    the facilitation of work by the use of one set of tools rather than another; and
                    a poor tool in skilful hands can do vastly better work than the best tool in
                    unskilful hands—even as the ancient Egyptians, without steel or steam, turned
                    out products which, both for colossal grandeur and for exquisite finish, are the
                    despair of modern engineers and artists. In such a history of development as
                    that of human speech a fortunate turn may lead to results of unforeseen value;
                    the earlier steps determine the later in a degree quite beyond their own
                    intrinsic importance. Everything in language depends upon habit and analogy; and
                    the formation of habit is a slow process, while the habit once formed exercises
                    a constraining as well as a guiding influence. Hence the persistency of
                    language-structure: when a certain sum and kind of expression is produced, and
                    made to answer the purposes of expression, it remains the same by inertia; a
                    shift of direction becomes of extreme difficulty. No other reason can at present
                    be given why in historical time there has been no marked development out of one
                    grade of structure into another; but the fact no more shakes the linguistic
                    scholar’s belief in the growth of structure than the absence of new animal
                    species worked out under his eyes shakes the confidence of the believer in
                    animal development. The modifying causes and their modes of action are clearly
                    seen, and there is no limit to the results of their action except what is
                    imposed by circumstances.</p>
                <p>It is in vain to attempt to use dates in language-history, to say when this or
                    that step in development was taken, and how long a period it cost, especially
                    now that the changed views as to the antiquity of man are making it probable
                    that only a small part of the whole history is brought within the reach even of
                    our deductions from the most ancient recorded dialects. At any rate, for aught
                    that we know or have reason to believe, all existing dialects are equally old;
                    every one alike has the whole immeasurable past of language-life behind it, has
                    reached its present condition by advance along its own line of growth and change
                    from the first beginnings of human expression. Many of these separate lines we
                    clearly see to converge and unite, as we follow them back into the past; but
                    whether they all ultimately converge to one point is a question quite beyond our
                    power to answer. If in this immensity of time many languages have won so little,
                    if everywhere language-growth has been so slow, then we can only differ as to
                    whether it is reasonably certain, or probable, or only possible, that there
                    should have been a considerable first period of human existence without
                    traditional speech, and a yet more considerable one before the fixation of so
                    much as should leave abiding traces in its descendants, and that meanwhile the
                    race should have multiplied and scattered into independent communities. And the
                    mere possibility is enough to exclude all dogmatic assertion of the unity of
                    origin of human speech, even assuming unity of origin of the human race. For to
                    prove that identity by the still existing facts of language is utterly out of
                    the question; the metamorphosing effect of constant change has been too great to
                    allow it. In point of fact, taking languages as they now exist, only those have
                    been shown related which possess a common structure, or have together grown out
                    of the more primitive radical stage, since structure proves itself a more
                    constant and reliable evidence than material. And this is likely ever to be the
                    case; at any rate, to trace all the world’s languages so far back toward their
                    beginnings as to find in them evidences of identity is beyond the wildest hope.
                    We must be content with demonstrating for those beginnings a unity of kind as
                    alike a body of formless roots. But, on the other hand, since this unity is
                    really demonstrated, since all structure is the result of growth, and no degree
                    of difference of structure, any more than of difference of material, refuses
                    explanation as the result of discordant growth from identical beginnings, it is
                    equally inadmissible to claim that the diversities of language prove it to have
                    had different beginnings. That is to say, the question of the unity of speech,
                    and yet more that of the unity of the race, is beyond the reach of the student
                    of language; the best view he can attain is the hypothetical one, that, if the
                    race is one, the beginnings of speech were perhaps one— but probably not, even
                    then. This negative conclusion is so clearly established as to leave no excuse
                    for the still oft-repeated attempts to press language into service on either
                    side of the controversy respecting human unity of race.</p>
                <p>That all making and changing of language is by the act of its speakers is too
                    obvious to call for discussion. No other force capable of acting and of
                    producing effects is either demonstrable or conceivable as concerned in the
                    work. The doctrine that language is an organism, growing by its own inherent
                    powers, exempt from the interference of those who use it, is simply an
                    indefensible paradox. Every word that is uttered is so by an act of human will,
                    at first in imitation of others, then more and more by a formed and controlling
                    habit; it is accessible to no change except by influences working in the
                    speaker’s mind, and leading him to make it otherwise. Not that he is aware of
                    this, or directs his action knowingly to that end. The whole process is
                    unconscious. If any implication of reflective or intended action can be shown to
                    inhere in any doctrine of linguistic science, it vitiates that doctrine. The
                    attitude of the ordinary speaker towards his language is that of unreasoning
                    acceptance; it seems to him that his names for things are their real names, and
                    all others unintelligent nicknames; he thinks himself to possess his speech by
                    the same tenure as his sight or hearing; it is “natural” to him (or, if he
                    reasons about it, he attributes it to a divine origin, as races beginning to
                    philosophize are wont to ascribe their various social institutions to their <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n811/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0811-0776"/> gods); he knows nothing of its structure and
                    relations; it never occurs to him to find fault with it, or to deem it
                    insufficient and add to or change it; he is wholly unaware that it does change.
                    He simply satisfies his social needs of communication by means of it; and if he
                    has anything to express that is different from what has been expressed before,
                    he takes the shortest way to a provision for the need; while any relaxation of
                    the energy of utterance tends to a variation in the uttered combinations; and
                    thus changes come by his act, though without his knowledge. His sole object is,
                    on the basis of what language he has, to make known his thought in the most
                    convenient way to his fellow; everything else follθλvs with and from that. Human
                    nature and circumstances being what they are, what follows actually is, as
                    already shown, incessant growth and change. For it we have not to seek special
                    disturbing causes in the history of the speakers, although such may come in to
                    heighten and quicken the change; we know that even in a small community, on a
                    narrow islet, cut off from all intercourse with other communities, the speech
                    would grow different—as certainly, if not as rapidly, as anywhere in the
                    world—and only by the action of its speakers: not that the speakers of a
                    language act in unison and simultaneously to produce a given change. This must
                    begin in an individual, or more or less accordantly in a limited number of
                    individuals, and spread from such example through the community. Initiation by
                    one or a few, acceptance and adoption by the rest,—such is the necessary method
                    of all linguistic change, and to be read as plainly in the facts of change now
                    going on among ourselves as in those of former language. The doctrine of the
                    inaccessibility of language to other action than that of its speakers does not
                    imply a power in the individual speaker to create or alter anything in the
                    common speech, any more than it implies his desire to do so. What he suggests by
                    his example must be approved by the imitation of his fellows, in order to become
                    language. The common speech is the common property, and no one person has any
                    more power over it than another. If there are, for example, a thousand speakers
                    of a certain dialect, each one wields in general a thousandth part of the force
                    required to change it—with just so much more as may belong to his excess of
                    influence over his fellows, due to recognized superiority of any kind on his
                    part. His action is limited only by their assent; but this is in effect a very
                    narrow limitation, insuring the adoption of nothing that is not in near
                    accordance with the already existing; though it is also to be noted that he is
                    as little apt to strike off into startling change as they to allow it; since the
                    governing power of already formed habits of speech is as strong in him as in
                    them. That change to which the existing habits naturally lead is easy to bring
                    about; any other is practically impossible. It is this tendency on the part of
                    the collective speakers of a language to approve or reject a proposed change
                    according to its conformity with their already subsisting usages that we are
                    accustomed to call by the fanciful name “the genius of a language.”</p>
                <p>On the relation of the part played in language-change by the individual to that
                    by the community, in -combination with the inevîtableness of change, rests the
                    explanation of the dialectic variation of language. If language were stable
                    there would of course be no divarication · but since it is always varying, and
                    by items of difference that proceed from individuals and become general by
                    diffusion, there can be uniformity of change only so far as diffusion goes, or
                    as the influences of communication extend. Within the limits of a single
                    community, small or large, whatever change arises spreads gradually to all, and
                    so becomes part of the general speech; but let that community become divided
                    into two (or more) parts, and then the changes arising in either part do not
                    spread to the other, and there begins to appear a difference in linguistic usage
                    between them. It is at first slight, even to insignificance; not greater than
                    exists between the dialects of different localities or ranks or occupations in
                    the same community, without detriment to the general unity of speech. This
                    unity, namely, rests solely on mutual intelligibility, and is compatible with no
                    small amount of individual and class difference, in vocabulary, in grammar, and
                    in pronunciation; indeed, in the strictest sense, each individual has a dialect
                    of his own, different from that of every other, even as he has a handwriting, a
                    countenance, a character of his own. And every item of change, as it takes
                    place, must have its season of existence as a local or class or trade
                    peculiarity, before it gains universal currency; some of them linger long in
                    that condition, or never emerge from it. All these differences in the speech of
                    different sub-communities within the same community are essentially dialectic;
                    they differ not in kind, but only in degree, from those which separate the
                    best-marked dialects; they are kept down by general communication within the
                    limit of general mutual intelligibility. Where that restraining influence
                    ceases, the limit is gradually but surely overpassed, and real dialects are the
                    result. From what we know of the life of language, we can say positively that
                    continued uniformity of speech without continued community is not practicable.
                    If it were possible to divide artificially, by an impassable chasm or wall, a
                    people one for ages, and continuing to occupy the same seats, the language of
                    the divided parts would at once begin to be dialectically different; and after
                    sufficient time had elapsed, each would have become unintelligible to the other.
                    That is to say, whenever a community of uniform speech breaks up, its speech
                    breaks up also; nor do we know of any other cause of dialectic diversity.</p>
                <p>In applying this explanation of dialectic growth we have to allow for modifying
                    circumstances of various nature, which alter not indeed the fact but the rate
                    and kind of divarication. Some languages grow and change much more rapidly than
                    others, with a corresponding effect upon divarication, since this is but a
                    result of discordant growth. Usually, when there is division of a community, the
                    parts get into different external circumstances, come in contact or mingle with
                    different neighbouring communities, and the like; and this quickens and
                    increases their divergence of speech. But the modifying factor of by far the
                    highest importance, here as elsewhere in the history of language, is
                    civilization. Civilization in its higher forms so multiplies the forces of
                    communication as to render it possible that the widely-divided parts of one
                    people, living in circumstances and under institutions of very different
                    character, should yet maintain a substantial oneness of speech; of this there is
                    no more striking example than the two great divisions of the English-speaking
                    people on opposite sides of the Atlantic. On the other hand, a savage people
                    cannot spread even a little without dialectic disunity; there are abundant
                    examples to be met with now of mutually unintelligible speech between the
                    smallest subdivisions of a race of obviously kindred tongue—as the different
                    clusters of huts on the same coral islet. It is with linguistic unity precisely
                    as it is with political unity, and for the same reasons. Before the attainment
                    of civilization the human race, whether proceeding from one centre of dispersion
                    or from several, was spread over the earth in a state of utter disintegration;
                    but every centre of civilization becomes also a centre of integration; its
                    influences make for unity of speech as of all other social institutions. Since
                    culture has become incontestably the dominant power in human history, the
                    unifying forces in language have also been <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n812/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0812-0777"/> stronger than the diversifying; and with culture
                    at its full height, and spread equally to every land and race, one universal
                    language, like one universal community, is not an absurdity or theoretic
                    impossibility, but only a Utopian or millennial dream.</p>
                <p>Dialectic variation is thus simply a consequence of the movements of population.
                    As the original human race or races, so the divisions or communities of later
                    formation, from point to point through the whole life of man on the earth, have
                    spread and separated, have jostled and interfered, have conquered and
                    exterminated or mingled and absorbed; and their speech has been affected
                    accordingly. Hence something of these movements can be read in the present
                    condition of languages, as in a faithful though obscure record—more, doubtless,
                    than can be read in any other way, however little it may be when viewed
                    absolutely. Dialectic resemblances point inevitably back to an earlier unity of
                    speech, and hence of community; from what we know of the history of speech, they
                    are not to be accounted for in any other way. The longer the separation that has
                    produced the diversity, the greater its degree. With every generation, the
                    amount of accordance decreases and that of discordance increases; the common
                    origin of the dialects is at first palpable, then evident on examination, then
                    to be made out by skilled research, then perhaps no longer demonstrable at all;
                    for there is plainly no limit to the possible divergence. So long, now, as any
                    evidence of original unity is discoverable we call the languages “related
                    dialects,” and combine them into a “family.” The term “family” simply signifies
                    a group of languages which the evidence thus far at command, as estimated by us,
                    leads us to regard as descended by the ordinary processes of dialectic
                    divarication from one original tongue. That it does not imply a denial of the
                    possibility of wider relationship is obvious from what has been said above. That
                    there is abundant room for error in the classification represented by it is also
                    clear, since we may take purely accidental resemblances, or the results of
                    borrowing, for evidence of common descent, or may overlook or wrongly estimate
                    real evidences, which more study and improved method will bring to light.
                    Grouping into families is nothing more than the best classification attainable
                    at a given stage in the progress of linguistic science; it is in no small part
                    provisional only, and is always held liable to modification, even sweeping, by
                    the results of further research. Of some families we can follow the history by
                    external evidences a great way back into the past; their structure is so highly
                    developed as to be traced with confidence everywhere; and their territory is
                    well within our reach: such we regard with the highest degree of confidence,
                    hardly allowing for more than the possibility that some other dialect, or group,
                    or now-accepted family even, may sometime prove its right to be added on. But
                    these are the rare exceptions; in the great majority of cases we have only the
                    languages as they now exist, and in more or less scanty collections, of every
                    degree of trustworthiness; and even their first grouping is tentative and
                    incomplete, and involves an adjournment of deeper questions to the day of more
                    light. To complete and perfect the work of classification by relationship, or
                    the establishment of families and their subdivisions, is the first object of the
                    comparative study of languages. No other classification has a value in the least
                    comparable with it; that by grade of structure is a mere recreation, leading to
                    nothing; that by absolute worth is of no account whatever, at any rate in the
                    present state of our knowledge. On genetic relationship, in the first place, is
                    founded all investigation of the historical development of languages; since it
                    is in the main the comparison of related dialects, even in the case of families
                    having a long recorded history, and elsewhere only that, that gives us knowledge
                    of their earlier condition, and enables us to trace the lines of change. In the
                    second place, and yet more obviously, with this classification is connected all
                    that language has to teach as to the affinities of human races; whatever aid
                    linguistic science renders to ethnology rests upon the proved relationships of
                    human tongues.</p>
                <p>That a classification of languages, to which we have now to proceed, is not
                    equivalent to a classification of races, and why this is so, is evident enough
                    from the principles which have been brought out by our whole discussion of
                    languages, and which, in their bearing upon this particular point, may well be
                    recapitulated here. No language is a race-characteristic, determined by the
                    special endowments of a race; all languages are of the nature of institutions,
                    parallel products of powers common to all mankind—the powers, namely, involved
                    in the application of the fittest available means to securing the common end of
                    communication. Hence they are indefinitely transferable, like other
                    institutions—like religions, arts, forms of social organization, and so on—under
                    the constraining force of circumstances. As an individual can learn any
                    language, foreign as well as ancestral, if it be put in his way, so also a
                    community, which in respect to such a matter is only an aggregate of
                    individuals. Accordingly, as individuals of very various race are often found in
                    one community, speaking together one tongue, and utterly ignorant of any other,
                    so there are found great communities of various descent, speaking the dialects
                    of one common tongue, which at some period historical circumstances have imposed
                    upon them. The conspicuous example, which comes into every one’s mind when this
                    subject is discussed, is that of the Romanic countries of southern Europe, all
                    using dialects of a language which, 2500 years ago, was itself the insignificant
                    dialect of a small district in central Italy; but this is only the most
                    important and striking of a whole class of similar facts. Such are the results
                    of the contact and mixture of races and languages. If languagehistory were
                    limited to growth and divarication, and racehistory to spread and dispersion, it
                    would be a comparatively easy task to trace both backward toward their origin;
                    as the case is, the confusion is inextricable and hopeless. Mixture of race and
                    mixture of speech are coincident and connected processes; the latter never takes
                    place without something of the former; but the one is not at all a measure of
                    the other, because circumstances may give to the speech of the one element of
                    population a greatly disproportionate preponderance. Thus, there is left in
                    French only an insignificant trace of the Celtic dialects of the predominant
                    race-constituent of the French people; French is the speech of the Latin
                    conquerors of Gaul, mixed perceptibly with that of its later Frankish
                    conquerors; it was adopted in its integrity by the Norse conquerors of a part of
                    the land, then brought into Britain by the same Norsemen in the course of their
                    further conquests, this time only as an element of mixture, and thence carried
                    with English speech to America, to be the language of a still further mixed
                    community. Almost every possible phase of language-mixture is traceable in the
                    history of the abundant words of Latin origin used by American negroes. What
                    events of this character took place in prehistoric time we shall never be able
                    to tell. If any one chooses to assert the possibility that even the completely
                    isolated dialect of the little Basque community may have been derived by the
                    Iberian race from an intrusive minority as small as that which made the Celts of
                    Gaul speakers of Latin, we should have to admit it as a possibility—yet without
                    detriment to the value of the dialect as indicating the isolated race-position
                    of its speakers. In strictness, language is never a proof of race, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n813/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0813-0778"/> either in an individual or in a community; it is
                    only a probable indication of race, in the absence of more authoritative
                    opposing indications; it is one evidence, to be combined with others, in the
                    approach towards a solution of the confessedly insoluble problems of human
                    history. But we must notice, as a most important circumstance, that its degree
                    of probability is greatest where its aid is most needed, in prehistoric periods
                    and among uncultivated races; since it is mainly civilization that gives to
                    language a propagative force disproportionate to the number of its speakers. On
                    the whole, the contributions of language to ethnology are practically far
                    greater in amount and more distinct than those derived from any other
                    source.</p>
                <p>The genetical classification of languages, then, is to be taken for just what it
                    attempts to be, and no more: primarily as a classification of languages only;
                    but secondarily as casting light, in varying manner and degree, on movements of
                    community, which in their turn depend more or less upon movements of races. It
                    is what the fates of men have left to represent the tongues of men—a record
                    imperfect even to fragmentariness. Many a family once as important as some of
                    those here set down has perhaps been wiped out of existence, or is left only in
                    an inconspicuous fragment; one and another has perhaps been extended far beyond
                    the limits of the race that shaped it,—which, we can never tell to our
                    satisfaction.</p>
                <p>We begin with the families of highest importance and nearest to ourselves.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Aryan {Indo-European, Indo - Germanic) Family.—</hi> To this
                    family belongs incontestably the first place, and for many reasons: the
                    historical position of the peoples speaking its dialects, who have now long been
                    the leaders in the world’s history; the abundance and variety and merit of its
                    literatures, ancient and modern, which, especially the modern, are wholly
                    unapproached by those of any other division of mankind; the period covered by
                    its records, hardly exceeded in duration by any other; and, most of all, the
                    great variety and richness of its development. These advantages make of it an
                    illustration of the history of human speech with which no other family can bear
                    a moment’s comparison as to value, however important various other families may
                    be in their bearing on one and another point or department of history, and
                    however necessary the combination of the testimony of all to a solution of the
                    problems involved in speech. These advantages have made Aryan language the
                    training-ground of comparative philology, and its study will always remain the
                    leading branch of that science. Many matters of importance in its history have
                    been brought up and used as illustrations in the preceding discussion; but as
                    its constitution and ascertained development call for a fuller and more
                    systematic exposition than they have found here, a special section is devoted to
                    the subject (see p. 781 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> below).</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Semitic Family.—</hi> This family also is beyond all
                    question the second in importance, on account of the part which its peoples
                    (Hebrews, Phoenicians, Assyrians, Syrians, Arabs, Abyssinians, &amp;c.) have
                    played in history, and of the rank of its literatures. For a special treatment
                    of it see <hi rend="smallcaps">Semitic.</hi> Some of the peculiarities of the
                    language have been alluded to above; in the monotony and rigidity of its
                    triliteral roots, and in the extended use which it makes of internal
                    vowel-change (“inflexion” in the special sense of that term) for the purposes of
                    grammatical distinction, it is more peculiar and unlike all the other known
                    families of language than these are unlike one another. There are, and perhaps
                    will always be, those to whom the peculiarities just mentioned will seem
                    original; but if the views of language and its history taken above are in the
                    main true, then that opinion is untenable; Semitic language must have grown into
                    its present forms out of beginnings accordant in kind, if not identical iη
                    substance, with those of other families; and the only question remaining to be
                    solved is, through what processes and under what governing tendencies Semitic
                    speech should have arrived at its present state. And with this solution is most
                    obviously and incontestably bound up that of the other interesting and much
                    discussed question, whether the Semitic family can be shown to be related with
                    other families, especially with our own Aryan. To some the possession in common
                    of grammatical gender, or of the classification of objects in general as
                    masculine and feminine, is of itself enough to prove such relationship; but,
                    though the fact is a striking one, and of no small importance as an indication,
                    this degree of value can by no means be attributed to it in the present state of
                    our knowledge—any more than to any other single item of structure among the
                    infinite variety of such, distributed among the multitude of human tongues. Many
                    others compare the Semitic and Aryan “roots” with one another, and believe
                    themselves to find there numerous indications of identity of material and
                    signification; but these also must pass for insufficient, until it shall prove
                    possible by their aid to work out an acceptable theory of how Semitic structure
                    should have grown out of such radical elements as underlie Aryan structure, or
                    out of the accordant initial products of a structural growth that afterwards
                    diverged into two so discordant forms. To show that, both the material and the
                    method have been hitherto wanting, and any confident decision is at least
                    premature; but present probabilities are strongly against the solubility of the
                    question. While many general considerations favour the ultimate unity of these
                    two great civilized and civilizing white races of neighbouring homes, and no
                    discordance of speech (as was shown above) can ever be made to prove their
                    diversity of origin, it seems in a high degree unlikely that the evidence of
                    speech will ever be made to prove them one. As regards the often-claimed
                    relationship of Semitic with Hamitic language, see the following section.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Hamitic Family.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The prominent
                    importance of this family is due to a single one of its members, the Egyptian;
                    in all other respects it is quite insignificant. It occupies the north-eastern
                    corner of Africa, with the border-lands of that continent stretching westward
                    along the whole shore of the Mediterranean, and southward to beyond the equator.
                    It falls into three principal divisions: (1) the ancient Egyptian, with its
                    descendant, the more modern Coptic (itself now for some centuries extinct; see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Egypt, Copts);</hi> (2) the Libyan or Berber languages of
                    northern Africa; (3) the Ethiopie languages of eastern Africa. Its situation
                    thus plainly suggests the theory of its intrusion from Asia, across the isthmus
                    of Suez, and its gradual spread from that point; and the theory is strongly
                    favoured by the physical character of the Hamites, and the historical position
                    especially of the Egyptians, so strikingly different from that of the African
                    races in general. Linguistic evidences of the relationship of Hamite with Semite
                    have also been sought, and by many believed to be found; but the maintenance of
                    the two families in their separateness is an indication that those evidences
                    have not yet been accepted as satisfactory; and such is indeed the case. The
                    Egyptian is a language of extreme simplicity of structure, almost of no
                    structure at all. Its radical words are partly monosyllabic, partly of more than
                    one syllable, but not in the latter case any more than in the former showing
                    traceable signs of extension by formative processes from simpler elements. It
                    has no derivative apparatus by which noun-stems are made from roots; the root is
                    the stem likewise; there is nothing that can be properly called either
                    declension or conjugation; and the same pronominal particles or suffixes have
                    now a subjective value, indicating use as a verb, and now a possessive,
                    indicating use as a noun. There is no method known to linguistic science by
                    which the relationship of such a tongue as this with the highly and peculiarly
                    inflective Semitic can be shown, short of a thorough working out of the history
                    of development of each family taken by itself, and a retracing in some measure
                    of the steps by which each should have arrived at its present position from a
                    common starting-point; and this has by no means been done. In short, the problem
                    of the relation of Semitic with Hamitic, not less than with Aryan, depends upon
                    that of Semitic growth, and the two must be solved together. There are striking
                    correspondences between the pronouns of the two families, such as, if supported
                    by evidences from other parts of their material, would be taken as signs of
                    relationship; but, in the absence of such support, they are not to be relied
                    upon, not till it can be shown to be possible that two languages could grow to
                    be so different in all other respects as are Egyptian and Hebrew, and yet retain
                    by inheritance corresponding pronouns. And the possession of grammatical gender
                    by Aryan, Semitic, and Hamitic speech, and by them almost alone, among all human
                    languages, though an extremely noteworthy fact, is (as was pointed out above) in
                    the present condition of linguistic science quite too weak a basis for a belief
                    in the original identity of the three families.</p>
                <p>Egyptian is limited to the delta and valley of the Nile, and is the only Hamitic
                    language which has ancient records; of the others the existing forms alone are
                    known.</p>
                <p>The Libyan or Berber division of the family occupies the inhabitable part of
                    northern Africa, so far as it has not been displaced by intrusive tongues of
                    other connexion—in later times the Arabic, which since the Mohammedan conquest
                    has been the cultivated tongue of the Mediterranean coast, while the earlier
                    Vandal, Latin, and Punic have disappeared, except in the traces they may have
                    left in Berber dialectic speech. The principal dialects are the Kabyle, tbe
                    Shiiba, and the Tuarek or Tamashek, corresponding nearly to the ancient
                    Numidian, Mauretanian, and Gaetulian respectively. Some authorities add the
                    Haussa, from farther south, while by others this is considered a Semitic, and by
                    yet others a negro tongue.</p>
                <p>The third or Ethiopie division includes as its chief members the Beja or

                    Sea north of Semitic Abyssinia, the others south of it, to the equator. By some
                    authorities (Lepsius, Bleek) there is added to the Hamitic family as a fourth
                    division a group from extreme southern Africa, the Hottentot and Bushman
                    languages. The ground of this classification is the possession by the Hottentot
                    of the distinction of grammatical gender, and even its designation by signs
                    closely corresponding to those used in the Ethiopie division. Others deny the
                    sufficiency of this evidence, and rank the Hottentot as a separate group of
                    African dialects, adding to it provisionally the Bushman, until better knowledge
                    of the latter shall show whether it is or is not a group by itself. If the
                    Hottentot be Hamitic, we shall have to suppose it cut off at a very remote
                    period from the rest of the family, and forced gradually southward, while all
                    the time suffering mixture both of speech and of blood with the negro races,
                    until the physical constitution of its speakers has become completely
                    metamorphosed, and of its original speech no signs are left save those referred
                    to above; and while such exceptional phonetic peculiarities have been worked out
                    as the use of the clicks or clucking sounds (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hottentots)</hi>: and this must be regarded as at least extremely
                    difficult.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Monosyllabic or South-eastern Asiatic Family.—</hi> This
                    body of languages may well enough be the next taken up; and here again (as was
                    the case with the preceding family) on account of the prominent importance of
                    one of its dialects and of the people speaking it—the Chinese people and
                    language. The territory of the family includes the whole south-eastern corner of
                    Asia: China on the north-east, Farther India in the south, and the high plateau
                    of Tibet, with the neighbouring Himalayan regions, to the westward. The ultimate
                    unity of all these languages rests chiefly upon the evidence of their form, as
                    being all alike essentially monosyllabic and isolating, or destitute of formal
                    structure; the material correspondences among them, of accordant words, are not
                    sufficient to prove them related. The Chinese itself can be followed up, in
                    contemporary records, to a period not far from 2000 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> and the language, the people, and their institutions, are then
                    already in the main what they have ever since continued to be (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">China);</hi> the other leading tongues come into view much
                    later, as they receive culture and religion from China on the one hand (the
                    Anamites), or from India on the other (the Tibetans, Burmese, Siamese); and the
                    territory includes great numbers of wild tribes unknown until our own times,
                    whose race-relations and languagerelations are as yet very obscure. Current
                    opinion tends to regard the Anamites, Peguans, and Cambodians as forming a more
                    nearly related group or division of the family, and as having been the earlier
                    population of Farther India, in part dispossessed and driven forward by the
                    later intrusion from the north of Siamese and Burmese, of whom the former are
                    more nearly related to the Chinese, and the latter to the Tibetans; but these
                    groupings rest as yet upon too slender evidence to be accepted with
                    confidence.</p>
                <p>The character of the languages of this family, especially as instanced by its
                    most important member, the Chinese, has been pretty fully set forth in the
                    general discussions above. They are languages of roots: that is to say, there is
                    not demonstrable in any of their words a formative part, limiting the word,
                    along with others similarly characterized, to a certain office or set of offices
                    in the formation of the sentence. That the words are ultimate roots, come down
                    from the first period of language-making, we have no reason whatever to believe;
                    and they may possibly have passed through processes of growth which equipped
                    them with some scanty supply of forms; but no evidence to that effect has yet
                    been produced. The indications relied on to show an earlier polysyllabism in the
                    family (though already in Chinese reduced to monosyllabism before the earliest
                    historical appearance of the language, some 4000 years ago) are the
                    comparatively recent loss of certain final mutes in Chinese words, and the
                    presence on a considerable scale in Tibetan spelling of added initial and final
                    consonants, now silent in the literary dialect, but claimed to be still uttered
                    in some parts of the country. If the theory connecting these phenomena be
                    established, the Tibetan will approve itself to be by far the most primitive of
                    the dialects of the family, furnishing the key to the history of the rest.</p>
                <p>For further details respecting the various tongues of the monosyllabic family,
                    the articles on tire different divisions of its territory <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(Burmaii, China, Siam, Tibet, &amp;c.)</hi> may be consulted. The languages all
                    alike show an addition to the resources of distinction possessed by languages in
                    general, in the use of tones: that is to say,, words of which the alphabetic
                    elements are the same differ in meaning according as they are uttered in a
                    higher or a lower tone, with the rising or the falling inflexion, and so on. By
                    this means, for example, the monosyllabic elements of the literary Chinese,
                    numbering but 500 as we should write them, are raised to the number of about
                    1500 words.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Ural-Altaic {Scythian, Turanian) Family. —</hi> China and
                    Tibet are bordered on the north and west by the eastern branches of another
                    immense family, which stretches through central and northern Asia into Europe,
                    overlapping the European border in Turkey, and reaching across it in Russia and
                    Scandinavia to the very shore of the Atlantic. Usage has not so definitely
                    determined as in the case of most other families by what name it shall be
                    called; Turanian is perhaps the commonest appellation, but also the most
                    objectionable. Five principal branches are generally reckoned as composing the
                    family. The two easternmost are the Tungusian, with the Manchu for its principal
                    division, and the Mongol (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mongols).</hi> Of these two
                    the language is exceedingly simple in structure, being raised but little above
                    the formlessness of the Chinese. The three others are: the Turkish or Tatar, the
                    dialects of which reach from the mouth of the Lena (Yakut) to Turkey in Europe;
                    the Samoyed, from the Altai down to the arctic shore of Asia, and along this to
                    the White Sea—an unimportant congeries of barbarous tribes; and the
                    Finno-Hungarian, including the tongues of the two cultivated peoples from which
                    it takes its name, and also those of a great part of the population of northern
                    and central Russia, to beyond the Ural Mountains, and finally the Lappish, of
                    northern Scandinavia. The nearer relation of the Samoyed is with the
                    Finno-Hungarian. The Turkish is a type of a well-developed language of purely
                    agglutinative structure: that is, lacking that higher degree of integration
                    which issues in internal change. Whether this degree is wholly wanting in
                    Finnish and Hungarian is made a question; at any rate, the languages named have
                    no reason to envy the tongues technically called “inflective.” Of a value not
                    inferior to that of inflective characteristics is one that belongs to all the
                    Ural-Altaic tongues, in varying measure and form, and helps to bind them
                    together into a single family—the harmonic sequence of vowels, namely, as
                    between root and endings, or a modification of the vowels of the endings to
                    agree with that of the root or its final syllable.</p>
                <p>While the physical race-characteristics known as Mongolian are wanting in the
                    speakers of the western dialects of this family, they are conspicuously present
                    in the people of Japan and Corea; and hence the tendency of scholars to
                    endeavour to connect the languages of the two latter countries, since they also
                    are of agglutinative structure (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Japan</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Corea),</hi> with the family now under treatment, as also with
                    one another. Neither connexion, however, can at present be regarded as
                    proved.</p>
                <p>Other languages of north-eastern Asia, too little known to group, and too
                    unimportant to treat as separate families, may be mentioned here by way of
                    appendix to their neighbours of the most diversified and widespread Asiatic
                    family. They are the Aino, of Yezo and the Kurile Islands with part of the
                    neighbouring coast; the Kamchatkan; and the Yukagir and Tchuktchi, of the
                    extreme north-east.</p>
                <p>The opinion was recently held by many scholars that the agglutinative
                    dialects—Accadian, Sumirian, &amp;c.—of the presumed founders of Mesopotamian
                    culture and teachers of the Assyrian Semites (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Babylonia)</hi> belonged to the Ural-Altaic family, and specifically to its
                    Finno-Hungarian branch; but it is believed to be now generally abandoned. The
                    mere possession of an agglutinative structure cannot be taken as proving
                    anything in the way of relationship.</p>

                    rend="italic">Family.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> This is an important body of
                    nearly and clearly related tongues, spoken by about 50,000,000 people, doubtless
                    representing the main population of all India at the time when the intrusive
                    Aryan tribes broke in from the north-west, and still filling most of the
                    southern peninsula, the Deccan, together with part of Ceylon. In an earlier
                    article (see <hi rend="smallcaps">India)</hi> the names of the dialects have
                    been given, with indication of their locality and relative importance, and with
                    some account of their leading features. They are languages of a high grade of
                    structure, and of great power and euphony; and the principal ones have enjoyed a
                    long cultivation, founded on that of the Sanskrit. As they obviously have no
                    Aryan affinities, the attempt has been made to connect them also with the
                    Ural-Altaic or Turanian family, but altogether without success, although there
                    is nothing in their style of structure that should make such connexion
                    impossible.</p>
                <p>Not all the tribes that make up the non-Aryan population of India speak Dravidian
                    dialects. The Santals and certain other wild tribes appear to be of another
                    lineage, and are now generally known as Kolarian.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Malay-Polynesian Family.—</hi> The islands, greater and
                    smaller, lying off the south-eastern coast of Asia and those scattered over the
                    Pacific, all the way from Madagascar to Easter Island, are filled with their own
                    peculiar families of languages, standing in no known relationship with those of
                    the mainland. The principal one among them is the great Malay-Polynesian family.
                    It falls into two principal divisions, Malayan and Polynesian. The Malayan
                    includes, besides the Malay proper (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Malays),</hi> which
                    occupies the Malaccan peninsula (yet doubtless not as original home of the
                    division, but by immigration from the islands), the languages also of Sumatra,
                    Java, Borneo, &amp;c., of the Philippine Islands, of Formosa, and of Madagascar,
                    together with the coasts of Celebes and other islands occupied in the interior
                    by Papuans. The Polynesian division includes most of the tongues of the
                    remaining scattered groups of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n815/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0815-0780"/> islands, and that of New Zealand. Probably to
                    these are to be added, as a third division, the Melanesian dialects of the
                    Melanesian Archipelago, of which both the physical and the linguistic
                    peculiarities would in that case be ascribed to mixture with the black Papuan
                    races. All these languages are extremely simple in phonetic form, and of a low
                    grade of structure, the Polynesian branch being in both respects the lowest, and
                    some of the Malayan dialects having reached a development considerably more
                    advanced. The radical elements are much offener of two syllables than of one,
                    and reduplication plays an important part in their extension and variation.
                    Malay literature goes back as far as to the 13th century, and there are Javan
                    records even from the early centuries of our era, the result of religion and
                    culture introduced into that island from Brahmanic India; but none of these have
                    yet been utilized, as they doubtless in time will be, for tracing out the
                    special laws of historical development prevailing in the family.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Other Oceanic Families.—</hi> At least two other families,
                    unconnected with the preceding and with one another, are found among the Pacific
                    islands, and. only there. The continental island of Australia, with its
                    dependency Tasmania (where, however, the native tongue has now become extinct),
                    has its own body of probably related dialects, as its own physical type. They
                    have been but imperfectly investigated, their importance, except to the
                    professed student of language, being nothing; but they are not destitute of a
                    rude agglutinative structure of their own. Still less known are the Papuan or
                    Negrito languages, belonging to the black race with frizzled hair inhabiting
                    most of New Guinea, and found also in the interior of some of the other islands,
                    having been driven from the coasts by superior intruders of the Malay race.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Caucasian Languages.—</hi> Of the existing languages of Asia
                    there remain to be mentioned only those of the Caucasian mountains and
                    highlands, between the Black and Caspian Seas, pressed upon the north by
                    Slavonians and Turks, upon the south by Armenians and Kurds and Turks. Its
                    situation makes of the Caucasus a natural eddy in all .movements of emigration
                    between Asia and Europe; and its linguistic condition is as if remnants of many
                    families otherwise extinct had been stranded and preserved there. The dialects
                    north of the principal range—Circassian, Mitsjeghian, Lesghian, &amp;c.—have not
                    been proved to be related either to one another or to those of the south. Among
                    the latter, the Georgian is much the most widespread and important (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Georgia),</hi> and, alone among them all, possesses a
                    literature. The Caucasian dialects present many exceptional and difficult
                    features, and are in great part of so high a grade of structure as to have been
                    allowed the epithet inflective by those who attach special importance to the
                    distinction thus expressed.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Remnants of Families in Europe.—</hi> The Basque people of
                    the western Pyrenees, at the angle of the Bay of Biscay, are shown by their
                    speech to be an isolated remnant of some race which was doubtless once much more
                    widely spread, but has now everywhere else lost its separate identity; as such
                    it is of extreme interest to the ethnologist. The Basque language appears to be
                    unrelated to any other on earth. It is of a very highly agglutinative structure,
                    being equalled in intricacy of combination only by a part of the American
                    dialects. Limited as it is in territory, it falls into a number of well-marked
                    dialects, so that it also may not be refused the name of a “family.”</p>
                <p>The only other case of the kind worth noting is that of the Etruscan language of
                    northern central Italy, which long ago became extinct, in consequence of the
                    conquest and absorption of Etruria by Rome, but which still exists in numerous
                    brief inscriptions (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Etruria).</hi> Many attempts have
                    been made to connect the language with other families, and it has even quite
                    recently been pronounced Aryan or Indo-European, of the Italican branch, by
                    scholars of high rank; yet it is altogether likely to be finally acknowledged,
                    like the Basque, as an isolated fragment.</p>
                <p>In order to complete this review of the languages of the Old World it only
                    remains to notice those of Africa which have not been already mentioned. They
                    are grouped under two heads: the languages of the south and those of the centre
                    of the continent.</p>
                <p>11. <hi rend="italic">South-African or Bantu Family.—</hi> This is a very
                    extensive and distinctly marked family, occupying (except the Hottentot and
                    Bushman territory) the whole southern peninsula of the continent from some
                    degrees north of the equator. It has been already partly described under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Kaffraria,</hi> and will be treated more in detail under the
                    head of <hi rend="smallcaps">Zulu).</hi> It is held apart from all other known
                    families of language by a single prominent characteristic — the extent to which
                    it makes use of prefixes instead of suffixes as the apparatus of grammatical
                    distinction; its inflexion, both declensional and conjugational, is by appended
                    elements which precede the stem or root. The most conspicuous part of this is
                    the variety of prefixes, different in singular and plural, by which the various
                    classes or genders (not founded on sex; the ground of classification is
                    generally obscure) of nouns are distinguished; these then reappear in the other
                    members of the sentence, as adjectives and verbs and pronouns, which are
                    determined by the noun, thus producing an alliterative concord that runs through
                    the sentence.</p>
                <p>The pronominal determinants of the verb, both subject and object, also come
                    before it; but the determinants of mode of action, as causative, &amp;c., are
                    mostly suffixed. The language in general is rich in the means of formal
                    distinction. Those dialects which border on the Hottentots have, apparently by
                    derivation from the latter, the clicks or clucking-sounds which form a
                    conspicuous part of the Hottentot spoken alphabet.</p>
                <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Central African Languages.—</hi> The remaining languages of
                    Africa form a broad band across the centre of the continent, between the Bantu
                    on the south and the Hamitic on the east and north. They are by no means to be
                    called a family, but rather a great mass of dialects, numbering by hundreds, of
                    varying structure, as to the relations of which there is great discordance of
                    opinion even among the most recent and competent authorities. It is no place
                    here to enter into the vexed questions of African linguistics, or even to report
                    the varying views upon the subject; that would require a space wholly
                    disproportioned to the importance of African speech in the general sum of human
                    language. There is no small variety of physical type as well as of speech in the
                    central belt; and, partly upon the evidence of lighter tint and apparently
                    higher endowment, certain races are set off and made a separate division of;
                    such is the Nuba-Fulah division of F. Müller, rejected by Lepsius. The latter
                    regarded all the varieties of physical and linguistic character in the central
                    belt as due to mixture between pure Africans of the south and Hamites of the
                    north and east; but this is at present an hypothesis only, and a very improbable
                    one, since it implies modes and results of mixture to which no analogies are
                    quotable from languages whose history is known; nor does it appear at all
                    probable that the collision of two races and types of speech should produce such
                    an immense and diverse body of transitional types. It is far from impossible
                    that the present prominence of the South-African or Bantu family may be
                    secondary, due to the great expansion under favouring circumstances of a race
                    once having no more importance than belongs now to many of the Central-African
                    races, and speaking a tongue which differed from theirs only as theirs differed
                    from one another. None of the Central-African languages is a prefix-language in
                    the same degree as the Bantu, and in many of them prefixes play no greater part
                    than in the world’s languages in general; others show special forms or traces of
                    the prefix - structure; and some have features of an extraordinary character,
                    hardly to be paralleled elsewhere. One group in the east (Oigob, &amp;c. ) has a
                    gender distinction, involving that of sex, but really founded on relative power
                    and dignity: things disparaged, including women, are put in one class; things
                    extolled, including men, are put in the other. This is perhaps the most
                    significant hint anywhere to be found of how a genderdistinction like that in
                    our own Aryan languages, which we usually regard as being essentially a
                    distinction of sex, while in fact it only includes such, may have arisen. Common
                    among the African languages, as among many other families, especially the
                    American, is a generic distinction between animate beings and inanimate
                    things.</p>
                <p>13. <hi rend="italic">American Languages.—</hi> With these the case is closely
                    the same as with the Central-African languages: there is an immense number of
                    dialects, of greatly varied structure, of which as yet even the nearer groupings
                    are only in part made out, while the grade and kind of relationship between the
                    groups, if such there exist, is wholly unclear. Some general statements
                    respecting American languages have been given under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >America,</hi> and a detailed list and classification of them in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Indians;</hi> hence it is unnecessary to go over the subject
                    again in this place. What we most need to note is the very narrow limitation of
                    our present knowledge. Even among neighbouring families like the Algonquin,
                    Iroquois, and Dakota, whose agreement in style of structure (polysynthetic),
                    taken in connexion with the accordant race-type of their speakers, forbids us to
                    regard them as ultimately different, no material correspondence, agreement in
                    words and meanings, is to be traced; and there are in America all the degrees of
                    polysynthetism, down to the lowest, and even to its entire absence. Such being
                    the case, it ought to be evident to every one accustomed to deal with this class
                    of subjects that all attempts to connect American languages as a body with
                    languages of the Old World are and must be fruitless; in fact, all discussions
                    of the matter are at present unscientific, and are tolerably certain to continue
                    so through all time to come.</p>

                    ARYAN LANGUAGES.</p>
                <p>The study of Aryan comparative philology has from its outset necessarily been in
                    close connexion with the study of Sanskrit, a language unparalleled amongst its
                    cognates in antiquity and distinctness of structure, and consequently the
                    natural basis of comparison in this field. It is therefore not to be wondered at
                    that we find no clear views of the mutual relationship of the individual members
                    of the Aryan family or their position with regard to other languages until
                    Sanskrit began to attract the attention of European philologists, or that the
                    introduction of Sanskrit as an object of study was closely followed by the
                    discovery of the original community of a vast range of languages and dialects
                    hitherto not brought into connexion at all, or only made the objects of baseless
                    speculations. We meet with the first clear conception of this idea of an
                    Indo-European community of languages in the distinguished English scholar Sir
                    William Jones, who, as early as 1786, expressed himself as follows: “The
                    Sanskrit language, whatever may be its antiquity, is of wonderful structure;
                    more perfect than the Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely
                    refined than either, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in
                    the roots of verbs and in the forms of grammar, than could have been produced by
                    accident; so strong that no philologer could examine all the three without
                    believing them to have sprung from some common source which, perhaps, no longer
                    exists. There is a similar reason, though not quite so forcible, for supposing
                    that both the Gothic and the Celtic, though blended with a different idiom, had
                    the same origin with the Sanskrit.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>For this quotation and the following historical sketch in
                    general see Th. Benfey, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der

                    neither Sir William Jones nor any of his older contemporaries who had arrived at
                    similar conclusions ever raised this important discovery from a brilliant <hi
                    rend="italic">aperçu</hi> into a valid scientific theory through a detailed and
                    systematic comparison of the languages in question. To have achieved this is the
                    undoubted merit of the German, Franz <hi rend="smallcaps">Bopp</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.vf,</hi> the founder of scientific philology of the Aryan
                    languages, and subsequently through this example also the founder of comparative
                    philology in general. Next to him Jacob <hi rend="smallcaps">Grimm</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.vf</hi> must be mentioned here as the father of historical
                    grammar. The first part of his famous <hi rend="italic">Deutsche</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Grammatik</hi> appeared in 1819, three years after Bopp had
                    published his first epoch-making book, <hi rend="italic">Ueber das
                    Conjugationssystem</hi><hi rend="italic">der Sanskritsprache.</hi> Bopp’s
                    results were here at once utilized, yet Grimm’s whole system was entirely
                    independent of that of Bopp, and had no doubt been worked out before Grimm knew
                    of his illustrious predecessor. In fact, their scientific aims and methods were
                    totally different. Bopp’s interest was not concentrated in comparison as such,
                    but chiefly inclined towards the explanation of the origin of grammatical forms,
                    and comparison to him was only a means of approaching that end. »</p>
                <p>In this more or less speculative turn of his interest Bopp showed himself the
                    true son of a philosophical period when general linguistics received its
                    characteristic stamp from the labours and endeavours of men like the two
                    Schlegels and Wilhelm von Humboldt. Jacob Grimm’s aims were of a less lofty
                    character than those of Bopp, whose work, to his own mind, was crowned by his
                    theory of the origin of inflexion through agglutination. In confining his task
                    to a more limited range than the vast field of Aryan languages embraced in
                    Bopp’s researches, and thus fixing his attention on a group of idioms exhibiting
                    a striking regularity in their mutual relationship, both where they coincide and
                    where they differ, he made it his foremost object to investigate and illustrate
                    the continuous progress, subject to definite laws, by which these languages had
                    been developed from their common source. He thus raised the hitherto neglected
                    study of the development of sounds to an equal level with the study of
                    grammatical forms, which had so far almost exclusively absorbed all the interest
                    of linguistic research. Grimm’s discovery of the so-called “Lautverschiebung,”
                    or Law of the Permutation of Consonants in the Teutonic languages (which,
                    however, had been partly found and proclaimed before Grimm by the Danish scholar
                    Rask), became especially important as a stimulus for further investigation in
                    this line. Grimm’s influence on comparative philology (which is secondary only
                    to that of Bopp, although he was never a comparative philologist in the sense
                    that Bopp was, and did not always derive the benefit from Bopp’s works which
                    they might have afforded him) is clearly traceable in the work of Bopp’s
                    successors, amongst whom Friedrich August Pott is universally judged to hold the
                    foremost rank. In his great work, <hi rend="italic">Etymologische Forschungen
                    auf dem Gebiete der indo-germanischen Sprachen, mit besonderem Bezug auf die

                    scientific investigation of general Indo-Germanic phonology. Amongst Pott’s
                    contemporaries Theodor Benfey<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Theodor Benfey was born on 28th January 1809 at Nörten,
                    Hanover, the son of a Jewish tradesman who had gained some reputation as an
                    acute and learned Talmudic scholar. At the early age of sixteen he entered the
                    university of Göttingen (which he afterwards exchanged for Munich) to devote
                    himself to the study of classical philology. It was not until after 1830, when
                    he had settled in Frankfort-on-the-Main as a private teacher, that his attention
                    was drawn towards the study of Sanskrit. In 1834 he went back to Göttingen and
                    began lecturing as a privat-docent. For some time his lectures extended over
                    various branches of classical philology as well as of Oriental and comparative
                    philology, but he soon began to concentrate himself on the latter departments.
                    After he had joined the Christian church he received, in 1848, an extraordinary
                    professorship, and in 1862 he was appointed ordinary professor of Sanskrit and
                    comparative philology. He died on 26th June 1881. Benfey also began his long and
                    brilliant literary career in the field of classics. Besides his dissertation <hi

                    comedies of Terence (Stuttgart, 1837) deserves special notice. This was followed
                    by his <hi rend="italic">Wurzellexikon</hi> in 1839, and his quarto volume on
                    “India” in Erseh and Gruber’s <hi rend="italic">Encyklopädie,</hi> 1840. Through
                    these he at once gained a position of authority both in comparative and Indian

                    to the different branches of Aryan philology, especially assisted and promoted
                    in their work by the rapidly progressing Vedic (and Λvestic) studies that had
                    been inaugurated by Rosen, Roth, Benfey, Westergaard, Müller, Kuhn, Aufrecht,
                    and others. Moreover, new foundations had been laid for the study of the
                    Slavonic languages by Miklosich and Schleicher, of Lithuanian by Kurschat and
                    Schleicher, of Celtic by Zeuss. Of the classical languages Greek had found a
                    most distinguished representative in Curtius, while Corssen, Mommsen, Aufrecht,
                    Kirchhoff, <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> fcc., had collected most valuable
                    materials towards the elucidation of Latin and the cognate Italic idioms. In his
                    <hi rend="italic">Compendium</hi> Schleicher undertook and solved the difficult
                    task of sifting down the countless details amassed since the days of Bopp and
                    Grimm, and thus making the individual languages stand out clearly on their
                    common background, while Bopp’s attention had been especially occupied with what
                    was common to all Indo-Germanic tongues. There are two prominent features which
                    characterize this part of Schleicher’s work,—his assumption and partial
                    reconstruction of a prehistoric parent-speech, from which the separate
                    Indo-Germanic languages were supposed to have sprung, and the establishment of a
                    long series of phonetic laws, regulating the changes by which that development
                    of the individual idioms had taken place. On Schleicher’s views of and
                    contribution^ towards general comparative philology (which he erroneously
                    proposed to consider as a branch of natural science) we need not enter here.</p>
                <p>For some time after Schleicher’s premature death (in 1868) Indo-Germanic
                    philology continued in paths indicated by him and Curtius, with the exception,
                    perhaps, of the school founded by Benfey, who had always stood on independent
                    ground. The difference between the two schools, however, was less strikingly
                    marked in their writings, because it chiefly concerns general views of language
                    and the Indo-Germanic languages in particular, although the characteristic task
                    of the period alluded to was that of working out the more minute details of
                    comparison; but behind all this the general interest still clung to Bopp’s old
                    glottogonic problems. Lately, however, a new movement has begun, and a younger
                    school of linguists has sprung up who are united in their opposition to many
                    theories of the older generation, yet often differ materially both with regard
                    to method and the solution of individual problems. 1n its present state this
                    younger school (often branded with the name of Neo-Grammarians,
                    “Junggrammatiker,” by its opponents real and imaginary) is marked by certain
                    distinct tendencies. In the first place, they are inclined more or less to
                    abandon glottogonic problems as insoluble, if not for ever, yet for the present
                    and with the scanty means that Aryan philology alone can furnish for this
                    purpose. In this they are in opposition to the whole of the older school. In the
                    second place, they object to the use bf all misleading metaphorical comparisons
                    of processes in the history of language with processes of organic
                    development,—comparisons used at all times, but especially cherished by
                    Schleicher. In the third place—and this has been of the greatest practical
                    importance—they hold that our general views of language and our methods of
                    comparison should be formed after a careful study of the living languages,
                    because these alone are fully controllable in every minute detail, and can
                    therefore alone give us a clear insight into the working of the different motive
                    forces which shape and modify language, and that the history of earlier periods
                    of language, consequently, can only be duly illustrated by tracing out the share
                    which each of these forces has had in every individual case of change. Of these
                    forces two are found to be especially prominent — phonetic variation and
                    formation by analogy. They generally work in turns and often in opposition to
                    one another, the former frequently tending to differentiation of earlier
                    unities, the latter to abolition of earlier differences, especially to
                    restoration of conformity disturbed by phonetic change. There are, however,
                    other important differences in the action of the two forces. Phonetic change
                    affects exclusively the pronunciation of a language by substituting one sound or
                    sound-group for another. From this simple fact it is self-evident that phonetic
                    changes as such admit of no exceptions. Pronunciation—that is, the use of
                    certain sounds in certain combinations—is perfectly unconscious in natural
                    unstudied speech, and every speaker or generation of speakers has only one way
                    of utterance for individual sounds or their combinations. If, therefore, a given
                    sound was once changed into another under given circumstances, the new sound
                    must necessarily and unconsciously replace its predecessor in every word that
                    falls under the same rules, because the older sound ceases to be practised and
                    therefore disappears from the language. Thus, for instance, the sound of the
                    short so-called Italian <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in English has become exchanged
                    for the peculiarly English sound in <hi rend="italic">man, hat,</hi> àc., which
                    is so exclusively used and practised now by English speakers that they feel
                    great difficulty in pronouncing the Italian sound, which at an earlier period
                    was almost as frequent in English as in any other language that has preserved
                    the Italian sound up to the present day. Again, the sound of the so-called long
                    English <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in <hi rend="italic">make, paper,</hi> àc.,
                    although once a monophthong, is now pronounced as a diphthong, combining the
                    sounds of the English short <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >i,</hi> and no trace of the old monophthong is left, except where it was
                    followed by <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic">hare, mare</hi>
                    (also <hi rend="italic">air, their, where,</hi> Arc.), where the <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> has a broader sound somewhat approaching that of the short
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in <hi rend="italic">hat.</hi> This last instance may
                    at the same time serve to illustrate the restrictions made above as to sounds
                    changing their pronunciation in certain groups or combinations, or under given
                    circumstances only. We may learn from it that phonetic change need not always
                    affect the same original sound in the same way in all its combinations, but that
                    neighbouring sounds often influence the special direction in which the sound is
                    modified. The different sounds of the English <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">make</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hare</hi> are both equivalents of
                    the same Old English sound <hi rend="italic">d</hi> ( = the Italian short <hi
                    rend="italic">a)</hi> in <hi rend="italic">maciaη, hara.</hi> The latter sound
                    lias <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n818/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0818-0783"/> been split in two, but this process again has
                    taken place with perfect regularity, the one sound appearing before <hi
                    rend="italic">r,</hi> the other before all other consonants. It is easy to see
                    that the common practice of comprising the history of the Old English <hi
                    rend="italic">ä</hi> in the one rule,—that it was changed into the sound of the
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in <hi rend="italic">make</hi> except when followed by
                    an r,—can only be defended on the practical ground that this rule is convenient
                    to remember, because the words exhibiting the former change are more numerous
                    than the instances of the latter; apart from this there is nothing to justify
                    the assumption that one of these changes is the rule and the other the
                    exception. The fact is, that we have two independent cases of change, which
                    ought to be stated in two distinct and independent rules according to the
                    different positions in which the original <hi rend="italic">a</hi> stood before
                    the splitting began. It is also easy to observe that the variety of modifying
                    influences may be much more manifold than in the present instance of <hi
                    rend="italic">make</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hare,</hi> and that the number of
                    special phonetic rules in such cases must be increased in proportion to the
                    progress made in the investigation of the said modifying powers. In this respect
                    much still remains to be done, but what has been achieved is more than
                    sufficient to prove the correctness of the statement from which we started
                    above, that phonetic rules in themselves are without exceptions, however often
                    phonetic processes may have been crossed and more or less effaced by
                    non-phonetic influences in actual (especially literary) language, such as
                    mixture of dialects, formation by analogy, and the like.</p>
                <p>Analogical change, on the other hand, does not affect the pronunciation of a
                    language as a whole in the way phonetic change does, but is confined to the
                    formation and inflexion of single words or groups of words, and therefore very
                    apt to bear an entirely arbitrary and irregular character. A few instances will
                    be sufficient to illustrate this. In Old English a certain number of
                    substantives formed their plurals by mutation of the root-vowels, as <hi
                    rend="italic">fót—fét</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bôc— bee.</hi> In Modern English
                    this system of inflexion has been preserved in some cases, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">foot—feet,</hi> and altered in others as <hi rend="italic"
                    >book—books.</hi> Now, while <hi rend="italic">foot, feet,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">book</hi> are the regular modern phonetic equivalents of the old
                    <hi rend="italic">fót, fét, bôc,</hi> the plural <hi rend="italic">books</hi>
                    can in no way be phonetically traced back to the old <hi rend="italic">bee,</hi>
                    the phonetical equivalent of which in Modern English would be <hi rend="italic"
                    >*beech.</hi> The only possible explanation of a form like <hi rend="italic"
                    >books</hi> is that the older <hi rend="italic">bee</hi> was at some date given
                    up and replaced by an entirely new formation, shaped after the analogy of the
                    numerous words with a plural in -s without modification of the root-vowel. That
                    this should have been done in the case of <hi rend="italic">book,</hi> but not
                    in that of <hi rend="italic">foot,</hi> is an accident, which must be accepted
                    as a fact not allowing of any special explanation. Let us now take another
                    instance from the English verb. In Old English the different persons of the
                    preterite indicative in the so-called strong (irregular) verbs were generally
                    distinguished by different root-vowels; <hi rend="italic">rídan,</hi> “to ride,”
                    and <hi rend="italic">bindan,</hi> “to bind,” for instance, form their
                    preterites thus: <hi rend="italic">ic rád, &lt;5 a ride, he rád, ιve, ge, his
                    ridon,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ic band,</hi> öá <hi rend="italic">bunde, he
                    band, we, ge, his bundon.</hi> In Modern English this difference in the
                    root-vowels has been abandoned, and <hi rend="italic">rode, bound</hi> now stand
                    for all persons, <hi rend="italic">rode</hi> being the modern phonetic
                    equivalent of the 1st and 3d sing, <hi rend="italic">rád,</hi> while <hi
                    rend="italic">bound</hi> represents the «-forms of <hi rend="italic"
                    >bindan.</hi> Inasmuch as a similar process of levelling has been carried
                    through in all preterites of Modern English, regularity prevails even here. But
                    when we look to its results in the individual verbs we soon find that the choice
                    amongst the different forms which might have served as starting-points has been
                    entirely arbitrary. It is indeed impossible to say why the old singular form
                    should have been chosen as a model in one case, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >rode,</hi> and the old plural form in another, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >bound.</hi> From these and numerous similar instances we must draw the
                    conclusion that it is beyond our power to ascertain whence analogical changes
                    may start, and to what extent they may be carried through when once begun. All
                    we can do is to carefully classify the single cases that come under our
                    observation, and in this way to investigate where such changes are especially
                    apt to take place and what is their general direction. As to the latter points,
                    it has been observed before that levelling of existing differences is one of the
                    chief features in analogical change (as in the case of <hi rend="italic"
                    >rode</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bound).</hi> As to the former, it must be borne
                    in mind that, before any analogical change can take place, some mental connexion
                    must exist between the words or forms serving as models and those which are
                    remodelled after the types suggested to the mind of the speakers through the
                    former. Of such natural mental combinations two classes deserve especial notice:
                    the mutual relationship in which the different, say inflexional, forms of the
                    same word stand to each other, and the more abstract analogies between the
                    inflexional systems of word-groups bearing a similar character, as, for
                    instance, the different declensions of nouns and pronouns, or the different
                    conjugations of verbs. The instance of <hi rend="italic">rode, bound</hi> may
                    serve to illustrate the former category, that of <hi rend="italic">books</hi>
                    the latter. In the first case a levelling has taken place between the different
                    forms of the root-vowels once exhibited in the different preterite forms of <hi
                    rend="italic">ridan</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bindan,</hi> which clearly
                    constitute a natural group or mental unity in consequence of their meaning. The
                    form of <hi rend="italic">rode</hi> as a plural has simply been taken from the
                    old singular, that of <hi rend="italic">bound</hi> as a singular from the old
                    plural. In the case of <hi rend="italic">book—books</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                    >bôc—bee,</hi> this explanation would fall short. Although we might say that the
                    vowel of the singular here was carried into the plural, yet this would not
                    explain the plural -s. So it becomes evident that the old declension of <hi
                    rend="italic">bôc—bee</hi> was remodelled after the declension of words like <hi
                    rend="italic">arm—arms,</hi> which had always formed their plurals in -s.
                    Isolated words or forms, on the other hand, which are no part of natural groups
                    or systems, inflexional or formative, must be regarded as commonly safe from
                    alterations through analogy, and are therefore of especial value with regard to
                    establishing rules of purely phonetic development.</p>
                <p>It is true that the distinction between phonetic and analogical change has always
                    been acknowledged in comparative philology. At the same time it cannot be denied
                    that analogical changes were for a long time treated with a certain disdain and
                    contempt, as deviations from the only course of development then allowed to be
                    truly “organic” and natural, namely, that of gradual phonetic change (hence the
                    epithet “false” so constantly attached to analogy in former times). Amongst
                    those who have recently contributed most towards a more correct evaluation of
                    analogy as a motive-power in language, Professor Whitney must be mentioned in
                    the first place. In Germany Professor Scherer <hi rend="italic">(Zur Geschichte
                    der deutschen Sprache,</hi> 1868) was the first to apply analogy as a principle
                    of explanation on a larger scale, but in a wilful and unsystematic way. Hence he
                    failed to produce an immediate and lasting impression, and the merit of having
                    introduced into the practice of modern comparative philology a strictly
                    systematic consideration of both phonetic and analogic change as co-ordinate
                    factors in the development of language rests with Professor Leskien of Leipsic,
                    and a number of younger scholars who had more or less experienced his personal
                    influence. Amongst these Brugmann, Osthoff, and Paul rank foremost as the most
                    vigorous and successful defenders of the new method, the correctness of which
                    has since been practically acknowledged by most of the leading philologists of

                <p>From this historical sketch we may now proceed to a short examination of some of
                    the chief results of Aryan comparative philology.</p>
                <p>The most prominent achievement of the researches of Bopp and his followers was to
                    prove that the majority of the European languages and dialects, together with a
                    certain number of important languages spoken in Asia, form one great
                    family,—that is, that they have sprung from one common source or
                    parent-language. The name now mostly used in England for this community is <hi
                    rend="italic">Aryan languages.</hi> American and French scholars generally
                    prefer to say <hi rend="italic">Indo-European languages,</hi> while the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Indo-Germanic languages</hi> is still almost universally used
                    in Germany. It is hard to decide for or against any of these names from a
                    scientific point of view. The word <hi rend="italic">IndoGermanic</hi> was not
                    inappropriately coined by combining the names of the most easterly and westerly
                    members of the family, the Indian and the Germanic or Teutonic group.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The word <hi rend="italic"
                    >Indo</hi><hi rend="italic">-Germanic,</hi> it is true, was invented before the
                    Celtic languages were known to belong to the same family. But even after that
                    discovery it was unnecessary to substitute the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >IndoCeltic</hi> as some authors have tried to do; for certainly the most
                    westerly branch of Indo-Germanic in Europe (disregarding the Aryan colonies in
                    America) is Icelandic, an undoubtedly Germanic language. Other names, such as
                    <hi rend="italic">Japhetic</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Sanskritic,</hi> have
                    hardly found any use in scientific literature.</p></note><hi rend="italic"
                    >Indo-European</hi> seems to be a less lucky invention, as this combination of
                    geographical names would erroneously point to all the languages of India and
                    Europe as the constituents of our family, while a large number both of Indian
                    and European idioms belong to entirely unrelated groups of languages. <hi
                    rend="italic">Aryan</hi> would no doubt be the best name in itself, for it seems
                    that the primitive forefathers of the Aryan nations used the word <hi
                    rend="italic">Âria</hi> as a national name themselves. We find at least the
                    Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">Årya</hi> thus used in India, and similarly the Old
                    Persian <hi rend="italic">Ariya</hi> (in the cuneiform inscriptions of <hi

                    word <hi rend="italic">Aryan</hi> came to be applied in the sense defined above
                    it had for some time been used, and it is still largely used, in a more
                    restricted sense as the special collective name for the languages of the Indian
                    and Persian or Iranian groups of the Indo-Germanic family. This ambiguity
                    renders the use of the word <hi rend="italic">Aryan</hi> less recommendable than
                    it would be had its meaning been properly fixed from the beginning. It seems
                    that outside of England <hi rend="italic">Aryan</hi> will hardly gain ground;
                    some recent attempts to introduce the name into Germany have utterly failed, and
                    in the same way the other nations who share in scientific research in this
                    demesne cling to the older names.</p>
                <p>This large Indo-Germanic or Aryan family, then, to revert to our principal task,
                    consists of ten groups or sub families of languages, three of which are located

                    its various branches being the mother of the modern Indian dialects of Aryan

                    group, but at the same time shares several important characteristics of the
                    European languages, so that it cannot be classed as a subdivision of either of

                    modern state of utter decay, it is extremely difficult to obtain definite
                    results concerning its origin and position relatively to the surrounding
                    languages. Bopp seems to have proved, however, that Albanian actually is an

                    Latin, from which the modern Romance languages have sprung. Closely connected
                    with Latin was the Faliscan dialect, which is preserved in a few inscriptions
                    only. A second branch of Italic is formed by Umbrian and Oscan, both of which
                    soon became extinct through the overpowering influence of Latin, like the other

                <p>7. The <hi rend="italic">Celtic Family,</hi> once covering a large part of
                    western Europe, but now reduced to comparatively scanty remnants in the
                    north-west of France and in the British islands. Among its extinct members the
                    language of the Galatians in Asia Minor may be mentioned, of which little more
                    is known than that it was Celtic. The earliest documents of Celtic speech we
                    possess are some inscriptions in the idiom of the Gallic inhabitants of France
                    and northern Italy. The surviving branches of Celtic show a clear division into
                    two groups: the Northern or Gaelic group, formed by Irish, Gaelic or Scotch, and
                    Manx, and a Southern or Britannic group, consisting of Welsh or Cymric, Cornish
                    (extinct since 1778), and Armorican or Bas Breton in Brittany. The fundamental
                    authority for the comparative study of Celtic grammar is Zeuss, <hi
                    rend="italic">Grammatica Celtica,</hi> 1853 (2d ed. by H. Ebel, 1871). After
                    Zeuss, Stokes and Rhys in England, Ascoli in Italy, Ebel, Windisch, and Zimmer
                    in Germany, and D’Arbois de Jubainville and H. Gaidoz in France have been the
                    chief contributors to this field of research. The last-named is also the editor
                    of a periodical especially devoted to Celtic studies, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Revue</hi><hi rend="italic">Celtique</hi> (Paris, from 1870).<note

                    This well-developed family is divided into two main groups, which are now
                    commonly denoted Eastern and Western Germanic. The members of the former are
                    Gothic (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Gothic Language,</hi> vol. x. p. 852 <hi
                    rend="italic">sqf)</hi> and Scandinavian, with an eastern and a western
                    subdivision, the former comprising Swedish and Danish, the latter Norse and
                    Icelandic. Western Germanic, on the other hand, consists of English, Frisian
                    (these two seem to form a separate branch), Saxon or Low German, Frankish
                    (including Dutch), and Upper German (see article <hi rend="smallcaps">German
                    Language).</hi> The dialects of the numerous other Teutonic tribes not mentioned
                    here have died out without leaving sufficient materials for linguistic
                    classification.</p>
                <p>9. The <hi rend="italic">Baltic Family,</hi> comprising three distinct idioms
                    —Prussian, Lithuanian, and Lettish. Prussian became extinct in the 16th century.
                    The few specimens of this highly interesting language which have been preserved
                    are collected by Nessehnann, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Sprache
                    der alten Preussen</hi> (Königsberg, 1845), and <hi rend="italic">Ein

                    same author has also published a dictionary, <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus linguae
                    Prussicae.</hi> (Berlin, 1873). Amongst other contributions to Prussian grammar,
                    Bopp’s essay, <hi rend="italic">Ueber die</hi><hi rend="italic">Sprache der
                    Altpreussen</hi> (Berlin, 1853), is especially noteworthy. Of the two other
                    branches, Lithuanian is the more important for comparative philology. The chief
                    grammars are those by Schleicher <hi rend="italic">(Handbuch der litauischen

                <p>10. The <hi rend="italic">Slavonic Family.</hi> There are two main branches of
                    Slavonic. The so-called Southern or South-Eastern branch embraces Russian,
                    Ruthenian (in Galicia), Bulgarian, Servian, Croatian, and Slovenian. The second
                    branch is generally designated by the name of Western Slavonic. It is chiefly
                    represented by Cechish or Bohemian and Polish. With the former the Sorbian
                    dialects spoken in Lusatia are very closely connected. Polish, again, is
                    subdivided into Eastern Polish or Polish Proper and Western Polish, a few
                    remnants of which now survive in the Kas-subian dialects of Prussia. About the
                    extinct members of this last group, which are generally comprehended under the
                    name of Polabian dialects, Schleicher’s <hi rend="italic">Laut-und Formenlehre
                    der</hi><hi rend="italic">polαbischeη</hi><hi rend="italic">Sprache</hi> (St
                    Petersburg, 1871) and an article by Leskien in <hi rend="italic">Im neuen
                    Reich,</hi> ii. p. 325, may be consulted. The oldest Slavonic texts, some of
                    which go as far back as the 10th century, are a number of books destined for the
                    use of the church. From this circumstance the peculiar dialect in which they are
                    written is often called Church Slavonic. Schleicher and others identify this
                    dialect with Old Bulgarian, while Miklosich thinks it should be classed as Old
                    Slovenian. For comparative purposes as well as for Slavonic philology this idiom
                    is the most important. The chief grammars are Schleicher, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Formenlehre der</hi><hi rend="italic">kirchenslavischen</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sprache</hi> (Bonn, 1852); Miklosich, <hi rend="italic">Laut-und Formenlehre

                    (Vienna, 1850); and Leskien, <hi rend="italic">Handbuch der altbulgarischen
                    Sprache</hi> (Vienna, 1871). The fundamental works on comparative Slavonic
                    philology are Miklosich, <hi rend="italic">Vergleichende Grammatik der
                    slawischen Sprachen</hi> (4 vols., Vienna, 1852-68; 2d ed. of vol. i., <hi
                    rend="italic">Lautlehre,</hi> 1879), and <hi rend="italic">Lexicon
                    Palaeoslovenico-Graeco-Latinum</hi> (Vienna, 1862-65). A large number of special
                    contributions are collected in Jagic, <hi rend="italic">Archiv für slawische
                    Philologie</hi> (Berlin, from 1876).</p>
                <p>The mutual relationship of these ten families may be shortly characterized by
                    saying that they are dialects of the primitive Aryan parent-speech, which at an
                    early period of its existence must have formed a linguistic unity, but
                    subsequently became dissolved into these subdivisions. This fundamental view now
                    seems to be universally admitted to be correct. But it is extremely difficult to
                    go beyond it in attempts to trace out the history of the process of dissolution.
                    One problem offering itself at the very outset of such an attempt (although more
                    of an ethnological than philological character) must at once be dismissed as
                    insoluble,—the question of the original home of our Aryan forefathers and the
                    directions of the wanderings that brought the single members of the great
                    original tribe to the seats occupied in historical times by the several Aryan
                    nations. There exist indeed no means for deciding whether they came from the
                    north-eastern part of the Iranian plateau near the Hindu-Kush Mountains, as was
                    once generally assumed, or whether Europe may boast of being the mother of the
                    Aryan nationality, as some authors are now inclined to believe.<note

                    the fact that some of these ten families stand in closer relationship with
                    certain others than with the rest, so that they seem to form separate
                    independent groups, and yet these groups cannot be severed from the rest without
                    overlooking important linguistic facts which seem to speak for the existence of
                    a closer connexion between single members of one group and single members or the
                    whole of another. Before attention was drawn to this latter point it was easy
                    enough to account for the origin of the grouping alluded to. If everything that
                    is common to all Aryan languages must have originated in the common
                    parent-speech—and the correctness of this assumption can hardly be doubted—then
                    everything that is common to all the families of one particular group, but
                    strange to the others, must be assigned to a period when these families formed a
                    unity by themselves and were disconnected with the other stock. The fact, for
                    instance, that all the European languages possess the three vowels <hi
                    rend="italic">a, e, o,</hi> where the Indian and Iranian group show the uniform
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which was then believed to be the primitive <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n821/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0821-0786"/> sound, seemed to indicate that the primitive
                    Aryan stock had once been split into two halves, one of which remained in Asia
                    and retained the primitive α-sound, while the other half emigrated to Europe and
                    there developed the new vowel-system, before any new divisions took place. The
                    Aryan parent-speech would thus appear to have been split into a European and an
                    Asiatic “base-language.” Similar facts in the history of the single European
                    languages then led to the further assumption of a southern European base as the
                    parent of Greek, Italic, and Celtic, and a northern European base for Germanic,
                    Baltic, and Slavonic, and, with further subdivision, an Italo-Celtic and a
                    Litu-Slavic base for Italic and Celtic on the one hand and for Baltic and
                    Slavonic on the other. The prehistoric development of Aryan, according to this
                    genealogical theory (which makes division of language dependent on division of
                    nations), may be illustrated by the following genealogical table.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This pedigree is the one
                    ultimately given by Schleicher. Others have assumed more or less different
                    degrees of relationship. Greek and Italic, for instance, were for a long time
                    believed to be particularly near relations. A totally contrary view would come
                    nearer the truth. Greek and Latin are about as different, both in phonology and
                    grammatical structure, as any two members of the Aryan family; indeed there is
                    nothing to recommend their combination but the intimate connexion in which the
                    two nations and their literatures have stood within historical times, and the
                    custom derived therefrom of studying the two classical languages together from

                <p>It may still be admitted that at least the mutual position of the ten families is
                    not the same in all cases. It cannot be doubted that Indian and Iranian resemble
                    each other more than either of them does any other family. The same may also be
                    said of Baltic and Slavonic, and even of Italic and Celtic, however different
                    the latter two may appear to be at first sight.<note anchored="true"

                    grouping through. It will be observed that not all the ten families are
                    represented in the genealogical tree given above; Albanian and Armenian have not
                    found a place in it, nor could they be introduced without disturbing the entire
                    table. If we look at Armenian, for instance, we find that its structure and
                    phonology on the whole follow the Asiatic type, and yet Armenian shares the
                    European vowel-system alluded to before; compare, for instance, Armenian <hi

                    is half European, half Asiatic, and if such an intermediate idiom exists it is
                    impossible to make a strict distinction between Asiatic and European. Let us
                    take another instance. All the Asiatic languages have changed the original
                    palatal <hi rend="italic">k</hi> into sibilants, and the same change we find
                    again in Slavonic and Baltic, both of which otherwise clearly belong to the
                    European type; compare, for instance, Sanskrit and Zend <hi rend="italic"
                    >daζan,</hi> “ten,” Armenian <hi rend="italic">tasn,</hi> Slavonic <hi
                    rend="italic">desςti,</hi> Lith. <hi rend="italic">deszimt,</hi> with Greek
                    δ∈κα, Latin <hi rend="italic">decern,</hi> Old</p>
                <p>Irish <hi rend="italic">deich</hi> (for <hi rend="italic">*dehiιn),</hi> Gothic
                    <hi rend="italic">taihun.</hi> In a similar way Litu-Slavic and Germanic are
                    connected by the formation of a plural dative in <hi rend="italic">in,</hi> as
                    in Gothic <hi rend="italic">wulfaιn,</hi> Lith. <hi rend="italic">vìlkams,</hi>
                    Slavonic <hi rend="italic">vlükomü,</hi> against the Sanskrit <hi rend="italic"
                    >-bhyαs,</hi> Latin <hi rend="italic">-bus,</hi> Irish <hi rend="italic"
                    >-b;</hi> and so all round. The consequence is that every attempt at grouping
                    the Aryan families of speech on the genealogical basis must fail, because it
                    would have to cut asunder some of the natural ties that hold the single families
                    together. It is true that some of the coincidences falling under this head may
                    be due to mere chance, especially those in phonology; for we often see the same
                    phonetic processes going on in languages which stand in no connexion whatever at
                    the time. Yet in the case before us the number of the actual coincidences is too
                    large to allow of such an explanation, and the fact of their existence is made
                    all the more striking from the circumstance that it is each pair of <hi
                    rend="italic">neighbouring</hi> families which shows these connecting links. If
                    they prove anything (and it cannot be doubted that they do), we must necessarily
                    come to the conclusion that every such link is a witness for at least a
                    temporary connexion between the two languages or families it holds together. To
                    assume such temporary connexions in the time after a true division of nations
                    had taken place (that is, to assume, for instance, that Slavonic had come into
                    contact with the Asiatic languages after the Europeans had migrated from Asia to
                    Europe, or the forefathers of the present Asiatic nations from Europe to Asia,
                    as the case may be) seems impossible. It is likewise highly improbable that
                    connexions intimate enough to leave distinct marks in language existed at a time
                    when the original tribe had spread over the wide regions now covered by the
                    Aryans, even supposing this spreading to have been so gradual as not to cause
                    any break in the continuity of the Aryan population. And, even if we concede
                    this, how are we to account for the fact that we have no longer the supposed
                    continuity of speech, but well-defined single languages, whose separation must,
                    after all, be due to breaks in the continuity of intercourse between the
                    respective speakers <hi rend="italic">ì</hi> These and similar reasons point to
                    the assumption that the origin of the phenomena alluded to must be sought in a
                    remote period, when the Aryan tribe had an extension small enough to permit
                    continuity of intercourse, and yet large enough to allow of dialectic variations
                    in its different districts. In other words, when the actual break-up of the
                    Aryan tribe into different nations came to pass the Aryan parent-speech was no
                    longer a homogeneous idiom, but the development of dialects had begun. On their
                    following wanderings, then, those tribes or clans would naturally cling together
                    which had until then lived in the closest connexion both of intercourse and
                    dialect (for community of intercourse and of speech always go together), or, as
                    we might also say, the old unity would naturally be broken up into as many parts
                    as there had been dialectic centres. Transition dialects, which might have been
                    spoken in the outlying parts of the old dialectic districts, would also
                    naturally be then reduced to a common level in consequence of the general
                    mixture of speakers that could not but have taken place on wanderings so
                    extensive as those of the Aryan tribes must*have been.</p>
                <p>Such an assumption would indeed solve most of the difficulties mentioned above,
                    especially the peculiar way in which the single families of Aryan are linked
                    together. Each of these would then correspond to one of the main dialects of the
                    parental language, and their mutual affinities would therefore be of the same
                    kind as those of neighbouring dialects, say, of any living speech. And in these
                    nothing is more common, nay even more characteristic, than the gradual
                    transition from one to the other, so that each dialect of an intermediate
                    position partakes of some <pb break="no"

                    right and left. In Old English the Kentish dialect, for instance, in some
                    respects goes with West Saxon against Mercian, in others with Mercian against
                    West Saxon, sometimes West Saxon and Mercian combine against Kentish, and
                    sometimes each of them stands by itself, as the following table will show.</p>

                <p>It remains to give a short review of the main characteristics of Indo-Germanic,
                    both phonetic and structural.</p>
                <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Phonology.—</hi> The consonant system of the Aryan
                    parent-language was chiefly characterized by the prevalence of stopped
                    (explosive) sounds and the scarcity of spirants. The only representatives of the
                    latter class were s, and in a few cases <hi rend="italic">z,</hi> while there is
                    no trace of sounds so common in modern languages as the English <hi
                    rend="italic">f th, sh,</hi> or the German <hi rend="italic">ch.</hi> Besides
                    stops and spirants the system comprised nasals, liquids, and semi vowels.</p>
                <p>The stops were either voiceless (surd), like the English <hi rend="italic">p, t,
                    k,</hi> or voiced (sonant), like the English <hi rend="italic">b,d,g,</hi> and
                    either pure (unaspirated) or aspirated. By combining these two distinctions we
                    arrive at four chief varieties of stops, which are generally thus symbolized:
                    <hi rend="italic">p, ρh, b, bh</hi> for the labial, <hi rend="italic">t, th, d,
                    dh</hi> for the dental class, &amp;c. Here the <hi rend="italic">ρ, t, k</hi>
                    denote unaspirated voiceless stops, <hi rend="italic">ph, th, kh</hi> their
                    aspirates; <hi rend="italic">b, d,g</hi> voiced stops, and <hi rend="italic">bh,
                    dh, gh</hi> their aspirates. In pronouncing these sounds English readers should
                    be careful not to give the Aryan <hi rend="italic">p, t,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >k</hi> the value of the English <hi rend="italic">p, t, k,</hi> because these
                    are always slightly aspirated. The true unaspirated sound is still found in the
                    Romance and the Slavonic languages, in modern Greek, &amp;c. The aspirates <hi
                    rend="italic">ph, th, kh</hi> should be sounded with a strong escape of breath
                    after the explosion of the stop, inserting a distinct <hi rend="italic">h</hi>
                    between the initial <hi rend="italic">p, t,</hi><hi rend="italic">k</hi> and the
                    following sound (as is often done in Irish pronunciation; initial <hi
                    rend="italic">p, t,</hi><hi rend="italic">k</hi> in Danish may also be taken as
                    examples). In the so-called mediae <hi rend="italic">b, d, g</hi> the voice
                    should always be distinctly audible, as in French, or in English medial <hi
                    rend="italic">b, d, g</hi> (initial <hi rend="italic">b, d, g</hi> in English
                    are often voiceless). The pronunciation of the voiced aspirates <hi
                    rend="italic">bh, dh, gh</hi> is a very vexed question, as these sounds have
                    disappeared from all the living Aryan languages except the modern Indian
                    dialects, and these seem to show differences in the pronunciation of the
                    aspirates which have not yet been sufficiently cleared up. The old Indian
                    grammarians made their aspirates out to be voiced stops followed by a
                    corresponding, that is voiced, aspiration, and this description seems to
                    correspond with the observations of Mr Alex. Ellis,<note anchored="true"

                    Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">bha, dha, gha</hi> are distinguished from <hi
                    rend="italic">ba, da, ga</hi> merely by a somewhat stronger pronunciation of the
                    vowel. It seems, however, that another pronunciation exists in the west, and
                    that <hi rend="italic">bha,</hi> for instance, in Bombay is actually pronounced
                    as a distinctly voiced <hi rend="italic">b</hi> followed by a common <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi>; the voice is broken ofl' simultaneously with the opening
                    of the lips, so that no vocalic sound is inserted between the <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">h.</hi> If this pronunciation was not original
                    in Aryan, it seems to have come in at an early period; for it would be extremely
                    difficult to explain the transition of original <hi rend="italic">bh, dh,
                    gh</hi> into the Greek voiceless aspirates <hi rend="italic">φ, θ, χ</hi> (as in
                    Greek <hi rend="italic">φίρν,</hi> originally pronounced <hi rend="italic"
                    >p-hérõ,</hi> compared with Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">bhárãmi),</hi> unless we

                <p>With regard to their positions, the labials <hi rend="italic">p, ph, b, bh</hi>
                    do not seem to have differed from the common European labials of the present
                    day. The so-called dentals <hi rend="italic">t, th, d, dh</hi> were really
                    dental, that is, formed by touching the lower rim or back of the upper teeth
                    with the tip of the tongue (in the pronunciation of the English <hi
                    rend="italic">t,</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> the tongue is raised towards the
                    upper gums). This purely dental pronunciation is still preserved in most of the
                    Asiatic and some European languages. The supradental class represented in the
                    Indian languages by the so-called cerebrals or linguals <hi rend="italic">t, th,
                    d, dh</hi> seems not to have existed in primitive Aryan, but was most probably
                    imported into Indian from the Dravidian idioms of southern India, where these
                    sounds are very common. Of back consonants Aryan possessed two distinct parallel
                    sets, now generally symbolized by <hi rend="italic">k</hi><hi rend="italic

                    They may be characterized as front and back gutturals, or possibly as palatals
                    and gutturals proper (compare the Semitic distinction of 0 and p). The
                    distinction of the two series is best preserved in the Asiatic languages and
                    Litu-Slaviç, where the front gutturals or palatals passed into spirants, while
                    the back gutturals (at least originally) retained their character of explosives.
                    In the other languages the difference is less clearly marked, as will be seen
                    from the following table of correspondences.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    It has been assumed, therefore, that Aryan bail only one sound instead of the

                    >l</hi> was founded on some parallel distinction in Aryan; most probably we have
                    to assume the coexistence of two varieties of r-sounds; the one which, at a

                    erroneous. Aryan not only had the five common vocalic sounds <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The most brilliant result, however, of these recent researches was not the more
                    exact fixing of the phonetic values of the single Aryan vowels, and of the rules
                    of correspondence between these and the vowels of the individual languages, but
                    the discovery that the system of etymological vowel-change which pervades the
                    whole of Aryan word-formation and inflexion, and which had until then generally
                    borne the name of vowel-gradation, was chiefly developed under the influence of
                    stress and pitch. It is well known how the theory by which the old Sanskrit
                    grammarians tried to explain vowel-differences in words or forms derived from
                    the same “root” considered the shortest form of a root-syllable discernible in
                    all its derivations as the most primitive shape of the root, and let the fuller
                    forms be developed from it through a process of increase, which Sanskrit grammar
                    is accustomed to call <hi rend="italic">guna</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >vrddhi.</hi> Taking, for instance, the inflexions of perfects like <hi
                    rend="italic">véda, véttha, véda</hi> (originally pronounced <hi rend="italic"
                    >vaida,</hi> &amp;c. ), plur. <hi rend="italic">vidmá, ridd, vid'ás,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">cakdra, cakártha, cakara,</hi> plur. <hi rend="italic">cakrmá,
                    cakrá, cakrús,</hi> past part, <hi rend="italic">krtá,</hi> they would start
                    from <hi rend="italic">vid</hi> and <hi rend="italic">kr</hi> as “roots,” and
                    say that <hi rend="italic">red- (raid-)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">kar-</hi> in
                    <hi rend="italic">véda (vaida)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cakara,</hi> &amp;c.,
                    were derived from these through <hi rend="italic">guna,</hi> that is, through
                    the insertion of an <hi rend="italic">a</hi> before the original root-vowels <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> This doctrine has been
                    adopted by Bopp, and thus become one of the fundamental theories of comparative
                    philology, although the objections that can be raised against it are both
                    numerous and obvious. Even if we pass over the difficulty of giving a
                    satisfactory phonetic explanation of the assumed process of insertion, how are
                    we to account for the fact that in cases like <hi rend="italic">yâjämi,</hi>
                    past part. <hi rend="italic">ishtJιA,</hi> or perfects like <hi rend="italic"
                    >jagrábha,</hi> ρlur. <hi rend="italic">jagrbhmá,</hi> the “inserted”« stands
                    after the “root-vowel” instead of before it? Or, if we look at forms like <hi
                    rend="italic">paptimá,</hi> perf. plur. of <hi rend="italic">pátãmi,</hi> “I
                    fly,” or <hi rend="italic">smás, sthá, sánti,</hi> plur. of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ásmi,</hi> “I am,” must we not take <hi rend="italic">pt</hi> and s as the
                    original roots, and is it possible to imagine that such roots could ever have
                    existed? All such difficulties disappear by assuming the new theory, that the
                    fuller forms are more original. As the above instances show, the fuller forms
                    appear wherever the “root-syllable” is accentuated, that is, stressed; the
                    shorter ones are confined to stressless syllables. AV hat, then, more natural
                    than to assume that the <hi rend="italic">a</hi> of the fuller forms was the
                    original “root-vowel,” and that it was dropped in the shorter forms on account
                    of their being unaccentuated? Loss of stressless vowels is one of the most
                    frequent phonetic phenomena in all languages, and we have only to look to modern
                    English pronunciation to find the most striking analogies to the processes
                    assumed above. Every-day pronunciations like <hi rend="italic">ffláto,
                    S'ptémber</hi> for the written <hi rend="italic">potato, September</hi> are
                    exact parallels to the Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">pa-p’timá,</hi> and the common
                    <hi rend="italic">mïflórd), mïflàdy)</hi> against the usual full <hi
                    rend="italic">my</hi> to the Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">vidmá</hi> against <hi
                    rend="italic">váida</hi>; even the r-vowel is quite well known in rapid speech
                    in forms like <hi rend="italic">Iprpése, or histry, natshrál</hi> for the
                    written <hi rend="italic">propose, history, natural. ¼</hi></p>
                <p>So far the new theory of vowel -gradation may be summed up as follows. Every
                    root-syllable originally contained one of the three primitive vowels <hi
                    rend="italic">a, e, o,</hi> either short or long; <hi rend="italic">i, u,</hi>
                    the liquids and nasals, only occurred as semi-vowels or consonants, that is,
                    forming monosyllabic (diphthongic) combinations with these vowels, which’ may
                    either precede or follow the consonants. Thus, taking the combinations with the
                    short vowels as an instance, we get the following table—</p>

                <p>&amp;c. In originally stressless syllables long vowels were shortened and short
                    vowels dropped. If the original short vowel were surrounded by mutes, the mutes
                    would come into contact through the loss of the vowel, as in Sanskrit <hi

                    the explanation that they represent intermediate stages of shortening between
                    the full diphthongs and the short <hi rend="italic">i, u,</hi> &amp;c., which
                    were sometimes kept under the influence of a sort of half-stress.<note

                    will ever be sufficiently elucidated.</p>
                <p>The principle of explanation by presence or absence of stress in “roots” is also
                    applicable to derivative or inflexional syllables. It s evident that forms like
                    the Greek τr0λets (for <hi rend="italic">*π0λεjες)—</hi> τr0λts, or <hi

                    of stress from one syllable to another (which even in root - syllables have
                    often somewhat obscured the original state of things) have done much to render
                    the working of the old laws indistinct, so that no more than this short hint can
                    be given here.</p>
                <p>There are yet other interchanges of vowels in Aryan, quite as important as those
                    which find their explanation in presence or absence of stress, which do not seem
                    to fall under the principle applied here. Amongst these the change of <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">o</hi> or <hi rend="italic">e</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">õ,</hi> both in roots and derivative syllables, is the
                    most frequent. Thus we have in Greek <hi rend="italic">λtyω—eιλoχa,</hi> λόγο;
                    <hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">λείπω</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">λέλοιπα, λοιπός</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >έλεύ-</hi><hi rend="italic">σoμaι—</hi><hi rend="italic">είλήλουθα</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">δέρκομαι</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">δέδορκα</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >τρέπω</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">τέτροφα</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">; frηyvvμL— tρpωya;</hi> or λόγο-s—λόγε; <hi rend="italic"
                    >yέι&gt;oς—yt</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">∕εoς</hi> (for <hi
                    rend="italic">*γένεα·-ος')</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >φέρο-μεν— φέρε·τε; πατήρ—</hi> Ει’ττάτωρ, <hi rend="italic">φράτωρ;
                    ποιμήν—άκμων,</hi> &amp;c. It is absolutely incredible that diíference of stress
                    could have changed either <hi rend="italic">e</hi> into o, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >o</hi> into <hi rend="italic">e</hi>; for the greater or less effort in
                    pronouncing a vowel can have nothing to do with the quality of the vowel
                    uttered, as vowel-quality is only regulated by the position of the tongue and
                    lips. If, then, any distinguishing principle in the utterance of human speech
                    governs these changes—and that assumption is inevitable—it must have been
                    difference of pitch. This explanation was suggested independently by Fick and
                    Moller<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Fick, in <hi

                    ago, but has not found its due share of attention, although it recommends itself
                    both upon physiological and philological grounds. There <hi rend="italic"
                    >is</hi> a natural physiological connexion between the palatal <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> and high pitch and between the guttural <hi rend="italic">o</hi> and low
                    pitch; for in uttering a high tone we generally raise the larynx above its
                    normal level, and consequently push the tongue forward with it towards a more
                    palatal position; for a low tone the larynx is lowered, and the tongue follows
                    this movement by sliding backwards, that is, towards the position of the
                    guttural vowels (as can easily be observed in singing the vowel <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> on different notes). On the other hand, we know that in
                    Sanskrit the stress syllables were uttered in a high tone <hi rend="italic"
                    >(udãtta),</hi> and regularly followed by a low-pitch syllable <hi rend="italic"
                    >(svarita).</hi> This combination of high tone + low tone again corresponds with
                    the sequel of <hi rend="italic">e + o</hi> observable in a great many types of
                    Aryan words or forms, such as λε'γω, <hi rend="italic">yivoς,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">δέδορκα</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> compare also <hi
                    rend="italic">Έύπάτωρ</hi> against <hi rend="italic">πατήρ, &amp;κμων</hi>
                    against <hi rend="italic">ποιμήν,</hi> &amp;c. So far this theory seems very
                    probable; yet several difficulties still remain. In the first place, the
                    additional hypothesis must be made, that not all “accentuated,” that is
                    stressed, syllables had the high tone; if <hi rend="italic">o</hi> is the
                    characteristic vowel of low-pitch syllables, words like <hi rend="italic"
                    >λoyos,</hi><hi rend="italic">φόρος</hi> must have had low pitch on their first
                    syllable, while the e of <hi rend="italic">Xéya&gt;,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >φέρω</hi> was uttered with the high tone. Strange as such an accentuation might
                    sound to English or German ears, it involves no practical difficulty; for there
                    are at least some living Aryan idioms which possess similar distinctions: in
                    Servian, for instance, the nominative <hi rend="italic">vódà</hi> is pronounced
                    with a high rising tone on the first and a falling tone on the second, the
                    stress being nearly equally divided between the two syllables; the accusative
                    <hi rend="italic">vbdu,</hi> again, has a well-marked stress on the first
                    syllable, but is pronounced in a low falling tone.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See L. Masing, “Die Hauptformen des
                    serbisch-chorwatischen Accents,” in <hi rend="italic">Mérn. Acad.</hi><hi

                    Petersburg, 1876.</p></note> In the second place, this theory requires a
                    supplementary inquiry into the relations of pitch and stress in Aryan, for it
                    seems evident that stress and high pitch did not always go together. That the
                    reduplicated perfects like the Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">dadàrça,</hi> Greek
                    <hi rend="italic">δέδορκε,</hi> for instance, originally had the stress on the
                    root-syllable is certain from the evidence of Germanic, yet that same
                    root-syllable has the low-pitch vowel <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> while the
                    unstressed reduplicative syllable shows the high-pitch vowel <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.</hi> The original pronunciation of Aryan <hi rend="italic">dedorke,</hi>
                    therefore, must have been something like · ≡j∙, while afterwards the stress was
                    attracted by the high-tone syllable in Greek and the high tone by the old
                    stress-syllable in Sanskrit. In this direction the investigations of Fick and
                    Moller cannot be considered more than an opening of the field for further
                    research; and the same must be said of what has been done hitherto with regard
                    to an explanation of other vowel-changes of a similar character.</p>
                <p>B. <hi rend="italic">Grammatical Structure.—</hi> A few short remarks must
                    suffice here, as a full characteristic of Aryan morphology cannot be given
                    without entering into a mass of more or less minute details.</p>
                <p>Since the days of Bopp comparative philologists have on the whole accepted the
                    theory of the old Sanskrit grammarians, that all Indo-Germanic words and forms
                    must be traced back to simple, no longer divisible, monosyllabic elements, which
                    have been called <hi rend="italic">roots.</hi> We cannot undertake here to
                    discuss the question how far this theory, which has never been uncontested and
                    is beginning to be doubted more and more, is historically correct. However, so
                    much may be conceded that, after removing all the elements which seem to serve
                    in the formation of single words or forms, or the formation of groups of such
                    only in contrast with the whole mass of a system of cognate words or forms,
                    there generally remains a monosyllable, which for practical purposes we may take
                    as a philological starting-point, without asking whether these preparations of
                    the philological laboratory ever had an actual existence of their own or whether
                    they are mere abstractions. The general means by which words and forms are
                    derived from these “roots,” or from other ready-made words and forms, are partly
                    external, partly internal. On the whole, Indo-Germanic derivation and inflexion,
                    looked at from this point of view, are based on a system of suffixes, that is,
                    individualizing formative elements added at the end of less compound and less
                    individualized formations. Infixes instead of suffixes occur only by exception,
                    the chief instance being the insertion of a nasal, especially in certain verbal
                    formations (as in Latin <hi rend="italic">ju-n-go</hi> against <hi rend="italic"
                    >jugum,</hi> Greek <hi rend="italic">λα-μ-βάνω</hi> against <hi rend="italic"
                    >ΐλαβον,</hi> Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">yu-nà-jmi, yu-ñ-jmás</hi> against <hi
                    rend="italic">yugdm).</hi> The third external element we meet is reduplication.
                    Prefixes in the proper sense do not seem to occur; even the verbal augment,
                    which is the only case of an apparently real prefix, most likely was once an
                    independent word, so that augmentation must be reckoned among the numerous
                    case⅛of composition. As means of internal change we may mention the shifting of
                    stress and pitch over the different syllables of words and forms, and the
                    vowel-changes which, as we have seen, originally followed these variations of
                    accent, yet may soon have become independent formative principles.</p>
                <p>As to inflexion, Indo-Germanic is known to hold the foremost rank among all
                    inflectiv⅜ languages. The distinction of nouns, pronouns» and verbs is fully
                    developed. In the nouns the introduction in the substantives of grammatical
                    gender is especially noteworthy. Substantives and adjectives were inflected in
                    the same way, though some of the individual languages have deviated from this
                    rule; the pronouns, at least, in many cases had their own inflexions; otherwise
                    they agree with the nouns in the distinction of numbers and cases. There were
                    three numbers—singular, dual, and plural. The number of original cases cannot be
                    settled with certainty. The highest number we find distinguished in any language
                    is seven—nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, instrumental, and locative
                    (besides the vocative or interjectional case). But, judging from the fact that
                    the same cases often have different endings in different declensions, one might
                    be inclined to think that once a still greater variety of case-distinctions had
                    existed. The single declensions are distinguished according to the various
                    stem-suffixes immediately preceding the case-endings. The two chief subdivisions
                    accordingly are the declensions of vocalic and consonantal stems. It may be
                    noticed in passing that the so-called <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> stems follow the type of the consonantal declension; this,
                    however, appears but natural if we consider that the final <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> of these stems most probably are reductions
                    of older diphthongs ending in a semi-vocalic or consonantal element. For
                    declensional distinctions only one of the general external formative principles
                    is used, namely, that of combining ready-made stems with suffixal endings, at
                    the same time expressing case and number.</p>
                <p>The verb, too, has in like manner its inflexional endings to express the
                    distinctions of number and person; but it also makes use of all the other
                    formative principles, both internal and external. The shifting of accent and the
                    vowel-changes connected therewith are nowhere more distinctly traceable than in
                    the verb. Besides, we find the use of special suffixes for the distinction of
                    tenses and moods, sometimes the infixion of a nasal in the formation of
                    tensestems, then again on a larger scale the use of reduplication, and lastly,
                    the use of the augment as a common sign for the different tenses of the past.
                    None of the individual languages seems to have preserved the original stock of
                    Aryan verbal forms to its full extent. The oldest Sanskrit seems to come nearest
                    to Aryan. Greek has also been very conservative in one way; it has lost hardly
                    anything that was original, but has, like Latin, created a host of apparently
                    new forms, some of which still continue to baffle all attempts at an
                    explanation. Germanic may serve as a type of the opposite character; it has lost
                    all but the old present and the old reduplicated perfect, but supplied the loss
                    by the extensive employment of auxiliaries. The differences thus exhibited by
                    the different languages make it a difficult task to determine which formations
                    belong to the primitive Aryan stock and which were added at later periods.
                    General consent, however, seems to take the following points for settled. Of the
                    three voices distinguished in Greek, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n825/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0825-0790"/> only two are of primitive growth, the active and
                    the middle voice, the passive voice being a later specialization of the middle.
                    There were three moods, an indicative, a subjunctive, and an optative; the
                    difference of the latter two from the indicative lay partly in the inflexional
                    endings, partly in the addition of a special mood-suffix before these
                    terminations. There was also an imperative. The distinction of numbers was the
                    same as in declension,—singular, dual, plural, each of which had three persons.
                    The tenses may be divided into three groups. The first group comprises the
                    present and perfect, the former of which is supposed to have been used
                    originally as a general predicative form, being neither past, present, nor
                    future, while the perfect was used to indicate the completion of the action
                    signified by the root. The present is rarely formed direct from the root, but
                    more generally from a special tensestem derived from the root by the addition of
                    some special tense suffix or infix, or reduplication. Of the different
                    formations of the perfect met with in the individual languages only that through
                    reduplication of the root-syllable is believed to be of Aryan origin. The second
                    group is that of the past tenses, the imperfect and two aorists. In all these
                    the past sense is marked by the augment. The imperfect is regularly formed from
                    the present stem, and the aorist either from the root simple or reduplicated
                    (root - aorist, corresponding to the so-called second aorist in Greek), or by
                    inserting an s between the root and the inflexional endings (sibilant, or
                    sigmatic aorist, the first aorist of Greek). The existence of a pluperfect
                    derived from the perfect in a way similar to the derivation of the imperfect
                    from the present is doubtful and not generally admitted. The last division is
                    formed by the future, which, like the first aorist, inserts a sibilant after the
                    root-syllable. None of the other formations of the future occurring here and
                    there is believed to have existed in the parent-speech. Of participles there
                    were three sets, belonging to the present, the perfect, and the aorist
                    respectively. An infinitive had not yet been developed; its place in Aryan was
                    supplied by the use of verbal nouns.</p>

                    cultivated this branch of research. (E. SI. )</p>
