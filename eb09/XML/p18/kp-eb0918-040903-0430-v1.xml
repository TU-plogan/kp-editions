                    the four courts of appeal in the kingdom, and the residence of the archbishop of
                    Patras and Elis. The custom-house is the most important in all Greece. Like the
                    ancient city, the modern Patras previous to the revolution occupied the high
                    ground of Scatovuni (a hill connected with Mount Voidia or Pan-achaicum, the
                    dominant summit in this region), but since then it has spread out over the plain
                    towards the sea. The two most interesting buildings are the castle, a mediaeval
                    structure on the site of the ancient acropolis, and the cathedral of St Andrew,
                    which is highly popular as the reputed burial-place of the saint, and has been
                    rebuilt since the revolution. The commerce of Patras consists mainly in the
                    export of currants, valonia, olive-oil, wine, and sheepskins (value in 1881,
                    19,369,270 francs, of which 18,104,046 francs were for currants alone), and the
                    import of cotton and woollen goods, grain, flour, and colonial wares (value in
                    1881, 16,560,600 francs). Great Britain and Austria almost divide the foreign
                    shipping trade, with a preponderance in favour of the former country, which
                    takes more than half of the currants. August and September are the months when
                    the port is at its busiest with British vessels. Famous even in antiquity for
                    its flax manufactures (whence the number of females in the city was double that
                    of the males), Patras at present contains several steam factories with about
                    4000 spindles producing coarse cotton twist from cotton grown in northern
                    Grèece; and there are also sulphur-crushing mills, flour and macaroni mills, and
                    an iron-foundry. Gas-works and water-works were constructed about 1874.</p>
                <p>The foundation of Patras goes back to prehistoric times, the legendary account
                    being that Eumelus, having been taught by Triptolemus how to grow grain in the
                    rich soil of the Glaucus valley, established three townships, Aroe <hi
                        rend="italic">(i.c.,</hi> ploughland), Antheia (the flowery), and Mesatis
                    (the middle settlement), which were united by the common worship of Artemis
                    Triclaria at her shrine on the river Meilichus. The Achaians having strengthened
                    and enlarged Aroe called it Patrae as the exclusive residence of the ruling
                    families. In 419 B.c. the town was, by the advice of Alcibiades, connected with
                    its harbour by long walls in imitation of those at Athens. The whole armed force
                    of Patrae was destroyed by Metellus after the defeat of the Achaians at
                    Scarpheia, and many of the remaining inhabitants forsook the city; but after the
                    battle of Actium Augustus restored the ancient name Aroe, introduced a military
                    colony of veterans from the 10th and 12th legions (not, as is usually said, the
                    22d), and bestowed the rights of coloni on the inhabitants of Rhypae and Dyme,
                    and all the Locri Ozolae except those of Amphissa. Colonia Augusta Aroe
                    Patrensis became one of the most populous of all the towns of Greece; its
                    colonial coinage extends from Augustus to Gordian III. That it was the scene of
                    the martyrdom of St Andrew is purely apocryphal, but, like Corinth, it was an
                    early and effective centre of Christianity; its archbishop is mentioned in the
                    lists of the council of Sardica in 347. In 551 Patrae was laid in nιins by an
                    earthquake. In 807 it was able without external assistance to deTeat tne
                    Slavonians (Avars), though most of the credit of the victory was assigned to St
                    Andrew, whose church was enriched by the imperial share of the spoils, and whose
                    archbishop was made superior of the bishops of Methone, Lacedaemon, and Corone.
                    Captured in 1205 by William of Champlitte and Villehardouin, the city became the
                    capital and its archbishop the primate of the principality of Achaia. In 1587 De
                    Heredia, grandmaster of the order of the Hospital at Rhodes, endeavoured to make
                    himself master of Achaia, and took Patras by storm. At the close of the 15th
                    century the city was governed by the archbishop in name of the pope; but in 1428
                    Constantine, son of John VI., managed to get possession of it for a time. Taken
                    by a Spanish fleet under Andrea Doria in 1532, sacked by another Spanish fleet
                    in 1595, and again sacked by the knights of Malta in 1603, Patras was at length
                    in 1687 surrendered by the Turks to the Venetians, who made it the seat of one
                    of the seven fiscal boards into which they divided the Morea. It was at Patras
                    that the Greek revolution began iu 1821; but the Turks, confined to the citadel,
                    held out till 1828, when the French troops took possession of the Morea.</p>
