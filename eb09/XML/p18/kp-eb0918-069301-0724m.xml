                    literary culture. Petau received his early education at Orleans, but finished
                    his university course in Paris, where, after graduating in arts, he attended
                    theological lectures at the Sorbonne. By Isaac Casaubon, who had perceived his
                    abilities, he was introduced to the MS. treasures of the Bibliothèque Royale;
                    and, at the suggestion of that scholar, he began to work for the edition of
                    Synesius which he afterwards published. In 1603, before he had completed his
                    twentieth year, he received a teaching appointment in the faculty of philosophy
                    at the university of Bourges; here his leisure hours were devoted to his
                    editorial labours and to a systematic study of the ancient philosophers and
                    mathematicians. Having come under the influence of the learned Jesuit Fronton le
                    Duc, he was induced to resign his post at Bourges in order that he might join
                    the Society of Jesus, and in June 1605 he entered upon his novitiate at Nancy.
                    After an interval of four years, he taught rhetoric successively at Rheims, La
                    Flèche, and Paris, taking the four vows of the order at the last-named place in
                    1618; from 1621 to 1644 he was professor of positive theology in the college of
                    the order. On account of growing infirmities and to secure leisure for his great
                    work, to be mentioned below, he then retired from teaching duties, but retained
                    the librarianship in the Collège de Clermont until his death, which took place
                    on 11th December 1652.</p>
                <p>The list of Petau’s literary labours bears witness to an extraordinary and
                    many-sided activity, and includes several works which still enjoy the
                    recognition of scholars. He edited Synesius (1611, 2d ed. 1631, 3d ed. 1633),
                    Themistius (1613), Julian (1630), the <hi rend="italic">Breviarium</hi> of
                    Nicephorus (1616), and Epiphanias (1622); his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Animadversiones</hi> on the last-named have been reprinted by Dindorf, as a
                    still unexhausted mine of valuable material, in the fifth vol. of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Epiphanii Opera</hi> (1859). Carrying on and improving on the
                    chronological labours of Scaliger, he published in two folio volumes an <hi
                    rend="italic">Opus de</hi><hi rend="italic">doctrina temporum</hi> (1627;
                    frequently reprinted), followed in 1630 by <hi rend="italic">Uranologion

                    >ad Uranologion</hi><hi rend="italic">libri</hi><hi rend="italic">VIII.</hi> Of
                    the first-mentioned of these he made an abridgment, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rationarium temporum,</hi> which passed through numerous editions, was
                    translated into English and French, and in a recent reprint has been brought
                    down to the year 1849. In theology proper Petau’s first appearance was
                    polemical, and quite in the manner of that time,—a pseudonymous criticism on the
                    recently-published commentary of Salmasius on Tertullian’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Be</hi><hi rend="italic">Pallio {Antonii</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Kerkoetii</hi><hi rend="italic">Aremorici animadversionum liber,</hi> 1622).
                    The controversy was continued in a series of replies and rejoinders, and was
                    renewed in connexion with other publications of his distinguished antagonist. In
                    particular, some references to the church doctrine as to the authority of
                    bishops made by Salmasius in his <hi rend="italic">Be faenore trapezitico</hi>
                    was the occasion of Petau’s <hi rend="italic">Bissertationum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ecclesiasticarum libri</hi><hi rend="italic">duo, in</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">Bc ecclesiastica hierarchia libri V.</hi> (1641). Petau also had
                    his share in the Jansenist controversy, and has the honour of being twice
                    mentioned as a Jesuit authority in the <hi rend="italic">Provinciales.</hi> His
                    first appearance in the dispute was against Arnauld’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Be</hi><hi rend="italic">la fréquente</hi><hi rend="italic">communion,</hi>
                    which he met with a treatise, <hi rend="italic">Be</hi><hi rend="italic">la
                    pénitence publique et de la préparation à la communion</hi> (1643); his
                    subsequent works, viewed in the light of the struggle then at its height,
                    explain themselves by their titles <hi rend="italic">{Be lege</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">gratia</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    non</hi><hi rend="italic">et adjutorio</hi><hi rend="italic">quo</hi> (1651). In
                    his great but unfinished work, <hi rend="italic">Be</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >theologicis dogmatibus</hi> (5 vols, fol., 1644-50), he deals with the doctrine
                    of God, the Trinity, Creation, and the Incarnation; his design had been to
                    complete it by an exhaustive treatment of the sacraments and of the Christian
                    graces and virtues. Its scope, which was to free theology from the subtleties of
                    scholasticism and to rest the science on the simple and firm basis of Scripture,
                    the councils, and the fathers, is well enough explained by his own avowal, “nova
                    quaerant alii, nil nisi prisca peto.” The work is a treasury of well-digested
                    learning, and justly entitles its author to the praise of Muratori, who speaks
                    of him as “the restorer of dogmatic theology.” By some of his fellow-J esuits he
                    was supposed to have been too ready to recognize the Jansenism of Augustine, and
                    in various quarters his declaration that many of the ante-Nicene fathers were
                    less orthodox than the decrees of the first council has been made a matter of
                    reproach. But in these charges the impartial critic will recognize only proof of
                    his candour. Petau, it may be added, was a rigid ascetic, and in particular is
                    said to have indulged in the discipline of self-flagellation to a degree that
                    injured his health.</p>
