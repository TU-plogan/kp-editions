                    Parasitism.</hi></p>
                <p>THE problems suggested by the occurrence of parasites not only in the intestines
                    or the kidneys but even in flesh and blood, in eye or brain, have occupied alike
                    physician and naturalist from the earliest times. From ancient Egyptian and
                    Jewish sanitary and religious codes we may perhaps infer considerable knowledge
                    of the distribution and danger of parasites,—unclean animals like the pig,
                    rabbit, and dog being peculiarly infested with them. The schoolmen, too,
                    perplexed themselves with quaint hypotheses as to the time and place and mode of
                    the introduction of the parasites of man, while the long per sistence of
                    mediaeval myths is evidenced by the “Furia infernalis” of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Systema</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturx.</hi> The spontaneous generation of
                    parasites seems never to have been doubted until the commencement of the 18th
                    century, when Redi proved the origin of maggots from eggs of the blow-fly, and
                    Swammerdam announced the similar origin of lice and other insect parasites. Both
                    naturalists, however, opposed the extension of their results to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Entozoa,</hi> but the discovery of microscopic animalcules, and
                    the reflexion that these must readily be introduced into the body, induced
                    Boerhaave to suggest the origin of parasites from free-living worms and
                    infusorians. The sexuality and characteristics of a few <hi rend="italic"
                    >Entozoa</hi> gradually became better known, while Linnaeus, though little
                    dreaming of their complex form-history, expelled the spontaneous generation
                    theory by the in-so-far fortunate mistake of identifying the free <hi
                    rend="italic">Bothriocephalus</hi> of the stickleback as the young stage of <hi
                    rend="italic">B. latus</hi> of man, and certain free Planarians and Nematoids as
                    the young of liver flukes and thread worms. His school vastly increased the
                    hitherto scanty catalogue of known forms, while their exacter knowledge rendered
                    his hypothesis improbable. The origin of <hi rend="italic">Entozoa</hi> from
                    eggs which leave the body of their host, enter new hosts in food or drink, and
                    when developing in other organs than the alimentary are carried thither by the
                    circulation, was clearly put forward by Pallas, who also revived the early view
                    of inheritance, which had been propounded before by the contemporaries of
                    Leeuwenhoek (then, however, to avoid the apparently insoluble difficulty of
                    tracing the origin of the parasite from its innumerable yet apparently wasted
                    ova). With the enormous labours of Rudolphi and Bremser hel minthology rose to
                    the rank of an important special study, yet the degeneration of the Linnaean
                    school had nowhere fuller course: observation of faunistic and systematic detail
                    excluded all physiological or morphological research, and the knotty problem of
                    origin was simply cut by a return to the hypothesis of spontaneous generation.
                    This view seemed supported by the absence of reproductive organs in cystic
                    parasites, and reigned almost undisputed until the accumulation of a new chain
                    of evidence. Of this the main links were the discovery of the ciliated larva of
                    a Trematode <hi rend="italic">{Monostomunι)</hi> by Mehlis in 1831, of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Redia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">C</hi><hi rend="italic">er</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">caria</hi> stages of the same genus, and of the six-hooked embryo
                    of <hi rend="italic">Txnia</hi> by Siebold in 1835, and the renewed study of <hi
                    rend="italic">Bothriocephalus</hi><hi rend="italic">latus</hi> by Eschricht, who
                    maintained that the encysted forms were persistently larval, and that the life
                    history of the <hi rend="italic">Entozoa</hi> should be viewed as broadly
                    parallel to that of parasitic insects. Yet in spite of all this, and of the
                    corroborative researches of Valentin, many helminthologists remained obstinate,
                    until these incredible life-histories had been confirmed and treated as so many
                    other cases of the “Alternation of Generations” in the epoch-making work of
                    Steenstrup (1842). Dujardin next observed the wanderings of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mermis,</hi> and Siebold those of <hi rend="italic">Gordius·,</hi> the latter,
                    however, advanced the doctrine that cysts were not larval stages, but mere
                    pathological modifications of those worms which had chanced to “wander” into
                    situations unfitted for their normal life. Meanwhile were commencing the
                    important labours of Van Beneden, who traced the actual development of the
                    cystic parasites of the bony fishes into the tape-worms of the rays and
                    dogfishes which had devoured them, so proving that the transmission of the
                    parasites depended upon the mode of feeding. These results were soon confirmed
                    by Küchenmeister, who not only transmuted cyst into tapeworm by transmission in
                    food, but redeveloped the cystic form by feeding with eggs from the adult
                    tape-worm, thus (1852-53) commencing the modern era of experimental
                    helminthology. Häubner and Leuckart eagerly followed for the same group;
                    Filippi, Valette, Pagenstecher, and Cobbold .made similar investigations on
                    Trematodes; while Leuckart transferred <hi rend="italic">Pentastomum</hi> from
                    rabbit to dog, and traced the formidable <hi rend="italic">Trichina</hi> from
                    pig to man. From this time (1860) the advances of our knowledge have been no
                    longer in principle, though numerous and important, but in detail. To
                    Küchenmeister, Cobbold, Davaine, and others, but more especially to Leuckart, we
                    owe valuable general works; to the last the present article is especially
                    indebted.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Leuckart,

                <p>Any discussion of parasitism with its difficulties and wide theoretic bearings
                    should naturally be preceded by an account of the known facts. This would
                    involve the preparation of two systematic lists,—the first enumerating the
                    parasitic members of each animal group, while the second, from the point of view
                    not of parasites but of hosts, would indicate the forms which are infested,
                    stating by what parasites. Of these lists the following scanty outlines must
                    suffice.</p>

                    choleraic affections; <hi rend="italic">Trichomonas</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >intestinalis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vaginalis</hi> are also described in
                    diseases. In perhaps all invertebrates and cold-blooded vertebrates ciliate and
                    flagellate parasites seem to occur. <hi rend="italic">Acinetae</hi> are

                    The adult consists essentially of a simple sac of finely ciliated ectodermal
                    cells enclosing a single elongated endodermal cell, which discharges nutritive
                    and reproductive functions. Some have attempted to demonstrate a mesoderm. The
                    embryos are of two kinds, nematogenic or vermiform, and rhombogenic or
                    infusiform, differing in origin, structure, and life-history, but of still
                    uncertain relations and import. The infusiform embryo which becomes free is of
                    complicated structure, and probably completes its development in some new host.
                    Some have connected the <hi rend="italic">Dicyemida</hi> with such higher forms
                    as the <hi rend="italic">Rotifera</hi> or Trematodes, and have regarded the
                    simplicity of the adult as the result of that degeneration which is suggested
                    both by development and habit. Haeckel, while acknowledging degeneration,
                    regards <hi rend="italic">Dicyema</hi> as a survivor of the originally simple

                    ciliated and segmented ectoderm encloses an inner endoderm layer and a central
                    cavity which usually contains embryos. They exhibit a well-marked sexual

                    of <hi rend="italic">Echinorhynchus.</hi> These parasites possess a muscular
                    elongated body with a retractile proboscis armed with hooks, which serves to fix

                    wanting; but the muscles, nerves, and generative organs are well developed.
                    There is a complicated subcutaneous canal system; the sexes are distinct, and
                    the reproduction is viviparous. The embryo, well provided with ensheathing
                    membranes and with hooks, is expelled with the excreta of its vertebrate host
                    and swallowed by some Arthropod, such as <hi rend="italic">Asellus</hi> or <hi

                    Trematodes. Ophidians have all kinds of parasitic worms, Chelonians chiefly
                    Nematoids and Trematodes. The parasites of birds are of extraordinary number and
                    variety; preying, fishing, and omnivorous birds serve, of course, very
                    constantly as intermediate hosts; but graminivorous birds are hardly more
                    exempt. The number of parasites is often so vast as to occasion the most serious
                    disease; thus the “gapes” of poultry is due to the choking of the bronchial
                    passages by multitudes of Nematoids <hi rend="italic">(Sclerostoma

                <p>Yet a great number of parasites may be borne without apparent injury: thus the

                    >oiHolostomum</hi> from the gullet and intestine. Ticks and insect parasites are

                    itself, we have seen that most invertebrate groups have their parasitic members
                    and exhibit transitions or grades connecting these with free-living forms. The
                    systematic position of many parasitic species is, however, not yet clear, many
                    have been named by accident or according to habitat, and great concentration
                    seems necessary. It is, for example, extremely probable that a careful
                    systematic study of genera like <hi rend="italic">Gordius, Distomum,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Tetrarhynckus,</hi> of which innumerable species have been
                    described from as many different hosts, would result in proving the identity of
                    many forms described as distinct, and that experiment would show that many of
                    the forms still apparently specifically distinct are really only individuals of
                    the same species more or less modified by the host upon whom the lotterv of
                    nature has chanced to quarter them.</p>
                <p>With the increasing completeness of our knowledge of parasitic forms the
                    transitions from free to parasitic species are becoming more prominent, and the
                    relationships of the parasitic to the non-parasitic groups more definite. Among
                    the <hi rend="italic">Nematoidea,</hi> for example, as Leuckart indicates, we
                    are able to construct a series, starting from free-living forms, and through
                    such cases as <hi rend="italic">Leptodera</hi> (a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhabditis</hi> like form, sometimes free, sometimes parasitic), thence to
                    parasitic Nematodes hardly to be distinguished from their free-living relations,
                    but passing gradually through <hi rend="italic">0xyuris, Trichocephalus,
                    Spiroptera,</hi> &lt;fcc., to such highly parasitic forms as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trichina,</hi> where all relation to the outer world is lost. The <hi

                    highly modified by parasitism, and he points out how <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gordius,</hi> with its atrophied alimentary canal, terminal position of female
                    reproductive organs, and other persistent and embryonic characters in which it
                    differs from the typical Nematoid, really leads up to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Echinorhynchus.</hi> As <hi rend="italic">Echinorhynchus</hi> is related to the
                    Nematodes, so are the Cestoids to the Trematodes. The close alliance suggested
                    by numerous points of anatomical correspondence, and by the close parallelism in
                    life-history, is corroborated by such intermediate forms as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caryophyllaeus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Amphilina,</hi> from which we pass
                    with ever-increasing parasitic adaptation through the <hi rend="italic"

                    >Taenia.</hi> Leuckart further points out how closely the Trematodes are united
                    by intermediate forms to the Planarians. The affinities of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Myzostoma</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pentastomum</hi> are not yet precisely
                    determined, though the former is most plausibly regarded as a degenerate
                    Chaetopod and the latter as similarly degenerated from some low Arachnid or at
                    least Arthropod type. In the <hi rend="italic">Copepoda, Cirripedia,</hi> and
                    other crustaceans all degrees in intimacy of association may be observed, making
                    the relations of the parasitic to the free forms sufficiently obvious.
                    Everywhere, in short, we find a morphological and physiological gradation from
                    free to parasitic forms.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nature and Degree of Parasitism—Commensalism.—</hi> From the
                    foregoing necessarily much abbreviated lists we observe not only the enormously
                    wide prevalence of parasitism—the number of parasitic individuals, if not indeed
                    that of species, probably exceeding that of non-parasitic forms—but its very
                    considerable variety in degree and detail. The majority indeed derive their main
                    support from their host, but of these some are free, wandering about from animal
                    to animal, some are attached permanently to the exterior of their victim, while
                    others again are concealed within its body. In some cases the parasitism is only
                    temporary, with others it is a life-long habit. The majority are free in their
                    youth, while some pass their early life as parasites, becoming free in their
                    mature state, and others again spend their whole life on their host.</p>
                <p>In some cases there is the very slightest association; every student of marine
                    forms is familiar with the complex incrustations and intergrowths of sessile
                    forms, and has seen how almost any surface or cranny may afford a lodgment.
                    Parasitism for support is not infrequent; it may be temporary or permanent; in
                    the former case it is useful in diffusion,—the glochidium-larva of the
                    freshwater mussel, for example, being transported on the fins of fishes. From
                    cases like those of many Cirripedes, which occur indifferently on rocks or on
                    animals, we pass readily to permanent associations like that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Loxosoma</hi> on the posterior end of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phascolosoma.</hi> Vague and loose associations, if useful to one or both
                    participants, may become perpetuated by natural selection. Thus sea anemones may
                    settle on any surface,—occasionally therefore on shells inhabited by hermit
                    crabs; hence have arisen permanent <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0278-0261"/> associations. Of these there are many familiar
                    instances, such as the hermit crabs bearing <hi rend="italic">Sagartia
                    parasitica</hi> (fig. 1), or having their shell-mouth enveloped by <hi
                    rend="italic">Adamsia.</hi> One of the quaintest instances is a lately described
                    species of crab which wields an anemone firmly grasped in either claw. In such
                    cases the association is obviously useful: the crab is protected from the
                    octopus and other enemies by the nematocysts of its comrade, which also aid in
                    holding the prey, while the <hi rend="italic">Actinia</hi> too gains its share
                    of the food, and vicariously acquires means of locomotion. To such cases where
                    two animals are associated together for mutual support and advantage the term
                    “Commensalism” is applied. In the struggle for existence increased complexity of
                    needs, and difficulty in satisfying them, evokes in the individual organism a
                    certain specialization of function and consequent differentiation of structure.
                    Similar causes result not so much in the differentiation of each individual of a
                    species as in the specialization of certain individuals for certain specific
                    functions, resulting again in that specialization of structure which is called
                    polymorphism. Thus in a <hi rend="italic">Hydractinia</hi> or Siphonophore
                    colony many different individuals of the same species have been specialized in
                    each to perform a certain function. The same purpose is served by those
                    associations, not of individuals of the same species, but of two individuals of
                    different species, united as we have just seen for mutual advantage, and each
                    working out some definite part of the common life-problem. Just as polymorphism
                    in the same species is physiologically equivalent to differentiation in the
                    individual organism, so is commensalism between different species the
                    physiological equivalent of polymorphism in a single species.</p>
                <p>But cases of co-operation on equal terms are rare; size constitutes the most
                    frequent disparity, and the smaller tends to become first wholly dependent upon
                    the other for support, then for concealment, and finally perhaps for sustenance.
                    The reverse may occasionally occur, the weaker being utilized for the purposes
                    of the stronger; thus a species of <hi rend="italic">Dromia</hi> adapts a colony
                    of sponge or ascidian as a removable upper garment for concealment.<note

                    some cases even within the morphological unity of the species a physiological
                    relation is established analogous to commensalism if not to parasitism. Thus in
                    <hi rend="italic">Boneilia</hi> the diminutive and degenerate male lives in the
                    uterus of the female, in <hi rend="italic">Trichosomum crassicauda</hi> of the
                    rat three or four male are found within the spermatheca of the female, while in
                    <hi rend="italic">Bilharzia</hi> the incipient reciprocal of these cases is
                    found, the male being host. Many of the most remarkable cases are also afforded
                    by the <hi rend="italic">Cirripedia,</hi> in which a female may bear males in
                    various states of dependence and degeneration. In viviparous animals a certain
                    absorption by the young from the tissues of the parent can hardly avoid taking
                    place; this is therefore so far an analogy to endoparasitism. This advantage is
                    clearly retained and developed if absorption take place by an organ specialized
                    for the purpose. Thus in the well-known shark <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mustel·us</hi><hi rend="italic">laevis</hi> the young are attached to the
                    oviduct by a placenta developed on the yolk sac; and the like arrangement,

                    are very few animals altogether free from parasites, but even parasites

                    though not <hi rend="italic">“ad infinitum.”</hi> Thus Leuckart mentions that

                    which, after destroying the greater part of its host, continues to subsist upon
                    the nourishment afforded by its root-like processes which survive the
                    operation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Classification.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Some
                    classification of these various parasitic forms is necessary. Van Beneden
                    introduced the useful term <hi rend="italic">commensals</hi> or messmates, under
                    which he includes (1) <hi rend="italic">oikosites</hi> or fixed and (2) <hi
                    rend="italic">coinosites</hi> or free partners. These he distinguishes not only
                    from parasites but from <hi rend="italic">mutualists</hi> where two species are
                    associated, but neither share a common food nor does one prey on the other.
                    Parasites he divides according to the duration of their state of attachment to a
                    host, distinguishing (1) those which are free all their life (leeches, bugs,
                    fleas, &amp;c. ); (2) those free as adults but parasitic when young <hi
                    rend="italic">(ichneumon, Mermis,</hi> &amp;c. ); (3) those free only in youth,
                    and attaining their adult form either directly in the first host entered, or
                    only after a migration from one host to another (most parasitic worms); (4)
                    those which pass all phases of their life on or in their host, <hi rend="italic"
                    >c.g., Strepsiptera, Tristomum,</hi> &amp;c. In this classification there is no
                    attempt to define the degree of dependence or the closeness of the association,
                    except in the general distinction between parasites and commensals; the group of
                    mutualists is entirely superfluous and confused, no clear definition being
                    given, and in the examples of the various groups the limits of his own
                    definitions are not adhered to.</p>
                <p>Leuckart distinguishes parasites as ecto-and endo-parasitic, and divides the
                    former into temporary and permanent. Endoparasites he divides according to the
                    nature and duration of their strictly parasitic life. (1) Some have free-living
                    and self-supporting embryos which become sexually mature either in their freedom
                    or only after assuming the parasitic habit. (2) Others have embryos which,
                    without having a strictly free life, yet pass through a period of active or
                    passive wandering, living for a while in an intermediate host. They may either
                    (a) escape to pass their adult life in freedom <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Archigetes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aspidogaster),</hi> or (ft) they may
                    become sexual, or (c) they may bore their way to another part of the body (<hi
                    rend="italic">Trichina),</hi> or (d) most frequently they pass to their final
                    host either directly when their intermediate host is devoured as food, or
                    indirectly seeking for themselves another intermediate host, or producing
                    asexual forms which do so (Trematodes and Cestoids). (3) Others again have no
                    free-living or even migratory embryonic stage, but pass through their complete
                    life-cycle in one host <hi rend="italic">(Trichocephalus, Oxyuris,</hi> &amp;c.
                    ). This somewhat detailed classification has at least the advantage of
                    clearness, and of showing to some extent the various degrees of parasitism.</p>
                <p>Rossmann has proposed a more physiological classification dealing with the
                    organization and habit of the parasite. This he has applied to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Crustacea</hi>:—I. <hi rend="italic">Diosmotici,</hi> or
                    vegetative without independent digestive organs, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,

                    holotmeta, Branchiura,</hi><hi rend="italic">Cymothoidae.</hi> The great variety
                    of details, however, makes it almost impossible to establish any logically
                    accurate division. Any strict classification of such a variety of organisms
                    having only in common the physiological correspondence of their mode of life is
                    almost impossible, and the most that can be done is to point out the existence
                    of series of adaptations varying with the intimacy and constancy of the
                    association and the degree of dependence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Origin of Parasitism and Transmission of Parasites.—</hi> With
                    the dismissal of the theory of <hi rend="italic">generatio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >aequivoca,</hi> the question of the origin of parasites is limited to the
                    discussion of the causes which might induce such a change of habit and
                    environment. There are obviously many opportunities for one animal either in
                    adult or larval state being swallowed by another in food or drink, in which
                    case, if the environment were not too utterly different from that previously
                    enjoyed, parasitism might arise in a purely unconscious way. It is again easily
                    conceivable that animals which have sought a host for temporary protection from
                    climate or enemies, or for safety and seclusion in the bearing and breeding of
                    the young, might, finding the environment congenial and a supply of food at
                    hand, remain there during a large portion of their life. It is worth noticing,
                    as corroboratory of the idea that the host was in many cases resorted to
                    primarily as a sort of maternity asylum, that we find many parasitic females
                    with free males, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Nicothoe.</hi> Given an animal with a
                    carnivorous habit, it is intelligible enough that during a period of <pb

                    enemies, various methods of solving the problem of life would be attempted, the
                    successful results of which in a few cases persist especially in ectoparasitism,
                    not the least obvious mode of retaliation on stronger foes. The degree of the
                    parasitism is, as we have seen, not of primary moment, and its intimacy may be
                    increased. There are naturally some physiological limits of respiration,
                    &amp;c., determining the possibilities of parasitism—air-breathing insects are
                    found on land animals or at most on some amphibian forms, water-breathing
                    Arthropods on water-breathers, waterbreathing worms only in the interior of land
                    animals; but even these limits may be overstepped by adaptation when, for
                    example, the respiration becomes cutaneous in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pentastomum,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sarcoptes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The various modes of transmission of parasites, though of great practical
                    importance, do not call for much discussion here. They may be summarized as
                    follows after Leuckart :—(1) the majority of parasites reach their hosts through
                    the medium of food or drink; (2) eggs are in some cases transferred from one
                    animal to another by actual bodily contact, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    eggs of <hi rend="italic">Pentastomum</hi> by the licking of dogs; (3) sometimes
                    the eggs are deposited in or on the host by the mother, for example, by insect
                    parasites, such as <hi rend="italic">Ichneumons,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Oestridae,</hi> &amp;c.; (4) in some rare cases parasites are transmitted by
                    self-infection,—for example, young <hi rend="italic">Trichinae,</hi> born free
                    in the alimentary canal of their host, bore their way thence directly into the
                    muscles, there to grow into the well-known encapsuled worms. Eggs or
                    proglottides of tape-worm may, on gaining the exterior, be transmitted
                    inadvertently to the mouth, and so recommence their life-cycle within the same
                    host.</p>
                <p>The mode of diffusion of the ova of parasites presents many analogies to that of
                    seeds in the vegetable kingdom: thus wind and water are alike utilized, passing
                    animals may serve as unconscious bearers, and the like. Though well protected by
                    a usually thickened egg-shell and an often remarkable degree of vitality, so as
                    to resist prolonged drought, burial, and other vicissitudes, the parasite has an
                    exceedingly small chance of success in finding a host; to preserve the species
                    from extinction an enormous number of eggs must be produced, far exceeding that
                    of free-living organisms. Thus Leuckart points out that as a tapeworm has an
                    average lifetime of two years, and produces in that time about 1500
                    proglottides, each containing say 57,000 ova, and since the species is not
                    increasing in numbers, an ovum has thus only one chance in 85,000,000 of
                    reaching maturity. The difficulties are of course increasingly greater as the
                    life-history becomes more complicated, demanding an increasing number of hosts.
                    Given a sufficient number of eggs, however, no difficulty is insuperable, and
                    few parasitic forms accordingly seem in any risk of disappearance, except, it is
                    to be hoped, in the case of civilized man and the domestic animals, where the
                    large consumption of cooked food, aided by conscious hygienic precautions and
                    medical aid, tends to exclude or remove them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Effects of Parasitic Life on Parasites.—</hi> So far from
                    treating the phenomena of parasitic life as highly aberrant, and the
                    peculiarities of parasitic form as differentiations <hi rend="italic">sui
                    generis,</hi> it becomes evident that we have to do with only one of the many
                    cases in which the influence of environment on organism is clearly marked. The
                    aetiology of parasitism is only a fraction of a vaster general question; and we
                    shall never fully understand the adaptation of the parasite to its host until
                    the relation of environment to organism has been far more profoundly analysed
                    and completely experimented on—inquiries which have only recently begun to be
                    seriously set on foot. The most cursory consideration of the action of
                    environment shows how profoundly it determines form; of this ho better examples
                    can be found than those furnished by the habit of plants. It is easy to see how
                    submerged leaves must become dissected, or desert plants tend to become
                    succulent; how evergreens are only possible in certain conditions of climate, or
                    thorns are only useful where herbivorous mammals abound. In the same way we can
                    broadly see that the conditions of life profoundly influence animal form. Before
                    considering how the abnormal parasitic environment affects the parasite, we
                    should know how the normal environment affects the non-parasite, and how the two
                    cases differ. The environment thus needs analysis into its factors, the organism
                    similarly into its constituent systems of organs; and the influence of any
                    factor of the environment upon each system and organ demands determination,
                    species by species, before safe and exhaustive generalizations can be obtained.
                    Pending these inquiries, which are destined to take so large a place in the
                    biology of the future, and within the present narrow limits, only the merest
                    outline can be attempted.</p>
                <p>Morphological science has but slowly and with difficulty disentangled itself from
                    the primitive classifications of plants and animals by habit and resemblances of
                    external form; the physiologist, however, needs to reassert the claims of these
                    and develop them in detail; as for the child so for him whales are in a sense
                    fishes, and bats birds,—just as the swimming organs of the former, like those of
                    the penguin or cuttlefish, are all fins, or the flying organs of the latter and
                    those of insects are wings alike. Such considerations show too the first
                    importance of the mechanical conditions, primarily those of locomotion or rest,
                    and whether in water, or land, or in air, since these determine, not only
                    external form, but muscular and skeletal disposition and structure. These
                    determined, conditions of heat and light play an obvious part; copious supplies
                    of heat energy to the organism have a distinct result in stimulating plant
                    growth, and accelerating that of animals; light too, a primal necessity for
                    green plants, has also the most marked effect on animals, which develop tracts
                    of absorbent pigments in its presence, these becoming locally evolved for
                    perception into eyes; while in relation to sound-vibrations and impressions of
                    contact other sense organs develop. Quantity of food has its influence mainly on
                    size, but nature of food and mode of feeding demand many appropriate
                    specializations of details of form. Expressing the same adaptations from the
                    other point of view, that of the organism, we see how not only the general form
                    but the integument with its colour and texture, and also the respiratory and
                    alimentary organs, are necessarily fitted to avail themselves of the given
                    conditions; how the circulatory and how the reproductive systems must comply;
                    how the sensory organs must take note more and more of the changes in the
                    environment; and how the whole series of complex adaptations demands a similarly
                    complex internal mechanism for their co-ordination through the nervous
                    system.</p>
                <p>From the slightest analysis then of the relation of organism to environment, the
                    theory of evolution might almost have been predicted, since, if the details of
                    environment and organism be indeed obviously and precisely adapted one to
                    another, change in the former must either be followed by the extinction of the
                    latter or its modification in the requisite details. To explain the <hi
                    rend="italic">modus</hi><hi rend="italic">operandi</hi> of change in the
                    organism, we have mainly to bear in mind Dohrn’s admirably expressed “principle
                    of functional change,”—the simple conception that any living tissue, however
                    specialized, still retains traces of all the functions of living protoplasm, and
                    that any one of these traces may be indefinitely increased by favourable
                    conditions, and the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n280/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0280-0263"/> specialized function similarly reduced to a
                    trace. Along with this, or rather as a corollary of it, comes the conception of
                    economy of unused structure; our notions of specialization become henceforth
                    associated with a corresponding possibility of simplification, and our idea of
                    progress must be for ever accompanied by the corresponding possibility of
                    degeneration.</p>
                <p>The conditions of parasitic life are readily seen to differ primarily from those
                    of independent organisms in negative characters, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in
                    the simplification of the factors of the environment; let us therefore .briefly
                    consider the results of such progressive simplification upon organisms in
                    general. Let the mechanical conditions be simplified by the cessation of active
                    movement; the specialized body-form necessary for locomotion then becomes
                    unnecessary; locomotor muscles and their skeletal attachments are simplified or
                    disappear; organs of sense are far less needed; and nervous adaptations and
                    structures become correspondingly reduced. In all these respects then sessile
                    parasites simply agree with other sessile animals. Again, let us simplify the
                    environment by the deprivation of light; eyes and pigment are useless, and our
                    organism, whether cave-dwelling insect or crustacean or internal parasite,
                    becomes blanched and blind; and similarly with other senses. Or let us subtract
                    as far as possible the element of danger from other animals by special
                    protection or concealment in one of the “nooks of life”; here again for shelled
                    mollusc, sand buried <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus,</hi> or hidden parasite the
                    diminished need of nervous adaptations is a similar degenerative factor. Let
                    food become abundant, the same nervous economy follows; let it be highly
                    nutritive, and digestive structures and functions may be simplified; thus the
                    examples of progressive degeneration of the alimentary system up to its complete
                    replacement by superficial absorption, afforded by various parasitic series, are
                    natural enough. The soft integument unprotected and blanched, the reduced
                    muscular activities, the simple or absent alimentary tube, the reduced
                    circulatory and respiratory organs consequent upon diminished waste and softened
                    integument, are all intelligible enough, as also is the increase in reproductive
                    activity demanded by increased risk of failure to find the appropriate
                    conditions. The few adaptive conditions are readily understood: given the
                    continuous application of a flat muscular surface to resist detachment from the
                    host, and atmospheric pressure helps the development of the sucker; given either
                    a clutching limb or a portion of the body-wall thrust for support into the host,
                    and the mechanical conditions aid the differentiation of a hook; here, if
                    anywhere, function in fact may be said to make the organ, and such curious
                    resemblances of superficial form as those between say a gregarine, a tapeworm,
                    and an <hi rend="italic">Eeh,inorhynchus</hi> are not hard to explain.</p>
                <p>Further details of the process of retrograde metamorphosis and of the enormously
                    important phenomena of degeneration cannot here be attempted; it must suffice if
                    the general dependence of such changes upon simplification of
                    environment—freedom from danger, abundant alimentation and complete repose,
                    &amp;c. (in short, the conditions commonly considered those of complete material
                    wellbeing)—has been rendered clearer, and if the phenomena of parasitism,
                    however apparently aberrant, become intelligible as new evidences of the unity
                    of organic nature.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    Host.—</hi> As the result of the association of two organisms with more or less
                    constancy, various mutual modifications of form and function must obviously
                    occur. The more important effects of parasite on host may be briefly outlined.
                    Semper cites numerous cases where the commensal or parasite has a mechanically
                    trans forming effect on the host. Thus a horny coral with which an annelid is
                    constantly associated has become permanently modified to form an encasing tube.
                    Worms inside corals have enlarged the base of the cavity by stimulating growth,
                    and may also produce permanent pores. Pycnogonids on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Campanularia</hi> produce galls, which acquire specific characters, and various
                    species of crab parasitic on corals form galls, two of which coalescing, form a
                    sort of “cave dwelling” with two fissures which are kept open by the respiratory
                    currents of the crab, which thus both stimulates and checks the growth of the
                    polyps. In higher animals, and with more intimate parasitism, the mechanical
                    influences of the parasite on the host are more serious and more markedly
                    pathological. Thus parasitic worms, by their size and number, frequently close
                    up passages such as arteries, windpipe, àc., causing often fatal results. But
                    many parasites are also actively destructive to certain tissues of their
                    host—thus, as Semper points out, <hi rend="italic">Peltogaster</hi> destroys the
                    female reproductive organsof <hi rend="italic">Pagurus,</hi> a Trematode those
                    of <hi rend="italic">Limnaea</hi><hi rend="italic">stagnalis,</hi> the larva of
                    a fly <hi rend="italic">(Cuterebra</hi><hi rend="italic">emasculator)</hi> the
                    testes of various species of American squirrel. In none of these cases, however,
                    is the general vitality of the host affected. The results of active motion
                    within the host are productive of still more serious mischief; thus the internal
                    migration and burrowing of such parasites as <hi rend="italic">Trichina</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Bilharzia</hi> is well known to produce violent inflammation.
                    The perforation of vessels, the consequent extravasation of blood, and the
                    destruction of tissue often end fatally for the host. Leuckart distinguishes
                    pathological effects as due either to growth and increase of parasites, or to
                    their wanderings within the host, or thirdly to the very considerable loss of
                    nourishment which a number of parasites of appreciable size necessarily entails.
                    Some blood-sucking parasites are specially dangerous, and many less ferocious
                    forms doubtless poison their host to some extent by their waste products. Roux
                    also notes how parasites—an <hi rend="italic">Echinococcus,</hi> for example—by
                    inducing a flow of nutritive material, may develop a net work of capillaries and
                    produce other histological changes<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>It is probable that many of the most remarkable integumentary specializations of
                    the animal kingdom are defences against parasites (somewhat as the stings or
                    thorns which protect foliage, or the hairs which keep ants from flowers); thus
                    the nematocysts of coelenterates, the molluscan shell or the crustacean mail,
                    the vigilant pedicellariae of the echinoderm, or the scales of the fish are
                    alike largely specialized as defences against the never-ceasing attacks of
                    swarms of larval parasites, eagerly struggling to gain entrance or footing
                    anywhere</p>
                <p>The history of the medical aspects of parasitism can only be very briefly alluded
                    to. From the time of the ancient Arabian physicians some diseases, such as itch,
                    have been referred to parasites. With the increasing knowledge as to the
                    prevalence and importance of parasitism there arose a distinct parasitic theory
                    of disease, and in the 17th and 18th centuries such questions were discussed as
                    “an mors naturalis sit substantia verminosa.” In spite of the gradual
                    unravelling of the mysteries of origin and lifehistory, physicians long clung
                    conservatively to the old hypothesis of spontaneous generation, even Bremser
                    regarding the pathological states of the host not as caused by the parasites,
                    but as causing and in fact creating them. It was not till within the last thirty
                    years that, with the rise of experimental helminthology, medical science shook
                    itself free from superstition and ignorance, and devoted close attention to
                    aetiology and treatment, culminating in that systematic warfare against all
                    forms of parasitism <pb break="no"

                    medicine and the veterinary art (see p. 269 <hi rend="italic">infra</hi> and <hi

                    >Vegetable Parasitism.</hi></p>
                <p>The name of parasites has been given to those plants which are nourished wholly
                    or partially at the expense of other living organisms. The degree and nature of
                    the benefit thus obtained varies greatly with different plants, and the effect
                    produced upon the host ranges from an almost imperceptible one to complete
                    destruction. At one extreme are certain forms which, while drawing the
                    nourishment necessary for life from their hosts, yet do so in such fashion that
                    both organisms continue to live in intimate association, and, it may be,
                    rendering mutual help. From these by a series of gradations we come to parasites
                    of such destructive influence as to cause widespread death to certain animal and
                    vegetable forms of life. This physiological group is closely related to another,
                    the saprophytes, which obtain their nourishment from the dead remains of
                    organisms. True parasites belong exclusively to the dicotyledonous flowering
                    plants and the fungi. A few algae are partial parasites.</p>
                <p>The remarkable appearance presented by most parasitic flowering plants
                    undoubtedly attracted notice in remote times. They are frequently mentioned by
                    early writers, but there is no evidence sufficient to enable us to determine
                    whether they were regarded as independent plants or merely as pathological
                    excrescences—unless in the one case of the mistletoe, which was recognized as
                    the former by Pliny, who gives an account of its reproduction by seed. The
                    effects of the attack of parasitic fungi were also observed in very early times,
                    as there is abundant evidence to show, but the plants themselves which caused
                    the damage were necessarily not detected as such from their minute size and
                    obscure nature. We must come to the middle of the 18th century for the first
                    attempt to establish a botanical group of flowering parasites. Pfeiffer, in his
                    treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Fungus melitensis (Cynomorium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">coccineum),</hi> divides all flowering parasites into three
                    groups, according as they infested the whole plant or attacked but one place or
                    were confined to the root; but he includes many epiphytes, such as ivy, lichens,
                    &amp;c. After this remarkable classification a knowledge of native and exotic
                    forms grew up, and nothing noteworthy occurred in the history of the subject
                    until the end of last century and beginning of the present one, when there was a
                    relapse to the old theory that parasites were no more than degenerate outgrowths
                    from their hosts. For example, Meyen attempted to account on anatomical grounds
                    for the existence of <hi rend="italic">Lathraea</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >squamaria</hi> on its host, and more absurdly still, Trattinick, in a letter to
                    Schlechtendal, gave a short list of plants to which parasites bear a very
                    superficial resemblance, and gravely affirmed his belief that the latter are but
                    specific degenerations of these. Thus he contended that <hi rend="italic"
                    >Balanophora</hi> is but an <hi rend="italic">Arum, C'y</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tinus</hi> a <hi rend="italic">Cotyledon, Raffl,esia,</hi> a cabbage, &amp;c.
                    De Candolle made the first genuine attempt in 1832 to establish a classification
                    of parasites on morphological and physiological grounds; Unger followed in 1840
                    with a purely morphological arrangement, and, though he advanced matters
                    considerably, his treatise contains much speculation not borne out by facts.
                    Martins’s classification of about the same time is on much the same lines as De
                    Candolle’s. The knowledge of parasitic fungi has advanced gradually with the
                    improvement of the microscope, and the accumulation of the life-histories of
                    forms has grown up under the hands of numerous observers, among the earliest of
                    whom Knight performed admirable service. With increasing knowledge of native and
                    exotic forms, and the advance made in the fields of vegetable anatomy and
                    physiology, the whole group of vegetable parasites has become more strictly
                    defined,—the last noteworthy service being the establishment by De Bary <hi

                    of “saprophytes” to receive those plants which differ from the parasites in

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Monotropeae,</hi> which are allied to the heaths, possess

                    as a saprophyte on organic matter derived from the soil. There has been some
                    controversy as to the parasitism of these plants. Perhaps the strongest evidence
                    in its favour was offered by Drude, who stated that he found a parasitic
                    connexion between <hi rend="italic">Monotropa</hi> and the roots of <hi

                    >Monotropa</hi> was then generally regarded as both parasite and saprophyte.
                    More recently, however, Kamienski has denied the accuracy of Drude’s
                    interpretation of the case, and, affirming that <hi rend="italic">Monotropa</hi>
                    possesses no haustoria, upholds the view that it is no true parasite. Upon the
                    evidence it may be taken that no case has yet been satisfactorily made out for
                    the parasitism of this group. The suborder consists of ten or twelve species
                    included in nine genera occurring in north temperate regions. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cuscutaceae</hi> (Dodders) are a suborder of <hi
                    rend="italic">Convolvulaceae,</hi> and are distinguished by their fibrous,
                    climbing stems bearing very small scale-like leaves. They are entirely without
                    chlorophyll, and are true parasites. The gtoup consists of annual plants
                    reproduced each year from their seed, which commonly ripens about the same time
                    as that of the host plants. The seeds of host and parasite are frequently found
                    mixed, and it consequently happens that they are sown together. When the seed of
                    the dodder germinates it <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n282/mode/1up"

                    of the host plant develops a papilla-like body at the point of contact. From the
                    papilla there proceeds the true haustorium, which penetrates the tissues of the
                    host as far as the vascular system, where it expands slightly and terminates in
                    a broad surface. The haustorium is furnished with a central vascular bundle
                    originating in the vascular system of the dodder stem. When this haustorium has
                    been developed the root of the dodder dies off and all connexion with the soil
                    ceases, while the stem above the haustorium continues to wind round its host,
                    producing fresh haustoria at short intervals, and gradually enveloping and
                    destroying the plant. The influences exerted are of two kinds :—(1) a truly
                    parasitic influence, since the dodder, possessing neither connexion with the
                    soil nor chlorophyll, obtains all its nourishment from its host by the action of
                    its haustoria; and (2) a mechanical influence, in depriving its host of air,
                    light, &amp;c., and preventing the development of branches, leaves, &amp;c. (see
                    fig. 2). The commonest species are <hi rend="italic">Cuscuta Epithymum,</hi>

                <p>There are at least five genera of <hi rend="italic">Scrophulariaceae</hi> which

                    on which small haustoria are developed. <hi rend="italic">Euphrasia,</hi>
                    occurring in both north and south temperate regions, is partially parasitic on
                    roots of grasses. <hi rend="italic">Pedicularis</hi> is common in alpine and

                    coloured, but destitute of chlorophyll. They are parasitic on the roots of many
                    different herbs and shrubs by means of their haustoria, which penetrate to the
                    vascular system of the host. They attach themselves thus immediately after

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cytinaceae</hi> are a very remarkable order of truly
                    parasitic plants which are wholly destitute of chlorophyll, and of a very
                    degraded structure. <hi rend="italic">Cytinus</hi> possesses a scaly stem
                    bearing sessile flowers, while <hi rend="italic">Eafflesia</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Brugmansia</hi> consists one may say of a single flower, measuring
                    in the case of <hi rend="italic">Eafflesia</hi> as much as 3 feet across. These
                    flowers appear first in the form of knobs emerging from the host plant, and
                    before expanding resemble an unopened cabbage. They remain expanded only for a
                    few days, when putrefaction begins and a smell as of putrescent flesh is
                    emitted, serving thus to attract insects which probably aid in effecting
                    fertilization, since the stamens are in different flowers. There are about
                    twenty-four species in the order, and these are mostly tropical. <hi

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Loranthaceae</hi> are parasitic on the stems and branches
                    of trees, but, since they bear mostly thick and leathery leaves containing
                    chlorophyll, their parasitism cannot be considered so complete as in those cases
                    where chlorophyll is absent. The order is for the most part a tropical one, but
                    it is represented in Europe by <hi rend="italic">Loranthus</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >album,</hi> L., the common mistletoe. <hi rend="italic">Loranthus</hi> is a
                    large tropical genus containing upwards of three hundred species. <hi
                    rend="italic">Arceuthobium</hi> occurs in southern Europe. The mode of
                    parasitism of <hi rend="italic">Viscum</hi><hi rend="italic">album,</hi> L., the
                    mistletoe, may be taken as illustrative of the order. Its seeds adhere to the
                    young shoots of trees by means of the viscid pulp of the fruit (used in the
                    preparation of bird-lime). On germination it shoots out rootlets which traverse
                    the cortex of the host mostly in the direction of the axis, sending down
                    numerous haustoria into the wood, where the cells of the parasite become partly
                    lignified, and thus attain an intimate connexion with the wood-cells of the
                    host. A layer of meristem is formed in the haustorium where it passes through
                    the cambium region of the host stem, thus enabling the parasite to keep pace
                    with the growth in thickness, and gradually to become more deeply fixed. The
                    function of the growing point, which soon passes over into permanent tissue, is
                    thus transferred to this region of the haustorium. Ultimately this layer of
                    meristem is also transformed into permanent tissue, and the activity of the
                    parasite in this direction ceases. The haustoria are commonly situated close
                    together in considerable numbers, and an excessive demand upon the host is thus
                    brought about, causing local death and a hurtful influence throughout the plant,
                    exhibited in its defective development. Where a tree has been attacked by
                    mistletoe a corroded and distorted appearance is presented, owing to the drying
                    up of the tissues and the reparative processes that ensue. "When the mistletoe
                    has thus exhausted one region of supply it frequently sends out adventitious
                    shoots, which, attacking the host in fresh places, give rise to new growths of
                    the parasite. The mistletoe grows on a large number of different trees, such as
                    the apple, lime, elm, maple, willow, thorn, poplar, and even on conifers. Though
                    exceedingly plentiful on the apple, it rarely attacks the pear tree, and the
                    Lombardy poplar seems to be exempt, while other poplars suffer considerably.
                    Very rarely does it attack the oak, and Dr Bull, who made exhaustive inquiry <hi

                    though there is no real affinity in the case. The stems are succulent, somewhat
                    knob-shaped or cylindrical, varying in height from a few inches to a foot, in
                    which latter case they are sometimes branched, and bear imbricated scales in

                    rend="smallcaps">Fungi.</hi> —The absence of chlorophyll from all fungi, and the
                    necessity thus thrown upon them of taking up the carbon compounds assimilated by
                    other organisms, determines their mode of life, which is therefore either
                    parasitic or saprophytic. The parasitic organ of the fungal thallus is the <hi
                    rend="italic">mycelium,</hi> upon which haustoria are sometimes developed in the
                    form of lateral protuberances of various shapes and sizes. In the same species
                    of parasitic fungus receptacles frequently occur of different kinds, succeeding
                    each other more or less regularly in cycles, and sometimes in their course
                    preying upon hosts of remote affinities among themselves. This course of life is
                    of practical importance when effort is made to limit the ravages of such a
                    parasite (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mildew,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 293). Many
                    indiscriminately attack plants nearly allied to each other; numerous species are
                    peculiar to one host; while others are confined to a single region such as the
                    ovary, the stem, or the leaf of one or more species of the higher plants. The
                    spores, invariably of microscopical -dimensions, represent the infectious agent,
                    as the seeds of flowering parasites commonly do. They are conveyed by the
                    atmosphere, by contact of one plant with another, by insects and other animals,
                    àc., and germinate by the emission of a germ-tube, the production of zoospores
                    sometimes intervening. Access to the host is obtained by the penetration of the
                    epidermal tissue or by way of the open stomata. The main body of the fungus is
                    either endophytic or epiphytic—the spore-producing portion in nearly all cases
                    opening externally. The amount of damage effected by the attack varies from
                    slight local injury to the destruction of the host; in some cases cellcontents
                    only are destroyed, while in others whole tissues perish. The effect produced is
                    often in the direction of abnormal stimulus, and the hypertrophy of whole
                    regions or the production of galls ensues. The parasite commonly prepares the
                    way for the saprophyte, which steps in to break up the dead and decaying
                    remains. In certain rare instances the union of parasitic and saprophytic modes
                    of life in the same species has been observed (see below). The fungi which are
                    concerned in the constitution of lichens maintain with the algal components
                    throughout life relations of consortism which will be dealt with below, under

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Peronosporcae</hi> are all parasites on vascular plants of
                    many different orders. The mycelium inhabits the tissues of the host, and, in

                    globular or irregularly branching filamentous haustoria (see fig. 3) into the

                    Parasitism.</hi> —It has been seen that the dependence of parasites upon their
                    hosts for the means of subsistence varies considerably in degree, but it is
                    equally manifest that underlying this condition of existence there are certain
                    facts which characterize every case. The most important of these is the absence
                    or the inadequate supply of chlorophyll and the <pb break="no"

                    assimilation. For a comparison of this abnormal condition with the normal state
                    a subject is found ready to hand in the nourishment of one organ by another, as
                    exemplified in the growth of young seedlings, which in the case of seeds
                    containing endosperm (cocoa-nut, date-palm, and many other monocotyledons)
                    absorb by means of a definite organ the nourishment necessary for their
                    development. Young plants nourished from the reserve-materials stored in bulbs
                    and the like, and the young shoots of a tree from winter buds, afford a
                    comparison which is even closer in an anatomical respect, since in this case
                    there is present, as in the intimate association of parasitic haustoria with the
                    host, a continuity of tissues which is not so strongly marked in the union of
                    the absorbing organ of a seedling with the endosperm. Looking at the subject
                    wholly from the point of view of the process of nutrition, there seems to be
                    little essential difference between parasite and saprophyte, since we have not
                    only experimental instances of the nutrition of parasites on artificially
                    prepared solutions, but the natural union of both habits in the same individual
                    (salmon-disease, &lt;fcc.; see also the experiments of Grawitz on the growth of
                    saprophytic fungi in the blood of animals). These are exceptional instances,
                    however, and it is manifest that other properties must be brought into play,
                    since most parasites affect peculiar hosts, and many of them certain regions
                    only of the plant. It is equally true that many saprophytes are able to grow
                    only in peculiar substrata.</p>
                <p>That parasitism is often but partial is apparent from such instances as the
                    mistletoe, <hi rend="italic">Rhinanthus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Thesium,</hi>
                    &lt;fcc., which probably obtain from their hosts in the main only water and
                    mineral substances in solution, to be prepared for plant food in their green
                    leaves. It is most likely, however, that a small quantity of certain organic
                    compounds is a necessary accompaniment in all such instances. Here again there
                    exist the means for comparison with green saprophytes. The taking up of ash
                    constituents from the soil may occur in such parasites as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orobanche,</hi> which possesses rootlets, though undoubtedly the whole of the
                    necessary carbon compounds are obtained from the host.</p>
                <p>This mode of life not only acts upon the host, but reacts upon the parasite
                    itself, as is manifested by the aberrant and degraded structure of the parts
                    (directly and indirectly) concerned in nutrition, and even of the reproductive
                    system. This is strongly marked in the case of the embryo. It is apparent that
                    large transpiratory surfaces are unnecessary, and would even be of detriment to
                    a parasite; and with this the formation of wood so intimately connected with the
                    process of transpiration keeps pace in degradation. In the mistletoe, for
                    example, the bulk of wood is in relation to the small transpiratory surface, and
                    in the cases of parasites without chlorophyll it dwindles to insignificance. No
                    other abnormal mode of life so influences the structure of a plant as a
                    parasitic or a saprophytic one, though we see an approach to it in the
                    adaptations existing in insectivorous plants.</p>
                <p>The effect upon 'the host ranges from local injury to destruction on the one
                    hand, and, on the other, in the case of stimulus, from the local production of
                    galls to the complete hypertrophy and transformation of at least large regions
                    of a plant. The exciting of definite reparative processes is an indirect effect.
                    It must be noticed also that many parasites, especially fungi, cause in the host
                    enormous destruction of food material far exceeding that necessary to their
                    maintenance. In this way the parasite frequently commits suicide as it were, and
                    the act is in striking contrast to the relations of symbiosis as exemplified in
                    the lichen thallus.</p>
                <p>The change of or alternation between two different hosts is adapted to suit the
                    requirements of the parasite. This is notably so in the case of the corn-mildew,
                    which passes an intermediate stage on the barberry until a period when the wheat
                    plant has sufficiently developed to become a suitable host.</p>
                <p>Most fungi are endophytic, and certain phanerogamic parasites, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Rafflesia,</hi> develop within the cortex of the host, while on
                    the other hand the fungal part of a lichen encloses the algal.</p>
                <p>The existence and complete dependence upon its host of a parasite culminating in
                    the production of seed after its kind is one of the most impressive
                    relationships physiology presents.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    to the whole community of organisms, is a mode of life closely related to
                    parasitism, in which, however, as has been seen, the profit is one-sided and the
                    alliance ends with the exhaustion of the host or the detachment of the parasite.
                    The term was first employed by De Bary <hi rend="italic">(Die</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Erscheinung der Symbiose,</hi> 1879), but the relations expressed
                    by it were first brought into general notice by the epoch-marking discovery of
                    the dual nature of the lichen thallus by Schwendener in 1868, and established
                    after prolonged and searching controversy, more especially by the classical
                    histological researches of Bornet, and the actual artificial lichen synthesis
                    (by sowing fungus on alga) by Stahl. Some theory of reciprocal accommodation was
                    necessary to account for the duration of such relations between a fungal
                    organism and an algal; and, though it is not yet precisely known in what way
                    these relations are maintained, speculation has been active enough. It may
                    safely be inferred that the fungal portion of the thallus is nourished by the
                    exosmose of starch and the like in much the same fashion as the colourless cells
                    of a plant are fed by those bearing chlorophyll; and there can be little doubt
                    that the algal cells benefit in return by the endosmose of the waste products of
                    the fungal protoplasm. In the reproductive process an adaptation exists in
                    certain lichens for the supply of gonidia to the new lichen. Hymenial-gonidia
                    (the offspring of the thallus-gonidia) are present in the apothecia, from which
                    they are cast out along with the spores, and falling with them are subsequently
                    enclosed by the germ tubes (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Fungus,</hi> vol. ix. p.
                    835). It may be noted here that, though the fungal portions of the thallus
                    retain the marks of near relationship to ascomycetous fungi, they are yet
                    considerably modified by this mode of life, and unfitted most probably in nearly
                    every case for the distinctly parasitic or saprophytic life normal to fungi. The
                    algal portion, on the other hand, is capable of independent existence after
                    liberation from the fungal thallus. The complete symbiotic community represents
                    an autonomous whole, living frequently in situations where neither alga nor
                    fungus is known to support existence separately.<note anchored="true"

                    rend="italic">Convoluta</hi><hi rend="italic">Schultzii,</hi> Schm. He found
                    that the analysis of the gas given off by these green animals, under the
                    influence of direct sunlight, “yielded from 45 to 55 per cent, of oxygen.” The
                    discovery of these vegetating animals directed fresh attention to
                    chlorophyll-bearing animals, with much result. The nature and functions of the
                    yellow cells of radiolarians had long been an unsolved enigma. Haeckel had
                    detected in them in 1870 the presence of starch, and regarded them as stores of
                    reserve material. Cienkowski, in the following year, contended for their algal
                    nature without finally deciding the question, and without perceiving the
                    significance such organisms would have in the economy of the radiolarian. Much
                    suggestive observation followed by the Hertwigs, Brandt, Entz, Korotneff,
                    Lankester, Moseley, and others on similar bodies in various organisms; but the
                    subject remained in uncertainty till its reinvestigation by Brandt, and
                    simultaneously and much more conclusively by Geddes, finally supplied the
                    solution of the difficulties. After confirming Haeckel’s discovery of the
                    presence of starch, and the observations of Cienkowski, Brandt, and others on
                    the survival of the yellow cells after the death of the radiolarian, and
                    extending his observation to various other organisms, Geddes demonstrated the
                    truly algal nature of these cells from their cellulose walls, the identity of
                    their yellow colouring-matter with that of diatoms, and the evolution of oxygen
                    (in some instances, such as <hi rend="italic">Anthea</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cereas,</hi> very copiously) under the influence of sunlight. It was pointed
                    out that the animal protoplasm investing these starch-producing cells (and
                    containing amylolytic ferment) must obtain by osmosis its share of the dissolved
                    starch, and that benefit must accrue to the animal from thedigestion of the dead
                    bodies of the algae. The evolution of oxygen during sunshine into the
                    surrounding animal protoplasm is a respiratory function fittingly compared to
                    that performed by certain stationary deposits of haemoglobin. On the other hand
                    the carbonic acid and nitrogenous waste produced by the animal cell is the
                    nutritive return made to the alga, which in removing them performs an intracel
                    lular renal function. The young gonophores of <hi rend="italic">Velella,</hi>
                    after budding off from the parent, start in life with a provision of algae, and
                    in this respect bear interesting resemblance to the function performed by the
                    hymenial-gonidia of lichens described above. The physiological relations are
                    summed up as follows :—“Thus, then, for a vegetable cell no more ideal existence
                    can be imagined than that within the body of an animal cell of sufficient active
                    vitality to manure it with abundance of carbonic anhydride and nitrogenous
                    waste, yet of sufficient transparency to allow the free entrance of the
                    necessary light. And, conversely, for an animal cell there can be no more ideal
                    existence than to contain a sufficient number of vegetable cells, constantly
                    removing its waste products, supplying it with oxygen and starch, and being
                    digestible after death.” The completeness of the case thus established for a
                    symbiotic mode of life marks one of the most interesting and impressive chapters
                    in the history of the biological relations between animals and plants.</p>
                <p>A re-discussion of the subject, largely historical and controversial, but with
                    excellent bibliography, has been lately furnished by Brandt, and more recently a
                    further contribution has been made by Oscar Hertwig, who repeats the views of
                    preceding investigators and goes on to speculate as to the nature of symbiosis

                    affecting cattle, (3) the itch, and (4) certain diseases caused by various
                    species of nematodes, and one disease caused by a trematode.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Skin Diseases due to Parasitic Fungi.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Favus</hi> (“honeycomb”) is a common disease of the scalp (more rarely of the
                    hairless parts of the skin) in children, primarily of scrofulous or
                    ill-cared-for children, but apt to spread to others, especially in schools. The
                    uncomplicated appearance is that of a number of yellowish circular cup-shaped
                    crusts, grouped in patches like a piece of honeycomb, each about the size of a
                    split pea, with a hair projecting in the centre. This was the first disease in
                    which a fungus was discovered—by Schönlein in 1839; the discovery was published
                    in a brief note of twenty lines in <hi rend="italic">Muller's</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Archiv</hi> for that year (p. 82), the fungus having been
                    subsequently named by Remak <hi rend="italic">Achorion</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Schönleinii</hi> after its discoverer. The achorion consists of slender
                    mycelial threads matted together, bearing oval nucleated gonidia either free or
                    jointed. The spores would appear to enter through the unbroken cutaneous
                    surface, and to germinate mostly in and around the hair-follicle and sometimes
                    in the shaft of the hair. Favus is commonest among the poorer Jews of Russia,
                    Poland, Hungary, Galicia, and the East, and among the same class of Mohammedans
                    in Turkey, Asia Minor, Syria, Persia, Egypt, Algiers, &amp;c. It is not rare in
                    the southern departments of France, in some parts of Italy, and in Scotland.</p>
                <p>The treatment of favus is difficult and disappointing. The first requisite is
                    good feeding; meanwhile the crusts are to be removed by poulticing, the hair
                    being cut short. The next thing is to destroy the fungus, to which end a lotion
                    of sulphurous acid (one part to three or four of water) may be applied
                    repeatedly by means of lint, and the scalp kept covered by an oil-silk cap. To
                    prevent the return of the fungus, various agents may be rubbed in, such as
                    codliver oil, oil of cade, or an ointment of iodine or of pitch, the oil-silk
                    cap being worn continuously. It has often been found of advantage to pull out
                    all the broken stumps of hairs with a tweezers (ste Bennett’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prin. and Pract. of Med.,</hi> 5th ed., Edin., 1868, ρ. 847).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ringιcorm,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tinea Tonsurans,</hi> a
                    much more common disease of the scalp (especially within the tropics), consists
                    of bald patches, usually round, and varying in diameter from half an inch up to
                    several inches, the surface showing the broken stumps of hairs and a fine
                    whitish powdering of desquamated epidermic scales. In scrofulous subjects matter
                    is sometimes produced, which forms crusts or glues the hairs together or
                    otherwise obscures the characteristic appearance. The disease is due to a
                    fungus, <hi rend="italic">Trichophyton tonsurans,</hi> which exists mostly in
                    the form of innumerable spores (with hardly any mycelium), and is most abundant
                    within the substance of the hairs, especially at their roots. If a piece of the
                    hair near the root be soaked for a time in dilute liquor potassae and pressed
                    flat under a cover-glass, the microscope will show it to be occupied by long
                    rows of minute oval spores, very uniform in size, and each bearing a nucleus.
                    The treatment of ringworm is very much the same as the treatment of favus.</p>
                <p>The same fungus sometimes attacks the hairs of the beard, producing a disease
                    called “sycosis.” Sometimes it invades the hairless regions of skin, forming
                    “tinea circinata circular patches of skin disease, if they be sharply defined by
                    a margin of papules or vesicles, may be suspected of depending on the
                    tinea-fungus. Interesting varieties of tinea are found in some of the Pacific
                    and East Indian islands.</p>

                    patches of brownish discolorations of various sizes and shapes, mostly on the
                    front of the body, and often attended with itching, especially after heating
                    exercise. The pigmentation seems to radiate from the orifices of hair-follicles.
                    The epidermis is in a scaly condition over the patch, and among the debris of
                    the epidermic cell there may be seen minute oval spores, which are supposed to
                    belong to a fungus, the <hi rend="italic">Microsporon Furfur.</hi> The disease
                    is mostly one of adult age, found all over the world, and not associated in any
                    special way with poor general health. The treatment consists of rubbing in an
                    ointment of sulphuret of potassium, or one of the mercurial ointments, or using
                    sulphur-soap habitually.</p>

                    under the name of “pinto” or “mal de los pintos,” lιave been claimed by

                    mycelial filaments may be detected among the deeper rows of cells of the rete
                    mucosum. The disease, which is somewhat serious from its large superficial area,
                    would appear to be one of the many forms of <hi rend="italic">morbus
                    miseries</hi>; but it is contagious, and is sometimes seen in the well-to-do. In
                    some villages of the western districts of Tabasco (Mexico), it has been
                    estimated that 9 per cent, of the inhabitants suffer from the pinto; M*Clellan
                    says that in 1826 in the city of Mexico he saw a whole regiment of
                    “pintados.”</p>
                <p>Before leaving the parasitic fungi of the skin, it should be mentioned that <hi
                    rend="italic">Oidiιιm albicans</hi> is apt to plant itself on the mucous
                    membrane of the mouth in young and ailing children, causing whitish patches
                    known as thrush.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Actinomycosis.</hi></p>
                <p>In certain tumour-like formations of cattle, usually growing from the alveoli of
                    the lower molar teeth, and protruding externally near the angle of the jaw,
                    Bollinger in 1877 detected the presence of a number of sulphur-yellow bodies
                    about the size of a hemp seed and of a fatty consistence. These were found to be
                    aggregates of a peculiar radiate fungus <hi rend="italic">{Actinomyces},</hi>
                    which assumed the form of minute rosettes, the mycelial filaments expanding into
                    flask-like swellings at their free or circumferential ends. The yellow seed-like
                    conglomerates lay in spaces of the tumour, and they were also found within
                    cavities on the tongue, fauces, larynx, mucous membrane of the stomach, in
                    lymphatic glands, and (by a later observer) in the lungs. In 1879 Ponfick found
                    the same sulphur-yellow bodies in the body of a man who had died of chronic
                    disease of the chest, and who had a number of sinuses in the skin of the back.
                    Some twenty cases of actinomycosis in man have now been described in Germany; in
                    most of them· there have been centres of chronic inflammation in front of the
                    vertebrae in the cervical, dorsal, or lumbar regions, with numerous sinuses
                    penetrating the muscles and opening on the skin. The yellow conglomerates of <hi
                    rend="italic">Actinomyces</hi> are found in or upon the granulations of these
                    sinuses, or in the sero-purulent discharge from them, or in the muscles, or more
                    rarely in centres of granulationlike new growth in some of the viscera. The
                    relation of the fungus to the primary tumour-like new growth of the ox has not
                    yet been made out, and there is hardly any clue to the connexion between the
                    bovine disease and the somewhat modified form of it in man. In some respects
                    there is an analogy between actinomycosis and the fungus-foot of India as
                    described by Vandyke Carter.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Scabies.</hi></p>
                <p>Of the human diseases due to animal parasites there is only one of any importance
                    affecting the skin, namely, scabies or the itch. The parasite is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sarcoptes</hi><hi rend="italic">scabiei</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mite,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 529), which burrows under the epidermis
                    at any part of the body, but hardly ever in the face or scalp of adults; it
                    usually begins at the clefts of the fingers, where its presence may be inferred
                    from several scattered pimples, which will probably have been torn at their
                    summits by the scratching of the patient, or have been otherwise converted into
                    vesicles or pustules. The remedy is soap and water, and sulphur ointment.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Diseases due to Nematode and Trematode Worms.</hi></p>
                <p>The common thread-worm <hi rend="italic">{0xyuris),</hi> a small white object
                    about half an inch long, is very frequent in all countries, mostly in children;
                    its habitat is"the lower bowel, but it is often a troublesome irritant outside
                    the bowel as well. The round-worm <hi rend="italic">(Ascaris</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lumbricoides},</hi> about 6 inches long when full-sized, and not
                    unlike the common earth-worm, is less common in England and other Western
                    countries; but it is enormously common all over the East, and in the tropics
                    generally. Hundreds of them may accumulate in the body, causing an obvious
                    enlargement of the abdomen. The most valuable remedy against them is santonine
                    powder. A third intestinal nematode is the whip-worm (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Trichocephalus dispar},</hi> about 2 inches long, having a slender anterior
                    extremity joined on to the body like the thong to the handle of a whip. It is
                    said to be very common in some countries, such as France, but it has no great
                    importance as regards disease.</p>

                    >Anchylostoma</hi><hi rend="italic">duodenale,</hi> often associated with the

                    China and other parts of the East, and often associated with the disease called
                    lymph-scrotum, and with haemato-chyluria; and <hi rend="italic">Filaria
                    medinensis,</hi> the Guinea-worm, very common on the Guinea coast and in many
                    other tropical regions, a long and slender filament like a hair from a horse’s
                    tail, and mostly infesting the skin of the legs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trichinosis.—</hi> The presence of encysted trichinae in the
                    muscles was discovered in one or more of the London dissecting-rooms in 1828 and
                    following years; but it was not until thirty years later that the clinical
                    characters of the acute disease caused by the invasion of the parasite were
                    discovered. This discovery was made in 1860 by Zenker, on examining the
                    abdominal muscles of a patient who had died at Dresden, with symptoms taken to
                    be those of typhoid fever, the case being afterwards accounted one of
                    trichinosis on the <hi rend="italic">post mortem</hi> evidence. Epidemics of
                    this disease occur from time to time, especially in north Germany, from the
                    eating of uncooked swine’s flesh, in which trichinae are not uncommon. The
                    greatest care is now taken in Germany to examine the carcases of swine for
                    trichinae, a piece of the diaphragm of every animal being searched with the
                    microscope by an inspector specially appointed. The symptoms in man are
                    occasioned by the presence of the free parasites in the intestine, by the
                    development of young trichinae from the eggs, and most of all by the migration
                    of the parasites from the intestinal canal to the muscles, where they become
                    quiescent within a calcareous shell. This cycle occupies from four to six
                    λveeks. "When consumed in small quantity, the parasites may give rise to no
                    marked symptoms, and they are sometimes found accidentally in muscular fibre in
                    the bodies of those who had probably experienced no definite symptoms from their
                    invasion. In the more acute and serious cases, sometimes ending fatally, the
                    early symptoms are nausea, failure of appetite, diarrhoea, and fever; later,
                    when the migration to the muscles begins, there is more fever, stiffness, pain,
                    and swelling in the limbs, swelling of the eyelids, continued exhausting
                    diarrhoea, perspirations, and sometimes delirium. During convalescence there is
                    desquamation of the cuticle. If the diagnosis be made early in the case, brisk
                    purgatives, particularly calomel, are the best treatment; if the parasites are
                    already on their way to the muscles, the only thing left to do is to support the
                    patient’s strength.</p>

                    men employed in making the St Gotthard tunnel. Various names have been given to
                    the malady, such as mal d’estomac, mal de coeur, dirt-eating, anaemia
                    intertropicalis, cachexia Africana, and cachexie aqueuse. The symptoms, as first
                    observed among the negroes, were pain in the stomach, capricious appetite, pica
                    (or dirt-eating), obstinate constipation followed by diarrhoea, palpitations,
                    small and unsteady pulse, coldness of the skin, pallor of the skin and mucous
                    membranes, diminution of the secretions, loss of strength, and, in cases running
                    a fatal course, colliquative diarrhoea and dysentery, haemorrhages, and
                    dropsies. The parasites, which cling to the intestinal mucous membrane, draw
                    their nourishment from the blood-vessels of their host, and as they are found in
                    hundreds in the body after death, the disorders of digestion, the increasing
                    anaemia, and the consequent dropsies and other cachectic symptoms are easily
                    explained. It seems probable that the parasite is introduced in its larval stage
                    through the medium of the drinking-water. Male-fern, santonine, or other
                    anthelmintic remedies are prescribed for it; but, inasmuch as it is most apt to
                    lodge in the bodies of the ill-fed and otherwise ailing poor, there is little
                    doubt that the most satisfactory remedy would be to increase the power of
                    resistance by improving the general well-being.</p>

                    milky appearance of the urine, due to the presence of a substance like chyle,
                    which forms a clot, had been observed from time to time, especially in tropical
                    and subtropical countries; and it has been proved by the late Dr Wucherer of
                    Bahia, and by Dr Timothy Lewis, that this peculiar condition is uniformly
                    associated with the presence in the blood of minute· eel-like worms, visible
                    only under the microscope, being the embryo forms of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Filaria.</hi> The parent worms are very difficult to find, and their characters
                    and habits are imperfectly known; but they are supposed to be about 3 inches
                    long, and to inhabit dilatations of the lymph-carrying vessels. It is not yet
                    clear how the chyle gets into the urine, but it seems probable that the blood in
                    which filariae are present is altered in its constituents, although there is no
                    obvious change in <pb break="no"

                    the young nematodes. These are also present in the chylous urine. Sometimes the
                    discharge of lymph takes place at one or more points of the surface of the body,
                    and there is in other cases a condition of nae· void elephantiasis of the
                    scrotum, or lymph-scrotum. More or less of blood may occur along with the
                    chylous fluid in the urine. Both the chyluria and the presence of filariae in
                    the blood are curiously intermittent; it may happen that not a single filaria is
                    to be seen during the daytime, while they swarm in the blood at night, and it
                    has been ingeniously shown by Dr S. Mackenzie that they may be made to
                    disappear*if the patient sits up all night, reappearing while he sleeps through
                    the day.</p>
                <p>Dr Manson of Amoy has proved that mosquitoes imbibe the embryo filariae from the
                    blood of man; and that many of these reach full development within the mosquito,
                    acquiring their freedom when the latter resorts to water, where it dies after
                    depositing its eggs. Mosquitoes would thus be the intermediate host of the
                    filariae, and their introduction into the human body would be through the medium
                    of water.</p>

                    nematode like a horse hair, whose most frequent habitat is the skin of the legs
                    and feet. It is common on the Guinea coast, and in many other tropical and
                    subtropical regions, and has been familiarly known since ancient times. The
                    condition of dracontiasis due to it is a very common one, and sometimes amounts
                    to an epidemic. The black races are most liable, but Europeans of almost any
                    social rank and of either sex are not altogether exempt. The λvorm lives in

                    doubtful whether the worm penetrates the skin of the legs directly; it is not
                    impossible that the intermediate host (a Cyclops) which contains the larvae may
                    be swallowed with the water, and that the larvae of the <hi rend="italic"

                    of the Natal coast. The parasites live mostly in the blood-vessels of the
                    intestine and of the urinary bladder, whence they reach the mucous membranes;
                    and the most remarkable effects of their parasitism are bleeding from the
