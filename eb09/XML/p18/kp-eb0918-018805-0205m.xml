                    in Berlin. Pallas was carefully educated by his father, being accustomed from
                    boyhood to the use of several languages, among them English and French. He was
                    intended for the medical profession, and his progress was such that in 1758 he
                    lectured publicly on anatomy. Pallas studied at the universities of Berlin,
                    Halle, Göttingen, and Leyden. He early displayed a strong leaning towards
                    natural history investigations, which by the time he reached manhood almost
                    monopolized his attention. In 1761 he came to England, where he spent a year,
                    devoting himself to a thorough study of the collections he found there, and to a
                    geological investigation of part of the English coast; and at the age of
                    twenty-three he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society. Pallas spent
                    some time in Holland, where he found ample scope for investigation in his
                    special subjects, the results of which appeared at the Hague in 1766 in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Elenchus</hi><hi rend="italic">Zoophy</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >torum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Miscellanea Zoologica,</hi> and in 1767-1804
                    in his well-known <hi rend="italic">Spicilegia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Zoologica</hi> (Berlin). In 1768 he gladly accepted the invitation of the
                    empress Catherine to fill the professorship of natural history in the Imperial
                    Academy of Science, St Petersburg, and from that time until within a year of his
                    death his home was in Russia. The great event of his life, and that by which he
                    will be permanently remembered, was the expedition through Russia and Siberia in
                    1768-74, in which he acted as naturalist, in company with Falk, Lepechen, and
                    Güldenstadt, the immediate object being the observation of the transit of Venus
                    in 1769. In this leisurely journey Pallas went by Kasan to the Caspian, spent
                    some time among the Calmucks, crossed the Urals to Tobolsk, visited the Altai
                    Mountains, traced the Irtish to Kolyvan, went on to Tomsk and the Yenissei,
                    crossed Lake Baikal, and extended his journey to the frontiers of China. Few
                    explorations have been so fruitful as this six years’ journey. Pallas’s
                    collections included all departments of natural history, and his observations
                    extended to every point of interest in the region traversed and its inhabitants.
                    The leading results were given in his <hi rend="italic">Reisen durch
                    verschiedene Provinzen des Russischen Reichs</hi> (3 vols. 4to, St Petersburg,
                    1771-76), richly illustrated with coloured plates. A French translation in
                    1788-93, in 8 vols., with 9 vols, of plates, contained, in addition to the
                    narrative, the natural history results of the expedition; and an English
                    translation in three volumes appeared in 1812. As special results of this great
                    journey may be mentioned <hi rend="italic">Sammlungen historischer Nachrichten
                    über die Mongolischen Völkerschaften</hi> (2 vols. 4to, St Petersburg,

                    besides many special papers in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> of the
                    academies of St Petersburg and Berlin. The empress bought Pallas’s natural
                    history collections for 20,000 roubles, 5000 more than he asked for them, and
                    allowed him to keep them for life. He spent a considerable time in 1793-94 in
                    visiting the southern provinces of Russia, and was so greatly taken with the
                    Crimea that he determined to take up his residence there. The empress gave him a
                    large estate at Simpheropol, and 10,000 roubles to assist in equipping a house.
                    Though disappointed with the Crimea as a place of residence, Pallas continued to
                    live there, devoted to constant research, especially in botany, till the death
                    of his second wife in 1810, when he removed to Berlin, where he died September
                    8, 1811. The results of his journey in southern Russia were given in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Bemerkungen auf einer Reise durch die südlichen
                    Statthalterschaften des Russischen Reichs</hi> (Leipsic, 1799-1801; English
                    translation by Blagdon, vols. 5-8 of <hi rend="italic">Modern Discoveries,</hi>
                    1802, and another in 2 vols., 1812). Pallas also edited and contributed to <hi
                    rend="italic">Neue Nordische Beiträge zur physikalischen Erd-und
                    Völkerbeschreibung, Naturgeschichte, und Oekonomie</hi> (1781-96), published <hi
                    rend="italic">Illustrationes Plantarum imperfecte vel nondum cognitarum</hi>
                    (Leipsic, 1803), and contributed to Buffon’s <hi rend="italic">Natural
                    History</hi> a paper on the formation of mountains, and to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions</hi> of various learned societies a great number of special
                    papers.</p>
                <p>The solid value and great extent of Pallas’s contributions to natural science
                    have been long admitted; his name is inseparably associated with the geography
                    (in its varied branches) of Siberia and a large part of European Russia. That he
                    had a marked influence on the progress of zoology there is no doubt; some
                    authorities even hold that he changed the face of the science; while his
                    geological investigations and speculations, if they did not revolutionize the
                    young science (as has been maintained), greatly helped its progress. Though not
                    in any sense brilliant either as an investigator or as a writer, Pallas is
                    certainly one of the most important figures in the science of the latter half of
                    the 18th century.</p>
