                    N. lat., and between 84° 44' and 86° 5' E. long., is bounded on the N. by the
                    river Ganges, which separates it from Sáran, Muzaffarpur, and Darbhangah, on the
                    E. by Monghyr, on the S. by Gayá, and on the W. by the Son, which separates it
                    from Sháhábád. Patna district, with an area (1881) of 2079 square miles, is,
                    throughout the greater part of its extent, a level plain; but towards the south
                    the ground rises into hills. The soil is for the most part alluvial, and the
                    country along the bank of the Ganges is peculiarly fertile. The general line of
                    drainage is from west to east; and high ground along the south of the Ganges
                    forces back the rivers flowing from the district of Gayá. The result is that,
                    during the rains, nearly the whole interior of the district south of a line
                    drawn parallel to the Ganges, and 4 or 5 miles from its bank, is flooded. There
                    are no forests or jungles of any extent, but fine groups of trees are found in
                    many places. In the south-east are the Rájágríhá Hills, consisting of two
                    parallel ridges running south-west, with a narrow valley between, intersected by
                    ravines and passes. These hills, which seldom exceed 1000 feet in height, are
                    rocky and clothed with thick low jungle, and contain some of the earliest
                    memorials of Indian Buddhism. Hot springs are common on the Rájágríhá Hills. The
                    chief rivers are the Ganges and the Son. The total length of the former along
                    the boundary of Patna is 93 miles. The Son first touches the district near
                    Mahíbalípur village, and flows in a northerly direction for 41 miles, till it
                    joins the Ganges. The only other river of any consequence is the Púnpún, which
                    is chiefly remarkable for the number of petty irrigation canals which it
                    supplies. So much of the river is thus diverted that only a small portion of its
                    water ever reaches the Ganges at Fatwá. Great changes have from time to time
                    taken place in the course of the Ganges, and the point at which the Son <pb

                    its present position. Large game is not abundant except on the Rájágríhá Hills,
                    where bears, wolves, and jackals are common, and hyaenas are sometimes seen. Of
                    smaller game, duck, quail, and ortolan are abundant, and partridges and wild
                    geese are also found.</p>
                <p>The census of 1881 returned the population at 1,756,856 persons (males 858,783,
                    and females 898,073). Hindus numbered 1,541,061, Mohammedans 213,141, Christians
                    2588, and “others” 66. Of high-caste Hindus there are 47,041 Brahmans and 64,332
                    Rájputs. Ranking next to these two castes are the Bábhans, a class who number
                    121,381 in Patna district, and whose origin is much disputed. They assert
                    themselves to be Sarwariá Brahmans, but, although they are held in high respect,
                    this rank is not generally accorded to them. Among the Súdras the most numerous
                    are the Goálás or Ahírs, the great herdsman class, ofwhom there are 217,845; and
                    the Kurmís, an agricultural caste, who number 194,222. Among the semi-Hinduized
                    aboriginal tribes the Dosádhs, the ordinary labouring class of Behar, number
                    99,976. The Wahabis form the most interesting section of the Mohammedan
                    community. They are a numerous body, and include several wealthy traders, though
                    the majority belong to the lower classes. The following towns in the district
                    contained a population in 1881 exceeding 10,000—Patna city (170,654); Behar
                    (48,968); Dinápur, including the cantonment (37,893); Bárh (14,689); Khagaul
                    (14,075); Mukáma (13,052); Fatwá (10,919).</p>
                <p>Rice, which forms the staple of the district, is divided into two great crops—the
                    <hi rend="italic">kartikd</hi> or early rice, sown in June or July and reaped in
                    October or November; and the <hi rend="italic">agháni</hi> or winter rice, sown
                    after the commencement of the rains and cut in November or December. The <hi
                    rend="italic">boro</hi> or spring rice is also cultivated to a limited extent,
                    being sown in November or December and reaped in April or May. By far the most
                    important of these is the <hi rend="italic">agháni</hi> crop, of which forty-six
                    varieties are named. Among the other principal crops are wheat and barley, <hi
                    rend="italic">khesárí,</hi> gram, pease, cotton, tobacco, sugar-cane, a little
                    indigo and mustard, several other oil-producing plants, and poppy. All the poppy
                    grown in the province of Behar is manufactured at Patna city.</p>
                <p>Patna is subject to blights, floods, and drought, but seldom to such an extent as
                    to seriously interfere with the general harvest. There are abundant facilities
                    for importations of grain in case of distress. The trade of the district centres
                    in Patna city, which, next to Calcutta, is the largest river-mart in Bengal. The
                    total length of district and provincial roads is 454 miles. The East Indian
                    Railway traverses the entire length of the district for 86 miles. Several
                    newspapers are published at Patna, the most important being the <hi
                    rend="italic">Behar Herald,</hi> published weekly and conducted by the native
                    pleaders of the Patna bar.</p>
                <p>Patna is one of the two places in British India where opium is manufactured. The
                    poppy cultivated is exclusively the white variety <hi rend="italic">(Papaver
                    somniferum</hi><hi rend="italic">album),</hi> and the crop requires great
                    attention. The amount of produce from various lands differs considerably. Under
                    favourable circumstances of soil and season, the out-turn per acre may be as
                    high as 41 ìb of standard opium <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> containing 70 per
                    cent, of pure opium and 30 per cent, of water), paid for by the Government at
                    the rate of 5s. per lb; but the average is from 21 to 27 ft&gt; per acre. The
                    opium is made up into cakes weighing about 4 ìb, and containing about 3 ìb of
                    standard opium. These cakes are packed in chests (forty in each), and sent to
                    Calcutta for exportation to China. The price which they fetch varies every year;
                    the average rate per chest in 1880-81 was about £135 and the cost £39.</p>
                <p>The net revenue of Patna in 1882-83 amounted to £278,550, of which £147,205 was
                    derived from the land-tax. In 1874-75 there were, exclusive of the Patna
                    college, 309 Government and aided schools with 9003 pupils; by 1877-78 the
                    number had risen to 816, and the pupils to 16,396. The Patna college was founded
                    in 1862, and is the only institution for superior instruction in Behar; the
                    total number of pupils in 1881-82 was 166. The climate of Patna is considered
                    remarkably healthy. The average annual rainfall is 35 '66 inches.</p>
