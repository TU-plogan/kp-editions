                    never written these works. Most of those who know him by name as a ribald
                    scoffer against revealed religion are not aware that he has any other title to
                    fame or infamy. But if he had never meddled with religious controversy, his name
                    would have been remembered in the United States at least as one of the founders
                    of their independence. He had a prominent reputation when he crossed the
                    Atlantic to stir up the people of tbe Old World against monarchy and
                    aristocracy, taking as his motto “Where liberty is <hi rend="italic">not,</hi>
                    there is my country.” Even after he wrote <hi rend="italic">The Rights of
                    Man,</hi> if he had been guillotined by Robespierre, which he very narrowly
                    escaped being, he might have been remembered in Britain as a clever but crazy
                    and dangerous political enthusiast. The final verdict of history upon his
                    usefulness would have turned on the question whether the United States did well
                    to declare and fight for independence. But <hi rend="italic">The Age of
                    Reason</hi> brought his name into disrepute almost as much in the United States
                    as in England. The career of Paine was a very extraordinary one. The son of - a
                    Quaker stay maker, of Thetford in Norfolk, he had emigrated to the American
                    colonies somewhat late in life, after erratically trying various ways of making
                    a living as a marine, an exciseman, a teacher of English, and acquiring a
                    reputation in local political clubs by extreme views and vigour in debate. Born
                    in 1736, he was thirty-eight when he arrived in America, and he apparently went
                    with a purpose, his combative temper attracted by the quarrel then reaching an
                    acute stage, for he carried introductions with him from Franklin to the leaders
                    of the resistance to the mother-country. His opportunity came when these leaders
                    were dispirited and disposed to compromise. He then set the colonists in a flame
                    with a pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic">Common Sense,</hi> a most telling
                    array of arguments for separation and for the establishment of a republic,
                    conveyed in strong direct unqualified language. There is a complete concurrence
                    of testimony that Paine’s pamphlet, issued on the 1st January 1776, was a
                    turning-point in the struggle, that it roused and consolidated public feeling,
                    and swept waverers along with the tide. The New York assembly appointed a
                    committee to answer it, but the committee separated with the conclusion that it
                    was unanswerable. When war was declared, and fortune at first went against the
                    colonists, Paine, serving with Washington as a private soldier, composed by the
                    light of camp fires a short hortative tract, <hi rend="italic">The Crisis,</hi>
                    which was read to the army, and seems to have had a wonderful effect in
                    restoring a courage that was considerably impaired by defeat. Its opening words,
                    “These are the times that try men’s souls,” became a battle-cry. This and other
                    literary services were recognized by Paine’s appointment in the first Congress
                    to be secretary of the-committee on foreign affairs. The republic finally
                    established, another phase of his turbulent career was entered on. He determined
                    to return to England, and “open the eyes of the people to the madness and
                    stupidity of the Government.” His chief effort in this propagandism was <hi
                    rend="italic">The Rights of Man,</hi> written as an answer to Burke’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Reflexions on the Revolutions in France.</hi> The first part
                    appeared in 1791, and had an enormous circulation before the Government took the
                    alarm and endeavoured to suppress it, thereby exciting the most intense
                    curiosity to see it even at the risk of heavy penalties. Those who know the book
                    only by hearsay as the work of a furious incendiary would be surprised at the
                    dignity, force, and temperance of the .style; it was the circumstances that made
                    it inflammatory. Pitt “used to say,” according to Lady Hester Stanhope, “that
                    Tom Paine was quite in the right, but then he would add, ‘ What am I to do? As
                    things are, if I were to encourage Tom Paine’s opinions, we should have a bloody
                    revolution.’” Paine accordingly was indicted for treason, but before the trial
                    came off he was elected by the department of Calais to the French Convention,
                    and was allowed to pass into France followed by a sentence of outlawry. The
                    first years that he spent in France form a curious episode in his life. As he
                    knew little of the language, he could have had but little influence on affairs,
                    but he was treated with great respect, and did what he could in the interests of
                    moderation till he incurred the suspicion of Robespierre and was thrown into
                    prison, escaping the guillotine by an accident. He completed the first part of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Age of Reason</hi> in the exciting interval between his
                    accusation and his arrest, and put it into the hands of a friend on his way to
                    prison. The publication of the work made an instant change in his position on
                    both sides of the Atlantic, the indignation in the United States being as strong
                    as in England. Washington, to whom he had dedicated his <hi rend="italic">Rights
                    of Man,</hi> declined to take any steps for his release from the prison of the
                    Luxembourg, and he lay there for several months after the fall of Robespierre.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Age of Reason</hi> can now be estimated calmly. It was
                    written from the point of view of a Quaker who did not believe in revealed
                    religion, but who held that “all religions are in their nature mild and benign”
                    when not associated with political <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n152/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0152-0137"/> systems. Intermixed with the coarse unceremonious
                    ridicule of what he considered superstition and bad faith are many passages of
                    earnest and even lofty eloquence in favour of a pure morality founded on natural
                    religion, fully justifying the bishop of Llandaff’s saying :—“There is a
                    philosophical sublimity in some of your ideas when speaking of the Creator of
                    the universe.” The work in short—a second part was published after his release—
                    represents the deism of the 18th century, in the hands of a rough, ready,
                    passionate controversialist. Paine remained in France till 1802, and then
                    returned to America, occupying the rest of his turbulent active life with
                    financial questions and mechanical inventions. He died in 1809.</p>
