                    Stephen III. on 29th May 757. His pontificate was chiefly remarkable for his
                    close alliance with Pippin, king of France, to whom he made a present of books
                    highly significant of the intellectual poverty of the times, and for his
                    unsuccessful endeavours to effect a reconciliation with the iconoclastic emperor
                    of the East, Constantine Copronymus. He died on 28th June 767, and received the
                    honour of canonization, which he seems to have merited by his piety and virtues.
                    His successor was Stephen IV.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Paul</hi> II., Pietro Barbo, pope from 1464 to 1471, was
                    born at Venice, 28th February 1418. He was on the mother’s side the great-nephew
                    of Gregory XII. and the nephew of Eugenius IV., to whose favour he owed his
                    elevation to the cardinalate at the early age of twenty-two. He seems, however,
                    to have made no especial figure at the papal court until the death of Calixtus
                    III. in 1458, when we hear of his interfering actively to protect the late
                    pope’s nephew, Pietro Luigi Borgia, from the vengeance of the Roman nobility,
                    and escorting him safely to Civita Vecchia. Upon the death of Pius II. he was
                    unanimously and unexpectedly elected his successor, 31st August 1464. Vain of
                    his personal appearance, he wished to take the name of Formosus, and afterwards
                    that of Mark in honour of the patron saint of his native city, but, being
                    dissuaded from both, called himself Paul. He abandoned his predecessor’s
                    projects for a crusade, which he saw to be impracticable, and made it his
                    leading objects to preserve peace in Italy and to enhance the dignity of the
                    papal see by a display of outward magnificence. He embellished the costume of
                    the cardinals, collected jewels for his own adornment, entertained the Roman
                    people with shows and banquets, and introduced the sports from which the Corso
                    takes its name to this day. If the spirit of his pontificate was secular, its
                    administration was in general prosperous, and no serious reproach would rest
                    upon his memory but for his violent persecution of the humanists and scholars
                    who adorned his court, the truth respecting which it is exceedingly difficult to
                    discover. Whether actuated by a perception of the incompatibility between
                    Renaissance culture and traditional Christianity, or by a panic fear of
                    imaginary conspiracies against his own person, he appears to have acted with
                    much arbitrary severity, and to have exhibited himself in the unamiable light of
                    a comparatively illiterate man persecuting letters and learning. At the same
                    time, his severities have been without doubt considerably exaggerated by the
                    sufferers, from whom our knowledge of them is almost entirely derived, and his
                    own official acts and documents give a much more favourable view of his
                    character, confirmed by the tranquillity of Italy in his day. He was undoubtedly
                    not a man of quick parts or enlarged views, but he must have possessed
                    considerable administrative ability, and his lavish ostentation, not in itself
                    wholly impolitic, was frequently accompanied by displays of charity and
                    munificence. He died very suddenly, probably of apoplexy, on 28th July 1471. The
                    inventory of his personal effects, recently published by Μ. Eugène Müntz, is a
                    valuable document for the history of art. He was succeeded by Sixtus IV.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Paul</hi> III., Alessandro Farnese, pope from 1534 to 1549,
                    was born 28th February 1468, of an ancient and noble Roman family. He received
                    an excellent education, but his youth was dissolute and stormy, and he owed his
                    promotion to the cardinalate (September 1493) to the admiration of Alexander VI.
                    for his beautiful sister Giulia, whence he was derisively nicknamed Cardinal
                    Petticoat. He soon showed himself, however, to be a man of ability and
                    character, and his reputation and influence went on steadily increasing until,
                    upon the death of Clement VIL, being at the time senior cardinal of the sacred
                    college, he was unanimously elected pope after a conclave of only two days,
                    having been in a manner nominated by his predecessor (13th October 1534).</p>
                <p>Succeeding the most unfortunate of the popes, at the most critical period in the
                    history of the church, the part assigned to Paul III. was one of no common
                    difficulty. But he also possessed no common qualifications,—prudence increased
                    and vigour tempered by age, learning, moderation, and a prolonged experience of
                    affairs. It was his misfortune to be not altogether a man of his own day: deeply
                    penetrated with the ambitious, luxurious, and secular spirit of the Renaissance,
                    he found it difficult to adapt himself personally to the changed circumstances
                    of the times by entering into the Catholic Puritanism which, however
                    disagreeable to a man of taste and refinement, was an indispensable necessity in
                    combating the Reformation. The want was in a manner supplied by the men whom,
                    conscious perhaps of his own deficiencies, he called around him. No pope has
                    made so many distinguished cardinals, and his promotions included both men of
                    evangelical piety inclined to the new doctrines like Contarini, and fanatical
                    devotees of the old system like Caraffa. The latter group, though Paul had
                    probably little personal inclination for them, triumphed in his councils. The
                    bull instituting the order of the Jesuits (1540) marks the commencement of the
                    Roman counter-reformation; two years afterwards the Roman Inquisition was
                    established, Contarini died with strong suspicions of poison, Ochino was hunted
                    from Italy, and a persecution broke out which soon exterminated Protestantism
                    inside the Alps. Another memorable measure extorted from Paul by the necessities
                    of his position was the convocation of the council of Trent in 1545; but he soon
                    found means to suspend its sittings, which were not resumed for many years. His
                    brief condemning slavery (1537) ranks among the most honourable actions of his
                    reign. As a politician Paul continually strove to trim between Charles V. and
                    Francis I., and to preserve the peace of Italy as far as compatible with his
                    darling aim of procuring an establishment for his natural son. All these objects
                    were accomplished. Paul’s contemporaries respected and courted him, Italy in
                    general enjoyed tranquillity, and the monster who brought such disgrace upon him
                    acquired the principalities of Parma and Piacenza. After, however, the murder of
                    this unworthy son, the ingratitude of his grandsons broke Paul’s heart, and,
                    overcome by a sudden fit of passion, he expired on 10th November 1549,—enjoying
                    the rare distinction of being one of the very few popes who have died lamented
                    by their subjects. His character was in many respects a very fine one, but in
                    every respect the character of a prince and a scholar, not of an ecclesiastic.
                    He was a munificent <pb break="no"

                    had an especial weakness for judicial astrology. The arts also owed much to him.
                    Michelangelo’s Last Judgment and other works of the first rank were completed
                    under his auspices, and he greatly improved and beautified the city of Rome.
                    Julius III. was his successor.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Paul</hi> IV., Giovanni Pietro Caraffa, pope from 1555 to
                    1559, born 28th June 1476, was the nephew of Cardinal Oliviero Caraffa, by whose
                    interest he became at an early age chamberlain to Pope Alexander VI., and
                    subsequently, though contrary to his own inclination, archbishop of Chieti. He
                    was afterwards nuncio in England and Spain, both of which missions he discharged
                    with credit; but in 1524, under the influence of strong religious impressions,
                    he resigned his archbishopric, distributed his goods among the poor, and retired
                    from the world to direct the monastic order of Theatins, founded by himself. In
                    1536 the fame of his sanctity induced Paul III. to call him to his court and
                    confer the dignity of cardinal upon him, notwithstanding his own reluctance. He
                    now became the head of the reactionary party at Rome, bent on crushing all
                    tendencies to religious innovation, while insisting on reforms in discipline and
                    moral deportment. Such was unquestionably the policy required by the times from
                    the exclusive point of view of the interests of the church, and it was
                    thoroughly incarnate in Caraffa, in whom the spirit of the Dominican
                    exterminators of the Albigenses seemed to revive. Having taken an important part
                    in two conclaves, he was himself unexpectedly elected pope on 23d May 1555,
                    after the death of Marcellus II., notwithstanding his personal unpopularity and
                    the positive veto of Charles V. Raised to the pontifical throne, Paul showed
                    himself a man of extreme counsels in every respect. He endeavoured to efface the
                    prejudice against his former austerity by excessive magnificence. He rushed into
                    politics, and evinced himself as rash in his partisanship as his predecessors
                    had been dexterous and ambiguous. His open espousal of the cause of France
                    brought upon him a Spanish invasion which would have destroyed his temporal
                    sovereignty but for the superstition of Philip II. and his general Alva, who
                    embraced the first opportunity of making peace. He called his nephews to court
                    and trusted them with blind confidence, but unhesitatingly disgraced them when
                    convinced of their unworthiness. He refused to acknowledge Ferdinand as emperor
                    of Germany, maintaining that Charles had no right to abdicate or Ferdinand to
                    succeed without his own permission. Amid all these agitations he never lost
                    sight of the main purpose of his life: he struggled incessantly against heresy,
                    and was the first pope to issue a full official <hi rend="italic">Index</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Librorum Prohibitorum</hi> (see vol. xii. p. 730). He died, on
                    18th August 1559, recommending the Inquisition to the cardinals with his last
                    breath, and leaving the character of a pope of rare energy of body and mind,
                    upright in all his thoughts and actions, but intoxicated with fanaticism and the
                    pride of office, and more perverse, obstinate, and impracticable than any
                    occupant of the papal chair since Urban VI. His memory was so detested by the
                    Roman people that the hawkers of glass and earthenware were compelled for a time
                    to discontinue their usual cry of “carafe” and cry “ampolle.” He was succeeded
                    by Pius IV.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Paul</hi> V., Camillo Borghese, pope from 1605 to 1621, was
                    born in Rome, 17th September 1552, of a noble family. He followed the study of
                    canon law, and after having filled various important offices was made a cardinal
                    in 1596. He succeeded Leo XI. on 16th May 1605, after an unusually long and
                    stormy conclave, the vicissitudes of which are dramatically narrated in Mr T. A.
                    Trollope’s <hi rend="italic">Paul the Pope and Paul the Friar.</hi> No one, till
                    the last moment, had thought of Borghese, who owed his election to his supposed
                    inoffensiveness and the inability of the leaders of the factions to agree upon
                    any other man - Scarcely had he been elected ere he gave convincing proof that
                    his character had been very much mistaken. He showed himself harsh, domineering,
                    impatient of advice, fanatical in his devotion to the secular as well as the
                    spiritual prerogatives of the church, and inflexible in his resolution to uphold
                    them. He began by successfully repressing numerous encroachments of the civil
                    power in various Roman Catholic countries, and thus became tempted to embark in
                    a contention with the republic of Venice, which inflicted a deeper wound on Rome
                    than anything that had taken place since the Reformation. The dispute was
                    occasioned by the claim of the Venetians to try ecclesiastical culprits before
                    the lay tribunals, and by the extension of old laws forbidding the unauthorized
                    formation of religious corporations and the acquisition of property by
                    ecclesiastics to the entire territory of the republic. Paul protested and
                    menaced (October 1605), and, when the Venetians refused to yield, he launched
                    (April 1606) a bull of excommunication against them, and placed the whole
                    republic under an interdict. The Venetians set him at defiance, forbidding their
                    clergy to pay the least attention to the papal censures, and banishing those who
                    disobeyed from their dominions. A vehement literary controversy arose, in which
                    the famous Father Sarpi, the chief counsellor of the Venetian senate, especially
                    distinguished himself. Paul found himself impotent, and, disappointed in his
                    expectations of material aid from Spain, was thankful to escape from the
                    difficulty by the mediation of France, whose representative, Cardinal Joyeuse,
                    negotiated a compromise in April 1607. The Venetians made some nominal
                    concessions, but gained every substantial point at issue; the main result of the
                    contention, however, was to demonstrate the inefficacy of the spiritual weapons
                    on which Rome had so long relied, and the disrepute into which papal pretensions
                    had fallen even among Catholic nations. Throughout the remainder of his long
                    pontificate Paul acted with comparative moderation, maintaining, nevertheless,
                    the character of a zealous pontiff intent on combating heresy, and especially
                    active in his encouragement of foreign missions. He ranks among the popes who
                    have contributed most to the embellishment of Rome; the nave, façade, and
                    portico of St Peter’s were completed by him; he also erected the sumptuous
                    Borghese chapel in Santa Maria Maggiore, and greatly benefited the city by
                    improving streets and constructing public fountains. He died on 28th January
                    1621, and was succeeded by Gregory XV. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. g.)</hi></p>
