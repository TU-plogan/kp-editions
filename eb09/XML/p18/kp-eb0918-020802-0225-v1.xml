                    north of South America. The city, which is the capital of the state and the seat
                    of a ‘bishop, is situated on the coast of the Pacific at the head of the Gulf of
                    Panamâ, a few miles east of the mouth of the Rio Grande, occupying partly a
                    tongue of coral and basaltic rock and partly a gentle rise towards Mount Ancon,
                    an eminence 560 feet in height. The cathedral stands in 8° 57' 16" N. lat. and
                    79° 30' 50'' W. long. In the 16th and 17th centuries Panamâ was, next to
                    Cartagena, the strongest fortress in South America; but its massive granite
                    ramparts, constructed by Alfonzo Mercado de Villacorta (1673), in some places 40
                    feet high and 60 feet broad, have been razed on the land side (where they
                    separated the city proper from the suburbs of Santa Ana, Pueblo Nuevo, and
                    Arrabal) and allowed to fall into a ruinous condition towards the sea. Of the
                    old Spanish houses constructed in the Moorish fashion comparatively few remain;
                    but three-story buildings, in which the two upper stories project, are
                    sufficiently common to give a distinctive character to the city, which thus
                    differs from the other towns of Central America. Ruins of churches <hi
                        rend="superscript"> -</hi> and convents occupy a large area, those of the
                    Jesuit college being the most imposing, and those of the Franciscan monastery
                    (on the north-west sea wall) the most extensive. The cathedral, built in 1760,
                    is a spacious edifice in the so-called Jesuit style, and its two lateral towers
                    are the loftiest in Central America. It was restored in 1873-76, but the façade
                    was destroyed and columns thrown down by the earthquake of September 7, 1882.
                    The church of Santa Ana, in the suburb of that name, is of interest as the
                    rallying point of the insurgents in the local revolutions; the high ground on
                    which it stands commands the city, and was long kept carefully free of all
                    buildings. The president’s residence, the governor’s office, the state assembly
                    house, the hospital in the old convent of the Conception, and the grand hotel
                    (now the head offices of the canal company) in the principal square are the
                    buildings now of most note. Besides the episcopal seminary there exist a
                    sisters-of-charity school and a ladies’ college, with teachers from the United
                    States and Canada. In the rainy season streams of water flow down the streets,
                    but in the dry season the city is dependent on -water brought in carts from the
                    Matasnillo, a distance of several miles, the only perennial wells which it
                    possessed having been dried up by the earthquake of 8th March 1883. By 1885,
                    however, water-works introducing the water of the Rio Grande at a cost of
                    .£50,000 are to be completed. Rents are high, and living is expensive. As
                    Panamâ, like Colon, is a free port, statistics of trade are not collected. The
                    local exports are india-rubber (growing scarcer), gold-dust, hides, ivory nuts,
                    manganese, shells, tobacco, cocof&gt;olo (a cabinet wood), tortoise-shell,
                    vanilla, whale oil, sarsaparilla, and cocoa-nuts. The Panamâ pearl fishery is
                    still prosecuted with success. The passengers across the isthmus were 35,076 in
                    1868, 22,941 in 1876, 52,113 in 1881, and 75,703 in 1882. In 1870 the population
                    of Panamâ (of very varied origin) was 18,378; by 1880 it was 25,000, of whom
                    about 5000 were strangers.</p>
                <p>Panama (an Indian word meaning abounding in fish) was founded in 1518 by Pedro
                    Arias Davila, and is thus the oldest European city in America, the older
                    settlement at Santa Maria el Antigua near the Atrato having been abandoned and
                    leaving no trace. Originally it was situated six or seven miles farther north on
                    the left side of the Rio Algarrobo; but the former city, which was the great
                    emporium for the gold and silver from Peru, and “had eight monasteries, a
                    cathedral, and two churches, a fine hospital,' 200 richly furnished houses,
                    nearly 5000 houses of a humbler sort, a Genoese chamber of commerce, and 200
                    warehouses, was after three weeks ofrapine and murder burned, February 24, 1671,
                    by Morgan’s buccaneers, who carried offl75 laden mules and more than 600
                    prisoners” (see <hi rend="italic">Trawls of Pedro de Cieza de Leon,</hi> Hakluyt
                    Soc., 1864). A new city was founded on the present site by Villacorta in
                    1673.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">The, Isthmus and State.—</hi> By the Isthmus of Panamâ is
                    sometimes understood the whole neck of land between the continents of North and
                    South America; more generally the name is restricted to the narrow crossing from
                    Panamâ to Colon, the two other narrowest crossings being distinguished as the
                    Isthmus of San Blas (31 miles) and the Isthmus of Darien (46 miles). Nearly the
                    whole isthmus, in the wider sense of the word, constitutes (since 1855) a state
                    of the Confederation of Colombia, extending from the frontiers of Costa Rica to
                    those of the state of. Cauca. Besides Panamâ the capital and Colon (Aspinwall),
                    it contains Santiago, formerly chief town of a province and an apanage of the
                    family of Columbus, Penonomé (about 15,000 inhabitants), Los Santos, formerly
                    chief town of a province, Nata, and David. It is divided into six
                    departments—Coclé, Colon, Chiriqui, Los Santos, Panamâ, Veragua. The total
                    population in 1870 was 221,052.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railway and Canal.—</hi> It is the Isthmus of Panamâ in the
                    narrower sense which is crossed both by the interoceanic railway and by the line
                    of the interoceanic ship-canal at present in course of construction. It affords
                    a much shorter route than that of Darien, and while the central Cordillera does
                    not sink lower than 980 feet in the Isthmus of San Blas, at the Culebra Col it
                    is rather less than 290 feet high. As the watershed runs much nearer the south
                    than the north side of the isthmus, the streams flowing to the Pacific are of
                    comparatively little importance, while the Chagres on the Atlantic slope, with
                    its tributary the Rio Obispo, forms a navigable river whose volume attains
                    formidable dimensions at certain seasons. The railway (a single line) starting
                    from Colon (on the swamp-island of Manzanillo on Limon Bay) reaches the valley
                    of the Chagres at Gatun, runs along its northern flanks to Bar-bacoas, crosses
                    the river by a large bridge, continues along the southern flank and up the
                    tributary Obispo to the Culebra Col, from which it descends straight to Panamâ.
                    The ship-canal is to follow very much the same route; only it will keep closer
                    to the bed of the Chagres, which it is to cross again and again, and on the
                    Pacific slope it will descend the valley of the Rio Grande and be continued
                    seaward to the island of Perico. The total length is 54 miles. Throughout the
                    whole distance the bottom is to lie 8∣ metres (nearly 28 feet) below the mean
                    level of the oceans, and the width is to be 22 metres (72 feet) at bottom and 50
                    metres (160 feet) at top, except in the section through the Culebra ridge, where
                    the depth is to be 9 metres, the bottom width 24, and the top width 28. The two
                    great difficulties connected with the undertaking are those caused by the
                    mountain and the river. As the idea of tunnelling the col has been abandoned, it
                    will be necessary to cut down through the solid strata for a depth of 300 to 350
                    feet over a considerable distance; the rock happily is of a comparatively soft
                    schistous character, disposed almost horizontally. The Chagres has an average
                    discharge at Matachin of 100 cubic metres per second, which at low water may
                    sink to 15 or 20 cubic metres, and during flood rise to 500 or 600. At Gamboa,
                    which lies just above the influx of the Rio Obispo, it is proposed to construct
                    an enormous reservoir by throwing a dam across the valley. From Cerro Obispo on
                    the one side to Cerro Santa Cruz on the other this dam will be 960 metres long
                    at the base and 1960 metres at the top, with a width at the bottom of 1000
                    metres and a height of 45 metres. It will thus be the largest dyke yet
                    constructed in the world. Altogether it is calculated that the excavation of the
                    canal involves the removal of 3531 millions of cubic feet of earth; by January
                    31, 1884, the actual quantity removed was 118,448,595 cubic feet, or only about
                    one-thirtieth of the whole. All along the route, however, at Buhio Soldado,
                    Tabernilla, San Pablo, Mamei, Ac., workshops and settlements have been formed,
                    and by 1883 11,000 men were at work. At certain states of the tide the levels of
                    the two oceans differ materially: while at Colon the difference between high and
                    low water is not more than 23 inches, at Panamâ it is generally 13 feet, and at
                    times even upwards of 19⅜ feet. The current thus produced in the canal would be
                    sufficient to stop navigation for a number of hours at each tide; and to obviate
                    this difficulty it will be necessary either to construct locks at the Panamâ
                    extremity or to slope the canal from Colon to Panamâ.</p>
                <p>A proposal to pierce the Isthmus of Darien was made as early as 1520 by Angel
                    Saavedra; Cortez caused the Isthmus of Tehuantepec to be surveyed for the
                    construction of a canal; and in 1550 Antonio Galväo suggested four different
                    routes for such a scheme, one of them being across the Isthmus of Panama. In
                    1814 the Spanish cortes ordered the viceroy of New Spain to undertake the
                    piercing of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec; but the War of Independence intervened,
                    and, though a survey was made by General Obegoso in 1821, and José de Garny
                    obtained a concession for a canal in 1842, nothing was accomplished. Bolivar,
                    president of Colombia, caused Messrs Lloyd and Palmare to study the Isthmus of
                    Panama. Lloyd, whose paper was published in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                        Transactions,</hi> London, 1830, proposed to make only a railway from Panama
                    or Chorrera to the Rio Trinidad (tributary of the Chagres), and to establish a
                    port on the Bay of Limon. Μ. Napoleon Garella, sent out by the French Government
                    in 1843, advocated the construction of a sluiced canal. An American company,
                    stimulated by the sudden increase of traffic across the isthmus caused by the
                    discovery of gold in California, commenced in 1849 to construct a railway, and
                    their engineers, Totten and Trautwine, already known in connexion with the canal
                    from Cartagena to the Magdalena, managed, in spite of the extreme difficulty of
                    procuring labour, to complete the works in January 1855. Meanwhile the question
                    of an interoceanic canal was not lost sight of; and in 1875 it came up for
                    discussion in the Congrès des Sciences Géographiques at Paris. A society under
                    General Tiirr was formed for prosecuting the necessary explorations; and
                    Lieutenant Wyse, assisted by Celler, A. Reclus, Bixio, &amp;c., was sent out to
                    the isthmus in 1876. In 1878 the Colombian Government granted the society known
                    as the Civil International Interoceanic Canal Society the exclusive privilege of
                    constructing a canal between the two oceans through the Colombian territory; and
                    at the same time the ports and canal were neutralized. In 1879 Μ. de Lesseps
                    took the matter· up, and the first meeting of his company was held in 1881. The
                    capital necessary for the “Company of the Jnteroceanic Canal of Panama,” as it
                    is called, was stated at 600,000,000 francs,—the estimated cost of excavation
                    being 430,000,000, that of weirs and trenches to take fresh water to the sea
                    46,000,000, and that of a dock and tide-gates on the Pacific side 36,000,000.
                    The Panama canal was bought for $20,000,000. The contractors, Couvreux &amp;
                    Hersent, began operations in October of the same year. Meanwhile the United
                    States Government proposed to make a treaty with Colombia by which it would be
                    free to establish forts, arsenals, and naval stations on the Isthmus of Panama,
                    though no forces were to be maintained during peace; but the British Government
                    objected to any such arrangement.</p>
