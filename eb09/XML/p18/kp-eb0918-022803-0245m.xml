                <p><label type="entry">PAPIER MÂCHÉ</label> (mashed or pulped paper) is a term
                    embracing numerous manufactures in which paper pulp is employed, pressed and
                    moulded into various forms other than uniform sheets, such as ordinary paper and
                    millboards. In the East the art has long been practised, especially in Kashmir,
                    where, under the name of <hi rend="italic">kar-i-kalamdani,</hi> or pen-tray
                    work, the manufacture of small painted boxes, trays, and cases of papier mâché
                    is a characteristic i⅛dustry. About the middle of the 18th century papier mâché
                    work came into prominence in Europe in the form of trays, boxes, and other small
                    domestic articles, japanned and ornamented in imitation of Oriental manufactures
                    of the same class; and contemporaneously papier mâché snuff boxes ornamented in
                    vernis Martin came into favour. In 1772 Henry Clay of Birmingham secured a
                    patent for a method of preparing this material, which he used for
                    coach-building, for door and other panels, and for many furniture and structural
                    purposes. In 1845 the application of the material to internal architectural
                    decoration was patented by C. F. Bielefeld of London, and for this purpose it
                    has come into extensive use. Under the name of carton pierre, a substance which
                    is essentially papier mâché is also largely employed as a substitute for plaster
                    in the moulded ornaments of roofs and walls, and the ordinary roofing felts,
                    too, are very closely allied in their composition to papier mâché. Under the
                    name of ceramic papier mâché, architectural enrichments are also made of a
                    composition patented by Mr Martin, the constituents of which are paper pulp,
                    resin, glue, a drying oil, and acetate of lead. Among the other articles for
                    which the substance is used may be enumerated masks, dolls’ heads and other
                    toys, anatomical and botanical models, artists’ lay figures, milliners’ and
                    clothiers’ blocks, mirror and picture frames, tubes, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The materials for the commoner classes of work are old waste and scrap paper,
                    repulped, and mixed with a strong size of glue and paste. To this very often are
                    added large quantities of ground chalk, clay, and fine sand, so that the
                    preparation is little more than a plaster held together by the fibrous pulp. For
                    the finest class of work Clay’s original method is retained. It consists of
                    soaking several sheets of a specially made paper in a strong size of paste and
                    glue, pasting these together, and pressing them in the mould of the article to
                    be made. The moulded mass is dried in a stove, and, if necessary, further
                    similar layers of paper are added, till the required thickness is attained. The
                    dried object is hardened by dipping in oil, after which it is variously trimmed
                    and prepared for japanning and ornamentation. For very delicate relief
                    ornaments, a pulp of scrap paper is prepared, which after drying is ground to
                    powder mixed with paste and a proportion of potash, all of which are thoroughly
                    incorporated into a fine smooth stiff paste. The numerous processes by which
                    surface decoration is applied to papier mâché differ in no way from the
                    application of like ornamentation to other surfaces. Papier mâche for its weight
                    is an exceedingly tough, strong, durable substance, possessed of some
                    elasticity, little subject to warp or fracture, and unaffected by damp.</p>
