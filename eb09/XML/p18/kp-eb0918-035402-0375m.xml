                <p><label type="entry">PATENTS</label>. Patents for inventions, instruments which
                    formerly bore the great seal of the United Kingdom, are now issued at the Patent
                    Office in London under the seal of that office. By their means inventors obtain
                    a monopoly in their inventions for fourteen years, a term which, if insufficient
                    to remunerate the inventor, can be extended. This monopoly is founded on exactly
                    the same principle as the copyright enjoyed by authors and artists. There are
                    persons who argue that no such privilege should be permitted; there are others
                    who think that the most trifling exertions of the inventive faculties should be
                    protected. The right course lies between these extremes. All civilized nations
                    have in modern times considered it desirable to give inventors an exclusive
                    right to their inventions for a limited period, not only as a matter of justice
                    to individuals but as a piece of sound policy tending to the advantage of the
                    whole community. The monopoly is granted in the expectation that the inventor
                    will derive some profit from it; and the hope of profit is known to be a great
                    stimulus to invention. When an author writes a book, or an artist designs a
                    picture, the law allows a right of property to those persons in their
                    productions, and accompanies the recognition of this right with the power to
                    repress infringements. If this were not so, probably very few persons would
                    employ their time in writing books or creating works of art; and hardly any one
                    will be bold enough to assert that the extinction of the race of authors and
                    artists is to be desired. The same principle applies to inventors, who ought to
                    have the works of their brain protected from piracy fully as much as the other
                    classes of mental producers. By holding out to them the prospect of gain they
                    are induced, at a present loss of time and money, to attempt to discover
                    improvements in the useful arts, in machinery, in manufacturing processes,
                    &amp;c.; and thus the interests of the community are advanced more rapidly than
                    if such exertions had not been brought into play. Just as the rule of rewarding
                    inventors is in theory attended with some difficulty, so is the practical
                    application of it. To grant a very long term of exclusive possession would be
                    detrimental to the public, since it would tend to stop the progress of
                    improvement. A limited property must therefore be allowed,—large enough to give
                    the inventor an opportunity of reaping a fair reward, but not barring the way
                    for an unreasonable period. And, when this compromise has been decided on, it
                    will be seen how difficult it may be to determine beforehand what is the real
                    merit of an invention, and apportion the time to that merit. Hence it has been
                    found necessary to allot one fixed period for all kinds of inventions falling
                    within the purview of the patent laws. This regulation appears to be open to the
                    complaint that the least valuable and the most meritorious inventions are placed
                    on the same footing. But it may be replied that in the result this is of little
                    consequence, since meritorious inventions alone obtain the patronage of the
                    public, those which are destitute of value being neglected. Besides, if the
                    complaint were well founded, there is here no sound argument against the policy
                    of privileges of this nature, seeing that it is impossible to weigh beforehand
                    one invention against another in the scale of merit, or to obtain a true
                    standard of comparison.</p>
                <p>Leaving the discussion of general considerations, we will now give an outline of
                    the law affecting patent privileges in the United Kingdom. Formerly the reigning
                    prince considered himself entitled, as part of his prerogative, to grant
                    privileges of the nature of monopolies to any one who had gained his favour.
                    These grants became so numerous that they were oppressive and unjust to various
                    classes of the commonwealth; and hence, in the reign of James I., a statute was
                    wrung from that king which declared all monopolies that were grievous and
                    inconvenient to the subjects of the realm to be void. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Monopoly.)</hi> There was, however, a special exception from this enactment of
                    all letters patent and grants of privilege of the “sole working or making of any
                    manner of new manufacture within the realm to the true and first inventor of
                    such manufacture, which others at the time of making such letters patent and
                    grants should not use, so they be not contrary to law, nor mischievous to the
                    state by raising of the prices of commodities at home or hurt of trade or
                    generally inconvenient.” Upon these words hangs the whole law of letters patent
                    for inventions. Many statutes were afterwards passed, but these were all
                    repealed by the Patent Act of 1883 (46 and 47 Vict. c. 57), which, besides
                    introducing a new procedure, modified the law in several particulars. When the
                    law remains unaltered, it has to be gathered from the numerous decisions of the
                    courts, for patent law is for the most part “judge-made law.” Of the law as it
                    now stands we proceed to give an outline.</p>
                <p>The inventions for which patents are obtained are chiefly either vendible
                    articles formed by chemical or mechanical operations, such as cloth, alloys,
                    vulcanized india-rubber, &amp;c., or machinery and apparatus, or processes. It
                    may be remarked here that a scientific principle cannot form the subject of a
                    valid patent unless its application to a practical and useful end and object is
                    shown. An abstract notion, a philosophical idea, may be extremely valuable in
                    the realm of science, but before it is allowed to form a sound basis for a
                    patent the world must be shown how to apply it so as to gain therefrom some
                    immediate material advantage. With regard to processes, the language of the
                    statute of James has been strained to bring them within <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n376/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0376-0355"/> the words “any manner of new manufacture,” and
                    judges on the bench have admitted that the exposition of the Act has gone much
                    beyond the letter. However, it is undoubted law that a process is patentable;
                    and patents are accordingly obtained for processes every day.</p>
                <p>The principal classes of patentable inventions seem to be these:—(1) new
                    contrivances applied to new ends, (2) new contrivances applied to old ends, (3)
                    new combinations of old parts, whether relating to material objects or
                    processes, (4) new methods of applying a we!1-known object.</p>
                <p>With regard to a patent for the new application of a well-known object it may be
                    remarked that there must be some display of ingenuity in making the application,
                    otherwise the patent will be invalid on the ground that the subject-matter is
                    destitute of novelty. For example, a machine already in use as an excavator on
                    land cannot be separately patented as an excavator under water; nor can a
                    machine employed in the finishing of cotton goods be afterwards patented without
                    alteration as applied to the finishing of woollen fabrics. A small amount of
                    invention is indeed sufficient to support a patent where the utility to be
                    derived from the result is great. A small step in advance, a slight deviation
                    from known processes, may have been apparently brought about by the exercise of
                    little ingenuity; but, if the improvement be manifest, either as saving time or
                    labour, a patent in respect of it will stand. The mere omission of a step from
                    some commonly practised process has been held sufficient to support a patent for
                    a new method of manufacture; and how often do we see what appears to be a very
                    trifling degree of novelty attended with very advantageous consequences,
                    sometimes resulting in the entire revolution of a manufacture, or in a lowering
                    of price appreciable in every pound of an article extensively used by the
                    public?</p>
                <p>Whatever be the nature of the invention, it must possess the incidents of utility
                    and novelty, else any patent obtained in respect of it will be invalid. The
                    degree of utility need not, however, be great. As to novelty, this is the rock
                    upon which most patents split; for, if it can be shown that other persons have
                    used or published the invention before the date of the patent, it will fall to
                    the ground, although the patentee was an independent inventor deriving his ideas
                    from no one else. The difficulty of steering clear of this rock will be apparent
                    at once. Suppose A in London patents an invention the result of his own
                    ingenuity and patient study, and it afterwards appears that B, in some distant
                    part of the kingdom, had been previously openly using the same thing in his
                    workshop, A’s patent is good for nothing. Thus, in one of the cases which arose
                    out of Heath’s carburet of manganese patent —a patent celebrated in the
                    law-courts—it appeared that three firms had used a process in the manufacture of
                    steel which was substantially the same as that forming the subject of the
                    patent. They had used the process openly in the way of their trade previous to
                    the date of the patent, although it had not become generally known. This prior
                    use of the invention was held to deprive the patent of validity. It is therefore
                    a very frequent subject of inquiry, whether an invention has been previously
                    used to such an extent as to have been publicly used in the sense attached by
                    the courts to this phrase. The inventor himself is not allowed to use his
                    invention, either in public or secretly, with a view to profit, before the date
                    of the patent. Thus, if he manufactures an article by some new process, keeping
                    the process an entire secret, but selling the produce, he cannot afterwards
                    obtain a patent in respect of it. If he were allowed to do this he might in many
                    cases easily obtain a monopoly in his invention for a much longer period than
                    that allowed by law. The rule that an inventor’s use of the invention
                    invalidates a subsequent patent does not, however, apply to cases where the use
                    was only by way of experiment with a view to improve or test the invention. And
                    it has been repeatedly decided that the previous experiments of other persons,
                    if incomplete or abandoned before the realization of the discovery, will not
                    have the effect of vitiating a patent. Even the prior discovery of an invention
                    will not prevent another independent discoverer from obtaining a valid patent if
                    the earlier inventor kept the secret to himself, the law holding that he is the
                    “true and first inventor” who first obtains a patent.</p>
                <p>When an invention is the joint production of more persons than one, they must all
                    apply for and obtain a joint patent, for a patent is rendered invalid on showing
                    that a material part of the invention was due to some one not named therein. The
                    mere suggestion of a workman employed by an inventor to carry out his ideas will
                    not, however, require that he should be joined, provided that the former adds
                    nothing substantial to the invention, but merely works out in detail the
                    principle discovered by his employer. In certain cases in which patents taken
                    out by the celebrated Sir Richard Arkwright came to be inquired into, it was
                    proved that the inventions were really made by persons in Arkwright’s
                    employment. Their value being perceived by him, he adopted them, and obtained
                    the patents in question, but under these circumstances they were adjudged
                    invalid.</p>
                <p>If it can be shown that the invention in respect of which a patent has been
                    obtained was previously described in a printed book in circulation in Great
                    Britain, whether such book be in the English or a foreign language, the patent
                    is also invalid, because a man has no right to obtain a monopoly in that which
                    is already a part of the stock of public information; and it is not necessary to
                    prove that the patentee was acquainted with the book, and derived his ideas from
                    that source. The most usual prior publication fatal to a patent is a prior
                    specification of a similar invention. But persons are allowed to obtain patents
                    for inventions imported from abroad, if such inventions are new within the
                    realm, and if they acknowledge, on the face of their applications, that the
                    inventions are imported, not original. Such patents are now common.</p>
                <p>The attributes of novelty and utility being possessed in due degree by an
                    invention, the chief remaining difficulty with which a patent has to contend
                    resides in the complete specification, the instrument by which the inventor
                    describes the nature of the invention and the means by which it may be carried
                    into effect. An inventor is bound, in return for the monopoly conceded to him,
                    to instruct the public how to work the invention when the monopoly shall have
                    expired, and to inform them in the meantime what it is they are shut out from
                    using; and now the patent is not granted till the complete specification is
                    filed. The patentee is bound to make by this instrument a full disclosure of his
                    secret; he must not keep anything back either wilfully or accidentally; he must
                    render everything plain and clear, showing no attempt to mislead, and leaving
                    nothing ambiguous; he must distinguish what is old from what is new; he must
                    point out distinctly what it is that he claims as his own exclusive property,
                    and he must take care that he claims no more than he is entitled to. Very many
                    patents have been invalidated by a disregard of the requirements of the law, the
                    most common fault being that the specification claims too much; in other words,
                    it claims something that is already public property, or another man’s patented
                    invention. And here we are brought back to the question of novelty. If a
                    patentee discovers that his specification claims more than he is entitled to, he
                    may put the matter right by filing an amendment, and excising the superfluous
                    parts; but he will not be allowed to extend <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n377/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0377-0356"/> his daims in any degree. He may cut out anything,
                    but he can insert nothing, except matter which is of the nature of correction or
                    exp!anation.</p>
                <p>The term for which a patent is originally granted is fourteen years, but the
                    crown has been empowered by parliament and through the intervention of the
                    judicial committee of the privy council, before which the proceedings take
                    place, to extend the time of a patent from its expiration for any additional
                    time not longer than fourteen years. But an extension will only be granted on
                    the patentee showing that the invention is meritorious, and that he has not been
                    adequately rewarded in spite of his best efforts directed to that end. What is
                    adequate reward depends on the special circumstances of each case. The crown has
                    hitherto had a right to the free use of a patented invention, but this right has
                    been abolished by the new Act.</p>
                <p>Patent privileges, like most other rights, can be made the subject of sale.
                    Partial interests can also be carved out of them by means of licences,
                    instruments which empower other persons to exercise the invention, either
                    universally and for the full time of the patent (when they are tantamount to an
                    assignment of the patentee’s entire rights), or for a limited time, or within a
                    limited district. By an exclusive licence is meant one that restrains the
                    patentee from granting other licences to any one else. By means of a licence a
                    patentee may derive benefit from his patent without entering into trade and
                    without running the risks of a partnership.</p>
                <p>One of the regulations of the recent Act is that a patentee can be compelled by
                    the Board of Trade to grant licences to persons who are able to show that the
                    patent is not being worked in the United Kingdom, or that the reasonable
                    requirements of the public with respect to the invention cannot be supplied, or
                    that any person is prevented from working or using to the best advantage an
                    invention of "which he is possessed.</p>
                <p>A patentee’s remedy for an infringement of his rights is by civil suit, there
                    being no criminal proceedings in such a case. In prosecuting such suit he
                    subjects those rights to a searching examination, for the alleged infringer is
                    at liberty to show that the invention is not new, that the patentee is not the
                    true and first inventor, &amp;c., as well as to prove that the alleged
                    infringement is not really an infringement. But it may here be remarked that a
                    patentee is not bound down (unless he chooses so to be) to the precise mode of
                    carrying the invention into effect described in the specification. If the
                    principle is new, it is not to be expected that he can describe every mode of
                    working it; he will sufficiently secure the principle by giving some
                    illustrations of it; and no person will be permitted to adopt some mode of
                    carrying the same principle into effect on the ground that such mode has not
                    been described by the patentee. On the other hand, when the principle is not
                    new, a patentee can only secure the particular method which he has invented, and
                    other persons may safely use other methods of effecting the same object.
                    Instances of this occur every day; and it is well known that scores of patents
                    have been taken out for screw-propellers, steam-hammers, water-meters, &amp;c.,
                    each of which is limited to the particular construction described, and cannot be
                    extended further. Again, where the invention patented consists of a combination
                    of parts, some old and some new, the whole constituting a new machine or a new
                    process, it is not open to the world to copy the new part and reject the rest. A
                    man is not permitted to allege that the patent is for a combination, and that,
                    the identical combination not having been used, there has been no infringement.
                    If he has borrowed the substance of the invention, it will be held that he has
                    infringed the patent.</p>
                <p>A patent may be revoked by a court of law on any one taking proceedings for that
                    purpose, and showing good ground for a revocation, such as want of novelty or
                    utility in the invention, the fact of the patentee not being the inventor,
                    insufficiency of the specification, fraud, or the like.</p>
                <p>Patents are not now extended to the colonies, and such of the English colonies as
                    possess a legislature are gradually acquiring patent laws for themselves (see

                <p>The new Act enables the crown to make arrangements with foreign states for the
                    mutual protection of inventions, under which a person who has applied for
                    protection for any invention in a foreign state will be entitled to apply for a
                    patent in England within a limited time in priority to other applicants (see p.
                    358).</p>
                <p>The patent business of the United Kingdom is transacted at the Patent Office in
                    London under the superintendence of the comptroller, an officer appointed by the
                    Board of Trade, under whose direction he performs his duties. At this office is
                    kept a register of all patents issued, of assignments of patents, licences
                    granted under them, &amp;c. An illustrated journal of patent inventions is
                    published at the same office, where printed copies of all specifications can
                    also be obtained. The proceedings taken with a view to obtain a patent commence
                    with an application drawn up in a special form and accompanied by a description
                    of the invention and a declaration as to its originality. Any person, whether a
                    British subject or not, may apply for a patent. The actual inventor must always
                    be a party to the application, but he may join other persons with himself, and
                    the patent when issued will be granted to them all jointly. The fees payable to
                    Government on patents have been considerably reduced by the new Act, and they
                    may now be paid by convenient annual instalments.</p>
                <p>During the ten years ending with 1882 the average annual number of patents issued
                    was 3506. There has been a large increase under the new law, the number of
                    patents applied for in the first three months of 1884 being 5748.</p>
                <p>Patents are frequently obtained through the intervention of persons termed patent
                    agents, who devote themselves to this branch of business.</p>

                    may contemporaneously execute an assignment of the invention, and the patent
                    will thereupon be issued to the assignee. Every application is referred to an
                    official examiner. The patent will be refused if any part of the invention is
                    wanting in novelty, or if the application is not in proper form. The applicant
                    may, however, make a re-application, and if the inventor is dissatisfied with
                    the report of the examiner he can appeal. Patents are issued for the term of
                    seventeen years, but expire with any earlier foreign patents for the same
                    invention. A foreign inventor may obtain a patent if his invention has not been

                    Ireland, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man. Soon after the date of this
                    Act the legislatures of the colonies began to pass Acts of their own for the
                    protection of inventions, and at the present time most English colonies have
                    patent laws. As a rule, the application in the colony must be made by petition
                    accompanied with a specification and drawings of similar nature to those used in
                    the British application; and in most cases the application must be made by the

                    attorney. The patents are in all cases assignable and the deeds of assignment
                    must be registered in the respective colonies. The patents are usually granted

                <p><hi rend="italic">Aιιstralian Colonies.—</hi> The colonial Act for New South
                    Wales is dated 14th September 1852. Applications are referred to a board
                    consisting of two scientific men, and upon their report and the payment of £20
                    the governor will grant letters patent of registration, which have the effect of
                    letters patent. These letters of registration are granted for the term of
                    fourteen years. The New South Wales Act of 1852 still continues in force in
                    Queensland. By an order in council of 6th November 1859 patents similar in terms
                    to those granted in New South Wales can be obtained, and at the same cost. By an
                    Act passed in 1867 inventions can be provisionally protected, but the
                    provisional protection only appears to be useful to residents in the colony. In
                    South Australia the law of patents is governed by the Acts of 1877 and 1881. The
                    application is submitted to an official examination. The patent is granted for a
                    term of fourteen years, and is subject to taxes of £2 10s. to be paid before the
                    end of the third year and £2 10s. before the end of the seventh year. The
                    invention must be worked in the colony within three years from the date of the
                    grant. In Victoria power is given to the governor to issue letters patent by Act
                    No. 240, 1865. The sum of £15 must be paid before the expiration of the third
                    year, and £20 before the expiration of the seventh year. For Western Australia
                    the colonial Act is dated 15th August 1872, under which <hi rend="italic">bona

                    registration having the force of patents and expiring with the original patent.
                    The government fee is £25. The governor has also power to grant original
                    patents, but these are seldom applied for except by residents in the colony. The
                    government fee on these is £50. The application for a patent must be made before

                    year prior to the application. When a period of more than twelve months has
                    elapsed since the date of any other patent for the same invention the

                    five years, $40 for the second five years, and $60 for the last five years.
                    These duties can be paid either altogether on application or by three
                    instalments. The invention must be worked in Canada within two years from the

                    patent has already been obtained, the application must be made within twelve

                    and there is a reference to the attorneygeneral, upon which he is paid a fee of
                    £5. The duration of the patent is limited to that of any previous foreign

                <p><hi rend="italic">Belgium.—</hi> Patents are granted to the inventor or to his
                    assignee, or to any one holding the authority of the inventor for that purpose.
                    The term is fixed at twenty years, except in the case of inventions previously
                    patented elsewhere, when the Belgium patent expires with the previous foreign
                    patent of the greatest length. Patents are subject to an annual tax beginning at
                    10 francs for the first year, and increasing annually at the rate of 10 francs.
                    Patents of addition expiring with the original patent may be obtained. The
                    invention must be worked in Belgium within one year from its <pb break="no"

                    manufactured abroad may be introduced into Belgium.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Brazil.—</hi> By a statute passed in 1882 patents are granted
                    alike to nativesand to foreigners. In the case of a foreigner the application
                    must be made in Brazil within seven months from the αate of his foreign patent.
                    The specification must be in the Portuguese language. Patents are granted for a
                    term of fifteen years, subject to the payment of a duty of £1 for the first
                    year, and increasing £1 yearly. The patent must be put into operation in Brazil
                    within a year from the date of the grant, and the working must not be
                    interrupted for more than a year. The Brazilian patent expires on the expiration
                    of any earlier foreign patent for the same invèntion. The foreign patentee must
                    appoint an accredited agent to represent him in Brazil.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chili.—</hi> Patents are granted for a term of ten years,
                    subject to a tax of £10 to be paid on application. An extension of a patent may
                    be obtained when the importance of the invention is considered sufficient to
                    warrant it. The invention must be worked in Chili within a term fixed in the
                    patent, and the working must not be discontinued as long as the patent is
                    valid.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Denmark.—</hi> Native inventors may obtain patents for fifteen
                    years, but patents granted to foreigners are limited to five years. A tax of 60
                    francs is payable on every patent. The invention must be worked in the country
                    during the first year of the patent, and must be continued without interruption,
                    but the patentee can import the patented article into the country from
                    abroad.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">France.—</hi> Grants of patents (brevets d’invention) are
                    regulated in France by the law of 5th July 1844. Patents are granted to
                    inventors or their assignees, whether natives or foreigners, and the French
                    patent expires with any foreign patent of earlier date. Applications for French
                    patents must be made prior to the filing of the complete specification in any
                    foreign country. Patents are granted for a term of fifteen years upon payment of
                    an annual duty of £4. All the duties must be paid up prior to an assignment of
                    the patent being registered. Alterations, additions, or improvements may be
                    protected by patents of addition which expire with the original grant. The
                    subject of the patent must be manufactured entirely in France, and cannot be
                    imported from a foreign country without invalidating the patent. The invention
                    must be put into execution within two years from the date of the grant, and the
                    working must not then cease for any period of two consecutive years. The patent
                    extends to all the French colonies.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Germany.—</hi> By a law dated 25th May 1877 patents are granted
                    for fifteen years to natives and foreigners. The invention must not have been
                    previously described in a printed publication in any way. The patentee may
                    obtain supplementary patents for improvements expiring with the original patent.
                    A government duty of £1 10s. is paid on the issue of the patent, together with
                    an annuity commencing at £2 10s. and increasing by £2 10s. each year for the
                    whole term. The Government may revoke the patent if the invention has not been
                    carried out in Germany within three years from the date of the patent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Italy.—</hi> Patents are granted only to inventors or their
                    assignees for terms varying from one to fifteen years. The publication of a
                    previous foreign patent does not invalidate the grant provided the application
                    is made during the continuance of the foreign patent, but the Italian patent
                    will expire with the previous foreign patent. Patents of addition are granted
                    expiring with the original patent. Patents are liable to taxes amounting to
                    about 50 francs for each of the first three years of the patent, and increasing
                    gradually. The invention must be worked in Italy within two years from the date
                    of the grant. The description of the invention may be either in the Italian or
                    the French language.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Norway.—</hi> By laws of 15th July 1839 and 9th May 1842
                    patents are granted for a term not exceeding ten years to inventors only. The
                    invention must not have been published in Norway prior to the application, which
                    is subject to an official examination, not usually of a stringent character. A
                    payment of 10 specie dollars must be made in respect of each application. The
                    invention must be nut in practice in the country within two years from the date
                    of the grant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Paraguay.—</hi> Under a law of 20th May 1845 citizens or
                    foreigners are alike entitled to protection, and the term of the grant varies
                    from two to ten years. Where there is a previous foreign patent for the same
                    invention the patent is not valid for more than six months beyond the
                    termination of the foreign patent. The invention patented must be worked within
                    two years from the date of the grant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Portugal.—</hi> By a royal decree of 31st December 1852
                    inventors, whether natives or foreigners, may obtain patents for terms varying
                    from one to fifteen years. Certificates of addition are also granted, but expire
                    with the original patent. A patent will not be granted to an inventor for a
                    longer term than that of his original patent. The government taxes amount to
                    about £1 8s. per annum, in addition to which certain official fees are payable.
                    The patent becomes void if the invention is not carried into practice within two
                    years from the date of its grant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Russia.—</hi> The law is set forth in several imperial decrees,
                    under which patents are granted to natives and foreigners alike for the term of
                    three, five, or ten years, and upon payment of government duties of 90 roubles
                    for three years, 150 roubles for five years, and 450 roubles for ten years. The
                    patent also covers the kingdom of Poland. There is great delay in obtaining
                    patents. A period of from one to two years usually elapses between the
                    application and the date of the grant. The specification must be written in the
                    Russian language. The invention must be worked in Russia within one quarter of
                    the time for which the patent is granted. Separate patents are issued for
                    Finland.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spain.—</hi> The law is dated 1st August 1878. Patents are
                    granted to foreigners as well as to natives for terms varying from five to
                    twenty years. The application must be made prior to the publication of the
                    specification of the invention in another country. The annual taxes begin with
                    10 francs for the first year, and increase at the rate of 10 francs a year. The
                    patent covers the Spanish colonies of Cuba, Porto-Rico, and the Philippine
                    Islands. The specification must be made in the Spanish language. Certificates of
                    addition are granted for improvements, expiring with the original patent. The
                    invention must be put into operation within two years from the date of the
                    grant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sweden.—</hi> Patents are granted to natives and foreigners for
                    terms varying from three to fifteen years, but the patent of a foreigner expires
                    with the expiration of the foreign patent. The invention must be put into
                    operation within the country before the expiration of two years from the date of
                    the grant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Turkey.—</hi> Under a law dated 2d March 1880 patents are
                    granted to natives or foreigners for five, ten, or fifteen years, subject to an
                    annual payment of two Turkish pounds. A patent expires with the termination of
                    any earlier foreign patent for the same invention. Certificates of alteration,
                    addition, or improvement are granted, and expire with the termination of the
                    original grant. The invention must be worked within two years from the date of
                    the patent, and the working must not be discontinued for two consecutive years
                    subsequently. Patented articles manufactured abroad cannot be imported into
                    Turkey without invalidating the patent.</p>
                <p>In addition to the above-mentioned countries the following also have laws for the
                    protection of inventions under which foreigners may obtain patents:—United
                    States of Colombia, Guatemala, Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, Mexico, Nicaragua, and
                    San Salvador.</p>

                <p>The Governments of Belgium, Brazil, France, Guatemala, Holland, Italy, Portugal,
                    San Salvador, Servia, Spain, and Switzerland have recently signed, and Great
                    Britain is about to sign, an international convention relating to patents, the
                    salient points of which are :— (1) that the subjects of each of the above states
                    shall in all the other states, as regards patents, enjoy the advantages that
                    their respective laws grant to their own subjects; (2) that any person who has
                    duly registered an application for a patent in any one of the states shall enjoy
                    a right of priority protecting the first patentee against any acts accomplished
                    in the interval for a term of six months—a month longer being allowed for
                    countries beyond the sea; (3) that the introduction by the patentee into the
                    country where the patent has been granted of objects manufactured in any of the
                    other states shall not entail forfeiture; but the patentee remains bound to work
                    his patent in conformity with the laws of the country into which he introduces
                    the patented objects; (4) that the states agree to grant temporary protection to
                    patentable inventions for articles appearing at officially recognized
                    international exhibitions.</p>
                <p>It is understood that Holland and Switzerland, where there are at present no
                    patent laws, will shortly adopt measures in pursuance of the terms of the above
