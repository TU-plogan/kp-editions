                    and belongs to the Umbrian school of painting. The name of Perugino came to him
                    from Perugia, the chief city of the neighbourhood. Pietro was one of several
                    children born to Cristoforo Vannucci, a member of a respectable family settled
                    at Città della Pieve. Though respectable, they seem to have been poor, or else,
                    for some reason or other, to have left Pietro uncared for at the opening of his
                    career. Before he had completed his ninth year the boy was articled to a master,
                    a painter at Perugia. Who this may have been is very uncertain; the painter is
                    spoken of as wholly mediocre, but sympathetic for the great things in his art.
                    Benedetto Bonfigli is generally surmised; if he is rejected as being above
                    mediocrity, either Fiorenzo di Lorenzo or Niccolò da Foligno may possibly have
                    been the man. Pietro painted a little at Arezzo; thence he went to the
                    headquarters of art, Florence, and frequented the famous Brancacci Chapel in the
                    church of the Carmine. It appears to be sufficiently established that he studied
                    in the atelier of Andrea del Verrocchio, where Leonardo da Vinci was also a
                    pupil. He may have learned perspective, in which he particularly <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0712-0681"/> excelled for that period of art, from Pietro
                    della Francesca. The date of this first Florentine sojourn is by no means
                    settled; some authorities incline to make it as early as 1470, while others,
                    with perhaps better reason, postpone it till 1479. Pietro at this time was
                    extremely poor, and his prospects of rising in his art, save by the exercise of
                    incessant diligence day and night, were altogether dim; he had no bed, but slept
                    on a chest or trunk for many months, and, bent upon making his way, resolutely
                    denied himself every creature-comfort.</p>
                <p>Gradually Perugino rose into notice, and in the course of some years he became
                    extremely famous not only throughout all Italy but even beyond her bounds. He
                    was one of the earliest Italian painters to practise oil-painting, in which he
                    evinced a depth and smoothness of tint which elicited much remark; he
                    transcended his epoch in giving softness to form and a graceful spaciousness to
                    landscape-distances, and in perspective he applied the novel rule of two centres
                    of vision. The Florentine school advanced in amenity under his influence. Some
                    of his early works were extensive frescos for the Ingesati fathers in their
                    convent, which was destroyed not many years afterwards in the course of the
                    siege of Florence; he produced for them also many cartoons, which they executed
                    with brilliant effect in stained glass. Though greedy for gain, his integrity
                    was proof against temptation; and an amusing anecdote has survived of how the
                    prior of the Ingesati doled out to him the costly colour of ultramarine, and how
                    Perugino, constantly washing his brushes, obtained a surreptitious hoard of the
                    pigment, which he finally restored to the prior to shame his stingy
                    suspiciousness. Another (and possibly apocryphal) anecdote, to show that he was
                    not incapable of rising superior to all sordid considerations, is that he
                    painted some excellent frescos for the oratory annexed to S. Maria de’ Bianchi
                    and would only accept an omelette as a gratuity. A third anecdote (but it
                    belongs to a late period of his life) is that, as he would trust no one, he was
                    accustomed to carry his money about with him in travelling after he had received
                    a payment, and on one occasion was robbed and had a narrow escape of his life;
                    eventually, however, the bulk of the money was recovered. A good specimen of his
                    early style, in tempera, is the circular picture in the Louvre of the Virgin and
                    Child enthroned between Saints.</p>
                <p>Perugino returned from Florence to Perugia, and thence, towards 1483, he went to
                    Rome. The painting of that part of the Sixtine Chapel which is now immortalized
                    by Michelangelo’s Last Judgment was assigned to him by the pope; he covered it
                    with frescos of the Assumption, the Nativity, and Moses in the Bulrushes. These
                    works were ruthlessly destroyed to make a space for his successor’s more
                    colossal genius, but other works by Perugino still remain in the Sixtine
                    Chapel,—Moses and Zipporah (often attributed to Signorelli), the Baptism of
                    Christ, and Christ giving the keys to Peter. This last work is more especially
                    noted, and may be taken as a typical example both of Perugino’s merits and of
                    his characteristic defects, —such as formal symmetry of composition, set
                    attitudes, and affectation in the design of the extremities. Pinturicchio
                    accompanied the greater Umbrian to Rome, and was made his partner, receiving a
                    third of the profits; he may probably have done some of the Zipporah
                    subject.</p>
                <p>Pietro, now aged forty, must have left Rome after the completion of the Sixtine
                    paintings in 1486, and in the autumn of that year he was in Florence. Here he
                    figures by no means advantageously in a criminal court. In July 1487 he and
                    another Perugian painter named Aulista di Angelo were convicted, on their own
                    confession, of having in December waylaid with staves some one (the name does
                    not appear) in the street near S. Pietro Maggiore. Perugino limited himself, in
                    intention, to assault and battery, but Aulista had made up his mind for murder.
                    The minor and more illustrious culprit was fined ten gold florins, and the major
                    one exiled for life. The next recorded incident in his career is also not wholly
                    honourable to Perugino,—that of his undertaking but not fulfilling a contract to
                    paint in Orvieto <hi rend="italic">; as</hi> the commission fell through we need
                    not pursue the details.</p>
                <p>Between 1486 and 1499 Perugino resided chiefly in Florence, making one journey to
                    Rome and several to Perugia. He had a regular shop in Florence, received a great
                    number of commissions, with proportionate gain and fame, and continued
                    developing his practice as an oilpainter, his system of superposed layers of
                    colour being essentially the same as that of the Van Eycks. One of his most
                    celebrated pictures, the Pietà in the Pitti Gallery, belongs to the year 1495.
                    From about 1498 he became increasingly keen after money, frequently repeating
                    his groups from picture to picture, and leaving much of his work to journeymen.
                    In 1499 the guild of the Cambio (money-changers or bankers) of Perugia asked him
                    to undertake the decoration of their audience-hall, and he accepted the
                    invitation. This extensive scheme of work, which may have been finished within
                    the year 1500, comprised the painting of the vault with the seven planets and
                    the signs of the zodiac (Perugino doing the designs and his pupils most probably
                    the executive work), and the representation on the walls of two sacred
                    subjects—the Nativity and Transfiguration—the Eternal Father, the four Virtues
                    of Justice, Prudence, Temperance, and Fortitude, Cato as the emblem of wisdom,
                    and (in life-size) numerous figures of classic worthies, prophets, and sibyls.
                    On the mid-pilaster of the hall Perugino placed his own portrait in bust-form.
                    It is probable that Raphael, who in boyhood, towards 1496, had been placed by
                    his uncles under the tuition of Perugino, bore a hand in the work of the
                    vaulting; but, besides Raphael, the master had many and distinguished scholars
                    acting as his assistants. The Transfiguration in this series has often been
                    spoken of as the latest work of eminent excellence produced by Perugino, and
                    from about 1500 he declined in a marked degree; this, however, is not to be
                    accepted as true without some qualification, as we shall see in the sequel. It
                    may have been about this time (though some accounts date the event a few years
                    later) that Vannucci married a young and beautiful wife, the object of his fond
                    affection; he loved to see her handsomely dressed, and would often deck her out
                    with his own hands. He was made one of the priors of Perugia in 1501.</p>
                <p>While Perugino, though by no means stationary or unprogressive as an executive
                    artist, was working contentedly upon the old lines, and carrying out, almost to
                    their highest .point of actual or potential development, the ancient conceptions
                    of subject-matter, treatment, style, and form, a mighty wave of new art flooded
                    Florence with its rush and Italy with its rumour. Michelangelo, twenty-five
                    years of age in 1500, following after and distancing Leonardo da Vinci, was
                    opening men’s eyes and minds to possibilities of achievement as yet unsurmised.
                    Vannucci in Perugia heard Buonarroti bruited abroad, and was impatient to see
                    with his own eyes what the stir was all about. In 1504 he allowed his
                    apprentices and assistants to disperse, and he returned to Florence. It was not
                    in the nature of things that he should simply swell the chorus of praise. Though
                    not openly detracting, he viewed with jealousy and some grudging the advances
                    made by Michelangelo; and Michelangelo on his part replied, with the intolerance
                    which pertains to superiority, to the faint praise or covert dispraise of his
                    senior and junior in the art. On one occasion, in company, he told Perugino to
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n713/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0713-0682"/> his face that he was “a bungler in art” (goffo
                    nell’ arte). This was not to be borne, and Vannucci brought, with equal
                    indiscretion and ill success, an action for defamation of character. Put on his
                    mettle by this mortifying transaction, he determined to show what he could do,
                    and he produced the chef-d’oeuvre of the Madonna and Saints for the Certosa of
                    Pavia. The constituent parts of this noble work have now been sundered. The only
                    portion which remains in the Certosa is a figure of God the Father with
                    cherubim. An Annunciation has disappeared from cognizance; three
                    compartments—the Virgin adoring the infant Christ, St Michael, and St Raphael
                    with Tobias— are among the choicer treasures of the London National Gallery. The
                    current story that Raphael bore a hand in the work is not likely to be true.
                    This was succeeded in 1505 by an Assumption, in the Cappella dei Rabatta, in the
                    church of the Servi in Florence. The painting may have been executed chiefly by
                    a pupil, and was at any rate a failure: it was much decried; Perugino lost his
                    scholars; and towards 1506 he once more and finally abandoned Florence, going to
                    Perugia, and thence in a year or two to Rome.</p>
                <p>Pope Julius II. had summoned Perugino to paint the Stanza in the Vatican, now
                    called that of the Incendio del Borgo; but he soon preferred a younger
                    competitor, that very Raphael who had been trained by the aged master of
                    Perugia; and Vannucci, after painting the ceiling with figures of God the Father
                    in. different glories, in five medallion-subjects, found his occupation gone; he
                    retired from Rome, and was once more in Perugia from 1512. Among his latest
                    works one of the best is the extensive altar-piece (painted between 1512 and
                    1517) of S. Agostino in Perugia; the component parts of it are now dispersed in
                    various galleries.</p>
                <p>Perugino’s last frescos were painted for the monastery of S. Agnese in Perugia,
                    and in 1522 for the church of Castello di Fontignano hard by. Both series have
                    disappeared from their places, the second being now in the South Kensington
                    Museum. He was still at Fontignano in 1524 when the plague broke out, and he
                    died. He was buried in unconsecrated ground in a field, the precise spot now
                    unknown. The reason for so obscure and unwonted a mode of burial has been
                    discussed, and religious scepticism on the painter’s own part has been assigned
                    as the cause; the fact, however, appears to be that, on the sudden and
                    widespread outbreak of the plague, the panic-struck local authorities ordained
                    that all victims of the disorder should be at once interred without any waiting
                    for religious rites. This leads us to speak of Perugino’s opinions on religion.
                    Vasari is our chief, but not our sole, authority for saying that Vannucci had
                    very little religion, and was an open and obdurate disbeliever in the
                    immortality of the soul. Gasparo Celio, a painter of the 16th century, cites
                    Niccolò delle Pomarance (whose wife was related to Perugino’s wife) as averring
                    that the aged master on his deathbed rejected the last sacraments, and refused
                    to confess, saying he was curious to know the final fate of an unconfessed soul,
                    and <hi rend="italic">therefore</hi> he was buried in unconsecrated ground. For
                    a reader of the present day it is easier than it was for Vasari to suppose that
                    Perugino •may have been a materialist, and yet just as good and laudable a man
                    as his orthodox Catholic neighbours or brother-artists; still there is a sort of
                    shocking discrepancy between the quality of his art, in which all is throughout
                    Christian, Catholic, devotional, and even pietistic, and the character of an
                    anti-Christian contemner of the doctrine of immortality. It is difficult to
                    reconcile this discrepancy, and certainly not a little difficult also to suppose
                    that Vasari was totally mistaken in his assertion; he was born twelve years
                    before Perugino’s death, and must have talked with scores of people to whom the
                    Umbrian painter had been well known. We have to remark that Perugino in 1494
                    painted his own portrait, now in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, and into this
                    he introduced a scroll lettered “Timete Deum.” That an open disbeliever should
                    inscribe himself with “Timete Deum” seems odd; one’s first impression is either
                    that he cannot have been a disbeliever or else that he must have been a
                    hypocrite as well, which, however, is still inconsistent with Vasari’s account
                    of the facts. It is possible, after all, that a man might fear God and yet have
                    no confidence in immortality, or in many of the things which seemed in 1494 to
                    be essentials of religion. The portrait in question shows a plump face, with
                    small dark eyes, a short but well-cut nose, and sensuous lips; the neck is
                    thick, the hair bushy and frizzled, and the general air imposing. The later
                    portrait in the Cambio of Perugia shows the same face with traces of added
                    years. Perugino died possessed of coniderable property, leaving three sons.</p>
                <p>The character of Perugino’s art is, as we have just said, throughout religious,
                    although, in some instances already indicated, he strayed outside the circle of
                    Christian history and tradition. His art is reserved, self-contained, not
                    demonstrative, yet conspicuously marked by a tendency to posing and balance, and
                    to little artifices wherein the graceful merges in the affected. He had a
                    particular mastery over abstracted purism of expression; this appears constantly
                    in his works, and, while it carries the finer of them to a genuinely ideal
                    elevation, it leaves upon many a mincing and mawkish taint which it is not easy
                    to view without some impatience. Perugino did not recruit his strength from
                    study of the antique; his drawing, though frequently solid and able, is unequal,
                    and there is a certain littleness of style in his forms, especially (with rare
                    exceptions) the nude. His technical attainment was exceptional, and in colour he
                    may be regarded as standing first in his generation in central Italy if we
                    except Francia. Perugino does not leave upon us the impression of personal
                    greatness; he does not seem to have had struggling within him a profounder
                    message to convey than he succeeded in conveying. There is neither massiveness
                    of thought, nor novel initiative, nor glowing intensity, though there is some
                    fervour of inspiration. Still, within his own province, he is a rare and
                    excellent master.</p>
                <p>Among the very numerous works of Perugino a few not already named require
                    mention. Towards 1501 he produced the picture of the marriage of Joseph and the
                    Virgin Mary (the “Sposalizio ”) now in the museum of Caen; this served
                    indisputably as the original, to a great extent, of the still more famous
                    Sposalizio which was painted by Raphael in 1504, and which forms a leading
                    attraction of the Brera Gallery in Milan. A vastly finer work of Perugino’s than
                    his Sposalizio is the Ascension of Christ, which, painted a little earlier for
                    S. Pietro of Perugia, has for years past been in the museum of Lyons; the other
                    portions of the same altar-piece are dispersed in other galleries. In the chapel
                    of the Disciplinati of Città della Pieve is an Adoration of the Magi, a square
                    of 21 feet containing about thirty life-sized figures; this was executed, with
                    scarcely credible celerity, from the 1st to the 25th March (or thereabouts) in
                    1505, and must no doubt be in great part the work of Vannucci’s pupils. In 1507,
                    when the master’s work had for years been in a course of decline and his
                    performances were generally weak, he produced, nevertheless, one of his best
                    pictures—the Virgin between St Jerome and St Francis, now in the Palazzo Penna.
                    In S. Onofrio of Florence is a much-lauded and much-debated fresco of the Last
                    Supper, a careful and blandly correct but not inspired work; it has been
                    ascribed to Perugino by some connoisseurs, by others to Raphael; it may more
                    probably be by some different pupil of the Umbrian master.</p>
                <p>Our account of Perugino follows in its main lines that given by Crowe and
                    Cavalcaselle in their <hi rend="italic">History of Painting in Italy,</hi> vol.
                    iii. Vasari is, as usual, by far the most graphic narrator, but lax in his facts
                    (though not so much so as in several other instances). Other leading authorities
                    are Orsini, <hi rend="italic">Vita,</hi> &lt;fc., <hi rend="italic">di Pietro
                    Perugino e degli Scolari,</hi> 1804, and Mezzauotte, <hi rend="italic">Vita,
                    £c., di Pietro Vannucci,</hi> 1836. (W. Μ. R.)</p>
