                    to have received his call to follow Jesus at Bethany, having previously been, it
                    would seem, a disciple of the Baptist (John i. 43, 44). Philip was at that time
                    the means of bringing Nathanael to Jesus (John i. 45), and at a later date he,
                    along with Andrew, carried the request of the inquiring Greeks to the Master
                    (John xii. 22). Philip and Andrew alone are mentioned by name in connexion with
                    the feeding of the five thousand (John vi. 5, 7), and Philip is also one of the
                    few interlocutors in John xiv. After the resurrection he was present at the
                    election of Matthias as successor to Judas, but he does not again appear in the
                    New Testament history; it is, however, implied that he still continued in
                    Jerusalem after the outbreak of the first persecution.</p>
                <p>According to Polycrates, bishop of Ephesus, in his controversial letter written
                    to Victor of Rome towards the end of the 2d century (ap. Euseb., <hi
                    rend="italic">H. E.,</hi> iii. 31, v. 24), the graves of Philip, “one of the
                    twelve,” and of his two aged virgin daughters were in [the Phrygian] Hierapolis;
                    a third daughter, “who had lived in the Holy Ghost,” was buried at Ephesus.
                    Proclus, one of the interlocutors in the “Dialogue of Caius,” a writing of
                    somewhat later date than the letter of Polycrates, mentions (ap. Euseb., <hi
                    rend="italic">H. E.,</hi> iii. 31) “four prophetesses, the daughters of Philip
                    at Hierapolis in Asia, whose tomb and that of their father are to be seen
                    there.” But Eusebius himself proceeds expressly to identify this Philip with the
                    Philip mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles as living in Caesarea; and in
                    another place he alludes to Philip “the apostle” as having preached the gospel
                    to the Ethiopian eunuch <hi rend="italic">(H. E.,</hi> ii. 1). Clement of
                    Alexandria also <hi rend="italic">(Strom.,</hi> iii. 6 [52] ) incidentally
                    speaks of “Philip the apostle” as having begotten children and as having given
                    daughters in marriage. In another place <hi rend="italic">(Strom.,</hi> iv. 9
                    [73]) Clement quotes, with concurrence, a passage from the Gnostic</p>
                <p>Heracleon, in which it is expressly said that Matthew, Philip, Thomas, and others
                    died λvithout “confession of the voice,” or, in other words, were not, properly
                    speaking, confessors or martyrs. A later stage of the tradition regarding Philip
                    appears in various late apocryphal writings which have been edited by
                    Tischendorf in his <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Apostolorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Apocrypha,</hi> and in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apocalypses Apocryphae.</hi> According to the <hi rend="italic">Acta
                    Philippi,</hi> this apostle, along with Bartholomew and ΔIariamne, the sister of
                    the latter, came to Ophioryma or Hierapolis, where the success of their
                    preaching, and more particularly the conversion and miraculous healing of
                    Nicanora, the wife of the governor, provoked bitter hostility. Philip was
                    crucified head downwards, and invoked curses on his persecutors. His
                    imprecations were heard, but the Lord Jesus immediately afterwards appeared to
                    him and rebuked him for his want of meekness, further announcing his approaching
                    death, and that on account of his sin he would be kept back forty days from the
                    gates of paradise. The <hi rend="italic">Acta Philippi in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Hellade</hi><hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> “in the city of Athens, called
                    Hellas”) are still more fantastical. An apocryphal book, under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">Adus Philippi,</hi> is condemned in tne canon of Gelasius. Since
                    the 6th century Philip has been commemorated in the West, along with St James
                    the Less, on 1st May, their relics being deposited in the same church in Rome;
                    in the Eastern Church Philip’s day is 14th November, and that of James the Less
                    23d October.</p>
