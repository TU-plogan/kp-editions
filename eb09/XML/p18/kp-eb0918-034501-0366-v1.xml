                <p><label type="entry">PASTORAL</label> is the name given to a certain class of
                    modern literature in which the “idyl” of the Greeks and the “eclogue” of the
                    Latins are imitated. It was a growth of humanism at the Renaissance, and its
                    first home was Italy. Virgil had been imitated, even in the Middle Ages, but it
                    was the example of <hi rend="smallcaps">Theocritus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >(q.v.)</hi> that was originally followed in pastoral. Pastoral, as it
                    appeared in Tuscany in the 16th century, was really a developed eclogue, an idyl
                    which had been expanded from a single scene into a drama. The first dramatic
                    pastoral which is known to exist is the <hi rend="italic">Faνola di Orfeο</hi>
                    of Politian, which was represented at Mantua in 1472. This poem, which has been
                    elegantly translated by Mr J. A. Symonds, was a tragedy, with choral passages,
                    on an idyllic theme, and is perhaps too grave in tone to be considered as a pure
                    piece of pastoral. It led the way more directly to tragedy than to pastoral, and
                    it is the <hi rend="italic">II Sagrifizio</hi> of Agostino Beccari, which was
                    played at the court of Ferrara in 1554, that is always quoted as the first
                    complete and actual dramatic pastoral in European literature.</p>
                <p>In the west of Europe there were various efforts made in the direction of
                    non-dramatic pastoral, which it is hard to classify. Early in the 16 th century
                    Alexander Barclay, in England, translated the Latin eclogues of Mantuanus, a
                    scholastic writer of the preceding age. Barnabe Googe, a generation later, in
                    1563, published his <hi rend="italic">Eglogs, Epytaphes, and</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Sonnettes,</hi> a deliberate but not very successful attempt
                    to introduce pastoral into English literature. In France it is difficult to deny
                    the title of pastoral to various productions of the poets of the Pléiade, but
                    especially to Rémy Belleau’s pretty miscellany of prose and verse in praise of a
                    country life, called <hi rend="italic">La Bergerie</hi> (1565). But the final
                    impulse was given to non-dramatic pastoral by the publication, in 1504, of the
                    famous <hi rend="italic">Arcadia</hi> of G. Sannazaro, a work which passed
                    through sixty editions before the close of the 16th century, and which was
                    abundantly copied. Torquato Tasso followed Beccari after an interval of twenty
                    years, and by the success of his <hi rend="italic">Arninta,</hi> which was
                    performed b⅛fore the court of Ferrara in 1573, secured the popularity of
                    dramatic pastoral. Most of the existing works in this class may be traced back
                    to the influence either of the <hi rend="italic">Arcadia</hi> or of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Arninta.</hi> Tasso was immediately succeeded by Alvisio
                    Pasqualigo, who gave a comic turn to pastoral drama, and by Cristoforo
                    Castelletti, in whose hands it grew heroic and romantic, while, finally, Guarini
                    produced in 1590 his famous <hi rend="italic">Pastor Fido,</hi> and Ongaro his
                    fishermen’s pastoral of <hi rend="italic">Alceo.</hi> During the last quarter of
                    the 16th century pastoral drama was really a power in Italy. Some of the best
                    poetry of the age was written in this form, to be acted privately on the stages
                    of the little court theatres that were everywhere springing up. In a short time
                    music was introduced, and rapidly predominated, until the little forms of
                    tragedy, and pastoral altogether, were merged in opera.</p>
                <p>With the reign of Elizabeth a certain tendency to pastoral was introduced in
                    England. In Gascoigne and in Whetstone traces have been observed of a tendency
                    towards the form and spirit of eclogue. It has been conjectured that this
                    tendency, combined with the study of the few extant eclogues of Clément Marot,
                    led Spenser to the composition of what is the finest example of pastoral in the
                    English language, the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd's Calendar,</hi> printed in
                    1579. This famous work is divided into twelve eclogues, and is remarkable
                    because of the constancy with which Spenser turns in it from the artificial
                    Latin style of pastoral then popular in Italy, and takes his inspiration direct
                    from Theocritus. It is important to note that this is the first effort made in
                    European literature<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n367/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0918-0367-0346"/> to bring upon a pastoral stage the actual
                    rustics of a modern country, using their own peasant dialect. That Spenser’s
                    attempt was very imperfectly carried out does not militate against the
                    genuineness of the effort, which the very adoption of such names as Willie and
                    Cuddie, instead of the customary Damon and Daphnis, is enough to prove. Having
                    led up to this work, the influence of which was to be confined to England, we
                    return to Sannazaro’s <hi rend="italic">Arcadia,</hi> which left its mark upon
                    every literature in Europe. This remarkable romance, which was the type and the
                    original of so many succeeding pastorals, is written in rich but not laborious
                    periods of musical prose, into which are inserted at frequent intervals passages
                    of verse, contests between shepherds on the “humile fistula di Coridone,” or
                    laments for the death of some beautiful virgin. The characters move in a world
                    of supernatural and brilliant beings; they commune without surprise with “i
                    gloriosi spirti degli boschi,” and reflect with singular completeness their
                    author’s longing for an innocent voluptuous existence, with no hell or heaven in
                    the background.</p>
                <p>It was in Spain that the influence of the <hi rend="italic">Arcadia</hi> made
                    itself most rapidly felt outside Italy. Gil Vicente, who was also a Portuguese
                    writer, had written Spanish religious pastorals early in the 16 th century. But
                    Garcilaso de la Vega is the founder of Spanish pastoral. His first eclogue, <hi
                        rend="italic">El dulce</hi><hi rend="italic">lamentar</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >de</hi><hi rend="italic">los</hi><hi rend="italic">pastores,</hi> is
                    considered one of the finest poems of its kind in ancient or in modern
                    literature. He wrote little and died early, in 1536. Two Portuguese poets
                    followed him, and composed pastorals in Spanish, Francisco de Sá de Miranda, who
                    imitated Theocritus, and the famous Jorge de Montemayor, whose <hi rend="italic"
                        >Diana</hi> (1524) was founded on Sannazaro’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Arcadia.</hi> Gaspar Gil Polo, after the death of Montemayor in 1561,
                    completed his romance, and published in 1564 a <hi rend="italic">Diana
                        enamorada.</hi> It will be recollected that both these works are mentioned
                    with respect, in their kind, by Cervantes. The author of <hi rend="italic">Don
                        Quixote</hi> himself published an admirable pastoral romance, <hi
                        rend="italic">Galatea,</hi> in 1584. The rise of the taste for picaresque
                    literature in Spain towards the close of the 16th century was fatal to the
                    writers of pastoral. In Portugal it can hardly be said that this form of
                    literature has ever existed, although Camoens published idyls.</p>
                <p>In France there has always been so strong a tendency towards a graceful sort of
                    bucolic literature that it is hard to decide what should and what should not be
                    mentioned here. The charming <hi rend="italic">pastourelles</hi> of the 13th
                    century, with their knight on horseback and shepherdess by the roadside, need
                    not detain us further than to hint that when the influence of Italian pastoral
                    began to be felt in France these earlier lyrics gave it a national inclination.
                    We have mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Bergerie</hi> of Rémy Belleau, in which
                    the art of Sannazaro seems to join hands with the simple sweetness of the
                    mediaeval <hi rend="italic">pastourelle.</hi> But there was nothing in France
                    that could compare with the school of Spanish pastoral writers which we have
                    just noticed. Even the typical French pastoral, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Astree</hi> of Honoré d’Urfé (1610), has almost more connexion with the
                    knightly romances which Cervantes laughed at than with the pastorals which he
                    praised. D’Urfé had been preceded by Nicolas de Montreux, whose <hi
                        rend="italic">Bergeries</hi><hi rend="italic">de Juliette</hi> are just
                    worthy of mention. The famous <hi rend="italic">Astrée</hi> was the result of
                    the study of Tasso’s <hi rend="italic">Aminta</hi> on the one hand and
                    Montemayor’s <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi> on the other, with a strong flavouring
                    of the romantic spirit of the <hi rend="italic">Amadis.</hi> To remedy the pagan
                    tendency of the <hi rend="italic">Astrée</hi> a priest, Camus de Pontcarré,
                    wrote a series of Christian pastorals. Of the romances which followed in the
                    wake of the <hi rend="italic">Astrée,</hi> and in which the pastoral element was
                    gradually reduced to a minimum, a succinct but admirable account is given in Mr
                    Saintsbury’s <hi rend="italic">Short History of French Literature.</hi> The main
                    authors in this style were Mademoiselle de Scudéry, La Calprenède, and
                    Gomberville. Racon produced in 1625 a pastoral drama, <hi rend="italic">Les
                        Bergeries,</hi> founded on the <hi rend="italic">Astree</hi> of D’Urfé.</p>
                <p>In England the movement in favour of Theocritean simplicity which had been
                    introduced by Spenser in the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd's Calendar</hi> was
                    immediately defeated by the success of Sir Philip Sidney’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Arcadia,</hi> a romance closely modelled on the masterpiece of Sannazaro.
                    So far from attempting to sink to colloquial idiom, and adopt a realism in
                    rustic dialect, the tenor of Sidney’s narrative is even more grave and stately
                    than it is conceivable that the conversation of the most serious nobles can have
                    ever been. In these two remarkable books, then, we have two great contemporaries
                    and friends, the leading men of letters of their generation, trying their
                    earliest flights in the region of pastoral, and producing typical masterpieces
                    in each of the two great branches of that species of poetry. Henceforward, in
                    England, pastoral took one or other of these forms. It very shortly appeared,
                    however, that the San-nazarean form was more suited to the temper of the age,
                    even in England, than the Theocritean. In 1583 a great impetus was given to the
                    former by Robert Greene, who was composing his <hi rend="italic">Morando,</hi>
                    and still more in 1584 by the publication of two pastoral dramas, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Gallathea</hi> of Lyly and the <hi rend="italic">Arraignment
                        of Paris</hi> of Peele. It is doubtful whether either of these writers knew
                    anything about the <hi rend="italic">Arcadia</hi> of Sidney, which was
                    posthumously published, but Greene, at all events, became more and more imbued
                    with the Italiän spirit of pastoral. His <hi rend="italic">Menaphon</hi> and his
                        <hi rend="italic">Never too Late</hi> are pure bucolic romances. While in
                    the general form of his stories, however, he follows Sidney, the verse which he
                    introduces is often, especially in the <hi rend="italic">Menaphon,</hi>
                    extremely rustic and colloquial. In 1589 Lodge appended some eclogues to his <hi
                        rend="italic">Scilla’</hi><hi rend="italic">s Metamorphosis,</hi> but in his
                        <hi rend="italic">Rosalynde</hi> (1590) he made a much more important
                    contribution to English literature in general, and to Arcadian poetry in
                    particular. This beautiful and fantastic book is modelled more exactly upon the
                    masterpiece of Sannazaro than any other in our language. The other works of
                    Lodge scarcely come under the head of pastoral, although his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Phillis</hi> in 1593 included some pastoral sonnets, and his <hi
                        rend="italic">Margarite of America</hi> (1596) is modelled in form upon the
                        <hi rend="italic">Arcadia.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Sixe Idillia</hi> of
                    1588, paraphrases of Theocritus, are anonymous, but conjecture has attributed
                    them to Sir Edward Dyer. In 1598 Bartholomew Young published an English version
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi> of Montemayor.</p>
                <p>In 1585 Watson published his collection of Latin elegiacal eclogues, entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">Amyntas,</hi> which was translated into English by Abraham
                    Fraunce in 1587. Watson is also the author of two frigid pastorals, <hi
                        rend="italic">Meliboeus</hi> (1590) and <hi rend="italic">Amyntae</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Gaudia</hi> (1592). John Dickenson printed at a date unstated,
                    but probably not later than 1592, a “passionate eclogue” called <hi
                        rend="italic">The Shepherd’s Complaint,</hi> which begins with a harsh burst
                    of hexameters, but which soon settles down into a harmonious prose story, with
                    lyrical interludes. In 1594 the same writer published the romance of <hi
                        rend="italic">Arisbas.</hi> Drayton is the next pastoral poet in date of
                    publication. His <hi rend="italic">Idea: Shepherd's Garland</hi> bears the date
                    1593, but was probably written much earlier. In 1595 the same poet produced an
                        <hi rend="italic">Endimion and Phoebe,</hi> which was the least happy of his
                    works. He then turned his fluent pen to the other branches of poetic literature;
                    but after more than thirty years, at the very close of his life, he returned to
                    this early love, and published in 1627 two pastorals, <hi rend="italic">The
                        Quest of Cynthia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Shepherd's</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Sirena.</hi> The general character of all these pieces is
                    rich, but vague and un impassioned. The <hi rend="italic">Queen’s Arcadia</hi>
                    of Daniel must be allowed to lie open to the same <pb break="no"

                    accordance with a fashion, than in following of the author’s predominant
                    impulse. It may be added that the extremely bucolic title of Warner’s first
                    work, <hi rend="italic">Pan: his Syrinx,</hi> is misleading. These prose stories
                    have nothing pastoral about them. The singular eclogue by Barnfield, <hi
                        rend="italic">The Affectionate Shepherd,</hi> printed in 1594, is an
                    exercise on the theme “0 crudelis Alexi, nihil mea carmina curas,” and, in spite
                    of its juvenility and indiscretion, takes rank as the first really poetical
                    following of Spenser and Virgil, in distinction to Sidney and Sannazaro.
                    Marlowe’s pastoral lyric <hi rend="italic">Come live with Me,</hi> although not
                    printed until 1599, has been attributed to 1589. In 1600 was printed the
                    anonymous pastoral comedy in rhyme, <hi rend="italic">The Maid’s
                        Metamorphosis,</hi> long attributed to Lyly.</p>
                <p>With the close of the 16th century pastoral literature was not extinguished in
                    England as suddenly or as completely as it was in Italy and Spain. Throughout
                    the romantic Jacobean age the English love of country life asserted itself under
                    the guise of pastoral sentiment, and the influence of Tasso and Guarini was felt
                    in England just when it had ceased to be active in Italy. In England it became
                    the fashion to publish lyrical eclogues, usually in short measure, a class of
                    poetry peculiar to the nation and to that age. The lighter staves of <hi
                        rend="italic">The Shepherd’s Calendar</hi> were the model after which all
                    these graceful productions were drawn. We must confine ourselves to a brief
                    enumeration of the principal among these Jacobean eclogues. Nicholas Breton came
                    first with his <hi rend="italic">Passionate Shepherd</hi> in 1604. Wither
                    followed with <hi rend="italic">The Shej)herTs Hunting</hi> in 1615, and
                    Braithwaite, an inferior writer, published <hi rend="italic">The Poet’s
                        Willoιv</hi> in 1613 and <hi rend="italic">Shepherd’s Tales</hi> in 1621.
                    The mention of Wither must recall to our minds that of his friend William
                    Browne, who published in 1613-16 his beautiful collection of Devonshire idyls
                    called <hi rend="italic">Britannia’s Pastorals.</hi> These were in heroic verse,
                    and 1ess distinctly Spenserian in character than those eclogues recently
                    mentioned. In 1614 Browne, Wither, Christopher Brook, and Davies of Hereford
                    united in the composition of a little volume of pastorals entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">The Shepherd’s Pipe.</hi> Meanwhile the composition of
                    pastoral dramas was not entirely discontinued. In 1606 Day dramatized part of
                    Sidney’s <hi rend="italic">Arcadia</hi> in his <hi rend="italic">Isle of
                        Culls,</hi> and about 1625 the Rev. Thomas Goffe composed his <hi
                        rend="italic">Careless Shepherdess,</hi> which Ben Jonson deigned to imitate
                    in the opening lines of his <hi rend="italic">Sad Shepherd.</hi> In 1610
                    Fletcher produced his <hi rend="italic">Faithful Shepherdess</hi> in emulation
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Aminta</hi> of Tasso. This is the principal pastoral
                    play in our language, and, in spite of its faults in moral taste, it preserves a
                    fascination which has evaporated from most of its fellows. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Arcades</hi> of Milton is scarcely dramatic; but it is a bucolic ode of
                    great stateliness and beauty. In the <hi rend="italic">Sad Shepherd,</hi> which
                    was perhaps written about 1635, and in his pastoral masques, we see Ben Jonson
                    not disdaining to follow along the track that Fletcher had pointed out in the
                        <hi rend="italic">Faithful Shepherdess.</hi> With the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Piscatory Eclogues</hi> of Phineas Fletcher, in 1633, we may take leave of
                    the more studied forms of pastoral in England early in the 17 th century.</p>
                <p>When pastoral had declined in all the other nations of Europe, it enjoyed a
                    curious recrudescence in Holland. More than a century after date, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Arcadia</hi> of Sannazaro began to exercise an influence on
                    Dutch literature. Johan van Heemskirk led the way with his popular <hi
                        rend="italic">Batavische Arcadia</hi> in 1637. In this curious romance the
                    shepherds and shepherdesses move to and fro between Katwijk and the Hague, in a
                    landscape unaffectedly Dutch. Heemskirk had a troop of imitators. Hendrik
                    Zoeteboom published his <hi rend="italic">Zaanlandsche Arcadia</hi> in 1658, and
                    Lambertus Bos his <hi rend="italic">Dordtsche Arcadia</hi> in 1662. These local
                    imitations of the suave Italian pastoral were followed by still more crude
                    romances, the <hi rend="italic">Rotterdamsche Arcadia</hi> of Willem den Eiger,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Walchersche Arcadia</hi> of Gargon, and the <hi
                        rend="italic">Noordwijker Arcadia</hi> of Jacobus van der Valk. Germany has
                    nothing to offer us of this class, for the <hi rend="italic">Diana</hi> of
                    Werder (1644) and <hi rend="italic">Die adriatische Rosamund</hi> of Zesen
                    (1645) are scarcely pastorals even in form.</p>
                <p>In England the writing of eclogues of the sub-Spenserian class of Breton and
                    Wither led in another generation to a rich growth of lyrics which may be roughly
                    called pastoral, but are not strictly bucolic. Carew, Lovelace, Suckling,
                    Stanley, and Cartwright are lyrists who all contributed to this harvest of
                    country-song, but by far the most copious and the most characteristic of the
                    pastoral lyrists is Herrick. He has, perhaps, no rival in modern literature in
                    this particular direction. His command of his resources, his deep originality
                    and observation, his power of concentrating his genius on the details of rural
                    beauty, his interest in recording homely facts of country life, combined with
                    his extraordinary gift of song to place him in the very first rank among
                    pastoral writers; and it is noticeable that in Herrick’s hands, for the first
                    time, the pastoral became a real and modern, instead of being an ideal and
                    humanistic thing. From him we date the recognition in poetry of the humble
                    beauty that lies about our doors. His genius and influence were almost instantly
                    obscured by the Restoration. During the final decline of the Jacobean drama a
                    certain number of pastorals were still produced. Of these the only ones which
                    deserve mention are three dramatic adaptations, Shirley’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Arcadia</hi> (1640), Fanshawe’s <hi rend="italic">Pastor Fido</hi> (1646),
                    and Leonard Willan’s <hi rend="italic">Astraea</hi> (1651). The last pastoral
                    drama in the 17th century was Settle’s <hi rend="italic">Pastor Fido</hi>
                    (1677). The Restoration was extremely unfavourable to this species of
                    literature. Sir Charles Sedley, Aphra Behn, and Congreve published eclogues, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Pastoral Dialogue between Thirsis and Strephon</hi> of the
                    first-mentioned was much admired. All of these, however, are in the highest
                    degree insipid and unreal, and partook of the extreme artificiality of the
                    age.</p>
                <p>Pastoral came into fashion again early in the 18th century. The controversy in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Guardian,</hi> the famous critique on Ambrose Philips’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Pastorals,</hi> the anger and rivalry of Pope, and the
                    doubt which must always exist as to Steele’s share in the mystification, give
                    1708 a considerable importance in the annals of bucolic writing. Pope had
                    written his idyls first, and it was a source of infinite annoyance to him that
                    Philips contrived to precede him in publication. He succeeded in throwing
                    ridicule on Philips, however, and his own pastorals were greatly admired. Yet
                    there was some nature in Philips, and, though Pope is more elegant and
                    faultless, he is not one whit more genuinely bucolic than his rival. A far
                    better writer of pastoral than either is Gay, whose <hi rend="italic">Shepherd’s
                        Week</hi> was a serious attempt to throw to the winds the ridiculous
                    Arcadian tradition of nymphs and swains, and to copy Theocritus in his
                    simplicity. Gay was far more successful in executing this pleasing and natural
                    cycle of poems than in writing his pastoral tragedy of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Dione</hi> or his “tragi-comico pastoral farce” of <hi rend="italic">The
                        What Tye call it</hi> (1715). He deserves a very high place in the history
                    of English pastoral on the score of his <hi rend="italic">Shepherd’s Week.</hi>
                    Swift proposed to Gay that he should write a Newgate pastoral in which the
                    swains and nymphs should talk and warble in slang This Gay never did attempt;
                    but a northern admirer of his and Pope’s achieved a veritable and lasting
                    success in Lowland Scotch, a dialect then considered no less beneath the dignity
                    of verse. Allan Ramsay’s <hi rend="italic">Gentle Shepherd,</hi> published in
                    1725, was the last, and remains the most vertebrate and interesting, bucolic
                    drama produced in Great Britain. The literary value of this play has been
                    exaggerated, but it is a very clever and natural essay, and <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n369/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0918-0369-0348"/> the best proof of its success as a painting
                    of bucolic life is that it is still a favourite, after a hundred and fifty
                    years, among lowland reapers and milkmaids.</p>
                <p>With the <hi rend="italic">Gentle Shepherd</hi> the chronicle of pastoral in
                    England practically closes. This is at least the last performance which can be
                    described as a developed eclogue of the school of Tasso and Guarini. It is in
                    Switzerland that we find the next important revival of pastoral properly
                    so-called. The taste of the 18th century was very agreeably tickled by the
                    religious idyls of Salomon Gessner, who died in 1787. His <hi rend="italic"
                        >Daphnis</hi><hi rend="italic">vend Phillis</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Der</hi><hi rend="italic">Tod Abel’s</hi> were read and imitated throughout
                    Europe. In German literature they left but little mark, but in France they were
                    cleverly copied by Arnaud Berquin. A much more important pastoral writer is Jean
                    Pierre Clovis de Florian, who began by imitating the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Galatea</hi> of Cervantes, and continued with an original bucolic romance
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Estelle.</hi> His eclogues had a great popularity,
                    but it was said that they would be perfect if only there were sometimes wolves
                    in the sheepfolds· The tone of Florian, as a matter of fact, is tame to fatuity.
                    Neither in France nor in Germany did the shepherds and shepherdesses enjoy any
                    considerable vogue. It has always been noticeable that pastoral is a form of
                    literature which disappears before a breath of ridicule. Neither Gessner nor his
                    follower Abbt were able to survive the laughter of Herder. Since Florian and
                    Gessner there has been no reappearance of bucolic literature properly so-called.
                    The whole spirit of romanticism was fatal to pastoral. Voss in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Luise</hi> and Goethe in <hi rend="italic">Hermann</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">und.</hi><hi rend="italic">Dorothea</hi> replaced it by poetic
                    scenes from homely and simple life.</p>
                <p>Half a century later something like pastoral reappeared in a totally new form, in
                    the fashion for <hi rend="italic">Dorfgeschichten.</hi> About 1830 the Danish
                    poet S. S. Blichet, whose work connects the grim studies of our own Crabbe with
                    the milder modern strain of pastoral, began to publish his studies of out-door
                    romance among the poor in Jutland. Immermann followed in Germany with his novel
                        <hi rend="italic">Der</hi><hi rend="italic">Oberhof νa</hi> 1839. Auerbach,
                    who has given to the 19th-century idyl its peculiar character, began to publish
                    his <hi rend="italic">Schwarzwälder Dorfgeschichten</hi> in 1843. Meanwhile
                    George Sand was writing <hi rend="italic">Jeanne</hi> in 1844, which was
                    followed by Zα <hi rend="italic">Mare</hi><hi rend="italic">au</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Diable</hi> and <hi rend="italic">François le</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Champi,</hi> and in England Clough produced in 1848 his
                    remarkable long-vacation pastoral <hi rend="italic">The Bothie of
                        Tober-na-Vuolich.</hi> It seems almost certain that these writers followed a
                    simultaneous but independent impulse in this curious return to bucolic life, in
                    which, however, in every case, the old tiresome conventionality and affectation
                    of lady-like airs and graces were entirely dropped. This school of writers was
                    presently enriched in Norway by Björnson, whose <hi rend="italic">Synnove
                        Solbakken</hi> was the first of an exquisite series of pastoral romances.
                    But perhaps the best of all modern pastoral romances is Fritz Reuter’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Ut mine Stromtid,</hi> written in the Mecklenburg dialect of
                    German. In England the Dorsetshire poems of Mr Barnes and the Dorsetshire novels
                    of Mr Hardy belong to the same class, which has finally been augmented by the
                    appearance of Mr Munby’s remarkable idyl of <hi rend="italic">Dorothy.</hi> It
                    will be noticed of course that all these recent productions have so much in
                    common with the literature which is produced around them that they almost evade
                    separate classification. It is conceivable that some poet, in following the
                    antiquarian tendency of the age, may enshrine his fancy once more in the five
                    acts of a pure pastoral drama of the school of Tasso and Fletcher, but any great
                    vitality in pastoral is hardly to be looked for in the future. <hi
