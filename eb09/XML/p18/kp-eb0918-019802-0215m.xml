                <p><label type="entry">PALMYRA</label> is the Greek and Latin name of a famous city
                    of the East, now sunk to a mere hamlet, but still an object of interest for its
                    wonderful ruins, which its Semitic inhabitants and neighbours called Tadmor. The
                    latter name, which is found in the Bible (2 Chron. viii. 5), and is written
                    -∣o∏n and mom in Palmyrene inscriptions, has survived to the j&gt;resent day,
                    and is now locally pronounced Tιidmir or Tidmir. The site of Palmyra<note

                    fringe the oasis mark the northern limit of the Hammâd, the springless and stony
                    central region of the great Syrian desert. The direct route between the
                    Phoenician ports and the cities of * Ir⅛⅛ and the Persian Gulf would be from
                    Damascus eastward through the Hammâd, but this region is so inhospitable that
                    for at least two thousand years caravans have preferred to make a detour to the
                    north and pass through the oasis of Tadmor. At this point also the great line
                    between the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean is intersected by other routes
                    connecting Palmyra with northern Syria on the one hand and with Bostra, Petra,
                    and central Arabia on the other —routes now deserted or little traversed, but
                    which in ancient times were of very considerable consequence, especially in
                    connexion with the overland incense trade. The oasis was thus naturally marked
                    out as a trading post of some importance, but the commanding position which
                    Palmyra held in the 2d and 3d centuries of our era was due to special causes.
                    The rise and fall of Palmyra form one of the most interesting chapters in
                    ancient history, and must be studied not only from ancient writers but from the
                    numerous inscriptions that have been collected from the ruins of the city and
                    the tombs that surround it.</p>
                <p>The oldest notice of Palmyra is in 2 Chron. viii. 5, when Tadmor in the
                    wilderness is said to have been built by Solomon. But the source of this
                    statement is 1 Kings ix. 18, and here the name is <hi rend="smallcaps">tmr,</hi>
                    which cannot be read Tadmor, and from the context—in which Judaean towns are
                    spoken of—is almost certainly the Tamar of Ezek. xlvii. 19, xlviii. 28. It is
                    indeed extremely improbable that Solomon, whose policy was to enrich Judah by
                    developing the Red Sea traffic, and so carrying the trade of the East to the
                    Mediterranean ports through his own country, would have encouraged the rival
                    route by Tadmor, which lies quite outside the Israelite settlements, and passes
                    through districts over which Solomon was unable to maintain even the recognition
                    of suzerainty which David had extorted by his Syrian wars. After the time of
                    Solomon the Red Sea trade was interrupted, and an overland caravan trade from
                    Phoenicia to Yemen and the Persian Gulf took its place. But neither on the
                    cuneiform inscriptions nor in the Old Testament writings prior to Chronicles,
                    not even in Ezekiel’s account of the trading connexions of Tyre, is there any
                    mention of Tadmor; up to the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the
                    caravans seem to have been organized by merchants of southern or central Arabia,
                    and they probably reached Damascus by way of Dιima (Jauf Beni 'Amir) and the W.
                    Sirhân, without coming near the oasis of Palmyra (see especially Isa. xxi. 11
                    <hi rend="italic">sq.;</hi> Ezek. xxvii.). On the other hand Tadmor cannot have
                    been a new place when the Biblical Chronicler ascribed its foundation to
                    Solomon, and thus we shall hardly be wrong in connecting its origin with the
                    gradual forward movement of the nomadic Arabs which followed on the overthrow of
                    the ancient nationalities of Syria by the Chaldaean empire. Arabian tribes then
                    took possession of the partly cultivated lands east of Canaan, and, as has been
                    explained in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Nabataeans,</hi> became masters of
                    the Eastern <pb break="no"

                    learned civilization and the use of writing from the Aramaeans, whose language
                    was in current official and commercial use in the Persian empire west of the
                    Euphrates. The Nabataeans of Petra naturally appear in Western literature before
                    the remote Palmyrenes, who are not even mentioned by Strabo. But we learn from
                    Appian <hi rend="italic">{Bell. Civ.,</hi> v. 9) that in 42-41 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the city was rich enough to excite the cupidity of
                    Mark Antony, and that the population was still small and mobile enough to evade
                    that cupidity by timely flight. The series of Semitic inscriptions of Palmyra
                    begins a few years later. The oldest (De Vogüé, 30) bears the date 304 of the
                    Seleucid era (9 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), and was placed upon one of the
                    characteristic tower-shaped tombs which overlooked the city from the surrounding
                    hillsides. The dialect and the writing (a form of the <hi rend="superscript">
                    u</hi> square” character) are western Aramaic; the era, as we have just seen, is
                    Greek,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The oldest Greek
                    inscription (bilingual) is of 10 A.D., for a statue erected jointly by the
                    Palmyrenes and the Greeks of Seleucia, <hi rend="italic">Jour. As.,</hi> ser. 8,
                    i. 243.</p></note> the calendar Macedonian; and these influences, to which that
                    of Rome was soon added, were the determining factors in Palmyrene civilization.
                    The proper names and the names of deities are also partly Syriac, but in part
                    they are unmistakably Arabic. The Arabic element appears in the names of members
                    of the chief families, and these retain some distinctive grammatical forms which
                    biggest that, though Aramaic was the written language, Arabic may have not been
                    quite obsolete in common life. That the town was originally an Arabic settlement
                    is further rendered probable by the use of a purely Arabic term (η∏D “fahdh ”)
                    for the septs into which the townsmen were divided. And thus we can best explain
                    how, when the oasis was occupied by a settlement of Arabs, it gradually rose
                    from a mere halting-place for caravans to a city of the first rank. The true
                    Arab despises agriculture; but the pursuit of commerce, the organization and
                    conduct of trading caravans, is an honourable business which gives full scope to
                    all the personal qualities which the Bedouin values, and cannot be successfully
                    conducted without widespread connexions of blood and hospitality between the
                    merchant and the leading sheikhs on the caravan route. An Arabian merchant city
                    is thus necessarily aristocratic, and its chiefs can hardly be other than pure
                    Arabs of good blood. The position of Palmyra in this respect may be best
                    illustrated by the analogy of Mecca. In both cities the aristocracy was
                    commercial, and the ruling motive of all policy lay in the maintenance of the
                    caravan trade, which involved a constant exercise of tact and personal
                    influence, since a blood feud or petty tribal war might close the trade routes
                    at any moment. To keep the interests of commerce free from these embarrassments,
                    it was further indispensable to place them under the sanctions of religion, and,
                    though we cannot prove that this policy was carried out at Palmyra with the same
                    consistency and success as at Mecca, we can trace significant analogies which
                    point in this direction. Mecca became the religious centre of Arabia in virtue
                    of the cosmopolitan worship of the Ka'ba, in which all tribes could join without
                    surrendering their own local gods. So at Palmyra, side by side with the worship
                    of minor deities, we find a central cultus of Baal (Bel or Malachbel) identified
                    with “the most holy sun.” To him belonged the great temple in the south-east of
                    the city with its vast fortress-like courtyard 256 yards square, lined with
                    colonnades in the style of Herod’s temple; and ’ the présidence of the banquets
                    of his priests, an office coveted by the first citizens of Palmyra (W., 2606,
                    a), may be compared with the Meccan <hi rend="italic">rifâda,</hi> or right of
                    entertaining the pilgrims.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The sacrifices were partly maintained by endowments given by rich citizens
                    (De V., 3; W. 2588). The dates of the inscriptions show that much the commonest
                    time for the erection of honorific statues— often in a connexion partly
                    religious—was in spring (Adar, or more often Nisan), and this seems to point to
                    a great spring festival, corresponding to the Arabic sanctity of Rajab. Palmyra
                    had an important trade with the Bedouins in skins and grease (fiscal inscr.,
                    xvi. <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> XXX.); the herds of the desert are in condition
                    for slaughter in spring, and this also points to a spring feast and fair. A
                    trace of the hospitality so necessary to keep the Bedouins in humour may perhaps
                    be found in De V., 16; W., 2585.</p></note> And, just as in Mecca the central
                    worship ultimately became the worship of the supreme and nameless god (Allâh),
                    so in Palmyra a large proportion of the numerous votive altars are simply
                    dedicated to <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> the good and merciful one, blessed
                    be his name for ever.” In Palmyra as at Mecca the name Rahmân, (merciful) may be
                    due to the influence of the Jewish colony, which settled in the town after the
                    destruction of Jerusalem; but the tendency to a universal religion, of which the
                    dropping of the local proper name of God is so decided a mark, and which
                    nevertheless is accompanied by no such rejection of polytheism as made Jehovah
                    and Elohim synonymous in the religion of the Hebrew prophets, appears too early
                    to be due to Jewish teaching (Mordtmann, 1), and seems as at Mecca to be rather
                    connected with the cosmopolitanism of a merchant city. A secondary parallelism
                    with Mecca is found in the sacred fountain of Ephka. Its tepid and sulphureous
                    waters perhaps acquired their reputation from their medicinal use to cure the
                    rheumatism which has always prevailed in Palmyra.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Mordtmann, 18, and his notes; the oasis
                    lies 1300 feet above the sea, is constantly swept by cutting winds, and is
                    liable to sudden and extreme variations of temperature.</p></note> This spring,
                    like Zemzem at Mecca, had a guardian, appointed by the “moon-lord” Yarhibôl (W.,
                    2571, c; De V., 30), whose oracle is alluded to in another inscription, and who
                    may therefore be compared with the Meccan Hobal.</p>
                <p>The wars between Rome and Parthia favoured the growth of Palmyra, which astutely
                    used its secluded position midway between the two powers, and by a trimming
                    policy secured a great measure of practical independence and continuous
                    commercial relations with both (Appian, <hi rend="italic">ut sup.·,</hi> Pliny,
                    v. 89). These wars, too, must have given it a share in the trade with north
                    Syria, which in more peaceful times would not have chosen the desert route. To
                    some extent, however, the oasis soon came under Roman control, for decrees
                    regulating the custom-dues were issued for it by Germanicus and Corbulo. The
                    splendid period of Palmyra, to which the greater part of the inscribed monuments
                    belong, began with the overthrow of the Nabataean kingdom of Petra (105 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a,d.),</hi> which left it without a commercial rival. Hadrian
                    took Palmyra into his special favour, and gave it on the occasion of his visit
                    to the town <hi rend="italic">{circa</hi> 130 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi>
                    the name of Adrianopolis.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See Uranius, <hi rend="italic">apud</hi> Steph. Byz., now confirmed by the
                    great fiscal inscription.</p></note> Under the same emperor (8th April 137) the
                    customs and dues of Palmyra were regulated by a law which has recently been
                    copied from the stone on which it was engraved, and gives the fullest picture of
                    the life and commerce of the city. At this time the supreme legislative
                    authority lay in the hands of a senate <hi rend="italic">(βουλή),</hi> with a
                    president, a scribe, two archons, and a fiscal council of ten. At a later date,
                    probably under Septimius Severus or Caracalla, Palmyra received the <hi
                    rend="italic">jus italicum</hi> and became a Roman colony,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Ulpian, <hi rend="italic">Dig.,</hi> 1.
                    15, 1, and Waddington, p. 596. Palmyrenes who became Roman citizens took Roman
                    names in addition to their native ones, and these in almost every case are
                    either Septimius or Julius Aurelius.</p></note> and according to usage the
                    legislative power came into the hands of the senate and people under the
                    administration of officers called <hi rend="italic">strateqi.</hi> The Romans

                    became an important military post, and turned its commercial organization to
                    good account in aiding the movements of the legions marching against the
                    Persians (De V., 15). It was the Persian wars that raised Palmyra to brief
                    political importance, and made it for a few years the mistress of the Roman
                    East; but before we pass to this last epoch of its greatness we must attempt to
                    describe the aspect and life of the city during the century and a half of its
                    chief commercial prosperity.</p>
                <p>The chief luxuries of the ancient world—silks, jewels, pearls, perfumes, and the
                    like—were drawn from India, China, and southern Arabia; and Pliny computes the
                    yearly import of these wares into Rome at not less than three quarters of a
                    million of English money. The trade followed two routes, one by the Red Sea,
                    Egypt, and Alexandria, the other from the Persian Gulf through the Syro-Arabian
                    desert. The latter, after the fall of Petra, was in the hands of the Palmyrene
                    merchants. West of Palmyra there were Roman roads, and the bales could be
                    conveyed in waggons, but east of the oasis there was no road, and the caravans
                    of Palmyra traversed the desert either to Vologesias (near the ancient Babylon
                    and the later Cufa), where water carriage was available, or to Forath on the
                    Pasitigris and Charax at the head of the Persian Gulf. The trade was enormously
                    profitable not only to the merchants but to the town, which levied a rigorous
                    duty on all exports and imports, and even farmed out the water of the two wells;
                    but the dangers of the desert and the risks of Parthian or Persian hostility
                    were also formidable, and successfully to plan or conduct a great caravan was a
                    distinguished service to the state, often recognized by public monuments erected
                    by the “senate and people,” or by the merchants of the caravan. These monuments,
                    which form a conspicuous feature in Palmyrene architecture, took the form of
                    statues placed on pedestals projecting from the upper part of the long rows of
                    pillars which lined the chief streets; for every great merchant was eager to see
                    his name handed down to posterity by an enduring memorial, and to add to the
                    colonnades a series of pillars <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> with all their
                    ornaments, with their brazen capitals (?) and painted ceilings,” was the
                    received way of honouring others or winning honour for oneself. Thus arose,
                    besides minor streets, the great central avenue which, starting from a triumphal
                    arch near the great Temple of the Sun, formed the main axis of the city from
                    south-east to north-west for a length of 1240 yards, and at one time consisted
                    of not less than 750 columns of rosy-white limestone each 55 feet high. We must
                    suppose that this and the other pillared streets were shaded from the fierce
                    heat of the sun like a modern bazaar; and in some parts the pillars seem to have
                    served to support a raised footway, from which loungers could look down at their
                    ease on the creaking waggons piled with bales of silk or purple wool or heavy
                    with Grecian bronzes designed to adorn some Eastern palace, the long strings of
                    asses laden with skins or <hi rend="italic">alabastra</hi> of precious unguents,
                    the swinging camels charged with olive oil from Palestine or with grease and
                    hides from the Arabian deserts, and the motley crew of divers nationalities
                    which crowded the street beneath—the slave merchant with his human wares from
                    Egypt or Asia Minor, the Roman legionary and the half-naked Saracen, the Jewish,
                    Persian, and Armenian merchants, the street hawkers of old clothes, the petty
                    hucksters at the corners offering roasted pine cones, salt fish, and other cheap
                    dainties, the tawdry slave-girls, whose shameful trade went to swell the coffers
                    of the state, the noisy salt auction, presided over by an officer of the
                    customs. The production of “pure salt” from the deposits of the desert was
                    apparently one of the chief local industries, and another which could not be
                    lacking on the confines of Arabia was the manufacture of leather. We read too,
                    on the inscriptions, of a guild of workers in gold and silver; but Palmyra was
                    not a great industrial town, and the exacting fiscal system, which reached the
                    most essential industries, and drew profit from the barest necessaries of life,
                    must have weighed, heavily on the artizan classes. Though all quarters of the
                    town still show traces of splendid buildings, wealth was probably confined to a
                    comparatively small number of great families, and we must picture Palmyra in its
                    best days as displaying a truly Oriental compound of magnificence and squalor,
                    where the mud or straw-built huts of the poor stood hard by the palaces of the
                    merchant princes.</p>
                <p>The life of the mass of the population was the unchanging life of the Eastern
                    poor; the great families too remained essentially Oriental under the varnish of
                    their Greek culture and Roman citizenship. The life of a prominent townsman
                    included an active share in the organization and even the personal conduct of
                    caravans, the discharge of civic offices, perhaps the superintendence of the
                    market and the victualling of a Roman expedition. The capable discharge of these
                    functions, which sometimes involved considerable pecuniary sacrifices, ensured
                    publie esteem, laudatory inscriptions, and statues, and to these honours the
                    head of a great house was careful to add the glory of a splendid family tomb,
                    consecrated as the “long home <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi> (κtθSy ∏3—the same
                    phrase as in Eccles, xii. 5) of himself, his sons, and his sons’ sons “for
                    ever.” These tombs, which lie outside the city, are perhaps the most interesting
                    monuments of Palmyra. Some are lofty square towers, with as many as five
                    sepulchral chambers occupying successive stories, and overlooking the town and
                    its approaches—a feature characteristically Arabic—from the slopes of the
                    surrounding hills. Others are house-like buildings of one story, a richly
                    decorated portico opening into a hall whose walls are adorned with the names and
                    sculptured portraits of the dead. The scale of these monuments corresponds to
                    the wide conception of an Eastern family, from which dependants and slaves were
                    not excluded; and on one inscription, in striking contrast with Western usage, a
                    slave is named with the sons of the house (De V., 33, a). The tombs are the only
                    buildings of Palmyra that have any architectural individuality; the style of all
                    the ruins is late classic, highly ornate, but without refinement.</p>
                <p>The frequent Eastern expeditions of Rome in the 3d century brought Palmyra into
                    close connexion with several emperors, and opened a new career of ambition to
                    her citizens in the Roman honours that rewarded services to the imperial armies.
                    One house which was thus distinguished was to play no small part in the world’s
                    history. Its members, as we learn from the inscriptions, prefixed to their
                    Semitic names the Roman <hi rend="italic">gentilicium</hi> of Septimius, which
                    shows that they received the citizenship under Septimius Severus, presumably on
                    the occasion of his Parthian expedition. In the next generation Septimius

                    Wahballath, son of Nassor, had attained the rank of a Roman senator, conferred
                    no doubt when Alexander Severus visited Palmyra (comp. De V., 15). The East was
                    then stirred by the progress of the new Sàsânian empire, and the Palmyrene
                    aristocracy, in spite of its Roman honours, had probably never cordially fallen
                    in with the changes which had made Palmyra a colony and a military station.
                    Indeed the Romanizing process had only changed the surface life of the place; it
                    lay in the nature of things that the <pb break="no"

                    Odaenathus appears to have been the head of a party which secretly meditated
                    revolt, but the outbreak was prevented by a Roman officer Rufinus, who procured

                    brother Odaenathus who sought revenge for his father’s death and inherited his
                    ambition. In him the old Bedouin blood reasserted itself; an Esau among the
                    Jacobs of Tadmor, he spent his youth in the mountains and deserts, where the
                    hardships of the chase prepared him for the fatigues of war, and where no doubt
                    he acquired the absolute influence over the nomad tribes which was one of the
                    chief secrets of his future success. In 258, the year of Valerian’s ill-fated
                    march against Sapor, Odaenathus is called <hi rend="italic">h,ypatikos</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">consular,</hi> the highest honorary title of the empire, in an
                    inscription erected to him by the gold and silver smiths of Palmyra. The title
                    no doubt had just been conferred by the emperor on his way eastward, and the
                    munificent patron of the guild of workers in precious metals had, we may judge,
                    liberally scattered their wares among the wives and daughters of the Bedouin
                    sheikhs. He meant to have a strength and party of his own, whatever the issue of
                    the war. If we may trust the circumstantial account of Petrus Patricius, the
                    captivity of Valerian and the victorious advance of Sapor induced Odaenathus to
                    send gifts and letters to Sapor, and it was only when these were rejected that
                    he threw himself heart and soul into the Roman cause. Sapor was offended that
                    Odaenathus did not appear before him in person; the Palmyrene chief in fact did
                    not mean to be the mere subject either of Persian or Roman, though he was ready
                    to follow whichever power would leave him practically sovereign at the price of
                    occasional acts of homage. Rome in her day of disaster could not afford to be so
                    proud as the Persian; the weak Gallienus was the very suzerain whom Odaenathus
                    desired; and, joining his own considerable forces with the shattered fragments
                    of the Roman armies, the Palmyrene commenced a successful war with Persia, in
                    which he amply revenged himself on the arrogance of Sapor, and not only saved
                    the Roman East but reduced Nisibis, twice laid siege to Ctesiphon itself, and
                    furnished Gallienus with the captives and trophies for the empty pomp of a
                    triumph. From the confused mass of undigested and contradictory anecdotes which
                    form all the history we possess of this period it is impossible to extract a
                    satisfactory picture of the career of Odaenathus; but we can see that he
                    steadily aimed at concentrating in his own person the whole sovereignty of Syria
                    and the neighbouring lands, and as the organization of the empire had entirely
                    broken down, and almost every Roman general who had a substantial force at his
                    command sooner or later advanced a claim to the purple, the Palmyrene prince,
                    always acting in the name of Gallienus, gradually disembarrassed himself of
                    every rival representative of Western authority throughout the greater part of
                    Roman Asia. In the year 264 he was officially named supreme commander in the
                    East,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This date is given

                    notices. The order of events is very obscure, and Pollio is selfcontradictory in
                    several places. But the two events which he dates by consulates, and which
                    therefore are probably most trustworthy, are the <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi>
                    of Odaenathus in 264 and the rejoicings in Rome over his Persian victories in
                    265 (reading <hi rend="italic">consulatu</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                    >consulta</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Gall.</hi> c. 12 with Klein in <hi

                    rend="italic">sq. ).</hi> With this agrees Jerome’s date of 265 for the campaign
                    against Sapor; and it is also possible to make out from the series of Palmyrene
                    inscriptions referring to a certain Septimius Worod that in 263-264 the military
                    organization of Palmyra ceased to be Roman. On the other hand up to 262-263
                    Syria was held by Macrianus and his son Quietus. Odaenathus took Emesa and
                    destroyed Quietus probably in 263. Up to this time his sphere of action was
                    limited by the desert, but the overthrow of Quietus left him the only real power
                    between Rome and Persia. There is really no evidence that he was at war with
                    Sapor before 265, and before 263 he was hardly in a position to send an embassy
                    to him. It is most likely that his final decision in favour of Rome was not made
                    till the fall of Emesa. Pollio is certainly wrong in saying that in 265
                    Odaenathus was named Augustus. He seems to have been misled by a medal in which
                    the Augustus represented dragging Persians captive was really Gallienus, whom we
                    know to have triumphed for Odaenathus’s victories. But after his Persian
                    successes Odaenathus strengthened his position, as we learn from coins, by
                    having his son associated in his imperium. The first year of Wahballath is
                    266-267, when his father, as will be presently shown, was still alive. The title
                    of “king” was perhaps not conferred on Wahballath till the reign of Aurelian
                    (Sallet, <hi rend="italic">Num.</hi><hi rend="italic">Zeit.,</hi>
                    1870).</p></note> and, though to the Romans he was a subject of the empire,
                    among his own people he was an independent sovereign, supreme over all the lands
                    from Armenia to Arabia, and able to count on the assistance of both these
                    nations. Odaenathus himself seems to have been engaged in almost constant
                    warfare in the east and north against the Persians and perhaps the Scythians,
                    but in his absence the reins of government were firmly held by his wife Zenobia,
                    the most famous heroine of antiquity, to whom indeed Aurelian, in a letter
                    preserved by Trebellius Pollio, ascribes the chief merit of all her husband’s
                    success. Septimia Zenobia was by birth a Palmyrene; her native name was Bath
                    Zabbai (De V., 29);<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    original reading of De Vogiié and Waddington, Bath Zebina, is now known to be

                    Septimius Zabbai, the general of the forces of the city.</p></note> and Pollio’s
                    description of her dark beauty, black flashing eyes, and pearly teeth, together
                    with her unusual physical endurance and the frank commanding manners which
                    secured her authority in the camp and the desert, point emphatically to an
                    Arabic rather than a Syrian descent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Athanasius, in speaking of the support she gave to Paul of Samosata, calls her a
                    Jewess; this is certainly false, for her coins bear pagan symbols. Athanasius
                    probably drew a hasty conclusion, not so much from her sympathy λvith the
                    Monarchian Paul as from her patronage of the Jews in Alexandria, for which the
                    evidence of an inscription from a synagogue still exists (see Mommsen in <hi

                    which is the most necessary quality of an Eastern sovereign, Zenobia added the
                    rarer gifts of economy and organization, and an unusual range of intellectual
                    culture. She spoke Coptic as well as Syriac, knew something of Latin, and had
                    learned Greek from the famous Longinus, who remained at her court to the last,
                    and paid the penalty of his life for his share in her counsels. She was also a
                    diligent student of Eastern and Western history, and the statement that she
                    enjoined her sons to speak Latin so that they had difficulty in using Greek
                    implies a consistent and early adoption of the policy which made the success of
                    Odaenathus, and, taken in connexion with Aurelian’s testimony, in a letter
                    preserved by Pollio, that she had the chief merit of her husband’s exploits,
                    seems to justify the conclusion that it was her educated political insight that
                    created the fortunes of the short-lived dynasty. In the zenith of his fame
                    Odaenathus was cut off by assassination along with his eldest son Herod, and it
                    is generally assumed that the murder took place under Gallienus. The authority
                    for this view is Pollio, who says that on receiving the news Gallienus sent an
                    army against the Persians, which was destroyed to a <pb break="no"

                    since we know from coins of her son Wahballath or Athenodorus, struck at
                    Alexandria, that the suzerainship of Rome was acknowledged in the Palmyrene
                    kingdom till the second year of Aurelian. That Odaenathus fell under Gallienus
                    seems, however, at first sight to be confirmed by the coins, which give 266-7 as
                    the first year of Wahballath. On the other hand the inscriptions on two statues
                    of Odaenathus and Zenobia which stand side by side at Palmyra bear the date
                    August 271, and, though De Vogüé, mistaking an essential word, supposed the
                    former to be posthumous, the inscription really implies that Odaenathus was then
                    alive.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>That Odaenathus

                    wife and sons were associated in the kingship of Odaenathus, and therefore the
                    years of Wahballath do not necessarily begin with his father’s death. The fact
                    seems to be that, while Odaenathus was busy at the other end of his kingdom,
                    Zenobia administered the government at Palmyra and directed the conquest of
                    Egypt, still nominally acting under the emperor at Rome, whose authority on the

                    years’ standing. Up to that date the royal pair probably did not venture to coin
                    in open defiance to Rome, and yet were unwilling to circulate an acknowledgment
                    of vassalship in all the bazaars of the East.</p>
                <p>When, however, Aurelian had restored the unity of the West, and stood at the head
                    of a powerful army flushed by victory in Gaul, Palmyra had to choose between
                    real subjection and war with Rome. Some time in the year ending August 28, 271,
                    Wahballath assumed the title of Augustus, and drops Aurelian from his coins, and
                    just at the same time Zabdai, generalissimo of the forces, and Zabbai, commander
                    of the army of Tadmor, erected the statues already mentioned, where Odaenathus
                    is styled “king of kings and restorer of the state.” This was an open challenge,
                    and the assassination of Odaenathus, which took place at Emesa, a town in which
                    the Roman party was strong, must have followed immediately afterwards, and on
                    political grounds.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See,

                    was now face to face with a Roman invasion. She held Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia,
                    and Asia Minor as far as Ancyra; and Bithynia was ready to join her party had
                    not the army of Aurelian appeared just in time from Byzantium. She could count
                    too on the Armenians and the Arabs, but the loyalty of Syria was doubtful: the
                    towns disliked a rule which was essentially “barbarian,” and in Antioch at least
                    the patroness of the Monarchian bishop Paul of Samosata could not be popular
                    with the large Christian party by whom he was bitterly hated. There were many
                    Romans in Zenobia’s force, and it was they who bore the brunt of the two great
                    battles at Antioch and Emesa, which followed Aurelian’s rapid advance through
                    Asia Minor. But Zenobia made light of these defeats,—“I have suffered no great
                    loss” was her message to Aurelian, “for almost all who have fallen are Romans”
                    <hi rend="italic">(Fr. H. Gr.,</hi> iv. 197). It was now plain that the war was
                    one of races, and the fact that the fellâhïn of Palestine fought with enthusiasm
                    on the side of Aurelian is the clearest proof that the empire of Palmyra was
                    really an empire of Arabs over the peasants of the settled Semitic lands, whom
                    the true Bedouin always despises, and who return his contempt with burning
                    hatred. Thus the analogy already traced between the early history of Tadmor and
                    Mecca is completed by an equally striking parallel between the empire of the
                    Septimians at Palmyra and that of the Omayyads at Damascus. In each case it was
                    a family of Arabian merchant princes, strong in its influence over the sons of
                    the desert, which rose to sovereignty and governed the old lands of the Semites
                    from a city which had the desert behind it. But the empire of Palmyra came four
                    centuries too soon. Rome was not yet exhausted, and Zenobia had neither the
                    religious discipline of Islâm to hold the Arabs together nor the spoil of the
                    treasuries of Persia to keep their enthusiasm always fresh. Aurelian’s military
                    skill was strained to the uttermost by the prudence and energy of Zenobia, but
                    he succeeded in forming and maintaining the siege of Palmyra in spite of its
                    bulwark of desert, and his gold corrupted the Arab and Armenian auxiliaries.
                    Zenobia attempted to flee and throw herself on the Persians, but she was pursued
                    and taken, and then the Palmyrenes lost heart and capitulated. Aurelian seized
                    the wealth of the city, but spared the inhabitants, and to Zenobia he granted
                    her Life while he put her advisers to death. She figured in his splendid
                    triumph, and by the most probable account accepted her fall with dignity, and
                    closed her days at Tibur, where she lived with her sons the life of a Roman
                    matron. The fall of Zenobia may be placed in the spring of 272. Soon after,
                    probably within a year, Palmyra was again in revolt, but on the approach of
                    Aurelian it yielded without a battle; the town was destroyed and the population
                    put to the sword.</p>
                <p>An obscure and distorted tradition of Zenobia as an Arab queen survived in the
                    Arabian tradition of Zabba, daughter of 'Amr b. Zarib, whose name is associated
                    with Tadmor and with a town on the right bank of the Euphrates, which is no
                    doubt the Zenobia of which Procopius speaks as founded by the famous queen. See
                    C. de Perceval, ii. 28⅛7., 197 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>; Tabari, i. 757 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.</hi> But the ruins of Palmyra, which excited the lively
                    admiration of the Bedouins, were not associated by them with the great queen;
                    they are referred to by Nâbigha as proofs of the might of Solomon and his
                    sovereignty over their builders the Jinn. This legend must have come from the
                    Jews, who either clung to the ruins or returned when Palmyra partially revived
                    as a military station founded by Diocletian. Under the Christian empire Palmyra
                    was a bishopric; about 400 A.D. it was the station of the first Illyrian legion
                    <hi rend="italic">(Not. Dig.).</hi> Justinian furnished it with an aqueduct, and
                    built the wall of which the ruins are still visible: it was deemed important, as
                    we gather from Procopius, to have a strong post on the disputed marches of the
                    Arabs of ITira and Ghassan. At the Moslem conquest of Syria Palmyra capitulated
                    to Khalid without embracing Islam (Beladhori, p. Ill <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>;
                    Yakut, i. 831). The town became a Moslem fortress and received a considerable
                    Arab colony; for in the reign of Merwân II. it sent a thousand Kalbite horsemen
                    to aid the revolt of Emesa, to the district of which it is reckoned by the
                    Arabic geographers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    was still a wealthy place, with considerable trade, as late as the 14th century;
                    but in the general decline of the East, and the change of the great trade
                    routes, it at length sunk to a poor group of hovels gathered in the courtyard of
                    the great Temple of Sun. The ruins first became known to Europe in 1678 through
                    W. Halifax, an Aleppo merchant. The architecture was carefully studied in 1751
                    by Wood and Dawkins, whose splendid folio <hi rend="italic">{The Ruins of
                    Palmyra,</hi> Lond., 1753) also gave copies of inscriptions.<note

                    thoroughly opened to study by the collections of Waddington and De Vogüé, made
                    in 1861-62. Subsequent discoveries have been of minor importance, with the
