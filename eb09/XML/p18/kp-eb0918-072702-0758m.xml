                    Leyden in 1611, occurs the following :—</p>
                <p>“In our third expedition, under Admiral Van der Hagen, there was seen at Amboyna
                    a rare and truly marvellous animal. The ‘cousa,’ as it is called by the natives,
                    is a reddish animal, a little larger than a cat, which has under its belly a
                    kind of pouch in which the mammae are placed, and in this the young are born,
                    and remain there hanging firmly on until large enough to be turned out by their
                    mother. They return, however, continually to the pouch until sufficiently
                    developed to follow their mother and to find food for themselves. These animals
                    live on grass, green leaves, and other vegetable food, and their flesh is eaten
                    by the Portuguese and other native Christians, but not by the Mohammedans, who
                    consider the cousa to be an unclean and forbidden animal, mainly on account of
                    its want of horns.”</p>
                <p>This early account forms the first mention of any of the numerous marsupials of
                    the eastern hemisphere, as there can be no doubt that the animal called the
                    cousa by the natives of Amboyna nearly 300 years ago was the Grey Cuscus <hi
                    rend="italic">(Cuscus</hi><hi rend="italic">orientalis},</hi> a member of the
                    only marsupial genus occurring in any Eastern land then known to Europeans.
                    About a hundred years afterwards the same animal was seen by the Dutch traveller
                    Valentyn, also at Amboyna, and still later Buffon gave to a pair of cuscuses
                    examined by him the name that heads this article, “Phalanger,” on account of the
                    peculiar structure of the second and third toes of the hind feet, which are
                    united in a common skin up to the nails, a character now known to be present in
                    a large proportion of the Australian marsupials. Later, Captain Cook in 1770 and
                    1777, Governor Phillip in 1788, and J. White in 1790 discovered various
                    different kinds of phalangers, and now we know of not less than ten genera, with
                    about thirty-five species, forming the sub-family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phalangistinae</hi> of the family <hi rend="italic">Phalangistidae,</hi> whose
                    general characters have already been noticed in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia</hi> (vol. XV. p. 382).</p>
                <p>Phalangers as a whole are small woolly-coated animals, with long, powerful, and
                    often prehensile tails, large claws, and, as in the American opossums, with
                    opposable nailless great toes. Their expression seems in the day to be dull and
                    sleepy, but by night they appear to decidedly greater advantage. They live
                    mostly upon fruit, leaves, and blossoms, although some few feed habitually upon
                    insects, and all relish, when in confinement, an occasional bird or other small
                    animal. Several of the phalangers possess flying membranes stretched between
                    their fore and hind limbs, by the help of which they can make long and sustained
                    leaps through the air, like the flying squirrels; but it is interesting to
                    notice that the possession of these flying membranes does not seem to be any
                    indication of special affinity, the characters of the skull and teeth sharply
                    dividing the flying forms, and uniting them with other species of the non-flying
                    groups. Their skulls (see fig. 1) are as a rule broad and flattened, with the
                    posterior part swollen out laterally, owing to the numerous air-cells situated
                    in the substance of the squamosals. The dental formula is very variable,
                    especially as regards the premolars, of which some at least in each genus are
                    reduced to mere functionless rudiments, and may even vary in number on the two
                    sides of the jaw of the same individual. The <pb break="no"

                    so common in zoological gardens, where, however, it is seldom seen, owing to its
                    nocturnal habits. It is of about the size and general build of a small fox,
                    whence its name; its colour is grey, with a yellowish white belly, white ears,
                    and a black tail. It is a native of the greater part of the continent of
                    Australia, but is replaced in Tasmania by the closely allied Brown Phalanger <hi

                <p>This genus contains about five species, the largest of which is the
                    Yellow-bellied Flying-Phalanger <hi rend="italic">{P.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >australis),</hi> whose habits are recorded by Mr Gould as follows. “This animal
                    is common in all the brushes of New South ΛVales, particularly those which
                    stretch along the coast from Port Philip to Moreton Bay. In these vast forests
                    trees of one kind or another are perpetually flowering, and thus offer a
                    never-failing supply of the blossoms upon which it feeds; the flowers of the
                    various kinds of gums, some of which are of great magnitude, are the principal
                    favourites. Like the rest of the genus, it is nocturnal in its habits, dwelling
                    in holes and in the spouts of the larger branches during the day, and displaying
                    the greatest activity at night while running over the small leafy branches,
                    frequently even to their very extremities, in search of insects and the honey of
                    the newly-opened blossoms. Its structure being ill adapted for terrestrial
                    habits, it seldom descends to the ground except for the purpose of passing to a
                    tree too distant to be attained by springing from the one it wishes to leave.
                    The tops of the trees are traversed by this animal with as much ease as the most
                    level ground is by such as are destined for terra firma. If chased or forced to
                    flight it ascends to the highest branch and performs the most enormous leaps,
                    sweeping from tree to tree with wonderful address; a slight elevation gives its
                    body an impetus which with the expansion of its membrane enables it to pass to a
                    considerable distance, always ascending a little at the extremity of the leap;
                    by this ascent the animal is prevented from receiving the shock which it would
                    otherwise sustain.”</p>
