                    in the Aegean Sea, one of the largest of the group of the Cyclades, with a
                    population of 8000. It lies to the west of Naxos, from which it is separated by
                    a channel about 6 miles broad, and with which it is now grouped together, in
                    popular language, under the common name of Paronaxia. It is in 37° N. lat. and
                    25° 10' E. long. Its greatest length from north-east to south-west is 13 miles,
                    and its greatest breadth 10 miles. It is formed of a single mountain about 2400
                    feet high, sloping evenly down on all sides to a maritime plain, which is
                    broadest on the north-east and south-west sides. The island is composed of
                    marble, though gneiss and mica-schist are to be found in a few places. Grey and
                    bare rises the mountain, but on the level ground as well as on some of the lower
                    slopes corn and vines are cultivated with success. A sweetish dark-red wine is
                    exported in considerable quantities. The island is almost treeless; the olives,
                    which formerly yielded abundance of oil, were cut down by the Venetians for
                    firewood in the war of Candia. The capital, Paroikia or Parikia (Italian, <hi
                    rend="italic">Parechiaf</hi> situated on a bay on the northwest side of the
                    island, occupies the site of the ancient capital Paros. Its harbour admits small
                    vessels; the entrance is dangerous on account of rocks. Houses built in the
                    Italian style with terraced roofs, shadowed by luxuriant vines, and surrounded
                    by gardens of oranges and pomegranates, give to the town a picturesque and
                    pleasing aspect. Here on a rock beside the sea are the remains of a mediaeval
                    castle built almost entirely of ancient marble remains. Similar traces of
                    antiquity in the shape of bas-reliefs, inscriptions, columns, &amp;c., are
                    numerous in the town. Outside the town is the church of Katapoliani <hi
                    rend="italic">(η</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >E</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >κατoντατrvλιανη),</hi> well known in the Archipelago. On the north side of the
                    island is the bay of Naousa (Naussa) or Agoussa, forming a safe and roomy
                    harbour. In ancient times it was closed by a chain or boom. Another good harbour
                    is that of Drios on the south-east side, where the Turkish fleet used to anchor
                    on its annual voyage through the Aegean. The three villages of Tragoulas,
                    Marmora, and Kepidi (K^τr∕δι, pronounced Tschipidi), situated on an open plain
                    on the eastern side of the island, and rich in remains of antiquity, probably
                    occupy the site of an ancient town. They are known together as the “villages of
                    Kephalos,” from the steep and lofty headland of Kephalos. On this headland
                    stands an abandoned monastery of St Anthony, amidst the ruins of a mediaeval
                    castle, which belonged to the Venetian family of the Venieri, and was gallantly
                    though fruitlessly defended against the Turkish general Barbarossa in 1537. In
                    antiquity the island contained a famous altar, the sides of which were said to
                    be a stadium (606 feet) long. But the celebrated marble quarries are the real
                    centre of interest of the island. They lie on the northern side of the mountain
                    anciently known as Marpessa (afterwards Capresso), a little below a former
                    convent of St Mina. The marble, which was employed by Phidias, Praxiteles, and
                    other great Greek sculptors, was obtained by means of subterranean quarries
                    driven horizon tally or at a descending angle into the rock, and the marble thus
                    quarried by lamplight got the name of Lychnites, Lychneus (from <hi
                    rend="italic">lychnos,</hi> a lamp), or Lygdos (Plin., <hi rend="italic">H.
                    N.,</hi> xxxvi. 5, 14; Plato, <hi rend="italic">Eryxias,</hi> 400 D; Athen., v.
                    2050; Diod. Sic., 2, 52). Several of these tunnels are still to be seen. At the
                    entrance to one of them is a celebrated bas-relief dedicated to the Nymphs by
                    one Adamas, of the Thracian tribe of the Odrysae; it represents a festival of
                    Silenus or Pan.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Like the rest of the Cyclades, Paros seems to
                    have been peopled at an early date by Carians (Herod., i. 171; Thue., i. 4)·
                    —perhaps also by the Phoenicians, whom we know from the Greek historians to have
                    occupied other islands in the Aegean, including the neighbouring Thera (Herod.,
                    ii. 44; iv. 147; compare Thue., i. 8). The institution of a form of sacrifice to
                    the Graces, apparently peculiar to Paros, at which neither garlands nor flutes
                    were made use of, was ascribed to Minos. The story that Paros was colonized by
                    one Paros of Parrhasia, who brought with him a colony of Arcadians to the island
                    (Heraclides, <hi rend="italic">De Rebus</hi><hi rend="italic">Publicis,</hi> 8;
                    Steph. Byz., <hi rend="italic">s.v.</hi> ∏αpos), is one of those etymologizing
                    fictions in which Greek legend abounds. Ancient names of the island are said to
                    have been Plateia (or Pactia), Demetrias, Zacynthus, Hyria, Hyleessa, Minoa, and
                    Cabarnis (Steph. Byz.). From Athens the island afterwards, received a colony of
                    Ionians (Schob Dionys., <hi rend="italic">Per.,</hi> 525; comp. Herod., i. 171),
                    under whom it attained a high degree of prosperity. It sent out colonies to
                    Thasos (Thuc., iv. 104; Strabo, 487) and Parium on the Hellespont. In the former
                    colony, which was planted in the'15th or 18th Olympiad, the poet Archilochus, a
                    native of Paros, is said to have taken part. As late as 385 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> the Parians, in conjunction with Dionysius of Syracuse, founded a
                    colony on the Illyrian island of Pharos (Diod. Sic., xv. 13). So high was the
                    reputation of the Parians that they were chosen by the people of Miletus to
                    arbitrate in a party dispute (Herod., v. 28 <hi rend="italic">sq.').</hi>
                    Shortly before the Persian War Paros seems to have been a dependency of Naxos
                    (Herod., v. 31). In the Persian War Paros sided with the Persians and sent a
                    trireme to Marathon to support them. In retaliation, the capital Paros was
                    besieged by an Athenian fleet under Miltiades, who demanded a fine of 100
                    talents. But the town offered a vigorous resistance, and the Athenians were
                    obliged to sail away after a siege of twenty-six days, during which they had
                    laid the island waste. It was at a temple of Demeter Thesmophorus<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n341/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0341-0320"/> in Paros that Miltiades received the hurt of
                    which he afterwards died (Herod, vi. 133-136). By means of an inscription Ross
                    was enabled to identify the site of the temple; it lies, in agreement with the
                    description of Herodotus, on a low hill beyond the boundaries of the town. Paros
                    also sided with Xerxes against Greece, but after the battle of Artemisium the
                    Parian contingent remained in Cythnos watching the progress of events (Herod.,
                    viii. 67). For this unpatriotic conduct the islanders were punished by
                    Themistocles, who exacted a heavy fine (Herod., viii. 112). Under the Athenian
                    naval confederacy, Paros paid the highest tribute of all the islands subject to
                    Athens,—30 talents annually, according to the assessment of Olymp. 88, 4 (429
                    B.C.). Little is known of the constitution of Paros, but inscriptions seem to
                    show that it was democratic, with a senate <hi rend="italic">(Boule)</hi> at the
                    head of affairs <hi rend="italic">(Corpus Inscript.,</hi> 2376-2383; Ross, <hi
                    rend="italic">Pnscr. Ined.,</hi> ii. 147,148). In 410 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> the Athenian general Theramenes found an oligarchy at Paros; he
                    deposed it and restored the democracy (Diod. Sic., xiii. 47). Paros was
                    included,in the new Athenian confederacy of 378 B.C., but afterwards, along with
                    Chios, it renounced its connexion with Athens, probably about 357 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Thenceforward the island lost its political
                    importance. From the inscription of Adule we learn that the Cyclades, and
                    consequently Paros, were subject to the Ptolemies of Egypt. Afterwards they
                    passed under the rule of Rome. When the Latins made themselves masters of
                    Constantinople, Paros, like the rest, became subject to Venice. In 1537 it was
                    conquered by the Turks. The island now belongs to the kingdom of Greece.</p>
