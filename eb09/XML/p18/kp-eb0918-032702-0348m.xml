                    (1546-1610), a celebrated Jesuit, was the son of a blacksmith, and was born at
                    Nether Stowey, near Bridgwater, England, in 1546. His precocity attracted the
                    attention of the vicar of the parish, who gave him private instruction, and
                    procured his entrance in 1563 as an exhibitioner to Balliol College, Oxford. He
                    graduated B.A. in 1568, and M.A. in 1572. He was fellow, bursar, and dean of his
                    college, but in 1574 he resigned his fellowship and offices, for reasons which
                    have been disputed, some alleging improprieties of conduct, and others suspected
                    disloyalty. Soon after his resignation he went to London, and thence in June to
                    Louvain, where he spent some time in the company of Father William Good, a
                    Jesuit. He then proceeded to Padua to carry out a previously conceived intention
                    to study medicine, but further intercourse with English Jesuits so influenced
                    his mind, that in July 1575 he entered the Jesuit Society at Rome. In 1580 he
                    was selected along with Campian, a former associate at Oxford, and others, to
                    undertake a secret mission to England against Elizabeth. Through the vigilance
                    of Burghley the plot was discovered and Campian arrested, but Parsons made his
                    escape to Rouen, and occupied himself for some time in the composition of
                    treasonable tracts against Elizabeth, which he caused to be secretly sent to
                    England. In 1583 he returned to Rome, where he was appointed prefect of the
                    English mission, and in 1586 chosen rector of the English seminary. He also
                    devoted much energy to the establishment of seminaries elsewhere on the
                    Continent, for the training of priests to be despatched to England to aid in
                    reviving the cause of Romanism. After the disaster to the Spanish Armada in
                    1588, he endeavoured to persuade the Spanish monarch to undertake a second
                    invasion, and, unsuccessful in this, he incited various plots against Elizabeth,
                    all of which were, however, abortive. On the death of Cardinal Allen in 1594 he
                    made strenuous efforts to be appointed his successor, and, failing in this, he
                    retired to Naples until <pb break="no"
