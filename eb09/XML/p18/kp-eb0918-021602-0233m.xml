                    Stretta in the district of Rostino, 25th April 1725. After the hopes of the
                    Corsicans were overthrown by the French in 1738, he accompanied his father to
                    Naples, where he entered the military college. In an expedition against
                    Calabrian bandits he greatly distinguished himself, and when in 1755 he returned
                    to Corsica he had acquired so high a reputation that he was chosen generalissimo
                    in a full assembly of the people. His refusal to accept Matra for a colleague,
                    led the latter to take advantage of the dissatisfaction of some influential
                    Corsicans to stir up an insurrection. With the aid of the Genoese, Matra for a
                    time made a formidable stand, but after his death in battle Paoli turned his
                    arms against the Genoese with such success that in 1761 they proposed terms of
                    peace. As Paoli would consent to nothing less than the complete independence of
                    Corsica, the Genoese, despairing of their ability to establish a hold on the
                    island, sold it in 1768 to France. The French effected a landing in 1769 with
                    22,000 men under Count Vaux, and after a stubborn and prolonged resistance Paoli
                    was totally defeated, and, barely succeeding in cutting his way through the
                    enemy, escaped on board an English frigate and went to England. His rule in
                    Corsica, notwithstanding the distraction of the continual struggle to maintain
                    its independent, had been marked by the introduction of many important reforms,
                    such as the remodelling of the laws, the establishment of permanent courts, the
                    regulation of the coinage, and the furtherance of various measures for the
                    encouragement of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce. At the instance of the
                    duke of Grafton, prime minister of England, Paoli received from the English
                    Government a pension of &lt;£1200 a year. He came to be on intimate terms with
                    Dr Samuel Johnson, to whom he was introduced by Boswell. When, after the French
                    Revolution, Corsica was numbered among the departments of France, Paoli agreed
                    to return to Corsica as lieutenant-general and governor of the department; but,
                    the excesses of the Convention having alienated his sympathies, he, with the
                    help of Great Britain, organized a revolt, and in 1793 was elected generalissimo
                    and president of the council of government at Corte. Despairing, however, of
                    maintaining the independence of the island, he in 1795 agreed to its union with
                    Great Britain, and on George III. being declared king returned to England. He
                    died near London in February 1807. Clemente, elder brother of Pasquale Paoli,
                    also distinguished himself in the struggles of Corsica against the Genoese.
                    Subsequently he retired to a convent at Vallambrosa, but at the end of twenty
                    years returned to Corsica, and died there in 1793.</p>
