                    caravan trade, is described by Strabo (xvi. p. 779) as lying in a level place,
                    well supplied with water for horticulture and other uses, but encircled by a
                    girdle of rocks, abrupt towards the outer side. The surrounding country was
                    barren, especially towards Judaea; the distance from Jericho was three to four
                    days’ journey, and from Phaenicum on the Red Sea coast five (see plate VI., vol.
                    vii.). According to Pliny (W. <hi rend="italic">H.</hi>, vi. 144) the little
                    valley of Petra is not quite 2 miles across, and lies at the junction of two
                    roads, from Palmyra and Gaza respectively, 600 miles from the latter. These and
                    other ancient notices leave no doubt as to the identity of the site with the
                    modern Wády Músá in the mountains which form the eastern wall of the great
                    valley between the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Akaba. Wády Músá lies just north of
                    the watershed between the two seas, in 30° 19' N. lat. and 35° 31' E. long.<note

                    about the caravan-routes in Arabia, gives the latitude, with surprising

                    the characteristic rockcut tombs and dwellings of the Nabataeans begin to
                    appear. But to reach the city proper from these upper settlements one must
                    traverse the whole length of the defile, which is simply a narrow waterway, in
                    some places not more than 10 or 12 feet broad, and walled in by rich brown or
                    red precipices rising from 60 to 120 feet (De Luynes; Stanley doubles this
                    height) above the stream. In ancient times there was a paved path beside the
                    channel, and remains of an arch spanning it are seen high in the air near the
                    entrance. Towards the lower end of the gorge, a turn in the dark path and the
                    descent of a side valley admit a sudden flood of light, and here stands the most
                    famous ruin of Petra, the so-called Khazna, or “treasury of Pharaoh,” with a
                    rich façade of late Roman style, not built but hewn out of the rose-coloured
                    limestone. The next turn gives room for a rock-cut theatre, and from this point
                    the gorge begins to open out into the little plain described by Strabo, and
                    gives perhaps the most striking view of the multiplicity of grottoes with
                    elaborate classical façades which line the enclosing mountain-wall. The plain
                    itself is strewn with ruins of temples and other buildings, and stairs once led
                    up the rocky walls to higher structures, of which the most notable is now called
                    the “convent” (Al-Deir). The grottoes are inhabited in cold weather by the
                    Liyá-thina Felláhín, who also hold the upper part of the valley, and are so
                    troublesome and extortionate that no thorough exploration of the district has
                    yet been carried out. It is not even known where the torrent-bed leads on
                    leaving the plain of Petra. De Luynes describes the water as wholly absorbed by
                    the sands near the theatre, but there is an unexplored gorge to the south-west
                    which is the continuation of the valley.</p>
                <p>The Nabataeans, as we see from Diodorus, used Petra as a place of refuge and a
                    safe storehouse for their treasures of frankincense, myrrh, and silver before
                    they gave up their nomadic habits. But Petra was not only safe and well <pb

                    of trade. The modern pilgrim-road from Damascus to Mecca, which has taken the
                    place of the old incense-route, passes indeed a little to the east by Ma'án. But
                    to touch Petra involves no great detour even on this line, and in ancient times,
                    when Gaza was the great terminus of the Arabian trade, Petra was the place where
                    the Gaza road branched off from that to Bostra, Palmyra, and north Syria. The
                    route from Egypt to Damascus is also commanded by Petra, and from it too there
                    went a great route direct through the desert to the head of the Persian Gulf.
                    Thus Petra became a centre for all the main lines of overland trade between the
                    East and the West, and it was not till the fall of the Nabataean kingdom that
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Palmyra (⅛</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> ,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">.v.)</hi> superseded it as the chief emporium of north Arabia.
                    Many Roman and other foreign merchants were settled here even in the time of
                    Strabo, and he describes the caravans which passed between it and Leuce Come on
                    the Red Sea coast as comparable to armies.</p>

                    'Amman (Mokaddasí, p. 175).</p></note> But Petra had yet another ancient name
                    familiar from the Bible. The Biblical Sela (generally with the article p⅛∏), a
                    city of Edom (2 Kings xiv. 7; Isa. xvi. 1; also Judges i. 36, where E.V. has
                    “the rock”; perhaps also Isa. xlii. 11), appears to be identified with Petra by
                    the LXX., and certainly is so by the <hi rend="italic">Onomastica.</hi> Petra,
                    in fact, or the “rock,” seems to be simply a translation of Sela, but a somewhat
                    loose one,—for the Hebrew name, corresponding to the Arabic SaΓ, is properly a
                    hollow between rocks, just such a place as Petra is. The fortress of Edom,
                    according to Obadiah 3, lay “in the clefts of the Sela,” and seemed impregnable.
                    And that the name of Sela survived the Nabataean occupation is known from Yákút,
                    who places a fortress SaΓ in Wády Músá (comp. Nöldeke in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Z.Ι).MH.,</hi> XXV. 259). Petra, therefore, was a city before theNabataeans,
                    and, occupying one of the few cultivable spots in the district, probably never
                    wholly ceased to be inhabited. This identification disposes of another which was
                    accepted alike by the Jewish and Christian Aramaic versions of the Old
                    Testament, and, passing from the Aramaeans to the Arabs, has given rise to the
                    modern names Fountain and Wády of Moses (comp. Yákút, iv. 879). According to
                    these versions Rkém, Rkám, or more precisely Rkém of Gaiá (that is, Eljí), is
                    Kadesh Barnea, where flowed the waters of Strife or “well of judgment” (Gen.
                    xiv. 7; Num. xx. 1 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> xxvii. 14), where Moses struck
                    the rock. This view is ably supported by Greene <hi rend="italic">(The Hebrew
                    Migration from EgypC)',</hi> others identify Kadesh with 'Ain Kadis (Kudais) on
                    the south border of Judaea.</p>
                <p>Petra survived the fall of the Nabataean kingdom, and indeed most of the
                    buildings may be dated from the 2d and 3d centuries. It appears from coins that
                    Hadrian took it into favour and gave it his name. But Palmyra absorbed its trade
                    with the Persian Gulf, and long before Islam the great incense-route was
                    deserted and left Petra, like the more southern Nabataean city of Egra (Hijr),
                    to fall into ruin. The ruins were an object of curiosity in the Middle Ages, and
                    were visited by Sultan Bibars (Quatremère, Z.c.). The first European to describe
                    them was Burckhardt, and since his time they have often been visited. See the
