                <p>Ashdod was probably the foremost city of the confederation in the time of
                    Philistine supremacy; for it heads the list in 1 Sam. vi. 17, and it was to the
                    temple of Dagon in Ashdod that the ark was brought after the battle of Aphek or
                    Ebenezer (1 Sam. v. 1). Hebrew tradition recognizes the Philistines as
                    immigrants into Canaan within historical times, like the Israelites and the
                    Aramaeans (Amos ix. 7), but unlike the Canaanites. They came, according to Amos,
                    from Caphtor (comp. Jer. xlvii. 4), and Deut. ii. 23 relates that the Caphtorim
                    from Caphtor displaced an earlier race, the 'Avvim, who were not citydwellers
                    like the Canaanites, but lived in scattered villages. The very name of
                    Philistines probably comes from a Semitic root meaning “to wander”; the
                    Septuagint calls them ’Αλλόφυλοι, “aliens.” The date of their immigration cannot
                    be determined with certainty.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>For some Egyptian evidence, see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Phoenicia.</hi></p></note> We are scarcely entitled to take Gen. xxi., xxvi.,
                    as proving that the inhabitants of Gerar in patriarchal times were identical
                    with the later Philistines, and the other references in the Pentateuch and
                    Joshua are equally inconclusive. The first real sign of the presence of the
                    Philistines is when the Danites, who in the time of Deborah were seated on the
                    sea-coast (Judges v. 17), were compelled—obviously by the pressure of a new
                    enemy—to seek another home far north at the base of Mount Hermon (Judges
                    xviii.). This marks the commencement of the period of Philistine aggression,
                    when the foreigners penetrated into the heart of the Israelite country, broke up
                    the old hegemony of Ephraim at the battle of Ebenezer, and again at the battle
                    of Mount Gilboa destroyed the first attempt at a kingdom of all Israel. The
                    highest power of the Philistines was after the death of Saul, when David, who
                    still held Ziklag, and so was still the vassal of Gath, reigned in Hebron, and
                    the house of Saul was driven across the Jordan. But these successes were mainly
                    due to want of union and discipline in Israel, and when David had united the
                    tribes under a new scep⅛e the Philistines were soon humbled. After the division
                    of the kingdom the house of Ephraim appears to have laid claim to the suzerainty
                    over Philistia, for we twice read of a siege of the border fortress of Gibbethon
                    by the northern Israelites (1 Kings xv. 27, xvi. 15); but the Philistines,
                    though now put on the defensive, were able to maintain their independence.
                    Philistia was never part of the land of Israel (2 Kings i. 3, viii. 2; Amos vi.
                    2), and its relations with the Hebrews were embittered by the slave trade, for
                    which the merchants of Gaza carried on forays among the Israelite villages (Amos
                    i. 6). On the other hand, the trading relations between Gaza and Edom (Amos, <hi
                    rend="italic">ut supf</hi> probably imply that in the 8th century Judah, which
                    lay between the two, was open to Philistine commerce (comp. Isa. ii. 6); Judah
                    under Uzziah had reopened the Red Sea trade, of which the Philistine ports were
                    the natural outlet.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    Chronicler, who represents the relations of Judah and Philistia as generally
                    unfriendly, makes Uzziah subdue the latter country as well as Edom, assuming
                    perhaps that he was the fulfiller of the prophecy in Amos i., in which, however,
                    it is the Assyrians who are really pointed to as the ministers of divine
                    justice. The old history has no trace of pretensions of Judah to sovereignty in
                    Philistia till the time of Hezekiah. Comp. Wellhausen, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prolegomena,</hi> p. 217.</p></note> Soon, however, all the Palestinian states
                    fell under the great empire of Assyria, and Tiglath-Pileser, in 734 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> subdued the Philistines as far as Gaza. But the
                    spirit of the race was not easily broken; they were constantly engaged in
                    intrigues with Egypt, and had a share in every conspiracy and revolt against the
                    great king. Of two of these revolts, first against Sargon in 711, and afterwards
                    against Sennacherib on Sargon’s death (705), a memorial is preserved in Isa.

                    was also engaged: it was to him that <pb break="no"

                    was delivered for custody by the rebels. In 701 Sennacherib inarched westward
                    and reduced the rebel cities of Ascalon and Ekron; kinglets faithful to his
                    cause were established in both places, and the territories of these Philistine
                    princes and of those of Gaza and Ashdod were enlarged at the cost of Judah. The
                    Philistine war of Hezekiah spoken of in 2 Kings xviii. 8 was probably undertaken
                    to regain the lost territory after the disaster of Sennacherib’s army. Under
                    Esarhaddon and Assurbanipal the inscriptions still speak of the cities of
                    Philistia as governed by kinglets tributary to Assyria; and, as the power of
                    Nineveh declined and the monarchs of Egypt began to form plans of aggrandizement
                    in Syria, the Philistine fortresses were the first that opposed their advance.
                    According to Herodotus (ii. 157) Psammetichus besieged Ashdod for twenty-nine
                    years, from which we may at least conclude that the Shephelah was the scene of a
                    protracted conflict between the two great powers. The prophecy of Zephaniah ii.
                    4 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> has by some been held to point to these events; but
                    most recent writers prefer to connect it with the invasion of the Scythians, who
                    in the reign of Psammetichus ravaged the Phoenician coast and plundered the
                    famous temple of Aphrodite Urania (Astarte) at Ascalon (Herod., i. 105). The
                    next king of Egypt, Necho, also made war in the Philistine country and smote
                    Gaza (Jer. xlvii.), an event recorded also by Herodotus, who gives to Gaza
                    (Ghazzat, Assyrian Khaziti) the name of Cadytis (Herod., ii. 159, comp. iii.
                    5).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The reference to
                    Necho and Gaza is not in the Septuagint of Jer. xlvii. 1, and it would be more
                    natural to think of C'haldaea as the enemy from the north whom Jeremiah
                    describes.</p></note> Amidst all these calamities Philistia, like the other
                    countries of Syria in the Assyrio-Babylonian period, must have lost great part
                    of its old individuality. The Philistine towns continued to be important, and
                    Gaza in particular became a great seat of international commerce —Herodotus
                    estimates Cadytis as being almost as large as Sardis—but we can hardly speak
                    further of a Philistine people. After the captivity Nehemiah speaks not of
                    Philistines but of Ashdodites (iv. 7), speaking an “Ashdodite” dialect (xiii.
                    24), just as Strabo regards the Jews, the Idumeans, the Gazans, and the
                    Ashdodites as four cognate peoples having the common characteristic of combining
                    agriculture with commerce. In southern Philistia at least the population was
                    modified by Arabian immigration. In the time of Cambyses the Arabs touched the
                    sea immediately south of Gaza (Herod., iii. 5), and this perhaps had something
                    to do with the fact that Gaza was the only Syrian city that resisted Cyrus, just
                    as the Persian and Arab garrison of Gaza offered to Alexander the only
                    resistance that he found on his march from Tyre to Egypt.</p>
                <p>We have still to consider the much-vexed question of the origin of the
                    Philistines. That they were a Semitic or at least a thoroughly Semitized people
                    can now hardly be made matter of dispute. The short list of proper names derived
                    from the Bible has been considerably enlarged from the Assyrian monuments, and
                    suffices to prove that before as after the captivity their language was only
                    dialectically different from that of the Israelites. The religion too was
                    Semitic, and of that older type when the gods were not yet reduced to mere
                    astral powers, but had individual types and special relations to certain
                    animals. Thus Ekron had its local “Fly-Baal” (Baal-Zebub, 2 Kings i. 2 <hi
                    rend="italic">sqf,</hi> the fame of whose oracle in the 9th century B.c.
                    extended as far as Samaria. The more famous Dagon, who had temples at Ashdod (1
                    Sam. v.; 1 Mac. x. 83) and Gaza (Judges xvi. 21 <hi rend="italic">sqf,</hi>
                    seems to have been more than a mere local deity; there was a place called
                    Beth-Dagon in Judaea (Josh. XV. 41) and another on the borders of Asher (Josh.
                    xix. 27). The name Dagon seems to come from JΙ, “fish,” and that his idol was
                    half-man half-fish is pretty clear from 1 Sam. v. 4, where, however, the text is
                    hardly sound, and we ought probably to read, omitting one of two consecutive <hi
                    rend="italic">nuns,</hi> “only his fish-part was left to him.”</p>
                <p>There are two other views about Dagon. (1) Philo Byblius (Müller, <hi
                    rend="italic">Fr. Hist. Graec.,</hi> iii. 567 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> makes
                    Dagon the inventor of corn and the plough, whence he was called Ze&lt;&gt;s
                    ’Apórpios. This implies an etymology of a very improbable kind from the Hebrew
                    and Phoenician pT, “corn.” But it is probable that, at least in later times,
                    Dagon had in place of, or in addition to, his old character that of the god who
                    presided over agriculture; for in the last days of paganism, as we learn from
                    Marcus Diaconus in the <hi rend="italic">Life of Porphyry of Gaza</hi> (§ 19),
                    the great god of Gaza, now known as Marna (our Lord), was regarded as the god of
                    rains and invoked against famine. That Marna was lineally descende&lt;l from
                    Dagon is probable in every way, and it is therefore interesting to note that he
                    gave oracles, that he had a circular temple, where he was sometimes worshipped
                    by human sacrifices, that there were wells in the sacred circuit, and that there
                    was also a place of adoration to him situated, in old Semitic fashion, outside
                    the town. Certain “marmora” in the temple, which might not be approached,
                    especially by women, may perhaps be connected with the threshold which the
                    priests of Dagon would not touch with their feet (1 Sam. v. 5; Zeph. i. 9). (2)
                    Schrader <hi rend="italic">(K. A. T.,</hi> 2ded., p. 181 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.)</hi> identifies Dagon with the Assyrian god Dakan, and believes that the
                    word is Accadian. We are here in a region of pure conjecture; the attributes of
                    Dakan are unknown, save only that Berosus speaks of an Assyrian mermangod <hi
                    rend="italic">Ώδάκων.</hi></p>
                <p>To the male god Dagon answers in the Bible the female deity Ashtoreth, whose
                    temple spoken of in 1 Sam. xxxi. 10 is probably the ancient temple at Ascalon,
                    which Herodotus regarded as the oldest seat of the worship of Aphrodite Urania.
                    This Ashtoreth is the Derketo of Diodorus (ii. 4) and Lucian <hi rend="italic"

                    with sacred pools and fish was common in Syria, and the sacred doves of Ascalon
                    mentioned by Philo (ed. Mangey, ii. 646) belong to the same worship.<note

                    shortened form of a name in which the second element was that of a god; but such
                    Phoenician names as Kalbâ (side by side with Kalbêlîm), Hanno, Abdâ or Bodo,
                    &amp;c., show that the shortening does not in the least imply that the divine
                    name was Iahveh.</p></note> Their gods were carried into battle (2 Sam. v. 21),
                    a usage found among other Semites; their skill in divination is alluded to in
                    Isa. ii. 6, and we have already seen that oracles were a feature in their
                    shrines. The whole record shows a religion characteristically Semitic in type;
                    and it is also noteworthy that at the earliest date when the Philistines appear
                    in history the great sanctuaries are all on the coast with deities of a marine
                    type. This raises a presumption that the Philistines came from over the sea, and
                    that Caphtor, their original home, was an island or maritime country.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The expression “isle” (or
                    coastland, Hebrew <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi> X) of Caphtor in Jer. xlvii.
                    is generally cited as conclusive to this effect; but in the context it is by no
                    means clear that it means anything more than the coastland of
                    Philistia.</p></note> In point of fact the Philistines must have entered their
                    later seats either by sea or from the desert between Canaan and Egypt. In the
                    latter case they come from Egypt, for a city-building people, which supplanted a
                    race of villagers, cannot have been a tribe of Arabs. And so the theories about
                    the origin of the Philistines reduce themselves to two, one class of writers
                    holding that Caphtor must be sought across the Mediterranean, another placing it
                    in the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n792/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0792-0757"/> Delta. Ancient tradition gives no help; for it
                    takes Caphtor to be Cappadocia, led, it would seem, merely by a superficial
                    similarity of the names. Of the two main theories the former is that which has
                    recently found most support, and it has a definite point of attachment in the
                    fact that the Philistines, or apart of them, are also called in the Bible
                    Cherethites (1 Sam. xxx. 14; Ezek. xxv. 16; Zeph. ii. 5), while David’s
                    Philistine guards are in like manner called the Cherethites and Pelethites (2
                    Sam. viii. 18, xv. 18, &amp;c.). Cherethites (Krêtïm) can hardly be anything but
                    Cretans, as the LXX. actually renders it in Ezekiel and Zephaniah, and Caphtor
                    would thus be the island of Crete, —an identification which seems to satisfy the
                    conditions of a reasonable hypothesis. For, though the points of contact between
                    Crete or Cretan religion and the Philistine coast which have been sought in
                    Greek and Latin writers (chiefly in Steph. Byzant., <hi rend="italic">s.v.</hi>
                    “Gaza ”) are very shadowy, there is no doubt that Crete had an early connexion
                    with Phoenicia and received many Semitic inhabitants and a Semitic civilization
                    before the Greeks gradually asserted themselves in the Aegean and forced back
                    the tide of Semitic influence (for details, see the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Phoenicia).</hi> These facts give a reasonable explanation of the settlement on
                    the Philistine coast within historical times of a maritime people, cognate to
                    the Phoenicians in so many points and yet having certain distinct characters,
                    such as would naturally be produced in a place like Crete by the grafting of a
                    Semitic stock and culture on ruder races not Semitic (the Eteocretans).<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In 2 Sam. xx. 23, Ktïb, and 2
                    Kings xi. 4, 19, the foreign mercenaries are called not Krethinι but Kãrî,
                    perhaps Carians. The Carian seamen and pirates had also a strong Semitic strain,
                    and were at bottom the same race with the Eteocretans.</p></note> The opposite
                    view, which places Caphtor in the Delta, rests on more complicated but less
                    satisfactory arguments. There were certainly many Semites in the Delta of Egypt,
                    and so long as the history of the Hyksos (who were no doubt Semites) remains in
                    its present obscurity it is always possible to suppose that their expulsion from
                    Egypt explains the settlement of the Philistines in Canaan. But it is very
                    questionable if the dates will fit; the name Caphtor is connected with the Delta
                    by no historical testimony, but only by elaborate hypotheses, as that Caphtor
                    may mean in Egyptian Great Phoenicia, and that this again may have been a name
                    for the Egyptian coast, where there was a large Semitic population;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>So Ebers, <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">Mosis,</hi> where the theory is supported by a very long and
                    complex argument. Another etymology in support of the theory is given by
                    Dietrich in <hi rend="italic">Merx’s</hi><hi rend="italic">Archiv,</hi> i. 313

                    peculiarity of uncircumcision, intelligible enough on the Cretan theory, is
                    scarcely conceivable in a race which had been long settled in Egypt. The
                    mainstay of the Egyptian hypothesis is found in Gen. X. 13, 14,—verses which
                    belong to the older part of the chapter (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Noah),</hi>
                    and reckon in the very obscure list of descendants of Mizraim or Egypt “Casluhim
                    (whence came forth Philistini) and Caphtorim.” This account places Caphtorim in
                    some relation to Egypt, but not necessarily in a very close relation, for the
                    Ludim, who are also made descendants of Egypt, are scarcely different from Lud
                    or Lydia, which appears at ver. 22, in the later part of the chapter, in another
                    connexion. But further, if the text as it stands is sound, it gives a nèw
                    account of the origin of the Philistines, which can be reconciled with the other
                    Biblical evidence only by making Casluhim a halting-place of the Philistines on
                    their way from Caphtor to Canaan. Accordingly the advocates of the Egyptian
                    theory propose to identify Casluhim with the arid district of Mount Casius on
                    the coast of the Egyptian desert. But this is false etymology. Mount Casius is
                    named from the temple of Jupiter Casius, that is, the well-known Semitic</p>

                    letters has no possible affinity to Casluhim. And in truth the statement that
                    the Philistines came from Casluhim, presented without a hint as to their
                    connexion with Caphtorim, which is mentioned immediately afterwards, lies under
                    strong suspicion of being a gloss, originally set on the margin by a copyist who
                    meant it to refer to Caphtorim.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
