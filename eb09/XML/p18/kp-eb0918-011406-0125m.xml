                <p><label type="entry">PACIFIC OCEAN</label></p>
                <p>THE ancient world was ignorant of the existence of the vast expanse of water now
                    known as the Pacific Ocean. In Ptolemy’s map of the world, constructed in the 2d
                    century of our era (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Map,</hi> vol. xv. Pl. VII.), this
                    fact is clearly brought out, for the only space which might possibly represent
                    the Pacific is the Magnus Sinus, a sea so limited in extent, and represented in
                    such a position, that it probably stands for the Gulf of Siam in the Indian
                    Ocean.</p>
                <p>Vague reports of a great ocean lying beyond China were current in Europe as early
                    as the period of Arabian supremacy in learning. Indeed an Arab merchant named

                    declared that he had sailed upon it. But for several hundred years the reports
                    continued so uncertain, and were so loaded with the wild extravagance of
                    travellers’ tales of the period, that it is difficult to get at the facts from
                    which they probably took their origin. During the 13th and 14th centuries Marco
                    Polo arid his successors travelled far to the East and came to an ocean of the
                    extent of which they were ignorant, but they partially explored its western
                    coasts. The East was the region towards which all the commerce and enterprise of
                    the Middle Ages tended, and it was the hope of finding a safer and shorter sea
                    route to India that led the Spanish court in 1492 to furnish Columbus with a
                    fleet for the exploration of the Western Ocean. Although convinced of the
                    spherical form of the earth, he greatly under-rated its size, and, accepting the
                    popular estimate of the great breadth of the Asiatic continent, he set out on
                    his voyage confident of soon reaching “the Indies.” The glowing descriptions of
                    his discoveries in that strange new world of the West that' rose up before him
                    to bar his advance immediately attracted the attention of adventurous Spanish
                    mariners. Headed by Columbus himself, they cruised intrepidly amongst the
                    Caribbean Islands, still lured by the hope of discovering some western passage
                    to the coveted East. Columbus found that what he at first considered a
                    labyrinthine archipelago was a continent of vast extent, but not Asia, and he
                    died without knowing what lay beyond. Spain and Portugal were the rival maritime
                    powers at that time, and both took up the search for new countries with great
                    ardour. Pope Alexander VI., in 1493, fearing that the two nations would quarrel
                    over their colonies, assigned all the new lands that might be discovered west of
                    the Azores to Spain, and all east of those islands to Portugal. The Portuguese
                    accepting the gift followed Vasco da Gama in opening up the road to India by the
                    Cape of Good Hope, and pushed forward their trading and piratical excursions
                    into the west Pacific far beyond the Spice Islands. The Spaniards confined
                    themselves to the New World, visiting, naming, and plundering the West India
                    Islands and the headlands of Central America. On the 29th of September 1513
                    Vasco Nunez de Balbao, the leader of a Spanish party exploring the Isthmus of
                    Panama, saw, from the summit of a mountain, a vast ocean stretching to the
                    west—the very ocean of whose existence Columbus was certain, and which he had so
                    long tried vainly to discover. Because he first saw it on Michaelmas day, Balbao
                    named it the <hi rend="italic">Golfo de San Miguel.</hi> Magellan, following the
                    east coast of America farther to the south than any previous explorer, sailed
                    on, in spite of terrific storms, until he found the strait which now bears his
                    name, and, steering carefully through it, on the 27th of November 1520 he swept
                    into the calm waters of that new sea on which he was the first to sail, and
                    which he named the <hi rend="italic">Mar Pacifico.</hi></p>
                <p>The victories of Cortez in Mexico about the same date opened the way for the
                    exploration of the west coast of America, where Pizarro’s conquest of Peru in
                    1526 gave the Spaniards a firm footing. From this time an intermittent trade
                    sprang up between Europe and the Pacific through Magellan Strait, and latterly
                    round Cape Horn. Before long English fleets, attracted more by the prospects of
                    plundering Spanish galleons than of discovering new territories, found their way
                    into the Pacific. Sir Francis Drake, like Balbao, saw the ocean from the Isthmus
                    of Panama. He entered the Pacific in September 1577, being the first Englishman
                    to sail upon it; some months later he sailed across it to the Moluccas. Alvaro
                    de Mardana, who preceded him, had discovered the Solomon Islands in 1567.</p>
                <p>Tasman, Roggewein, Dampier, and other explorers of the 17 th century discovered
                    Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, and many smaller groups of islands. During the
                    18th century the voyages of Anson, Bass, Behring, the two Bougainvilles,
                    Broughton, Byron, Cook, La Pérouse, and many more practically completed the
                    geographical exploration of the Pacific Ocean. In the beginning of that century
                    the Pacific had a curious fascination for commercial speculators, and the
                    ill-fated Scottish colony founded at Darien in 1698 seemed only to prepare the
                    way for the English South Sea bubble that burst in 1720. All the navigators who
                    explored these seas believed in the existence of a north-west passage between
                    the Atlantic and Pacific, and made attempts to find it; but its discovery
                    baffled all enterprise until 1850, when Maclure proved that there was such a
                    channel, but that the ice prevented its being of any commercial utility. In the
                    present century D’Entrecasteaux, Krusenstern, Beechy, Fitzroy, and Bennet have
                    taken the lead amongst geographical.explorers in the Pacific, although the ranks
                    contain many names scarcely less worthy of remembrance. Within recent years
                    several purely scientific exploring expeditions and British surveying vessels
                    have examined the Pacific, investigating its depth, the nature and form of the
                    bottom, the temperature of the water at various depths and its density, as well
                    as the marine fauna and flora. Of those expeditions the voyages of the
                    “Challenger,” “Gazelle,” and “Tuscarora” are the most important.<note

                    followed by trading vessels in the Pacific are three :—(1) round Cape Horn and
                    along the South American coast—the . great rush to California on the discovery
                    of gold in 1847 led to the establishment of lines of fast clippers by this route
                    and of steamers from Panama to San Francisco; (2) from San Francisco to China a

                    Australia to San Francisco in 1873 and to ’Panama in 1866. The trade with the
                    Pacific will no doubt be greatly increased when the Panama ship-canal is opened
                    for traffic.</p></note><hi rend="italic">Extent.—</hi> The Pacific Ocean<note

                    of Russia and Alaska, on the E. by the west coasts of North and South America;
                    on the S. the imaginary line of the Antarctic Circle divides it from the
                    Antarctic Ocean, while its western boundary is the east coast of Australia, the
                    Malay Archipelago separating it from the Indian Ocean, and the eastern coasts of
                    the Chinese empire. Some modern geographers place the southern limit of the
                    Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans at the 40th parallel, and name the body of
                    water which surrounds the earth between that latitude and the Antarctic Circle
                    the Southern Ocean.</p>
                <p>Although differing from the Atlantic in its general form, being more nearly
                    land-locked to the north, the Pacific resembles it in being open to the south,
                    forming, in fact, a great projection northwards of that vast southern ocean of
                    which the Atlantic is another arm.</p>
                <p>The Pacific is the largest expanse of water in the world, covering more than a
                    quarter of its superficies, and comprising fully one-half of its water surface.
                    It extends through 132 degrees of latitude, in other words, it measures 9000
                    miles from north to south. From east to west its breadth varies from about 40
                    miles at Behring Strait, where Asia and America come within sight of each other,
                    to 8500 miles between California and China on the Tropic of Cancer, and to more
                    than 10,000 miles on the Equator between Quito and the Moluccas, where the ocean
                    is widest. The area has been variously estimated at from 50,000,000 to
                    100,000,000 square miles; but,defining its boundaries as above, Keith Johnston,
                    from careful measurements, estimated it, with probably a near approach to the
                    truth, at 67,810,000 square miles.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Coasts, Seas, &lt;l·c.—</hi> The coast-line of the Pacific and
                    Indian Oceans, taken together, only amounts to 47,000 miles; that of the
                    Atlantic alone measures 55,000, the smaller ocean more than making up for its
                    less extent by its numerous inland seas and inlets of smaller size. Speaking
                    broadly, the eastern boundary of the Pacific is rugged, barren, mountainous, and
                    singularly free from indentations, while its western shores are low, fertile,
                    and deeply indented with gulfs and partially enclosed seas. Behring Strait
                    unites the Arctic Ocean with the Sea of Kamchatka, or Behring Sea, which is
                    bounded on the east by the irregular, low, swampy shores of Alaska, and on the
                    south by the Alaskan peninsula and the Aleutian Islands. Along British North
                    America the coast is rugged, rocky, considerably indented, and, between the
                    parallels of 50° and 60° N. lat., fringed with islands. The largest of these are
                    Vancouver Island in the Gulf of Georgia, Queen Charlotte Island, Prince of Wales
                    Island, and the islands of King George III.’s Archipelago. The Gulf of
                    California runs northwards in the Mexican coast, reaching from 23° to 32° N.
                    lat. It is the one important inlet on the whole west coast of America,—the only
                    others which are worth naming being the Gulf of Panama and the Gulf of
                    Guayaquil. The Mexican shore is low, and contrasts with the coasts to the north
                    and to the south, which are generally steep and rocky, though there are
                    occasional sandy beaches in Peru and Chili. The breadth of the plain between the
                    Rocky Mountains and the sea gradually diminishes towards the south, and the
                    mountain chain of the Andes runs close along the west coast of South America to
                    the very extremity of the continent.</p>
                <p>A series of volcanoes, active and extinct, runs round the Pacific, commencing at
                    Cape Horn, passing along the Andes and Rocky Mountains, crossing from the
                    American continent by the Aleutian Islands to Kamchatka, and thence southwards
                    by Japan and the East Indian Archipelago to New Zealand. Earthquakes are
                    frequent all along this line.</p>
                <p>There are few islands near the American coast north of Patagonia, and these are
                    small and unimportant; but south of the 40th parallel there is a complete
                    change. The end of the continent seems as if it had been shattered; there are
                    abrupt bays and jagged chasms; archipelagos of small islands rise up in
                    splintered fragments along the shore. The Strait of Magellan forms a tortuous
                    channel between the mainland and the rocky storm-beaten islands of Tierra del
                    Fuego.</p>
                <p>The coast-line on the Asiatic side is longer and greatly diversified. In the
                    north the Sea of Okhotsk is cut off from Behring Sea by the peninsula of
                    Kamchatka, from the extremity of which a chain of islands extends to the borders
                    of the Antarctic Ocean. These islands are of all sizes, ranging from small
                    islets to the island continent of Australia. The island chain hangs in loops
                    along the Asiatic coast, each loop including an almost land-locked sea. These
                    partially enclosed seas are more or less completely cut off from the general
                    oceanic circulation, and they consequently differ considerably from the open
                    ocean as regards the temperature of the water, specific gravity, fauna and
                    flora, and nature of the deposits. The Kurile Islands run from Kamchatka to
                    Japan, cutting off the Sea of Okhotsk. The great Japanese Islands, with
                    Saghalien to the north and the Chinese coast on the west, enclose the Sea of
                    Japan, leaving it in communication with the Sea of Okhotsk by the Channel of
                    Tartary to the north, with the ocean on the west by the Straits of La Pérouse
                    and Sangar, and on the south by the Straits of Corea. The Yellow Sea runs into
                    the Chinese coast, and is divided from the Sea of Japan by the peninsula of
                    Corea. The China Sea, with the two great gulfs of Tonquin and Siam, is marked
                    off from the Indian Ocean by the peninsula of Malacca—remarkable because it runs
                    in the same direction as the other two peninsulas of the Pacific, Kamchatka and
                    Corea—and the islands of Sumatra and Java, while Borneo and the Philippine
                    Islands separate it from the Pacific. Between the south coast of China and the
                    north of Australia the East Indian Archipelago cuts up the ocean into a network
                    of small seas and narrow channels. The seas are named the Celebes, the Banda,
                    the Sulu, the Java, the Flores, and the Arafura. The more important of the sea
                    passages between the islands are the Straits and Channel of Formosa, which lead
                    northward from the Pacific to the China Sea; the Strait of Macassar between
                    Borneo and Celebes; Molucca Passage between Celebes, the Moluccas, and Jilolo;
                    and Torres Strait between New Guinea and Australia. The east coast of Australia
                    is, as a rule, steep and rocky; there are few inlets, and none of them compare
                    in size with the Gulf of Carpentaria on the north coast. Moreton Bay and Port
                    Jackson are two of the best harbours, and as a haven the latter has few equals
                    in the world. The Great Barrier Reef lies off this coast for a length of more
                    than a thousand miles, the distance between it and the shore varying from 60 to
                    100 miles. Bass Strait separates Australia from Tasmania on the south; and the
                    two main islands of New Zealand, separated by Cook Strait, lie to the southeast
                    of the continent. The Gulf of Hauraki, the Bay of Plenty, and Pegasus Bay are
                    the chief inlets in these islands.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">River-System.—</hi> The drainage area of the Pacific Ocean is
                    estimated at 8,660,000 square miles, while that of the Atlantic amounts to more
                    than 19,000,000; the chief reason for this disparity is that only half a million
                    square miles of the American continent are drained into the Pacific, the
                    remaining six and a half millions being connected with the Atlantic
                    river-system, and it is estimated that only one-seventh of the area of the
                    Asiatic continent drains into the Pacific Ocean. The huge wall of the Andes
                    practically reduces the Pacific rivers of South America to the rank of mountain
                    streams; the Biobio and the Maypu in Chili are the only ones exceeding 100 miles
                    in length,— the former having a course of 180, the latter of 160 miles. The
                    Rocky Mountain chain, which forms the watershed of North America, runs parallel
                    to the Pacific coast at a distance of about 1000 miles, and the Cascade and
                    minor ranges which skirt the shore are broken through in several places to give
                    passage to rivers that are, in some cases, of considerable size. The Colorado
                    rises in the State of that name, at the base of the Rocky Mountains, flows
                    southwest through Utah and Arizona, and falls into the head of the Gulf of
                    California. Its course measures about 1100 miles, and it drains a rugged and
                    barren area of 170,000 square miles. California has only one river, the
                    Sacramento, 420 miles long. The Oregon (or Columbia) is formed by the union of
                    two streams rising in the Rocky Mountains, one in British Columbia, the other in
                    Idaho. It is a swift-flowing river, full of rapids and cataracts, and, though it
                    is only 750 miles long, the area which it drains is greater by one-seventh than
                    that drained by the Colorado. The ebb and flow of the tide are perceptible for a
                    hundred miles from the mouth of the Oregon, and the river is navigable for that
                    distance. The Frazer, which has a length of 600 miles, flows southward through
                    British Columbia from the Rocky Mountains, and enters the sea in the Gulf of
                    Georgia opposite Vancouver Island, carrying off the rainfall of 98,000 square
                    miles. The northern limit of the American mountain chains is marked by the rise
                    of the great river Yukon, which traverses Alaska; and, after a run of more than
                    2000 miles, it enters <pb break="no"

                    Its tributaries have not been fully explored, so the area which they intersect
                    is unknown, but probably it is very large.</p>
                <p>The Asiatic division of the Pacific river-system is very much more extensive than
                    the American, and includes many streams of great size and of considerable
                    commercial importance. In the north the Amur is more than 2000 miles long, and
                    it receives many tributaries, which rise on the north in the Stanovoi mountains,
                    and on the west and south on the borders of the great table-land of the Gobi,
                    the central Asiatic desert; altogether its basin measures nearly 900,000 square
                    miles. The Hoang-ho (Hwang-ho or Whang-ho) and the Yangtze-keang both rise near
                    the Kuen-lun mountains of Tibet amongst the extensive terraces which form the
                    eastern slope of the great table-land of Central Asia. The Hoang ho has a length
                    of 2600 miles, and in its course it sweeps in a northerly curve close to the
                    In-Shan mountains; then, after being crossed repeatedly by the Great Wall of
                    China, it turns sharply to the south, and finally runs due east into the Yellow
                    Sea. The Yangtze-keang follows a southward direction from its source, but
                    ultimately turns to the north-east and enters the Yellow Sea not far from the
                    mouth of the Hoang-ho. It is one of the longest rivers in the world, for,
                    including its windings, it measures 3200 miles from its source to the sea. These
                    two rivers drain more than a million and a quarter square miles; and it is
                    principally owing to the large amount of suspended matter which they carry down
                    that the sea into which they fall is called the Yellow Sea. The other rivers of
                    importance are the Choo-keang, the Mekong, and the Menam. The last two run into
                    the Gulf of Siam, after watering the peninsula of Siam and Cochin China. Few
                    rivers enter the Pacific on the east coast of Australia, and in consequence of
                    the proximity of the mountains to the shore they are short and unimportant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Atmospheric Pressure and Prevailing Winds.—</hi> When the mean
                    atmospheric pressure for the year over the entire surface of the world is
                    considered, it is found that there are two broad belts of high pressure which
                    encircle the globe, one on each side of the equator. There is a wide area of
                    slowly diminishing pressure between them, including a narrow central band along
                    which the barometric readings attain a minimum. Two other regions of low
                    pressure surround the poles, and extend to a considerable distance. That around
                    the North Pole is connected with an area of still lower pressure over the North
                    Pacific, and there is another permanent depression, which is even deeper, in the
                    vicinity of Iceland. Atmospheric pressure is the fundamental meteorological
                    phenomenon, and the mean pressure for the year affords a clue to the cause of
                    all such regular and continuous phenomena as trade winds and ocean currents, and
                    to the distribution of temperature. Similarly a study of the isobars at
                    different seasons throws light upon all periodical occurrences in the way of
                    winds and currents.</p>
                <p>A low barometer is always accompanied by a high percentage of atmospheric aqueous
                    vapour; consequently the equatorial belt of continuous low pressure is a region
                    of almost continuous rain, excessive cloud, and constant calm or light variable
                    winds. The effect of a difference in atmospheric pressure being established
                    between two places is to produce a flow of air from the region of high towards
                    that of low pressure, and the winds in their turn largely determine the surface
                    movements or drift currents of the ocean. The region of calms between the north
                    and south trades in the Pacific is both narrower, more irregular, and less
                    clearly marked than the corresponding belt in the Atlantic. In the East Pacific
                    it lies, at all seasons, considerably north of the equator; but during the
                    southern summer it is found south of the line in the western parts of the ocean,
                    and disappears entirely in the northern summer, as the calms of the Indian Ocean
                    do also. The reason of the southern position of the west end of the calm belt
                    seems to be the simultaneous occurrence of low atmospheric pressure in the
                    interior of Australia and an exceptionally high barometer in Asia. In the
                    southern winter the depression over Asia and the increase of pressure over
                    Australia form an unbroken barometric gradient, and the result is that the calms
                    are replaced by a southerly breeze of great regularity. The region of calms
                    included between the zones of the two trade winds, and towards which they blow,
                    is not the only one with which they are associated; for the opposite
                    meteorological conditions that characterize the northern border of the
                    north-east trades and the southern margin of the southeast winds produce two
                    fringing bands of calms. These regions are characterized by a high barometer, a
                    sunny sky, and occasionally sudden squalls,—contrasting with the depressed
                    barometer and dull, wet weather of the equatorial region. In January the low
                    atmospheric pressure over the North Pacific produces winds which affect the
                    climatological conditions of the shores in very different ways. At Vancouver
                    Island the prevailing wind is southwest, and consequently the winter on the
                    shores of British Columbia is mild and moist. The opposite coast of Asia is
                    visited during the same season by northerly winds,— north-east in Alaska,
                    north-north-east in Kamchatka, and north-west in Japan; and, as a result, the
                    weather in these regions in winter is dry and bitterly cold. The West Pacific
                    and the Indian Ocean are the regions of monsoons,— winds that blow as steadily
                    as the trades, but which change their direction with the season. During the
                    periods of transition the steady breeze gives place to variable winds,
                    occasional calms, and sometimes terrific hurricanes. The general direction of
                    the monsoons in the Pacific between April and October is southerly and
                    south-easterly, and from November to April they blow from the north-east, and on
                    nearing the continent of Asia from the north-west. Monsoonal winds are found
                    connected with all continents; they are produced by the great differences in the
                    temperature and pressure which prevail over the land at different seasons as
                    compared with the adjacent ocean. The monsoons give rise to oceanic currents
                    which flow in the same direction as the wind, and like it run opposite ways
                    during alternate half years. Although the velocity of the wind over the open sea
                    is always greater than that near shore or on land, it was shown by the
                    observations of the “Challenger,” in the Pacific and other oceans, that there is
                    no distinct diurnal variation in the wind’s force at sea, though very decided
                    periods of maxima and minima were noticed in the vicinity of land (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Meteorology,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 125).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Currents.—</hi> The system of surface circulation in the
                    Pacific is much more complicated and less clearly defined than that in the
                    Atlantic, as might be expected from the less constant character of the winds.
                    The latter ocean has two wide channels of communication with the Arctic Sea,
                    while, so far as currents are concerned, the Pacific is landlocked to the
                    north—Behring Strait being narrow and shallow; consequently water enters the
                    Pacific almost entirely from the south, where there is uninterrupted
                    communication with the Antarctic Ocean. There is no direct information as to the
                    movements of ocean water at depths greater than 200 or 300 fathoms; it is known,
                    however, from indirect evidence, that movements do occur. Although the subject
                    of undercurrents at depths less than those just mentioned has been extensively
                    studied, it is only with respect to surface currents that anything very definite
                    is as yet known.</p>

                <p>The vast extent of the Pacific Ocean gives full scope for the current-producing
                    action of tides and winds, while the smooth continental boundary on its eastern
                    side, the numerous groups of islands which break its surface, and its indented
                    western coast, combine to modify the direction of the main streams and to
                    produce innumerable minor currents, some permanent, and others varying from time
                    to time in velocity and direction. The chief cause of these currents is believed
                    to be traceable to the direct or indirect action of wind; but here it is
                    proposed to refer merely to their general geography and physical effects,
                    without discussing the theory of their formation.</p>
                <p>A general surface drift of the cold waters of the Antarctic Ocean, having a
                    temperature lower than 40° Fahr, at all seasons, bears north-east towards Cape
                    Horn, where it divides into two branches; one, the Cape Horn current, passes on
                    into the Atlantic, and the other sweeps northward along the west coast of South
                    America until it strikes the Peruvian shore, which deflects it westward. The
                    cooling effect of this current on the water all along the coast is illustrated
                    very clearly by the abrupt northward turn of the isothermals (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Meteorology,</hi> figs. 8 and 9), which is more conspicuous in
                    the chart for the southern winter than in that for the summer. In summer,
                    however, there is a more striking evidence of this current’s cooling power to be
                    seen in the arrangement of the isothermals. The northern line of 70° Fahr,
                    reaches as far south as 18° N. lat., and that of 80° makes a short loop from 18°
                    N. to the equator; but the southern isothermal of 80° does not touch the
                    American coast at all, and that of 70° lies farther from the equator than 30° S.
                    lat., so that the increase of temperature from the south is very gradual; so
                    much so that at the Galapagos Islands, under the equator, the temperature of the
                    surface water is only 70°, while a few hundred miles to the west it is over 80°.
                    Penguins—essentially Antarctic birds—are found living on the shores of these
                    islands. In consequence of this current, the highest surface temperature at all
                    seasons of the year is found distinctly io the north of the equator in the
                    eastern Pacific.</p>
                <p>The Peruvian current forms the southern fork of the great equatorial current,
                    which runs due west. This current is very broad, and divided by a narrow
                    countercurrent flowing in an opposite direction through its centre. The two
                    branches of the equatorial current occupy very approximately the two areas of
                    falling barometer between the north and south belts of high pressure and the
                    central trough of minimum barometric readings. This difference of atmospheric
                    pressure on each side produces the northeast and south-east trade winds, and to
                    these the current probably owes its regularity and constant direction. The
                    counter-current lies in the narrow belt of low barometric pressure to which the
                    trades blow, and probably originates from the banking up of the waters to the
                    westward. Its rate and position consequently vary greatly at different times of
                    the year. The “Challenger,” on her cruise between the Sandwich and Society
                    Islands, found these currents to run with considerable force. In the “Narrative”
                    of the cruise (chap, xviii.) the fact is alluded to thus :—</p>
                <p>“From Hawaii Island to the 10th parallel the direction of the current was
                    westerly, and its average velocity 18 miles per day, ranging from 10 to 23
                    miles. From the 10th to the 6th parallel the direction was easterly, and its
                    average velocity 31 miles per day, ranging from 7 to 54 miles per day. From the
                    6th parallel of north latitude to the 10th parallel of south latitude the
                    direction was again westerly, and the average velocity 35 miles per day, ranging
                    from 17 to 70 miles per day. From thence to Tahiti the general tendency of the
                    current was westerly, but its velocity was variable. The axis of greatest
                    velocity of the counter-equatorial current was between the 7th and 8th parallels
                    of north latitude. The axis of greatest velocity of the equatorial current was
                    on the parallel of 2° north, where its speed amounted to 3 miles per hour.”</p>
                <p>The equatorial current strikes on the East Indian Archipelago, where it is split
                    up by the narrow channels and shallow waters, and diverted into numberless minor
                    currents. The two main divisions, which have acquired a high temperature from
                    prolonged exposure to the tropical sun, ultimately leave the archipelago; the
                    southern arm curves southwards, carrying its warm water to the east coast of
                    Australia and to New Zealand, whence it is diverted towards the east, and
                    becomes merged again in the general north-easterly antarctic drift. The north
                    equatorial current, which varies in volume and velocity with the monsoons,
                    strikes the coast of Asia between the Philippines and Japan, and is deflected in
                    a north-easterly direction as the Kuro-Siwo or Japan current—wholly a warm
                    oceanic river during the S.E. monsoon similar to the Gulf Stream of the
                    Atlantic. The Japan current sends many branches into the inland seas and
                    channels of the north-eastern coast of Asia, but the main body of water flows
                    northward until it bifurcates in 40° N. lat., sending one fork among the Kurile
                    Islands and along the Kamchatka peninsula into Behring Sea, whence it escapes by
                    Behring Strait into the Arctic Ocean. A small counter-current of arctic water
                    flows southward through Behring Sea, but it is not of sufficient volume to make
                    its influence felt very decidedly on the general temperature of the surface
                    water in the vicinity. The second and larger branch of the Japan current crosses
                    the North Pacific, and, curving southward by Alaska and British Columbia, part
                    of it returns as the north equatorial current, while the rest forms the variable
                    Mexican current that runs along the coasts of California and Mexico.</p>
                <p>The general direction of surface circulation in the Pacific may be remembered by
                    supposing the ocean divided into a northern and southern half by the equatorial
                    counter-current. In the northern half the water circulates in the direction of
                    the hands of a watch, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it passes up the west coast
                    and down the east, while in the southern half the rotation is in the opposite
                    direction—down the west coast and up the east; but the latter half does not
                    exhibit the complete cycle so distinctly as the former. The centre of each area
                    of circulation is occupied by a small Sargasso Sea, the northern being the more
                    clearly defined, but neither approaches the well-known Sargasso Sea of the North
                    Atlantic either in definiteness, extent, or amount of weed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Temperature, of Surface Water.—</hi> The distribution of
                    temperature in the surface water of the Pacific varies considerably during the
                    year. The equatorial region is of course comparatively little affected by the
                    change of season, but there is a general rise of temperature in the northern
                    parts of the ocean, and a fall in the southern, during the northern summer, and
                    a similar rise in the south and fall in the north during winter. The charts
                    exhibit a general northward move in the isothermals during the former season,
                    and a southward tendency in the latter. The change in the position of the lines
                    is greatest in the temperate zones. The charts of ocean surface temperature (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Meteorology,</hi> figs. 8, 9) for February and August show
                    the direction of the isothermals at two opposite seasons; and reference to them
                    will make it plain that in temperate regions the lines of equal temperature
                    follow the parallels of latitude much more closely in the Pacific than in the
                    Atlantic, while their displacement with the change of season takes place in a
                    direction nearly north and south. There are notable instances of divergence from
                    these rules, such as the peculiarity of the isothermal of 80° already alluded
                    to. Another circumstance is the fact that the temperature of the surface water
                    on the western side of a great continent is much lower than that on the eastern
                    side in the same latitude; it seems as if the west side of <pb break="no"

                    them converge towards the equator. It has already been pointed out that these
                    effects are due to the winds and the cold currents which strike the western
                    continental shores and run along the coasts. The surface temperature of the
                    Pacific, between the latitudes of 45° N. and 45° S., nowhere at any season falls
                    below 50°. In August the southern isotherm of <hi rend="italic">50°</hi> remains
                    close to the 50th parallel, not diverging more than a degree or two on either
                    side. Between the 45th parallels and the northern and southern limits of the
                    ocean the temperature is almost always below 50°. The southern isotherm of 40°
                    is remarkable for its constant position all the year round, between latitudes
                    55° and 58°,—a result brought about by the gigantic antarctic icebergs which
                    prevent the surface temperature of the water from rising during the southern
                    summer.</p>
                <p>The northern and southern “isocrymes” of 68°, that is the lines which pass over
                    water which has a mean temperature of 68° during the coldest months of the year,
                    lie, according to Dana <hi rend="italic">(Corals and Coral Islands,</hi> 1872),
                    between the latitudes of 20° and 30° on each side of the equator, except in the
                    neighbourhood of the South-American coast, where the isocryme runs north in a
                    loop beyond the equator,—a consequence of the cooling effect of the Peruvian
                    current. These isocrymes mark out an area of great importance; for the
                    reef-building corals are confined within it.</p>
                <p>The highest temperature which sea water has been observed to attain is 90° F.,
                    and water of this temperature is only met with in the Red Sea. The maximum in
                    the Pacific in the month of August is reached in the boundary between it and the
                    Indian Ocean (in the Malay Archipelago) and in a narrow strip along the Mexican
                    coast; in both these regions the thermometer immersed in the surface water
                    registers 85° as a mean. There is a considerable area which in August stretches
                    between New Guinea and Japan, from 10° S. to nearly 30° N., where the surface
                    temperature reaches 84°, but these are exceptional temperatures.</p>
                <p>When the “Challenger” was cruising in the South Pacific—in 1874 and 1875—the
                    water was found to be uniformly warmer than the air, the difference in
                    temperature between the two averaging l <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 5 to 2°
                    Fahr. In the North Pacific, between the latitudes of 30° and 40°, on the other
                    hand, the atmospheric temperature is about half a degree higher than that of the
                    surface water. Such differences may be explained by considering the effect of
                    warm and cold currents, which alter the temperature of the water much more
                    rapidly than that of the air, and of warm and cold winds, which affect the
                    atmosphere more quickly than the ocean.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Deep-Sea Temperature.—</hi> The serial temperature soundings of
                    the “Challenger” in the Pacific give a very good idea of the distribution of
                    temperature in the deeper waters. There seems to be a slow massive movement of
                    water from the Antarctic Ocean into the Pacific, which is not confined to the
                    surface currents, but affects the whole mass of water down to the bottom. The
                    rate of this motion is quite unknown. In the open sea, far from coasts and
                    barriers, the temperature of the water continually decreases as the depth
                    increases. This is only true for the open ocean, fully exposed to the effects of
                    the mass movement of the water; there is a very different distribution of
                    temperature in enclosed seas such as those of the Western Pacific, or even in
                    the ocean when a barrier presents itself to the moving water. The difference,
                    which is brought out by the diagram (Plate II. fig. 1), is due to the fact that
                    when a barrier exists it retards the motion of the lower portion of the water,
                    which has the lowest temperature, while the higher passes on over it, and fills
                    up the area beyond with water at the uniform temperature of the great ocean at
                    the point to which the top of the ridge or obstruction reaches. In the Sulu Sea,
                    for instance, the diagram shows<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    The inference is that the Sulu Sea is surrounded by a ridge rising to at least
                    about 400 fathoms from the surface, which prevents the great ocean circulation
                    from having its. cooling effect, and soundings indicate that this is really the
                    case. A study of the temperature phenomena, such as those just referred to,
                    points out with considerable certainty the existence and height of barriers and
                    ridges in many parts of the ocean, where their presence has not been detected by

                    (about 2500 fathoms), the bottom temperature was as high as 35 <hi

                    seas of the Eastern Archipelago were found to be considerable, and nearly all
                    those seas show the phenomenon of constant temperature from an intermediate
                    point to the bottom, consequent on the existence of barriers. The chief details
                    of the thermal conditions of these seas are represented graphically in the
                    diagram (Plate II. fig. 1). Between the Caroline Islands and Japan the bottom
                    temperature was 35 <hi rend="superscript"> 0,</hi> 3. The bottom temperature in

                <p>The temperature of the water at the depth of 300 fathoms is nearly the same (40°
                    to 45°) over the whole of the North Pacific, but above 300 fathoms the water is
                    warmer in the western than in the central portion, while below that depth it is
                    colder in the former than in the latter. The same phenomenon is noticed between
                    the latitudes of 34° S. and 40° S., but here 700 fathoms marks the plane of
                    constant temperature. Between 33° N. and 40° S. the temperature of the water
                    above 200 fathoms is higher in the North than in the South Pacific, whilst from
                    200 to 1500 fathoms it is lower in the North, and below the latter depth the
                    condition reverts to what it was above 200 fathoms.</p>

                    order that the length of the diagram might be kept within reasonable bounds the
                    scale of latitude was made very much smaller. The result of this is to
                    exaggerate the inequalities of the sea bottom, making the slopes very much
                    steeper than they are; this effect is best seen in the way in which islands ¾re

                    is an index of its salinity, since the researches of various chemists, foremost

                <p>The density of the water in different parts of the ocean must obviously change to
                    a certain extent with the season; and it is not only the surface density that is
                    affected in this way; any cause which promotes evaporation tends to increase the
                    salinity of surface water, while any conditions that effect condensation of
                    aqueous vapour produce dilution. For instance, in the China Sea during the month
                    of November, at the end of the south-west monsoon, which is a moist wind
                    accompanied by much rain, the specific gravity observed was 1Ό2518, and two
                    months later, after the dry north-east monsoon had been blowing for some time,
                    evaporation had proceeded so far that the specific gravity had risen to 1Ό2534.
                    The climate is the principal factor in determining surface salinity, and the
                    causes which produce well-marked climatic conditions have an equally apparent
                    effect on the density of the water. Thus there are two zones of comparatively
                    high density encircling the globe in the region of thé north east and south-east
                    trade winds, which are dry and promote rapid evaporation; and similarly the
                    region of calms and rain between the trades is distinguished by the low specific
                    gravity of the water. North and south of these areas there are two zones where
                    the salinity maintains a mean value, in consequence of there being a balance
                    between evaporation and condensation; and round the poles there are areas of
                    concentration brought about by the freezing of the sea water and the separation
                    of salt, which of course increases the salinity of the water remaining
                    unfrozen.</p>
                <p>The distribution of density differs considerably in the two great oceans. In the
                    Atlantic there are two areas of high specific gravity, one in the north, the
                    other in the south; while in the Pacific there is only one, situated in the
                    southern division of the ocean in the neighbourhood of the Society Islands. It
                    is neither so large as those of the Atlantic, nor has it so high a specific
                    gravity. The density of the concentration areas in the Atlantic, taking pure
                    water at 4° C. as unity, is 1'02750; that in the saltest portion of the Pacific
                    is only 1Ό2700. In the North Pacific the salinity is less than in the South, and
                    its distribution is much more uniform. The density in this region never exceeds
                    1Ό2650, and the minimum, in the rainy region of the equatorial counter current,
                    is as low as 1Ό2485. The South Pacific has water of a relatively high density,
                    its maximum being Γ02750. The water of the seas of the Eastern Archipelago, in
                    the western basin of the Pacific, although exposed to the full force of an
                    equatorial sun, and possessed of a very high surface temperature, is yet
                    surprisingly fresh. The specific gravity varies considerably with the season,
                    but the average for the year over the greater part of these seas is under
                    1Ό2550; and there is a large area surrounding the islands of Java and Sumatra
                    where the dilution is greater, the hydrometer only indicating Γ02500. The weak
                    salinity of these waters is largely to be attributed to the extreme humidity of
                    the atmosphere, the frequent and heavy rains, and the fact that so many lofty
                    and extensive islands, where the annual rainfall rises above 200 inches, drain
                    into the seas. Water of such a degree of dilution is not met with anywhere else,
                    except near the mouths of rivers and in the vicinity of melting ice, and, as a
                    temporary phenomenon, after prolonged rain in the tropics.</p>
                <p>In regions where there is decided and continuous concentration in progress, the
                    specific gravity of the water is greatest at the surface and decreases as the
                    depth increases, down to about 800 or 1000 fathoms, after which the density
                    increases slowly with the depth until the bottom is reached. The density of the
                    bottom water of the Pacific is almost the same everywhere; it only varies from
                    1Ό2570 to 1 02590; and the same value holds for the South Atlantic. The North
                    Atlantic has denser water at the bottom, varying from Γ02616 to 1Ό2632. In those
                    regions where the surface water is being constantly diluted, as is the case in
                    the equatorial belt of calms, the density increases with the depth down to
                    between 50 and 100 fathoms, where there is a maximum, from which the density
                    diminishes, as in the other case, to about 1000 fathoms, and afterwards
                    increases slowly down to the bottom. There is a striking resemblance between the
                    direction of the isohalsines, or lines of equal salinity, and of the
                    isothermals; but the parallelism breaks down, of course, in the case of a
                    subsurface maximum.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Depth.—</hi> For a long time the opinion that the Pacific was a
                    comparatively shallow ocean was entertained by geographers, and it is only the
                    recent soundings of the “Challenger,” “Tuscarora,” “Gazelle,” and other
                    surveying ships that have succeeded in dispelling the illusion. It is now known
                    that the average depth of the Pacific is greater than that of the Atlantic, and
                    that areas of deeper water occur in it than in any other part of the globe. A
                    line running along the western shores of the two Americas and along the eastern
                    shores of the Asiatic continent more or less closely follows a great circle of
                    the globe. On the one side of this line there are the continental masses of the
                    Americas and of Europe and Asia, with an average height of about 800 feet above
                    the level of the sea; and on the other side the vast oceanic depression of the
                    Pacific, with an average depth of about 2500 fathoms. The average level of the
                    continental area may thus be regarded as about three miles above the Pacific
                    depression.</p>
                <p>The attempt to divide the ocean into sharply defined basins is more or less
                    unsatisfactory; and for the consideration of the depth it is better to view the
                    Pacific as marked off into two portions by an imaginary line passing through
                    Honolulu and Tahiti, on the meridian of 150° W.</p>
                <p>The eastern half is remarkable for the comparative absence of islands and the
                    uniform nature of its depth. With the exception of the narrow strip of shallow
                    water surrounding the Aleutian Islands and running along the American coast, the
                    sounding line shows an average depth of from 2000 to 3000 fathoms undiversified
                    by remarkable elevations or depressions, between the northern limit of the ocean
                    and 30° S. lat. There is a great submarine plateau extending from the Patagonian
                    coast (in 76° W. long.) in a westerly direction to 120° W. long., which rises to
                    between 2000 and 1000 fathoms of the surface. This elevated area diminishes in
                    breadth as it proceeds westward, but it is supposed by some authorities to be
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n136/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0136-0121"/> connected with the shallow water surrounding the
                    Low Archipelago and the Marquesas Islands (groups which are bisected by the
                    140th meridian of west longitude) and the Society Islands. If this be the case
                    there is an almost continuous area of elevation stretching between Patagonia and
                    Japan. It has been remarked that many of the submerged plateaus of the Pacific
                    have a south-east to northwest trend. The “Challenger” examined the depth of the
                    eastern half of the Pacific in 1875, along a line which extended fro n 38° N.
                    lat. on the 160th meridian south-east to the Sandwich Islands, and then as
                    nearly as possible along the 150th meridian to the Society Islands in 23° S.
                    lat. From this point the course was again south-east to the 40th parallel of
                    south latitude, which was followed eastward to the Patagonian coast, a visit to
                    Juan Fernandez forming a northward digression. The depth was ascertained at
                    fifty points along this route, and it was found to vary on the whole from 2000
                    to 3000 fathoms. There were two soundings of over 3000 fathoms between latitudes
                    38° and 36° N., and one a little to the south of the Sandwich Islands. Between
                    the meridian of 120° W. and the coast of America the soundings showed the depth
                    to vary considerably as the ship was in deep water or over the submerged
                    Patagonian plateau. The actual numbers observed proceeding eastward from 120° W.
                    long, were in fathoms :—2250, 1600, 2025, 2270, 1500, 1825,1775,1375, 2160,
                    2225,1450,1325. The soundings made by the United States ship “Tuscarora” during
                    1874 were much more numerous, closer together, and extended along several lines,
                    but the general result was similar to that of the “Challenger” observations. The
                    results of all recent observations are shown on Plate III.</p>
                <p>The western half of the Pacific Ocean is a complete contrast to the eastern.
                    Archipelagos and scattered islands are exceedingly numerous; the depth of the
                    ocean is by no means uniform, for shallows and areas of unusual depth occur
                    scattered over it at irregular intervals. Along the Asiatic coast and between
                    the island groups there are a number of partially enclosed seas, and these are
                    separated from the great ocean by submarine plateaus of sufficient extent and
                    height to warrant the supposition that a moderate upheaval would extend the
                    Asiatic continent as far south as Australia, transforming the seas into inland
                    salt lakes. Considerations of the peculiar animal and vegetable life of New
                    Zealand and Australia lend some degree of probability to the speculation that
                    these islands were joined to the main continent of Asia at some very remote
                    period; and it is even possible to trace the submerged coast-line of the great
                    continent which then existed. This line separates the very deep water of the
                    West Pacific from the shallower water of the inland seas and archipelagos; it
                    runs from Kamchatka, over Japan, Formosa, the Philippines, New Guinea, to
                    Australia and New Zealand. The most conspicuous peculiarity of the West Pacific
                    is the very deep water lying in a crescent shape to the east of the Kurile
                    Islands and Japan. It extends from 50° N. lat. to nearly 20° N. lat., although
                    it is of no great breadth. The average depth of this area is nearly 4000
                    fathoms, and a narrow strip of still more abysmal depths runs along its western
                    margin, like a ditch across the entrance to the Sea of Okhotsk; here the United
                    States ship “Tuscarora” found depths of over 4600 fathoms. The course of the
                    “Challenger” led her to explore the seas of the Eastern Archipelago pretty
                    thoroughly, and she carried a line of soundings from the archipelago to Japan,
                    and thence eastward across the Pacific, crossing the area of great depth about
                    the centre, off Nippon, where two soundings of 3950 and 3625 fathoms
                    respectively were obtained. Like the East Pacific, the western division of the
                    ocean has an average depth of from 2000 to 3000 fathoms, although a great number
                    of small depressions exist where the depth is greater, and detached areas of
                    shallower water occur still more frequently. Many of the islands rise from
                    depths of about 3000 fathoms, forming isolated mountains springing from the bed
                    of the ocean, and several peaks which do not rise to the surface have been
                    detected. More usually a number of islands are bound together by submarine
                    elevations, frequently within a few hundred fathoms of the surface, over wide
                    areas. Although the greater part of the sea surrounding New Zealand, the north
                    of Australia, and the adjacent islands is under 1000 fathoms in depth, there are
                    areas of great depression amongst the islands, and some very deep channels. In
                    1875 when sounding in the channel between the Carolines and Ladrones, the
                    “Challenger” met with the deepest water of the cruise, 4475 fathoms, or about
                    five miles and a quarter; and this is the greatest depth from which a specimen
                    of the bottom has hitherto been obtained. This abysmal depth only extends over a
                    relatively small area, for the two nearest “Challenger” stations, one to the
                    north and one to the south, had depths of 2300 and 1850 fathoms
                    respectively.</p>
                <p>The seas branching off from the Pacific are usually relatively shallow. Behring
                    Sea on the north has extremely Shallow water in its north-eastern half, where
                    there is a depth of under 100 fathoms; in the south-western portion the depth
                    increases rapidly to between 1000 and 2000 fathoms, except round the coasts and
                    the Aleutian Archipelago. The Sea of Okhotsk is still shallower: much of it is
                    within the 100 fathom line; and in its deepest part it does not attain 1000
                    fathoms. The Yellow Sea is entirely within the hundred fathom line; while the
                    Sea of Japan, only separated from it by the Corean Peninsula, is not inferior in
                    depth to the open ocean, its average depth being from 2000 to 3000 fathoms. The
                    western portion of the Pacific, which lies between the Philippines and the
                    Carolines and Ladrones, is also very deep, its mean depth approaching 3000
                    fathoms. This sea is of importance, since it is to the Pacific what the Gulf of
                    Mexico is to the Atlantic—the source of its great northern thermal current. The
                    fact that the temperature at 1500 fathoms over the whole of the North Pacific
                    does not differ by more than 0° ’ 5 F. from that at the bottom appears to
                    indicate that this portion is cut off from the southern division by a ridge
                    rising to within 1500 fathoms of the surface. The existence of such a barrier
                    cannot be said to be proved, but the indications lead to the supposition that it
                    may extend from Japan to the equator, through the Bonin, the Ladrone, and the
                    Caroline Islands.</p>
                <p>Taken altogether, so far as present knowledge goes, the bed of the Pacific is
                    more uniform than that of the Atlantic, and its changes of level are less
                    abrupt. Its depth is, on an average, greater, and appears to be more evenly
                    distributed than in the Atlantic, but this apparent greater uniformity may be
                    partly due to the fact that the latter ocean, both on account of its smaller
                    size and its greater commercial importance, has been much more carefully
                    surveyed, and its bathymetrical conditions more exactly ascertained.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Deposits.</hi></p>
                <p>The explorations of the “Challenger,” “Tuscarora,” and other surveying ships have
                    in recent years given a great amount of information respecting the nature of the
                    deposits now forming over the floor of the ocean, and the specimens collected by
                    these expeditions have been made the subject of a careful investigation by
                    Messrs Murray and Renard. The great extent and depth of the Pacific Ocean make
                    it the most suitable field for the study of the varieties of deep-sea deposits
                    and the conditions under which they are found. The various kinds of deposits,
                    all of which are found iu the Pacific Ocean, are classed as follows :—</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">terrigenous deposits</hi> are found in more or less close
                    proximity to the land, and are chiefly made up of the triturated fragments
                    carried down into the ocean by rivers, or worn away from the coasts by waves or
                    currents. Those found in the deeper water surrounding the land differ from the
                    sands, gravels, and shingles of the shore and shallow water chiefly in the
                    smaller size of the grains and the greater abundance of clayey matter and
                    remains of oceanic organisms. As, however, the water becomes still deeper and
                    the distance from land greater, the deposits assume, more and more, a deep-sea
                    character until they pass into a true pelagic deposit.</p>
                <p>The principal mineralogical constituents of the terrigenous deposits near
                    continental land are isolated fragments of rocks and minerals coming from the
                    crystalline and schisto-crystalline series, and from the clastic and sedimentary
                    formations; according to the character of the nearest coasts they belong to
                    granite, diorite, diabase, porphyry, &amp;c., crystalline schists, ancient
                    limestones, and the sedimentary rocks of all geological ages, with the minerals
                    which come from their disintegration, such as quartz, monoclinic and triclinic
                    felspars, hornblende, augite, rhombic pyroxene, olivine, muscovite, biotite,
                    titanic and magnetic iron, tourmaline, garnet, epidote, and other secondary
                    minerals. The trituration and decomposition of these rocks and minerals give
                    rise to materials more or less amorphous and without distinctive characters, but
                    the origin of which is indicated by association with the rocks and minerals just
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>Mixed with these are found in many places phosphatic nodules, large quantities of
                    glauconite, and minerals arising from chemical action probably in presence of
                    organic matter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Blue mud</hi> is the most extensive deposit now forming around
                    the great continents and continental islands, and in all enclosed or partially
                    enclosed seas. It is characterized by a slaty colour, which passes in most cases
                    into a thin layer of a reddish colour at the upper surface. These deposits are
                    coloured blue by organic matter in a state of decomposition, and frequently give
                    off an odour of sulphuretted hydrogen. When dried, a blue mud is greyish in
                    colour, and rarely or never has the plasticity and compactness of a true clay.
                    It is finely granular, and occasionally contains fragments of rocks 2 cm. in
                    diameter; generally, however, the minerals which are derived from the
                    continents, and arc found mixed up with the muddy matter in these deposits, have
                    a mean diameter of 0'5 mm. and less. Quartz particles, often rounded, play the
                    principal part; next come mica, felspar, augite, hornblende, and all the mineral
                    species which come from the disintegration of the neighbouring lands, or the
                    lands traversed by rivers which enter the sea near the .place where the
                    specimens have been collected. These minerals make up the principal and
                    characteristic portion of blue muds, sometimes forming 80 per cent, of the whole
                    deposit. Glauconite, though generally present, is never abundant. The remains of
                    calcareous organisms are at times quite absent, but occasionally they form over
                    50 per cent. The latter is the case when the specimen is taken at a considerable
                    distance from the coast and at a moderate depth. These calcareous fragments
                    consist of bottom-living and pelagic <hi rend="italic">Foraminifera,</hi>
                    Molluscs, <hi rend="italic">Polyzoa,</hi><hi rend="italic">Serpulae,</hi>
                    Echinoderms, Alcyonarian spicules, Corals, &amp;c. The remains of Diatoms and
                    Radiolarians are usually present. Generally speaking, as the shores are
                    approached the pelagic organisms disappear; and, on the contrary, as we proceed
                    seawards the size of the mineral grains diminishes, and the remains of shore and
                    coast organisms give place to pelagic ones, till finally a blue mud passes into
                    a true deep-sea deposit. In those regions of the ocean affected with floating
                    ice, the colour of these deposits becomes grey rather than blue at great
                    distances from land, and is further modified by the presence of a greater or
                    less"abundance of glaciated blocks and fragments of quartz. These deposits are
                    found along the coasts of North and South America, and in all the enclosed and
                    partially enclosed seas, such as the Japan Sea, China Sea, Arafura Sea, Sulu
                    Sea, Banda Sea, Celebes Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>At some points in the same regions are found <hi rend="italic">green muds</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">sands,</hi> which, as regards their origin, composition,
                    and distribution near the shores of continental land, resemble the blue muds.
                    They are largely composed of argillaceous matter and mineral particles of the
                    same size and kind as the blue muds. Their chief characteristic is the presence
                    of a considerable quantity of glauconitic grains, either isolated or united into
                    concretions by a brown argillaceous matter. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Foraminifera</hi> and fragments of Echinoderms and other organisms in these
                    muds are frequently filled with glauconitic substance, and beautiful casts of
                    these organisms remain after treatment with weak acid. At times there are few
                    calcareous organisms in these deposits, and at other times the remains of
                    Diatoms and Radiolarians are abundant. When these muds are dried they become
                    earthy and of a grey-green colour. They frequently give out a sulphuretted
                    hydrogen odour. The green colour appears sometimes to be due to the presence of
                    organic matter, probably of vegetable origin, and to the reduction of peroxide
                    of iron to protoxide under its influence. The green sands differ from the muds
                    only in the comparative absence of the argillaceous and other amorphous matter,
                    and by the more important part played by the grains of glauconite, to which the
                    green colour is chiefly due. <hi rend="italic">Red mud</hi> is found where
                    quantities of ochreous matter are brought down by rivers and deposited along the
                    coast, as in the Yellow Sea, but it is most characteristic in the Atlantic off
                    the Brazil coast of America.</p>
                <p>In addition to the terrigenous deposits above referred to, volcanic muds and
                    sands and coral muds and sands are found around the shores of oceanic islands
                    either of volcanic or coral origin. The <hi rend="italic">volcanic muds and
                    sands</hi> are black or grey, and when dried are rarely coherent. The mineral
                    particles are generally fragmentary, and consist of lapilli of the basic and
                    acid series of modem volcanic rocks, which are scoriaceous or compact, vitreous
                    or crystalline, and usually present traces of alteration. The minerals are
                    sometimes isolated, sometimes surrounded by their matrix, and consist
                    principally of plagioclases, sanidine, amphibole, pyroxene, biotite, olivine,
                    and magnetic iron; the size of the particles diminishes with distance from the
                    shore, but the mean diameter is generally 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 mm.
                    Glauconite does not appear to be present in these deposits, and quartz is also
                    very rare or absent. The fragments of shells and rocks are frequently covered
                    with a coating of peroxide of manganese. Shells of calcareous organisms are
                    often present in great abundance, and render the deposit of a lighter colour.
                    The remains of Diatoms and Radiolarians are usually present.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Coral muds</hi> frequently contain as much as 95 per cent, of
                    carbonate of lime, consisting of fragments of Corals, calcareous algae, <hi
                    rend="italic">Foraminifera,</hi><hi rend="italic">Serpulae,</hi> Molluscs, and
                    remains of other limesecreting organisms. There is a large amount of amorphous
                    calcareous matter, which gives the deposit a sticky and chalky character. The
                    particles may be of all sizes according to the distance from the reefs, the mean
                    diameter being 1 to 2 mm., but occasionally there are large blocks of coral and
                    large calcareous concretions; the particles are white and red. Remains of
                    siliceous organisms seldom make up over 2 or 3 per cent, of a typical coral mud.
                    The residue consists usually of a small amount of argillaceous matter, with a
                    few fragments of felspar and other volcanic minerals; but off barrier and
                    fringing reefs facing continents there may be a great variety of rocks and
                    minerals. Beyond a depth of 1000 fathoms off coral islands the debris of the
                    reefs begins to diminish, and the remains of pelagic organisms to increase; the
                    deposit becomes more argillaceous, of a reddish or rose colour, and gradually
                    passes into a <hi rend="italic">Globigerina</hi> ooze or a red clay. <hi
                    rend="italic">Coral sands</hi> contain much less amorphous matter than coral
                    muds, but in other respects they are similar, the sands being usually found
                    nearer the reefs and in shallower water than the muds, except inside lagoons. In
                    some regions the remains of calcareous algae predominate, and In these cases the
                    name <hi rend="italic">coralline mud</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sand</hi> is
                    employed to point out the distinction.</p>
                <p>The extent and peculiarities of the region in which these terrigenous deposits
                    are laid down are interesting. It extends from high-water mark down, it may be,
                    to a depth of over 4 miles, and in a horizontal direction from 60 to perhaps 300
                    miles seawards, and includes all inland seas, such as the North Sea, Norwegian
                    Sea, Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, China Sea, Japan Sea, Caribbean Sea, and many
                    others. It is the region of change and of variety with respect to light,
                    temperature, motion, and biological conditions. In the surface waters the
                    temperature ranges from 80° F. in the tropics to 28° F. in the polar regions.
                    From the surface down to the nearly ice-cold water found at the lower limits of
                    the region in the deep sea there is in the tropics an equally great range of
                    temperature. Plants and animals are abundant near the shore, and animals extend
                    in relatively great abundance down to the lower limits of the region, now marked
                    out by these terrigenous deposits. The specific gravity of the water varies
                    much, and this variation in its turn affects the fauna and flora. In the
                    terrigenous region tides and currents produce their maximum effect, and these
                    influences can in some instances be traced to a depth of 300 fathoms, or nearly
                    2000 feet. The upper or continental margin of the region is clearly defined by
                    the high-water mark of the coast-line, which is constantly changing through
                    breaker action, elevation, and subsidence. The lower or abysmal margin passes in
                    most cases insensibly into the abysmal region, but may be regarded as ending
                    where the mineral particles from the neighbouring continents begin to disappear
                    from the deposits, which then pass into an organic ooze or a red clay.</p>
                <p>The area covered by terrigenous deposits has been called the “transitional” or
                    “critical area,” and is estimated at about <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n138/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0138-0123"/> two-eighths of the earth’s surface, while the
                    continents cover three-eighths, and the deep-sea deposits of the abysmal
                    regions, which will now be considered, cover the remaining three-eighths.</p>
                <p>The true <hi rend="italic">deep-sea deposits</hi> may be divided into two
                    classes, viz., those in which the organic elements predominate, and those in
                    which the mineral constituents play the chief part. Belonging to the former
                    class there are <hi rend="italic">Globigerina,</hi> Pteropod, Diatom, and
                    Radiolarian O&lt;5zes, and to the latter Red Clay.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Globigerina ooze</hi> is the name given to all those truly
                    pelagic deposits containing over 40 per cent, of carbonate of lime which consist
                    principally of the dead shells of pelagic <hi rend="italic">Foraminifera</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">{Globigerina,</hi><hi rend="italic">0rbulina, Pulvinulina,
                    Pullenia,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sphaeroidind)</hi> and coccoliths and
                    rhabdoliths. I n some localities this deposit contains 95 per cent, of carbonate
                    of lime. The colour is milky white, yellow, brown, or rose, the varieties of
                    colour depending principally on the relative abundance in the deposit of the
                    oxides of iron and manganese. This ooze is fine grained; in the tropics some of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Foraminifera</hi> shells are macroscopic. When dried it is
                    pulverulent. Analyses show that the sediment contains, in addition to carbonate
                    of lime, phosphate and sulphate of lime, carbonate of magnesia, oxides of iron
                    and manganese, and argillaceous matters. The residue is of a reddish-brown
                    tinge. Lapilli, pumice, and glassy fragments, often altered into palagonite,
                    seem always to be present, and are frequently very abundant. The mineral
                    particles are generally angular, and rarely exceed 0 Ό8 mm. in diameter;
                    monoclinic and triclinic felspars, augite, olivine, hornblende, and magnetite
                    are the most frequent. When quartz is present, it is in the form of minute,
                    rounded, probably wind-borne grains, often partially covered with oxide of iron.
                    More rarely there are white and black particles of mica, bronzite, actinolite,
                    chromite, glauconite, and cosmic dust. Siliceous organisms are probably never
                    absent, sometimes forming 20 per cent, of the deposit, while at other times they
                    are only recognizable after careful microscopic examination. In some regions the
                    frustules of Diatoms predominate, in other the skeletons of Radiolarians.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pteropod ooze</hi> differs in no way from a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Globigerina</hi> ooze except in the presence of a greater number and variety of
                    pelagic organisms, and especially in the presence of Pteropod and Heteropod
                    shells, such as <hi rend="italic">Diacria, Atlanta, Styliola, Carinaria,</hi>
                    &amp;c. The shells of the more delicate species of pelagic <hi rend="italic"
                    >Foraminifera</hi> and young shells are also more abundant in these deposits
                    than in a <hi rend="italic">Globigerina</hi> ooze. It must be remembered that
                    the name “Pteropod ooze” is not intended to indicate that the deposit is chiefly
                    composed of the shells of these Molluscs, but, as their presence in a deposit is
                    characteristic and has an important bearing on geographical and bathymetrical
                    distribution, it is desirable to emphasize the presence of these shells in any
                    great abundance. It may be pointed out that there is a very considerable
                    difference between a <hi rend="italic">Globigerina</hi> ooze or a Pteropod ooze
                    situated near continental shores and deposits bearing the same names situated
                    towards the centres of oceanic areas, with respect both to mineral particles and
                    to remains of organisms.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diatom ooze</hi> is of a pale straw colour, and is composed
                    principally of the frustules of Diatoms. When dry it is a dirty white siliceous
                    flour, soft to the touch, taking the impression of the fingers, and contains
                    gritty particles which can be recognized by the touch. It contains on an average
                    about 25 per cent, of carbonate of lime, which exists in the deposit in the form
                    of small <hi rend="italic">Globigerina</hi> shells, fragments of Echinoderms and
                    other organisms. The residue is pale white and slightly plastic; minerals and
                    fragments of rocks are in some cases abundant; these are volcanic, or, more
                    frequently, fragments and minerals coming from continental rocks and transported
                    by glaciers. The fine washings consist essentially of particles of Diatoms along
                    with argillaceous and other amorphous matter. It is estimated that the frustules
                    of Diatoms and skeletons of siliceous organisms make up more than 50 per cent,
                    of this deposit.</p>
                <p>It has been already mentioned that Radiolarians are seldom, if ever, completely
                    absent from marine deposits. In some regions they make up a considerable portion
                    of a <hi rend="italic">Globigerina</hi> ooze, and are also found in Diatom ooze
                    and in the terrigenous deposits of the deeper water surrounding the land. In
                    some regions of the Pacific, however, the skeletons of these organisms make up
                    the principal part of the deposit, to which the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Radiolarian</hi> ooze has been given. The colour is reddish or deep brown, due
                    to the presence of the oxides of iron and manganese. The mineral particles
                    consist of fragments of pumice, lapilli, and volcanic minerals, rarely exceeding
                    0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 07 mm. in diameter. There is not a trace of
                    carbonate of lime in the form of shells in some samples of Radiolarian ooze, but
                    other specimens contain 20 per cent, of carbonate of lime derived from the
                    shells of pelagic <hi rend="italic">Foraminifera.</hi> The clayey matter and
                    mineral particles are the same as those found in the red clays, which will now
                    be described. .</p>
                <p>Of all the deep-sea deposits <hi rend="italic">red clay</hi> is the one which is
                    distributed over the largest areas in the modern oceans. It might be said that
                    it exists everywhere in the abysmal regions of the ocean basins, for the residue
                    in the organic deposits which have been described under the names <hi
                    rend="italic">Globigerina,</hi> Pteropod, Diatom, and Radiolarian oozes is
                    nothing else than the red clay. However, this deposit only appears in its
                    characteristic form in those areas where the terrigenous minerals and calcareous
                    and siliceous organisms disappear to a greater or less extent from the bottom.
                    It is in the central regions of the Pacific that the typical examples are met
                    with. Like other marine deposits, this one passes laterally, according to
                    position and depth, into the adjacent kind of deep-sea ooze, clay, or mud.</p>
                <p>The argillaceous matters are of a more or less deep brown tint from the presence
                    of the oxides of iron and manganese. In the typical examples no mineralogical
                    species can be distinguished by the naked eye, for the grains are exceedingly
                    fine and of nearly uniform dimensions, rarely exceeding 0'05 mm. in diameter. It
                    is plastic and greasy to the touch; when dried it forms lumps so coherent that
                    considerable force must be employed to break them. It gives the brilliant streak
                    of clay, and breaks down in water. The pyrognostic properties show that it is
                    not a pure clay, for it fuses easily before the blowpipe into a magnetic
                    bead.</p>
                <p>Under the term red clay are comprised those deposits in which the characters of
                    clay are not well pronounced, but which are mainly composed of minute particles
                    of pumice and other volcanic material <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n139/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0139-0124"/> which, owing to their relatively recent
                    deposition, have not undergone great alteration. If the analyses of red clay are
                    calculated, it will be seen, moreover, that the silicate of alumina present as
                    clay (2SiO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, Al <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + 2H <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> O) comprises only a
                    relatively small portion of the sediment; the calculation shows always an excess
                    of free silica, which is attributed chiefly to the presence of siliceous
                    organisms.</p>
                <p>Microscopic examination shows that a red clay consists of argillaceous matter,
                    minute mineral particles, and fragments of siliceous organisms. The mineral
                    particles are for the greater part of volcanic origin, except in those cases
                    where continental matters are transported by floating ice, or where the sand of
                    deserts has been carried to great distances by winds. These volcanic minerals
                    are the same constituent minerals of modern eruptive rocks enumerated in the
                    description of volcanic muds and sands; in the great majority of cases they are
                    accompanied by fragments of lapilli and of pumice more or less altered. Vitreous
                    volcanic matters belonging to the acid and basic series of rocks predominate in
                    the regions where the red clay has its greatest development; and it will be seen
                    presently that the most characteristic decompositions which there take place are
                    associated with pyroxenic lavas.</p>
                <p>Associated with the red clay are almost always found concretions and microscopic
                    particles of the oxides of iron and manganese, to which the deposit owes its
                    colour. Again, in the typical examples of the deposit, zeolites in the form of
                    crystals and crystalline spherules are present, along with metallic globules and
                    silicates which are regarded as of cosmic origin. Calcareous organisms are so
                    generally absent that they cannot be regarded as characteristic. On the other
                    hand, the remains of Diatoms, Radiolarians, and Sponge spicules are generally
                    present, and are sometimes very abundant. The ear-bones of various Cetaceans, as
                    well as the remnants of other Cetacean bones and the teeth of sharks, are, in
                    some of the typical samples far removed from the continents, exceedingly
                    abundant, and are often deeply impregnated with, or embedded in thick coatings
                    of, the oxides of iron and manganese. Over six hundred sharks’ teeth, belonging
                    to the genera <hi rend="italic">Carcharodon, Oxyrhina,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Lamna,</hi> and one hundred ear-bones of whales, belonging to <hi
                    rend="italic">Ziρhius,</hi><hi rend="italic">Balaenoptera, Balaena,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Orca,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Delphinus,</hi> along with fifty
                    fragments of other bones, have been obtained in one haul of the dredge in the
                    Central Pacific. The remains of these vertebrates have seldom been dredged in
                    the organic oozes, and still more rarely in the terrigenous deposits.</p>
                <p>The abysmal region, in which the true pelagic deposits above described are laid
                    down, shows a marked contrast with the “transitional” or “critical area” where
                    the terrigenous deposits are found. The former area comprises vast undulating
                    plains from 2 to 5 miles beneath the surface of the sea, the average being about
                    3 miles, here and’there interrupted by huge volcanic cones (the oceanic
                    islands). No sunlight ever reaches these deep cold tracts. The range of
                    temperature over them is not more than 7°, viz., from 31° to 38° F., and is
                    apparently constant throughout the whole year in each locality. Plant life is
                    absent, and, although animals belonging to all the great types are present,
                    there is no great variety of form nor abundance of individuals. Change of any
                    kind is exceedingly slow.</p>
                <p>Leaving out of view the coral and volcanic muds and sands which are found
                    principally around oceanic islands, the blue muds, green muds and sands, red
                    muds, together with all the coast and shore formations, are situated along the
                    margins of the continents and in enclosed and partially enclosed seas. The chief
                    characteristic of these deposits is the presence in them of continental debris.
                    The blue muds are found in all the deeper parts of the regions just indicated,
                    and especially near the embouchures of rivers. Red muds do not differ much from
                    blue muds except in colour, due to the presence of ferruginous matter in greater
                    abundance, and they are found under the same conditions as the blue muds. The
                    green muds and sands occupy, as a rule, portions of the coast where detrital
                    matter from rivers is not apparently accumulating at a rapid rate, viz., on such
                    places as the Agulhas Bank, off the east coast of Australia, off the coast of
                    Spain, and at various points along the coast of America. In the tropical and
                    temperate zones of the great oceans, which occupy about 110° of latitude between
                    the two polar zones, at depths where the action of the waves is not felt, and at
                    points to which the terrigenous materials do notextend, there are now forming
                    vast accumulations <hi rend="italic">oiGlobigcrina</hi> and other pelagic <hi
                    rend="italic">Foraminifera,</hi> coccoliths, rhabdoliths, shells of pelagic
                    Molluscs, and remains of other organisms. Thesedeposits may perhaps be called
                    the sediments of median depths and of warmer zones, because they diminish in
                    great depths and tend to disappear towards the poles. This fact is evidently in
                    relation with the surface temperature of the ocean, and shows that pelagic <hi
                    rend="italic">Foraminifera</hi> and Molluscs live in the superficial waters of
                    the sea, whence their dead shells fall to the bottom. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Globigerina</hi> ooze is not found in enclosed seas nor in polar latitudes. In
                    the southern hemisphere it has not been met with south of the 50th parallel. In
                    the Atlantic it is deposited upon the bottom at a very high latitude below the
                    warm waters of the Gulf Stream, and is not observed under the cold descending
                    polar current which runs south in the same latitude. These facts are readily
                    explained if it be admitted that this ooze is formed chiefly by the shells of
                    surface organisms, which require an elevated temperature and a wide expanse of
                    sea for their existence.</p>
                <p>The distribution of oceanic deposits may be summarized thus. (1) The terrigenous
                    deposits—blue muds, green mudsand sands, red muds, volcanic muds and sands,
                    coral muds and sands—are met with in those regions of the ocean nearest to land.
                    With the exception of the volcanic muds and sands and coral muds and sands
                    around oceanic islands, these deposits are found only lying along the borders of
                    continents and continental islands, and in enclosed and partially enclosed seas.
                    (2) The organic oozes and red clay are confined to the abysmal regions of the
                    ocean basins; a Pteropod ooze is met with in tropical and subtropical regions in
                    depths less than 1500 fathoms, a <hi rend="italic">Globigerina</hi> ooze in the
                    same regions between the depths of 500 and 2800 fathoms, a Radiolarian ooze in
                    the central portions of the Pacific at depths greater than 2500 fathoms, a
                    Diatom ooze in the Southern Ocean south of the latitude of 45° south, a red clay
                    anywhere within the latitudes of 45° north and south at depths greater than 2200
                    fathoms.</p>
                <p>As long as the conditions of the surface are the same, it might be expected that
                    the deposits at the bottom would also remain the same. In showing that such is
                    not the case, an agent must be taken into account which is in direct correlation
                    with the depth. It may be regarded as established that the majority of the
                    calcareous organisms which make up the <hi rend="italic">Globigerina</hi> and
                    Pteropod oozes live in the surface waters, and it may also be taken for granted
                    that there is always a specific identity between the calcareous organisms which
                    live at the surface and the shells of these pelagic creatures found at the
                    bottom. <hi rend="italic">Globigerina</hi> ooze is found in the tropical zone at
                    depths which do not exceed 2400 fathoms, but when depths of 3000 fathoms are
                    explored in this zone of the Atlantic and Pacific there is found an argillaceous
                    deposit without, in many instances, any trace of calcareous organisms.
                    Descending from the “submarine plateaus” to depths which exceed 2250 fathoms,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Globigerina</hi> ooze gradually disappears, passing into a
                    greyish marl, and finally is wholly replaced by an argillaceous material which
                    covers the bottom at all depths greater than 2900 fathoms.</p>
                <p>The transition between the calcareous formations and the argillaceous ones takes
                    place by almost insensible degrees. The thinner and more delicate shells
                    disappear first. The thicker and larger shells lose little by little the
                    sharpness of their contour and appear to undergo a profound alteration. They
                    assume a brownish colour, and break up in proportion as the calcareous
                    constituent disappears. The red clay predominates more and more as the
                    calcareous element diminishes in the deposit. Recollecting that the most
                    important elements of the organic deposits have descended from the superficial
                    waters, and that the variations in contour of the bed of the sea cannot of
                    themselves prevent the debris of animals and plants from accumulating upon the
                    bottom, their absence in the red clay areas can only be explained by the
                    hypothesis of decomposition.</p>
                <p>Pteropod ooze, it will be remembered, is a calcareous organic deposit, in which
                    the remains of Pteropods and other pelagic Mollusca are present, though they do
                    not always form a preponderating constituent, and it has been found that their
                    presence is in correlation with the bathymetrical distribution.</p>
                <p>In studying the nature of the calcareous elements which are deposited in the
                    abysmal areas, it has been noticed that, like the shells of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Foraminifera,</hi> those of the Thecosomatous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pteropoda,</hi> which live everywhere in the superficial waters, especially in
                    the tropics, become fewer in number in the deposit as the depth increases. It
                    has just been observed that the shells of <hi rend="italic">Foraminifera</hi>
                    disappear gradually along a series of soundings from a point where the <hi
                    rend="italic">Globigerina</hi> ooze has abundance of carbonate of lime, towards
                    deeper regions; but it is also noticed that, when the sounding-rod brings up a
                    graduated series of sediments from a declivity descending into deep water, among
                    the calcareous shells those of the Pteropods and Heteropods disappear first in
                    proportion as the depth increases. At depths less than 1400 fathoms in the
                    tropics a Pteropod ooze is found with abundant remains of Heteropods and
                    Pteropods; deeper soundings then give a <hi rend="italic">Globigcrina</hi> ooze
                    without these Molluscan remains; and in still greater depths, as has been said
                    above, there is a red clay in which calcareous organisms arc nearly, if not
                    quite, absent.</p>
                <p>In this manner, then, it is shown that the remains of calcareous organisms arc
                    completely eliminated in the greatest depths of the ocean. For if such be not
                    the case, why are all these shells found at the bottom in the shallower depths,
                    and not at all in the greater depths, although they are equally abundant on the
                    surface at both places? There is reason to think that this solution of
                    calcareous shells is due to the presence of carbonic acid throughout all depths
                    of ocean water. It is well kno∖vn that this substance, dissolved in water, is an
                    energetic solvent of calcareous matter. The investigations of Buchanan and
                    Dittmar have shown that carbonic acid exists in a free state in sea water, and
                    Dittmar’s analvses also show <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n140/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0140-0125"/> that deep-sea water contains more lime than
                    surface water. This is a confirmation of the theory which regards carbonic acid
                    as the agent concerned in the total or partial solution of the surface shells
                    before or immediately after they reach the bottom of the ocean, and is likewise
                    in relation with the fact that in high latitudes, where fewer calcareous
                    organisms are found at the surface, their remains are removed at lesser depths
                    than where these organisms are in greater abundance. It has been shown that sea
                    water itself has some effect in the solution of carbonate of lime, and further
                    it is probable that the immense pressure to which water is subjected in great
                    depths may have an influence on its chemical activity. Objections have been
                    raised to the explanation here advanced, on account of the alkalinity of sea
                    water, but it may be remarked that alkalinity presents no difficulty which need
                    be here considered (Dittmar, <hi rend="italic">Phys. Chem. Chalk Exp.,</hi>
                    parti., 1884).</p>
                <p>This interpretation also explains how the remains of Diatoms and Radiolarians
                    (surface organisms like the <hi rend="italic">Foramvnifera)</hi> are found in
                    greater abundance in the red clay than in a <hi rend="italic">Globigerina</hi>
                    ooze. The action which suffices to dissolve the calcareous matter has no effect
                    upon the silica, and so the siliceous shells accumulate. Nor is this view of the
                    case opposed to the distribution of the Pteιopod ooze. At first it would be
                    expected that the <hi rend="italic">Foraminifera</hi> shells, being smaller,
                    would disappear from a deposit before the Pteropod shells; but if it be
                    remembered that the latter are very thin and delicate, and, for the quantity of
                    carbonate of lime present, offer a larger surface to the action of the solvent
                    than the thicker, though smaller, <hi rend="italic">Globigerina</hi> shells,
                    this apparent anomaly will be explained.</p>
                <p>The origin of these vast deposits of clay is a problem of the highest interest.
                    It was at first supposed that these sediments were composed of microscopic
                    particles arising from the disintegration of the rocks by rivers and by the
                    waves on the coasts. It was believed that the matters held in suspension were
                    carried far and wide by currents, and gradually fell to the bottom of the sea.
                    But the uniformity of composition presented by these deposits was a great
                    objection to this view. It can be shown that mineral particles, even of the
                    smallest dimensions, continually set adrift upon disturbed waters must, owing to
                    a property of sea water, eventually be precipitated at no great distance from
                    land. It has also been supposed that these argillaceous deposits owe their
                    origin to the inorganic residue of the calcareous shells which are dissolved
                    away in deep water, but this view has no foundation in fact. Everything seems to
                    show that the formation of the clay is due to the decomposition of fragmentary
                    volcanic products, whose presence can be detected over the whole floor of the
                    ocean.</p>
                <p>These volcanic materials are derived from floating pumice, and from volcanic
                    ashes ejected to great distances by terrestrial volcanoes, and carried far by
                    the winds. It is also known that beds of lava and of tufa are laid down upon the
                    bottom of the sea. This assemblage of pyrogenic rocks, rich in silicates of
                    alumina, decomposes under the chemical action of the water, and gives rise, in
                    the same way as do terrestrial volcanic rocks, to argillaceous matters,
                    according to reactions which can always be observed on the surface of the globe,
                    and which are too well known to need special mention here.</p>
                <p>The universal distribution of pumice over the floor of the ocean is very
                    remarkable, and would at first appear unaccountable; but when the fact that
                    pieces of pumice have been known to float in sea water for a period of over
                    three years before becoming sufficiently waterlogged to sink is taken into
                    consideration, it will be readily understood how fragments of this material may
                    be transported by winds and currents to an enormous distance from their point of
                    origin before being deposited upon the bottom. Fragments of pumice are dredged
                    in the greatest profusion in the red clay of the Central Pacific, and much less
                    abundantly in the organic oozes and terrigenous deposits. This is owing to the
                    rate of deposition being much slower in the former than in the latter, where the
                    rapid accumulation of calcareous and siliceous organisms and continental debris
                    masks their presence.</p>
                <p>The detailed microscopic examination of hundreds of soundings has shown that the
                    presence of pumice, of lapilli, of silicates, and of other volcanic minerals in
                    various stages of decomposition can always be demonstrated in the argillaceous
                    matter.</p>
                <p>In the places where the red clay attains its most typical development, the
                    transformation of the volcanic fragments into argillaceous matter may be
                    followed step by step. It may be said to be the direct product of the
                    decomposition of the basic rocks, represented by volcanic glasses, such as
                    hyalomelan and tachylite. This decomposition, in spite of the temperature
                    approximating to zero (32° F.), gives rise, as an ultimate product, to clearly
                    crystallized minerals, which may be considered the most remarkable products of
                    the chemical action of the sea upon the volcanic matters undergoing
                    decomposition. These microscopic crystals are zeolites lying free in the
                    deposit, and are met with in greatest abundance in the typical red-clay areas of
                    the Central Pacific. They are simple, twinned, or spheroidal groups, which
                    scarcely exceed half a millimetre in diameter. The crystallographic and chemical
                    study of them shows that they must be referred to christianite. It is known how
                    easily the zeolites crystallize in the pores of eruptive rocks in process of
                    decomposition; and the crystals of christianite, which are observed in
                    considerable quantities in the clay of the centre of the Pacific</p>
                <p>(fig. 5), have been formed at the expense of the decomposing volcanic matters
                    spread out upon the bed of that ocean.</p>
                <p>In connexion with this formation of zeolites, reference may be made to a chemical
                    process which gives rise to the formation of nodules of manganiferous iron.
                    These nodules are almost universally distributed in oceanic sediments, but are
                    met with in the greatest abundance in the red clay. This association tends to
                    show a common origin. It is exactly in those regions where there is an
                    accumulation of pyroxenic lavas in decomposition, containing silicates with a
                    base of manganese and iron, such for example as augite, hornblende, olivine,
                    magnetite, and basic glasses, that manganese nodules occur in greatest numbers.
                    In the regions where the sedimentary action, mechanical and organic, is, as it
                    were, suspended, and where everything shows an extreme slowness of
                    deposition,—in these calm waters favourable to chemical reactions, ferro -
                    manganiferous substances form concretions around organic and inorganic
                    centres.</p>
                <p>These concentrations of ferric and manganic oxides, mixed with argillaceous
                    materials whose form and dimensions are extremely variable, belong generally to
                    the earthy variety or wad, but pass sometimes, though rarely, into varieties of
                    hydrated oxide of manganese with distinct indications of radially fibrous
                    crystallization? The interpretation necessary, in order to explain this
                    formation of manganese nodules, is the same as that admitted in explanation of
                    the formation of coatings of this material on the surface of terrestrial rocks.
                    These salts of manganese and iron, dissolved in water by carbonic acid, then
                    precipitated in the form of carbonate of protoxide of iron and manganese, become
                    oxidized, and give rise in the calm and deep oceanic regions to more or less
                    pure ferro-manganiferous concretions. At the same time it must be admitted that
                    rivers may bring to the ocean a contribution of the, same substances.</p>
                <p>Among the bodies which, in certain regions where red clay predominates, serve as
                    centres for these manganiferous nodules are the remains of vertebrates. These
                    remains are the hardest parts of the skeleton—tympanic bones of whales, beaks of
                    <hi rend="italic">Ziphius,</hi> teeth of sharks; and, just as the calcareous
                    shells are eliminated in great depths, so all the remains of the larger
                    vertebrates are absent, except the most resistant portions. These bones often
                    serve as a centre for the manganese iron concretions, being frequently
                    surrounded by layers several <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> For the composition

                    some sharks’ teeth and Cetacean ear-bones, some of which belong to extinct
                    species, are surrounded with thick layers of the manganese, and others with
                    merely a slight coating.</p>
                <p>The cosmic spherules incidentally referred to under the description of red clay
                    may be here described in greater detail· If a magnet be plunged into an oceanic
                    deposit, especially a red clay from the central parts of the Pacific, particles
                    are extracted, some of which are magnetite from volcanic rocks, to which
                    vitreous matters are often attached; others again are quite isolated, and differ
                    in most of their properties from the former. The latter are generally round,
                    measuring hardly 0’2 mm., usually smaller; their surface is quite covered with a
                    brilliant black coating having all the properties of magnetic oxide of iron;
                    often there may be noticed clearly marked upon them cup-like depressions (figs.
                    7 and 8). If these spherules be broken down in an agate mortar, the brilliant
                    black coating easily falls away and reveals white or grey metallic malleable
                    nuclei, which may be beaten out by the pestle into thin lamellae. This metallic
                    centre, when treated with an acid solu tion of sulphate of copper, immediately
                    assumes a coppery coat, thus showing that it is native iron. But there are some
                    malleable metallic nuclei extracted from the spherules which do not give this
                    reaction; they do not take the copper coating.</p>
                <p>Chemical reactions show that they contain cobalt and nickel; very probably they
                    constitute an alloy of iron and these two metals, such as is often found in
                    meteorites, and whose presence in large quantities hinders the production of the
                    coppery coating on the iron. G. Rose has shown that this coating of black oxide
                    of iron is found on the periphery of meteorites of native iron, and its presence
                    is readily understood when their cosmic origin is admitted. Indeed, these
                    meteoric particles of native iron in their transit through the air must undergo
                    combustion, and, like small portions of iron from a smith’s anvil, be
                    transformed either entirely or at the surface only into magnetic oxide, and in
                    the latter case the nucleus is protected from further oxidation by the coating
                    which thus covers it.</p>
                <p>One may suppose that meteorites in their passage through the atmosphere break
                    into numerous fragments, that incandescent particles of iron are thrown off all
                    round them, and that these eventually fall to the surface of the globe as almost
                    impalpable dust, in the form of magnetic oxide of iron more or less completely
                    fused. The luminous train of falling stars is probably due to the combustion of
                    these innumerable particles resembling the sparks which fly from a ribbon of
                    iron burnt in oxygen, or the particles of the same metal thrown off when
                    striking a flint. It is easy to show that these particles in burning take a
                    spherical form, and are surrounded by a layer of black magnetic oxide.</p>
                <p>Among the magnetic grains found under the same conditions as those just described
                    are other spherules, which are referred to the <hi rend="italic">chondres,</hi>
                    so that, if the interpretation of a cosmic origin for the magnetic spherules
                    with a metallic centre were not established in a manner absolutely beyond
                    question, it almost becomes so when their association with the silicate
                    spherules, which will now be described, is taken into account. It will be seen
                    by the microscopic details that these spherules have quite the constitution and
                    structure of <hi rend="italic">chondres</hi> so frequent in meteorites of the
                    most ordinary type, and on the other hand they have never been found, as far as
                    is known, in rocks of a terrestrial origin; in short, the presence of these
                    spherules in the deep-sea deposits, and their association with the metallic
                    spherules, are matters of prime importance.</p>
                <p>Among the fragments attracted by the magnet in deep-sea deposits are
                    distinguished granules slightly larger than the spherules with the shining black
                    coating above described. These are yellowish-brown, with a bronze-like lustre,
                    and under the microscope it is noticed that the surface, instead of being quite
                    smooth, is grooved by thin lamellae. Their dimensions never attain a millimetre,
                    generally they are about 0 ’ 5 mm. in diameter; they are never perfect spheres,
                    as in the case of the black spherules with a metallic centre; and sometimes a
                    depression more or less marked is to be observed in the periphery. When examined
                    by the microscope it is observed that the lamellae which .compose them are
                    applied the one against the other, and have a radial eccentric disposition. It
                    is the leafy radial structure <hi rend="italic">{radialblättrig),</hi> like that
                    of the chondres of bronzite, which predominates in these spherules. The serial
                    structure of the chondres with olivine is observed much less rarely, and indeed
                    there is some doubt about the indications of this last type of structure. Fig. 9
                    shows the characters and texture of one of these spherules magnified 25
                    diameters. On account of their small dimensions, as well as of their friability
                    due to their lamellar structure, it is difficult to polish one of these
                    spherules, and it has been necessary to study them with reflected light, or to
                    limit the observations to the study of the broken fragments.</p>
                <p>These spherules break up following the lamellae, which latter are seen to be
                    extremely fine and perfectly transparent. In rotating between crossed niçois
                    they have the extinctions of the rhombic system, and in making use of the
                    condenser it is seen that they have one optic axis. It is observed also that
                    when several of these lamellae are attached they extinguish exactly at the same
                    time, so that everything tends to show that they form a single individual.</p>
                <p>In studying these transparent and very thin fragments with the aid of a high
                    magnifying power, it is observed that they are dotted with brown-black
                    inclusions, disposed with a certainsymmetry, and showing somewhat regular
                    contours; these inclusions are referred to magnetic iron, and their presence
                    explains why these spherules of bronzite are extracted by the magnet. It should
                    be observed, hoιvever, that they are not so strongly magnetic as those with a
                    metallic nucleus.</p>
                <p>They are designated bronzite rather than enstatite, because of the somewhat deep
                    tint which they present; they are insoluble in hydrochloric acid. Owing to the
                    small quantity of substance, only a qualitative analysis could be made, which
                    showed the presence in them of silica, magnesia, and iron.</p>
                <p>The study of deep-sea deposits suggests some interesting conclusions. It has been
                    said that the debris carried away from the land accumulates at the bottom of the
                    sea before reaching the abysmal regions of the ocean. It is only in exceptional
                    cases that the finest terrigenous materials are transported several hundred
                    miles from the shores. In place of layers formed of pebbles and clastic elements
                    with grains of considerable dimensions, which play so large a part in the
                    composition of emerged lands, the great areas of the ocean basins are covered by
                    the microscopic remains of pelagic organisms, or by the deposits coming from the
                    alteration of volcanic products. The distinctive elements that appear in the
                    river and coast sediments are, properly speaking, wanting in the great depths
                    far distant from the coasts. To such a degree is this the case that in a great
                    number of soundings, from the centre of the Pacific for example, no mineral
                    particles on which the mechanical action of water had left its imprint have been
                    distinguished, and quartz is so rare that it may be said to be absent. It is
                    sufficient to indicate these facts in order to make apparent the profound
                    differences which separate the deposits of the abysmal areas of the ocean basins
                    from the series of rocks in the geological formations. As regards the vast
                    deposits of red clay, with its manganese concretions, its zeolites, cosmic dust,
                    and remains of vertebrates, and the organic oozes which are spread out over the
                    bed of the Central Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, have they their
                    analogues in the geological series of rocks? If it be proved that in the
                    sedimentary strata the true pelagic sediments are not represented, it follows
                    that deep and extended oceans like those of the present day cannot formerly have
                    occupied the areas of the present continents, and as a corollary the great lines
                    of the oceanic basins and continents must have been marked out from the earliest
                    geological ages.</p>
                <p>Without asserting that the terrestrial areas and the areas covered by the waters
                    of the great ocean basins have had their main lines marked out since the
                    commencement of geological history, it is a fact proved by the evidence of the
                    pelagic sediments that these areas have a great antiquity. The accumulation of
                    sharks’ teeth, of the earbones of Cetaceans, of manganese concretions, of
                    zeolites, of volcanic material in an advanced state of decomposition, and of
                    cosmic dust, at points far removed from the continents, tends to prove this.
                    There is no reason for supposing that the parts of the ocean where <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0142-0127"/> these vertebrate remains are found are more
                    frequented by sharks or Cetaceans than other regions where they are never, or
                    only rarely, dredged from the deposits at the bottom. When it is remembered also
                    that these ear-bones, teeth of sharks, and volcanic fragments are sometimes
                    incrusted with two centimetres of manganese oxide, while others have a mere
                    coating, and that some of the bones and teeth belong to extinct species, it may
                    be concluded with great certainty that the clays of these oceanic basins have
                    accumulated with extreme slowness. It is indeed almost beyond question that the
                    red-clay regions of the Central Pacific contain accumulations belonging to
                    geological ages different from our own. The great antiquity of these formations
                    is likewise confirmed in a striking manner by the presence of cosmic fragments,
                    the nature of which has been described. In order to account for the accumulation
                    of all these substances in such relatively great abundance in the areas where
                    they were dredged, it is necessary to suppose the oceanic basins to have
                    remained the same for a vast period of time.</p>
                <p>The sharks’ teeth, ear-bones, manganese nodules, altered volcanic fragments,
                    zeolites, and cosmic dust are met with in greatest abundance in the red clays of
                    the Central Pacific, at that point on the earth’s surface farthest removed from
                    continental land. They are less abundant in the Radiolarian ooze, are rare in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Globigerina,</hi> Diatom, and Pteropod oozes, and have
                    been, dredged only in a few instances in the terrigenous deposits close to the
                    shore. These substances are present in all the deposits, but owing to the
                    abundance of other matters in the more rapidly forming deposits their presence
                    is masked, and the chance of dredging them is reduced. The greater or less
                    abundance of these materials, which are so characteristic of a true red clay,
                    may be regarded as a measure of the relative rate of accumulation of the marine
                    sediments in which they lie. The terrigenous deposits accumulate most rapidly;
                    then follow in order Pteropod ooze, <hi rend="italic">Globigerina</hi> ooze,
                    Diatom ooze, Radiolarian ooze, and, slowest of all, red clay.</p>
                <p>Prom the data now advanced it appears possible to deduce other conclusions
                    important from a geological point of view. In the deposits due essentially to
                    the action of the ocean, the great variety of sediments which may accumulate in
                    regions where the external conditions are almost identical is very striking.
                    Again, marine faunas and floras, at least those of the surface, differ greatly,
                    both with respect to species and the relative abundance of individuals, in
                    different regions of the ocean; and, as their remains determine the character of
                    the deposit in many instances, it is legitimate to conclude that the occurrence
                    of organisms of a different nature in several beds is not an argument against
                    the synchronism of the layers which contain them. In this connexion may be noted
                    the fact that in certain regions of the deep sea no appreciable formation is now
                    taking place. Hence the absence, in the sedimentary series, of a layer
                    representing a definite horizon must not always be interpreted as proof either
                    of the emergence of the bottom of the sea during the corresponding period, or of
                    an ulterior erosion.</p>
                <p>The small extent occupied by littoral formations, especially those of an
                    arenaceous nature, and the relatively slow rate at which such deposits are
                    formed along a stable coast, are matters of importance. In the present state of
                    things there does not appear to be anything to account for the enormous
                    thickness of the clastic sediments making up certain geological formations,
                    unless the exceptional cases of erosion which are brought into play when a coast
                    is undergoing constant elevation or subsidence are considered. Great movements
                    of the land are doubtless necessary for the formation of thick beds of
                    transported matter like sandstones and conglomerates. Arenaceous formations of
                    great thickness require seas of no great extent and coasts subject to frequent
                    oscillations, which permit the shores to advance and retire. Along these,
                    through all periods of the earth’s history, the great marine sedimentary
                    phenomena have taken place.</p>
                <p>The continental geological formations, when compared with marine deposits of
                    modern seas and oceans, present no analogues to the red clays, Radiolarian, <hi
                    rend="italic">Globigerina,</hi> Pteropod, and Diatom oozes. On the other hand,
                    the terrigenous deposits of lakes, shallow seas, enclosed seas, and the shores
                    of the continents reveal the equivalents of the chalks, greensands, sandstones,
                    conglomerates, shales, marls, and other sedimentary formations. Such formations
                    as certain Tertiary deposits of Italy and the Radiolarian earth from Barbados,
                    where pelagic conditions are indicated, must be regarded as having been laid
                    down rather along the border of a continent than in a true oceanic area. The
                    white chalk is evidently not a deep-sea deposit, for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Foraminifera</hi> and fragments of other organisms of which it is largely
                    composed are similar to those found in comparatively shallow water not far from
                    land. The argillaceous and calcareous rocks recently discovered by Dr Guppy in
                    the upraised coral islands in the Solomon group are identical with the deposits
                    now forming around oceanic islands. Regions situated similarly to enclosed and
                    shallow seas and the borders of the present continents appear to have been,
                    throughout all geological ages, the theatre of the greatest and most remarkable
                    changes; in short, all, or nearly all, the sedimentary rocks of the continents
                    would seem to have been built up in areas like those now occupied by the
                    terrigenous deposits.</p>
                <p>During each era of the earth’s history the borders of some lands have sunk
                    beneath the sea and been covered by marine sediments, while in other parts the
                    terrigenous deposits have been elevated into dry land, and have carried with
                    them a record of the organisms which flourished in the sea of the time. In this
                    transitional area there has been throughout a continuity of geological and
                    biological phenomena.</p>
                <p>Krom these considerations it will be evident that the character of a deposit is
                    determined much more by distance from the shore of a continent than by actual
                    depth; and the same would appear to be the case with respect to the fauna spread
                    over the floor of the present oceans. Dredgings near the shores of continents,
                    in depths of 1000, 2000, or 3000 fathoms, are more productive both in species
                    and individuals than dredgings at similar depths several hundred miles seawards.
                    Again, among the few species dredged in the abysmal areas farthest removed from
                    land, the majority show archaic characters, or belong to groups which have a
                    wide distribution in time as well as over the floor of the present oceans. Such
                    are the <hi rend="italic">Hexactinellida, Brachiopoda,</hi> Stalked Crinoids and
                    other Echinoderms, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>As already mentioned, the “transitional area” is that which now shows the
                    greatest variety in respect to biological and physical conditions, and in past
                    time it has been subject to the most frequent and the greatest amount of change.
                    The animals now living in this area may be regarded as the greatly modified
                    descendants of those which have lived in similar regions in past geological
                    ages, and some of whose ancestors have been preserved in the sedimentary rocks
                    as fossils. On the other hand, many of the animals dredged in the abysmal
                    regions are most probably also the descendants of animals which lived in the
                    shallower waters of former geological periods^ but migrated into deep water to
                    escape the severe struggle for existence which must always have obtained in
                    shallower waters influenced by light, heat, motion, and other favourable
                    conditions. Having found existence possible in the less favourable and deeper
                    water, they may be regarded as having slowly spread themselves over the floor of
                    the ocean, but without undergoing great modifications, owing to the extreme
                    uniformity of the conditions and the absence of competition. Or it may be
                    supposed that, in the depressions which have taken place near coasts, some
                    species have been gradually carried down to deep water, have accommodated
                    themselves to the new conditions, and have gradually migrated to the regions far
                    from land. A few species may thus have migrated to the deep sea during each
                    geological period. In this way the origin and distribution of the deep-sea fauna
                    in the present oceans may in some measure be explained. In like manner, the
                    pelagic fauna and flora of the ocean is most probably derived originally from
                    the shore and shallow water. During each period of the earth’s history a few
                    animals and plants have been carried to sea, and have ultimately adopted a
                    pelagic mode of life.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Islands.</hi></p>
                <p>The Pacific Ocean is distinguished from the Atlantic by the greater number of
                    small island groups that diversify its surface. The continental islands, lying
                    along the coasts of America and Asia, have been referred to in speaking of the
                    coasts; the islands of the Malay Archipelago, Australia, New Zealand, and
                    probably New Caledonia belong to the same class. The true oceanic islands on the
                    other hand have no direct geological connexion with the continents; the older
                    sedimentary and metamorphic rocks appear to be quite absent, the islands being
                    either of eruptive or coral formation. The fauna and flora of the oceanic
                    islands present a considerable amount of uniformity, though each island or
                    important group of islands has its peculiar species. There is an entire absence
                    of terrestrial Mammalia. The genera and species are few in number when compared
                    with those of the continents and continental islands from which they would
                    appear to have been originally derived by immigration, and subsequently to have
                    undergone modification. Recent researches appear also to show that the dredgings
                    around oceanic islands yield fewer genera and species than dredgings at similar
                    depths along the shores of continents, although the numbers of individuals of a
                    few species may be extraordinarily abundant.</p>
                <p>The most · northern oceanic group is the Hawaiian Archipelago or Sandwich Islands
                    (see vol. xi. p. 528), stretching for about 340 miles between the latitudes of
                    18° 52' and 22° 15' N., and the meridians of 154° 42' and 160° 33' W.; it
                    consists of eight large islands—Hawaii (Owhyhee), Maui (Mowee), Kahulaui
                    (Tahooroway), Lanai <pb break="no"

                    (Atooi), and Niihau (Oneehoow), and four small barren islets, the entire area
                    being 6100 square miles. The islands of this group are mountainous, and abound
                    in active volcanoes; the great lake of fire, Kilauea, on the east side of the
                    Mountain of Mauna Loa (13,760 feet) in Hawaii is probably the largest active
                    crater in the world, while one of the largest known extinct craters is that of
                    Mauna Haleakala (“The House of the Sun”) in Maui, at a height of 10,200 feet
                    above the sea; it is 12 miles in circumference. The Hawaiian Islands being
                    within the zone of coral formation are surrounded by fringing reefs, and there
                    is abundant evidence that gradual upheaval has taken place over the whole area
                    which they occupy. There are beds of coral limestone in Molokai at a height of
                    400 feet, and in Kauai coral sand is found at an elevation of 4000 feet above
                    the sea; in many other islands coral and lava are found interstratified.</p>
                <p>The three groups of the Bonin Islands known as the Parry, Beechy, and Coffin
                    groups are composed of high rocky islets of a bold and fantastic outline, and
                    are situated between 26° and 27° N. lat.</p>
                <p>The Ladrones or Mariana Islands (see vol. xiv. p. 199) have a total area of 395
                    square miles; they stretch for nearly 450 miles between 13° and 20° N. lat. and
                    144° 37' and 145° 55' E. long. These islands are all of volcanic origin, and
                    their mountains contain several active volcanoes.</p>
                <p>The Caroline Archipelago (see vol. v. p. 125) lies about 170 miles to the south
                    of the Ladrones, and, together with the Pelew Islands, has an area of 877 square
                    miles. The Carolines embrace forty distinct island groups, five of which are
                    basaltic and mountainous, though surrounded by coral reefs; the remaining
                    thirty-five groups are entirely of coral formation, and do not rise much above
                    the sea-level. The Pelew Islands resemble the Carolines in their physical
                    characters; they present peculiarities in the arrangement of atolls which will
                    be alluded to below.</p>
                <p>The Marshall Islands (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Micronesia,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 256)
                    consist of two chains running parallel to each other, and composed of fourteen
                    and seventeen small groups respectively. They lie to the eastward of the
                    Carolines, and are entirely of organic formation.</p>
                <p>The Gilbert Archipelago (see vol. xvi. p. 256) is cut by the equator. It contains
                    sixteen groups of small coral islands, low and barren, but densely
                    populated.</p>
                <p>In the South Pacific oceanic islands are scattered with the greatest profusion
                    over a region between 5° and 25° S. lat. and 180° to 120° W. long. The northern
                    part of the shallow water surrounding Australia, New Zealand, and the Malay
                    Archipelago is occupied by the Solomon Islands, the New Hebrides, the bold rocky
                    and mountainous islands of Fiji with fine barrier reefs, the Friendly Islands,
                    and Samoa or the Navigators’ Islands. Farther to the south there are the Society
                    Islands, including Tahiti; they are lofty, of volcanic origin, and surrounded by
                    very perfect barrier reefs. The Marquesas or Mendana Archipelago, farther to the
                    north, also consists of volcanic islands, but they are not fringed by reefs.</p>
                <p>The volcanic group of the Galapagos Archipelago is situated under the equator at
                    a distance of 500 or 600 miles from the west coast of South America; it has been
                    minutely described by Darwin.</p>
                <p>The extensive Lo∖v or Paumotu Archipelago lies to the south-east of the Society
                    Islands, and runs parallel to them. It consists of about eighty atolls, some of
                    them of large size, and all typical examples of this form of coral island.</p>
                <p>The total area of the islands of the Pacific is exceedingly small, especially
                    when the vast number of groups that stud the ocean is taken into
                    consideration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theory of Coral Islands.</hi></p>
                <p>The origin of coral islands was specially studied by Darwin during the voyage of
                    the “Beagle” in 1831-36, and he shortly afterwards published a theory on the
                    subject which has been fully detailed in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Coral</hi> (vol. vi. p. 377). This theory was so simple, and it appeared so
                    complete, that it acquired univeι ’ sal acceptance; and the continuous action of
                    subsidence in promoting the development of fringing reefs into barriers, and of
                    barriers into atolls, was long unquestioned. In 1851 L. Agassiz<note

                    insufficient to explain the formation of the coral reefs and keys of Florida. In
                    1863 Carl Semper stated that an attentive study of the Pelew Islands showed the
                    complete inadequacy of this theory, and in 1868 he reiterated his
                    convictions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    theory of coral island formation which claims to account for all the phenomena
                    without calling in the aid of subsidence. It is pointed out that, with hardly an
                    exception, the oceanic islands are of volcanic origin, and it is assumed that
                    the various peaks which deep-sea soundings have shown to be scattered over the
                    bed of the ocean, and rising to within varioùs distances of the surface, are
                    also, primarily, of volcanic origin. There is no evidence of any extensive
                    submerged continent or mass of land such as Darwin’s theory requires. Whether
                    built up sufficiently high to rise above the surface of the sea and thus form
                    islands, or brought up only to varying heights below the sea-level, these
                    volcanic eminences tend to become platforms on which coral reefs may be formed.
                    The erosive action of waves and tides tends to reduce all volcanic summits down
                    to the lower limit of breaker action, thus producing platforms on which barrier
                    reefs and atolls may spring up. Again, submarine eminences may be brought up to
                    the zone of the reef builders by the deposit of volcanic and organic detritus
                    falling from the surface, as well as through the agency of organisms secreting
                    lime and silica, which live in profusion at great depths, especially on the tops
                    of submarine peaks and banks. The great profusion of life in the tropical
                    surface waters is insisted upon, and it is pointed out that this pelagic life
                    supplies the reef-building corals with food, an&lt;l that, when these surface
                    creatures die and their shells fall to the bottom, they carry down with them
                    sufficient organic matter to furnish food to the animals living on the floor of
                    the ocean. As the result of tow-net experiments in the tropics Mr Murray
                    estimated that, in the surface waters of the ocean, there were in a mass 1 mile
                    square by 100 fathoms, 16 tons of carbonate of lime existing in the form of
                    shells of pelagic <hi rend="italic">Foraminifera</hi> and Molluscs. In this way
                    it is urged that submarine banks are continually being brought within the zone
                    of reef-building corals. Darwin admitted that reefs not to be distinguished from
                    atolls might be formed on such submarine banks, but the improbability of so many
                    submerged banks existing caused him to dismiss this explanation without further
                    consideration. He was not, however, aware of the great number of submerged cones
                    which recent soundings have made known, nor of the enormous abundance of minute
                    calcareous organisms—such as calcareous algae, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Foraminifera,</hi> and Molluscs in the surface waters—and of the comparatively
                    rapid rate at which their remains might accumulate on the sea bottom. Nor had he
                    any idea of the comparatively great abundance of animals living at considerable
                    depths.</p>
                <p>Coral-reef builders starting on a bank, whether formed by elevation or
                    subsidence, by erosion or the upward growth of deep-sea deposits composed
                    largely of organic remains, tend ultimately to assume the atoll or baιτier form.
                    When the coral reef or colony approaches the surface, the central portions are
                    gradually placed at a disadvantage as compared with the peripheral parts of the
                    mass, in being farther removed from the food supply which is brought by the
                    oceanic currents, and consequently dwindle and die. In proportion as the reef
                    approaches the surface, the centre becomes cut off from the food supply and the
                    conditions become increasingly uncongenial. At last an outer ring of vigorously
                    growing reef corals encloses a central lagoon. The windward side of the reef
                    grows most vigorously, not because of a larger supply of oxygen and greater
                    aeration of the water, but because that is the direction in which the oceanic
                    currents bring the food to the reef. As the atoll extends seawards from vigorous
                    growth the lagoon becomes larger, chiefly from the removal of lime in solution
                    by the action of the carbonic acid in sea water which flows in and out at e’ach
                    tide. This solvent action of sea water on dead calcareous organisms was shown by
                    the “Challenger’s” observations to be universal.</p>
                <p>Mr Murray reverses the order of growth as given by Darwin for the groups in the
                    Indian Ocean. He regards the Laccadive, Caroline, and Chagos archipelagos as
                    various stages in the growth of coral reefs towards the surface, and he explains
                    the various appearances<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n144/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0144-0129"/> in the Maidive group of atolls without any
                    necessity for disseverment by oceanic currents as argued by Darwin. Precisely
                    the same explanation is applied to the case of a barrier reef. It commences in
                    the shallow water near the shore, and afterwards extends seawards on a talus
                    built up of lumps of coral broken off by the surf. A very careful examination of
                    the barrier reef at Tahiti was made by Lieutenant Swire of H.M.S. “Challenger”
                    and Mr Murray, and they found that such an explanation was completely justified
                    by the form and nature of the reef. There was much dead coral on the inner side
                    of the barrier, which in many places was perpendicular or even overhanging;
                    while, on the contrary, the outer surface was all alive, and sloped gradually
                    seawards. A section of it, drawn to a true scale, is given in fig. 10.</p>
                <p>This section shows that a ledge, over which there is a depth of from 30 to 40
                    fathoms of water, runs out for 250 yards from the edge of the reef. This ledge
                    is covered with luxuriant heads and bosses of coral. Beyond it there is a steep
                    irregular slope at an angle of about 45°, the talus being formed apparently of
                    coral masses broken off from the ledge, and piled up; this slope is covered with
                    living Sponges, Alcyonarians, Hydroids, <hi rend="italic">Polyzoa,
                    Foraminrfera,</hi> and other forms of life. The angle of inclination then
                    decreases to 30°, and the ground is covered with coral sand; while beyond 500
                    yards from the edge of the reef the declivity is insignificant, only 6°, and
                    there is a bed of mud containing volcanic and coral sand mixed with Pteropod and
                    other shells, in 590 fathoms of water. The vast perpendicular wall of coral
                    limestone descending into unfathomable depths, which has been supposed usually
                    to mark the outside of a coral reef, has always been looked upon as a conclusive
                    proof of great subsidence having taken place; but the depth and the slope of
                    such limestone walls have been greatly exaggerated, and no means have been taken
                    to ascertain beyond doubt that the rock is formed of coral throughout. The
                    probability is that only the upper portion of such a wall is true coral
                    limestone; and Dr Guppy has recently shown that this is actually the case in
                    some upraised coral islands of the Solomon group. Upheaval has taken place to a
                    considerable extent in the oceanic islands, and more extended examination of the
                    limestone cliffs of other coral islands will probably lead to the discovery of
                    many such cases. Mr Murray holds that the characteristic form of barrier reefs
                    and atolls is in no way dependent on subsidence, that subsidence is not the
                    cause of their peculiar features, that these reefs may be met with indifferently
                    in stationary areas, in areas of subsidence, and in areas of elevation, and that
                    elevation and subsidence only modify in a minor way the appearance of the
                    islands.</p>
                <p>The chief phenomena are accounted for—(1) by a physiological fact,—the very
                    vigorous growth of the reef-forming species on the outer or seaward face of the
                    reef where there is abundance of food, and the much less vigorous growth, and
                    even death, of these species on the inner parts of the reefs and in the lagoons,
                    where there is much less food, and where there are other conditions inimical to
                    growth; and (2) by a physical and chemical fact,—the removal of lime in
                    suspension and in solution from the inner portions of the reefs and from the
                    lagoons, where much dead coral is exposed to the action of seawater containing
                    carbonic acid, the result being the formation, the deepening, and the widening
                    of lagoons and lagoon channels.</p>
