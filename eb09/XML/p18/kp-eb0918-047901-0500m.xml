                <p><label type="entry">PELOPIDAS</label>, a distinguished Greek general, who, in
                    conjunction with Epaminondas, raised his native city Thebes to a pitch of power
                    such as she never attained to before or afterwards. He was the son of Hippoclus
                    and member of an illustrious Theban family. The large property to which he
                    succeeded in his youth, and which he seems to have increased by a brilliant
                    marriage, was liberally employed by him in the relief of the destitute. When he
                    could not persuade his friend Epaminondas to share his wealth, he imitated that
                    great man in the stern simplicity and frugality of his life and in his cheerful
                    endurance of hardships. Though his taste for hunting and gymnastics, and his
                    fiery temper, contrasted with the studious habits and the “gentle and majestic
                    patience” of his friend, no one appreciated better than Pelopidas the greatness
                    of Epaminondas, to whom, if inferior as a general and a statesman, he was equal
                    in romantic courage and unselfish devotion to his fatherland. Their friendship
                    continued unbroken till death. It was cemented by a battle in which Epaminondas
                    saved the life of Pelopidas. When the Spartans under Phaebidas seized the Cadmea
                    or citadel of Thebes (summer of 383 or 382 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi>
                    Pelopidas, as a member of the democratic club which was opposed to the Spartans,
                    was forced to flee. Along with other exiles he found a refuge at Athens.
                    Epaminondas, protected from suspicion by his poverty and his studies, was
                    suffered to remain in Thebes. Though a very young man, Pelopidas took a leading
                    part in persuading his fellow-exiles to strike a blow for the liberation of
                    Thebes. Having concerted a plan with their friends in Thebes, Pelopidas, with a
                    few companions, entered the city in disguise, surprised and slew the magistrates
                    favourable to Sparta, and roused the people to attack the Spartan garrison in
                    the citadel. But the Spartans capitulated and marched out. This happened in the
                    early winter of 379. Pelopidas and two others of the liberators were elected
                    “baeotarchs,” or chief magistrates of Baeotia, an office which had been in
                    abeyance for some years. Henceforward to the end of his life Pelopidas was
                    annually elected to one of the chief offices of the state. The treacherous
                    attempt made soon afterwards by the Spartan Sphodrias to seize the Piraeus was
                    said, with little probability, to have been instigated by Pelopidas in order to
                    embroil Sparta with Athens. The liberation of Thebes was followed by some years
                    of desultory warfare with Sparta. At Tanagra, however, Pelopidas defeated the
                    enemy and slew the Spartan governor. Still more brilliant was the victory gained
                    by him at Tegyra over a numerically superior force of two Spartan divisions. His
                    success was due chiefly to the disciplined valour of the</p>
                <p>Sacred Band, a picked regiment of 300 men, whom Pelopidas led to glory on many a
                    bloody field. The battle of Tegyra, as the first occasion on which the Spartans
                    had ever been worsted by an inferior force, made a deep impression on Greece. At
                    the great battle of Leuctra (July 371), which permanently crippled the power of
                    Sparta, Pelopidas and the Sacred Band were again conspicuous. Pelopidas was one
                    of the generals in command of the Theban army which invaded the Peloponnesus in
                    370-369, and he joined with Epaminondas in persuading their colleagues to
                    prosecute the campaign even after the expiry of their year of office. For this
                    the two friends were tried for their life, but acquitted. Soon afterwards
                    (apparently in 369), in response to a petition of the Thessalians, Pelopidas was
                    despatched with an army to Thessaly against Alexander, tyrant of Pherae. After
                    occupying Larissa and freeing the Thessalians from the oppression of the tyrant,
                    Pelopidas marched into Macedonia, where, at the request of the belligerents, he
                    acted as arbitrator between Alexander king of Macedonia and the pretender
                    Ptolemaeus. Having concluded an alliance with the Macedonian king, he brought
                    back to Thebes, amongst other hostages, the youthful Philip, brother of the king
                    and afterwards father of Alexander the Great. In the following year (368),
                    Pelopidas returned to Thessaly as ambassador and without an army. Learning that
                    Ptolemaeus had killed Alexander of Macedonia and seized the throne, he collected
                    a body of mercenaries and marched against him. Ptolemaeus induced the troops of
                    Pelopidas to desert their leader, but he was too prudent to press his advantage,
                    and agreed to act as regent for the brothers of the late king and to be an ally
                    of Thebes. On his return from Macedonia Pelopidas was seized and detained by
                    Alexander of Pherae. From this captivity, in which his scornful bearing excited
                    the wonder of his captor, he was released by a Theban force under Epaminondas.
                    By the exertions of Epaminondas and Pelopidas, Thebes had by this time become
                    the most powerful state in Greece; and that she might be formally recognized as
                    such Pelopidas was sent as ambassador (367) to the Persian court. Favourably
                    impressed by the renown and still more by the personal character of the envoy,
                    the Persian king, Artaxerxes, loaded him with marks of honour and ratified all
                    his proposals. These were, that Messene should be independent, that Athens
                    should lay up her warships, and that any city which declined to follow the
                    leadership of Thebes should be treated as an enemy by Persia. The purpose of the
                    treaty, to strengthen Thebes by weakening Athens and Sparta, was obvious. It
                    found no favour with the Greek states and remained a dead letter. In 364 the
                    Thessalian towns once more appealed to Pelopidas for help against their old
                    enemy Alexander of Pherae. Disregarding an ominous eclipse of the sun, Pelopidas
                    pushed on with a handful of troops, leaving the main body to follow. At the
                    heights of Cynoscephalae, near Pharsalus, he came up with the tyrant Alexander
                    at the head of a much superior force. The valour of Pelopidas secured another
                    victory, but it was his last,—catching sight of his hated foe, he rushed on him
                    single-handed and fell covered with wounds. The Thessalians, in whose cause he
                    died, requested and received the honour of carrying the hero to his last home,
                    and the crowns, trophies, and golden arms by which the coffin was surrounded
                    bore witness to the love and sorrow of a whole people. His friend did not long
                    survive him. He too was to die fighting his country’s battles in a foreign land.
                    The pre-eminence of Thebes was the work of these two men alone, and with them it
                    passed away.</p>
