                    form Peter (∏∈τpos) and in the Graecized form Cephas (K^&lt;∕&gt;ας) of the
                    Aramaic Kepha (KS'3). Simon is the name by -which he is always addressed by
                    Jesus Christ; Peter is that by which he is most commonly spoken of in the
                    Synoptic Gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, and subsequent ecclesiastical
                    literature; the combined name, Simon Peter, is found once in St Matthew, once in
                    St Luke, and frequently in St John; sometimes Peter is expressly stated to be a
                    surname (Matt. iv. 18, x. 2; Acts X. 5, 18, 32, xi. 13); St Paul, in 1 Cor. and
                    in Gal. i. 18, ii. 11, 14 (according to the chief uncial MSS., except D), uses
                    Cephas, but in Gal. ii. 7, 8, he uses Peter.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    referred to Peter.</p></note> The name of his father is also found in two forms,
                    John (’Ιωάννας, <hi rend="italic">Ίωάνης,</hi> in most MSS. of John i. 42, xxi.
                    15, 16) and Jonas (<hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> Iωvαs, Matt. xvi. 17, and cod.
                    A in John). In John i. 44 he is said to have been of Bethsaida, which was
                    possibly the place of his birth; but it appears from Mark i. 29 ( = Matt. viii.
                    14; Luke iv. 38) that he and his brother Andrew had a house together at
                    Capernaum. With the same brother, and with James and John as partners, he was
                    engaged in what was probably the thriving business of a fisherman on the Lake of
                    Gennesaret; and from the fact that he went back to his business after the
                    resurrection it has been inferred that, at least up to that time, he had never
                    wholly left it. That he was married is clear from the mention of his wife’s
                    mother <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n725/mode/1up"

                    accompanied him when he finally left his home to preach the gospel is implied by
                    St Paul (1 Cor. ix. 5); there is an early tradition, which is not inconsistent
                    with probability, that she also suffered martyrdom, and that Peter called out to
                    her as she was being led away, “O wife, remember the Lord !”<note

                    of his having been married; the alleged name of his daughter, Petronilla, is as

                <p>Of the beginningof his discipleship there are two accounts which have sometimes
                    (by Baur, Keim, Holtzmann, and others), though without sufficient reason, been
                    supposed to be inconsistent with each other.</p>
                <p>(1) According to St John, he was brought to Jesus by his brother Andrew, who had
                    been a follower of John the Baptist, but who, after the Baptist’s testimony,
                    recognized in Jesus the promised Messiah (John i. 40-42). The fact that he was
                    then not at Capernaum but in the Jordan valley, where John was baptizing, seems
                    to indicate that he, like his brother, had been attracted by John’s preaching.
                    It is not stated that he at once became one of those who followed Jesus, and
                    there is consequently room for the supposition that he returned home; and the
                    statement that it was upon the occasion of this first meeting that he received
                    his distinctive surname, Cephas or Peter, is not inconsistent with Mark iii. 16,
                    Luke vi. 14, which mention the fact rather than the occasion, or with Matthew
                    xvi. 18, which gives to an existing name a new application.</p>
                <p>(2) According to St Matthew and St Mark, it was at the beginning of the Galilaean
                    ministry that Jesus called Simon and Andrew to become “fishers of men” (Matt.
                    iv. 18-20; Mark i. 16-18). The manner of the call seems to imply a previous
                    acquaintance, and is consequently not out of harmony with that of St John. It is
                    less easy to determine whether the account in Luke v. 1-11 refers to the same or
                    to a different incident; Schleiermacher, Neander, Bleek, and others treat it as
                    the fuller and more accurate account; Ewald, Weiss, Keim, and others regard the
                    miraculous draught of fishes as a reminiscence of a later tradition, and
                    probably identical with John xxi. 5-11.</p>
                <p>From the time of his call Peter has a place in most of the important events of
                    the Gospel narrative. It was to his house in Capernaum that Jesus went as if to
                    a home (Matt, viii. 14; Mark i. 14, 33; Luke iv. 38), and it is consequently
                    sometimes spoken of as simply “the house” (Matt. ix. 28, xiii. 1, 36, xvii. 25).
                    He formed, with his two former partners, James and John, an apostolic
                    triumvirate, which was admitted when all others were excluded, and to whom, with
                    Andrew, was committed the great prophecy of the last days (Mark xiii. 3). The
                    most important incident which is recorded of him between his call and the
                    crucifixion is that which happened at Caesarea Philippi (Matt. xvi. 13-23; Mark
                    viii. 27-33; Luke ix. 18-22; probably recorded in substance, though in a
                    different form, in John vi. 66-69). The incident links itself closely with the
                    history which had immediately preceded it. The expectation which the Galilaean
                    peasantry had begun to form of Jesus had been disappointed; the miracles of
                    healing and feeding had not been followed by the assumption of the national
                    leadership; many of the disciples had begun to drift away, and those who were
                    looking for the Messiah saw in Him only “one of the prophets.” Those who
                    remained were tested by a direct question; whether the form of the question was
                    that of the Synoptists, “Whom say ye that I am?” or th'at of St John, “Will ye
                    also go away ?” it was Peter who answered for the rest, in words which have an
                    equivalent meaning, whether they were in the form “Thou art the Christ,” or in
                    the form “Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life.” The
                    further detail which St Matthew gives, xvi. 17-19, has sometimes been thought to
                    be a later addition, reflecting a fact of subsequent ecclesiastical history; but
                    its absence from St Mark does not seem to be an adequate ground for rejecting
                    it, and its substance is found in Justin Martyr <hi rend="italic">(Tryph.,</hi>
                    c. 100). Round the words which St Matthew records many controversies have raged;
                    nor does it seem possible, with existing means of investigation, to fix to the
                    sentence “upon this rock I will build My church” a meaning that will be beyond
                    dispute. Whatever may be its precise meaning, it seems at any rate to be in
                    harmony with other passages of the Synoptic Gospels, which indicate, not only
                    that Peter was foremost among the apostles by virtue of natural force of
                    character, but that he was also their ordinary leader and representative: the
                    most important passage is Matt. x. 2, where the expression “the first,” which is
                    applied to him, cannot be restricted to mere priority of enumeration in the
                    list. It is possible that his colleagues James and John, or their more ambitious
                    mother, endeavoured to dispute this position with him (Matt. xx. 20, 21; Mark x.
                    35-37), and it has been contended (Baur, Strauss, Holtzmann) that in the Fourth
                    Gospel John holds the place which the Synoptists assign to Peter; but even if
                    this contention were admitted it would merely afford one more argument to show
                    that the priority of rank was limited by natural affection as well as by the law
                    of equality among the Christian brotherhood (Matt, xxiii. 8-11; Mark ix. 33-35;
                    Luke xxii. 24-27). But, although Peter was foremost in expressing the confident
                    belief of the disciples that Jesus was the Messiah, it seems clear that in his
                    conception of the Messiah he did not rise above the current ideas of his
                    countrymen. “He that should come” was to be a national deliverer. This
                    conception appears on two occasions especially—when Jesus first told the
                    disciples of His coming sufferings, “Peter took Him and began to rebuke Him,”
                    and received the answer, “Get thee behind Me, Satan,” as though this attitude of
                    the disciples were a new temptation (Matt. xvi. 21-23; Mark viii. 31-33); and,
                    when Jesus was actually in the power of His enemies, and no “legions of angels”
                    appeared either to rescue or to enthrone Him, Peter’s natural hopefulness gave
                    way to complete despondency, and he more than once “denied that he knew
                    Him.”</p>
                <p>In the earliest account of the resurrection (that of St Paul, 1 Cor. xv. 5) it is
                    mentioned that Jesus appeared to Peter before and separately from the twelve;
                    and the last chapter of the Fourth Gospel gives him an especial prominence: it
                    adds one more example of the impulsive energy of his character (ver. 7); it
                    portrays more vividly than any other passage in the Gospels the depth of his
                    attachment to his Master (vers. 15-17); and it forecasts the manner of his death
                    (vers. 18, 19). His prominence in the early community at Jerusalem is proved by
                    the testimony of St Paul; for it was to visit “Cephas” that he made his first
                    journey to Jerusalem after his conversion, and fourteen years afterwards, though
                    James and John as well as Cephas “were reputed to be pillars,” it was the latter
                    who stood out above the rest as the special preacher of “the gospel of the
                    uncircumcision” (Gal. i. 18, ii. 1-10). These facts undoubtedly confirm the
                    general picture of the relations of Peter to the early church which is drawn in
                    the Acts of the Apostles; at the same time no part of the New Testament has been
                    more strongly attacked by modern <pb break="no"

                    book, in which the “Acts of Peter” are contained. The attack has been made
                    (Baur, Schwegler, Overbeck, Zeller, and others) partly on the speeches and
                    partly on the narrative. (1) It is alleged that the Petrine speeches form no
                    exception to the general uniformity of phraseology and style which characterizes
                    the Acts, and that they ignore the marked differences in the conception of
                    Christianity between Peter and Paul. It must be admitted that the coincidences
                    are such as to render it probable that the author of the Acts dealt freely with
                    his materials, but at the same time the peculiarities are sufficiently numerous
                    to support the view that these speeches contain a true representation of the
                    primitive teaching.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The

                    contested are those which relate to Simon of Samaria and to Cornelius. It is
                    alleged that the account of the former is the mere reflex of the later legends
                    in which the name of Simon Magus was substituted for that of St Paul as the
                    representative of false Christianity, and it is said of the latter that it is a
                    mere attempt to claim for Peter the opening of the door to the Gentiles which
                    was the special honour of Paul, and that it cannot be reconciled with the
                    division of labour between the apostle of the circumcision and the apostle of
                    the uncircumcision which is spoken of in the Epistle to the Galatians.<note

                    1875.</p></note> At the great crisis of early Christianity which is known as the
                    conference or council of Jerusalem Peter advocated (according to the Acts), or
                    accepted (according to Paul), the policy of conciliation. Afterwards he went to
                    Antioch, where Paul had preceded him, and there he carried out his acceptance of
                    Gentile Christianity to the further point of eating at the common meals at which
                    Gentiles were present. For this step the members of the original community at
                    Jerusalem were not prepared; and, when a deputation from them came to Antioch,
                    Peter “drew back and separated himself” (Gal. ii. 12). Thereupon followed an
                    argument and a remonstrance on the part of Paul which has been fruitful of
                    results to both ancient and modern Christianity. Peter was “withstood to the
                    face” because of (1) inconsistency, (2) practical calumny of Christ, (3)
                    transgression of the law, (4) making void the gift of God (Gal. ii. 14-21). It
                    is altogether too much to assume that this remonstrance led to a permanent
                    alienation of the two apostles from one another; it is more probable that with a
                    character such as Peter’s, which had more energy than steadiness of resolution,
                    it may even have been effectual. But it is upon the assumption of such an
                    alienation that the Jewish party in the ancient church pictured Peter as the
                    champion and hero of the faith, and Paul as its vanquished opponent, and also
                    that in modern times the Tübingen school have endeavoured to reconstruct not
                    only early church history but also the New Testament.</p>
                <p>This incident at Antioch is the last that is certainly known of Peter. The
                    prophecy recorded in John xxi. 18, 19, is in harmony with early tradition in
                    pointing to a violent death. But of the time and place of that death we know
                    nothing with even approximate probability. The only historical mention of him
                    for more than a hundred years afterwards is in Clement of Rome <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ep.,</hi> i. 5, 4), who sets before the Corinthians the example of “Peter, who
                    through zeal undertook not one or two but numerous labours, and so having borne
                    witness went to the place that was due to him.” It is sometimes supposed that an
                    indication of the place in which he “bore witness” or “suffered martyrdom” is
                    afforded by the phrase “among us,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> among the
                    Romans, in the next chapter; but this, though possible, is quite uncertain.
                    Outside this statement, which if it were more definite would be conclusive,
                    there is only the doubtful interpretation of “Babylon” in 1 Peter v. 13 as

                    reference to Peter’s connexion with Mark (Euseb., <hi rend="italic">H. E.,</hi>
                    iii. 39, 15) says nothing of the place at which they were together, and the
                    coupling of the names of Peter and Paul by Ignatius <hi rend="italic">(Ad
                    Roman.,</hi> c. 4) would not, even if the early date of Ignatius were
                    established, afford a solid argument that “in their death they were not
                    divided.” But from the beginning of the last quarter of the 2d century the
                    testimony to the presence and death of Peter at Rome is almost uniform; the
                    tradition, whatever may have been its foundation in fact, had firmly established
                    itself. Dionysius of Corinth (Euseb., <hi rend="italic">H. E.,</hi> ii. 25, 8)
                    says that Peter and Paul founded the church at Corinth together and then
                    proceeded to Italy. Irenaeus <hi rend="italic">(Adv.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Heeres.,</hi> iii. 1 ) speaks of Peter and Paul as having together founded the
                    church at Rome; the Muratorian Fragmen t (not earlier than the end of the 2d
                    century) refers to the “passion of Peter” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> his
                    martyrdom; the presbyter Gaius (Euseb., <hi rend="italic">H. E.,</hi> ii. 25, 7,
                    early in the 3d century) says that he saw the <hi rend="italic">τpoπaιa</hi>
                    (whatever that may mean) of the two apostles Peter and Paul at Rome; in
                    Tertullian <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Scorp.,</hi> c. 15; <hi rend="italic">De
                    Praescr.,</hi> c. 24 and 36) the tradition is fairly established; and no later
                    Latin father expresses any doubt of it.</p>
                <p>But, besides the fact that there is an interval of more than a hundred years
                    between what must have been, in the ordinary course of nature even if not
                    through violence, the approximate time of Peter’s death and the first certain
                    tradition of the place and manner of it, there are two other important
                    considerations which render the ordinary patristic statements doubtful. (1) One
                    stream of tradition, for the existence of which it is difficult to account if
                    the other tradition had been uniform, represents Peter as having worked at
                    Antioch, in Asia Minor, in Babylonia, and in the “country of the barbarians” on
                    the northern shores of the Black Sea. This is in harmony with the geographical
                    details of the first of the two epistles which bear his name. That epistle is
                    addressed to the “elect who are sojourners of the dispersion in Pontus, Galatia,
                    Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,” and the “Babylon” from which it is obviously
                    written (v. 13) is best understood not as a cryptographic expression for Rome,
                    but, like the other geographical names of the epistles of the New Testament, in
                    a literal sense. All this, no doubt, is not inconsistent with the supposition
                    that Peter went to Rome towards the end of his life, but it seems to exclude the
                    theory that he made a lengthened stay there and was the founder of the Roman
                    Church. (2) The other consideration is that the presence of Peter at Rome is
                    almost inextricably bound up with a story of whose legendary character there can
                    be little doubt, that of the Simon Magus of the <hi rend="italic"

                    relations between the two apostles, the violent controversies between the
                    catholic and the Jewish parties which came to a head in the 2d century, they
                    framed a romance of which Peter was the hero, and in which, under the mask of
                    Simon Magus, Paul played the part of the “false apostle.” The romance in its
                    original form has perished; its substance is partly preserved and partly recast
                    in the Clementine <hi rend="italic">Homilies</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Recognitions,</hi> of which the former exist in their original Greek, the
                    latter in an incomplete Latin translation. In course of time the original
                    identity of Paul with Simon Magus was forgotten, and in the later forms of the
                    legend (see the <hi rend="italic">Acts of Peter and Paul</hi> below) Peter and
                    Paul are joined together in the combat with the pretender. But in almost all
                    later patristic accounts of Peter Simon Magus has an important place; he is said
                    to have gone to Rome in the time of Claudius, and Peter is said to have at once
                    followed him in 42 A.D.; hence, as Peter lived until the Neronian persecution in
                    67 there was room for an episcopate of twenty-five years. This last tradition
                    can hardly be reconciled with the facts mentioned in the New Testament of his
                    presence at Jerusalem and at Antioch (Acts xv. Gal. ii.); but Lipsius has
                    endeavoured to show, not only that single points in the story must be given up,
                    but that the whole tradition of the presence of Peter at Rome is a fiction which
                    grew out of the Judaeo-Christian attack upon Paul.</p>
                <p>The probabilities of the case are evenly balanced; on the one hand it is
                    difficult to account for the complete silence as to Peter in the Pauline
                    epistles, and it is impossible with those epistles in sight to regard Peter as
                    the founder of the Roman community; on the other hand, it is difficult to
                    suppose that so large a body of tradition had no foundation in fact; such a
                    supposition, besides its general improbability, would assume that the extreme
                    form of Judaeo-Christianity which the <hi rend="italic">Clementines</hi> reflect
                    had a much greater influence over the conceptions of the 2d century than the
                    evidence warrants.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    question whether Peter was ever at Rome has been so much discussed that the

                    convenient for reference; it is not exhaustive. The question was at first
                    discussed as one between Protestants and Catholics. The earliest treatise on the

                <p>It would be inappropriate to enter in the present article into the causes and
                    consequences of the enormous influence which the belief that Peter founded and
                    presided over the first Christian community at Rome has exercised upon
                    Christianity. It was no doubt natural, considering that influence, that
                    curiosity should be largely exercised as to the details of his life and death at
                    Rome, and that legends of respectable antiquity should express themselves in
                    visible memorials. Modern Rome contains many such memorials. The chapel of S.
                    Pietro in Carcere preserves the tradition that he was imprisoned in the
                    Tullianum, and that a spring of water issued from the ground that he might
                    baptize his gaolers. The churches of S. Prassede and S. Pudenziana preserve the
                    tradition that much of the later part of his life at Rome was spent in the house
                    of Pudens on the Viminal Hill. The latest localization of a legend has built a
                    church outside the old Porta Capena to mark the spot where, when he was fleeing
                    from persecution, he met his Master going into Rome. “Lord, whither goest Thou
                    ?” (Domine, quo vadis? ) was his question. “I go to Rome to be crucified again”
                    was his Master’s answer.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The story is first found in a sermon sometimes attributed to St Ambrose and
                    printed in some editions of his works, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> ed. Paris,
                    1603, vol. V. p. 100.</p></note> Besides these visible memorials of Petrine
                    legends there are four annual feasts. (1) On 29th June is celebrated the Feast
                    of St Peter and St Paul. The day is supposed to be that of their martyrdom; it
                    is in reality that of the reburial of their supposed remains in 258, which is
                    recorded in the <hi rend="italic">Kalendarium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Liberianum</hi> of 354 (printed by Mommsen in the <hi rend="italic"

                    >Classe,</hi> 1850, p. 362). Those of Peter were then reburied “ad catacumbas,”
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in the cemetery of St Sebastian on the Appian Way;
                    they were afterwards said to have been transferred to the basilica which
                    Constantine erected on the Vatican. (2) On 22d February is celebrated a feast in
                    commemoration of Peter as bishop of Antioch <hi rend="italic">{Festum Cathedrae
                    Petri Antiochenae),</hi> which also is mentioned as early as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kaleηd. Liberianum.</hi> (3) On 18th January has been celebrated
                    since the 8th century a feast in commemoration of his bishopric of Rome. (4) On
                    1st August has been celebrated since the 9th century a feast in commemoration of
                    his imprisonment <hi rend="italic">{Fcstum S. Petri ad Vincula),</hi> but
                    whether of that by Herod which is mentioned in Acts xii., or of that by Nero, is

                    17, vol. iii. p. 462), by Jerome <hi rend="italic">{De Vir. Illustr.,</hi> c.
                    1), and by Theodoret <hi rend="italic">{Haeret. Fab.,</hi> ii. 2). Hilgepfeld
                    <hi rend="italic">{Nov. Test, extra canon, rec.,</hi> fasc. iv. p. 39) thinks
                    that it held a middle place between the <hi rend="italic">Gospel according to
                    the Hebrews</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Gospel of the Ebionites.</hi> No
                    certain fragments of it remain.</p>

                    περίοδοι).</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> These two works are mentioned together
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Epistle to James</hi> which is prefixed to the
                    Clementine <hi rend="italic">Recognitions</hi>; the former appears to have been
                    Judaeo-Christian; the latter was an attack on Paul under the guise of Simon
                    Magus. Both works underlie the Clementine <hi rend="italic">Recognitions</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Homilies</hi>; the patristic references to them will be
                    found in Hilgeu-feld, Z.c., p. 52, and <hi rend="italic">Einleitung,</hi> pp.
                    42, 155, 580, 613.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The Preaching of Peter and Paul.—</hi> This, in distinction
                    from the preceding, belongs to the period at which Pauline and Petrine
                    tendencies had become combined. The fragments of it and references to it are
                    collected by Hilgenfeld, Z.c., p. 56.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">The Acts of Peter and Paul.—</hi> The history of this work
                    is obscure; in its present form (as printed by Tischendorf, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aeta</hi><hi rend="italic">Apostolorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Aj)θcrypha,</hi>
                    pp. 1-39) it is probably a late recasting of an earlier work or works. Of such
                    earlier work or works there are traces which are collected by Hilgenfeld, <hi
                    rend="italic">l.c.,</hi> p. 66; in addition to these it has been thought that

                    difficulties of these <hi rend="italic">Acts</hi> has not yet (1884)
