                <p><label type="entry">PATRICK, <hi rend="smallcaps">St</hi></label>. In one of the
                    incursions of the Scots and Picts upon the neighbouring Roman province south of
                    the wall of Severus, probably that of 411 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> the
                    year after Honorius had refused aid to the Britons, a youth of about fifteen was
                    carried off with many others from the district in the neighbourhood of the wall
                    at the head of the Solway, and sold as a slave on the opposite coast of Ireland
                    in the territory of the Irish Picts called Dal Araide.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The province of Valentia, reorganized by
                    Theodosius I., was comprised between the wall of Antoninus, which extended from
                    the Clyde to the Firth of Forth, and the wall of Severus, which extended from
                    the Solway to Tynemouth. Although the destruction of the pagan temples was
                    decreed in 381, and the pagan religion prohibited in 390, that is, a few years
                    after the restoration of Roman power in Britain and the reorganization of this
                    province by Theodosius, the greater part of the Romanized population of Britain
                    seems to have been pagan at the end of the 4th century, and especially in
                    Valentia, where Patrick was born about 396. Amidst the many evidences of Roman
                    occupation that have been found there not a relic of Roman Christianity has, so
                    far as we know, been yet discovered. In the south-west part of Valentia, along
                    the north shore of the Solway Firth from the Nith to the Irish Channel, Ptolemy
                    placed the tribe of the Novantae, its principal dun or oppidum being on the west
                    side of Wigtown Bay, and called by him Leukopibia, a name still preserved in
                    Whithorn. During the great displacements of tribes consequent upon the Roman
                    conquests and the inroads of the Scots and Picts, the British Novantae
                    disappear, and in their place we find at the end of the 4th century Goidelic
                    Cruithni or Picts. Their position in the midst of a British population, and
                    their contiguity to the part of Ulster occupied by the Irish Cruithni or Picts,
                    clearly indicate that the Picts of Galloway were part of the Ulidian or Irish
                    Picts pressed out of Ireland by the intrusion of the Scots. This settlement of
                    the Irish Picts in Galloway afforded an excellent vantage-ground for such
                    attacks as that spoken of in the text.</p></note> This youth was the future
                    apostle of the Irish. As his name implies, he was of noble birth, and he tells
                    us so himself. He was the son of the deacon Calpurnius, who was the son of
                    Potitus, a priest. His father was a decurio or magistrate, and, as Patrick
                    according to tradition was born at Nemthur,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>There can be no doubt that Nemthur was situated at the Clyde
                    end of the wall of Antoninus, where Dumbarton now is. It is called Nevtur in the
                    Old Welsh MS. known as the “Black Book of Carmarthen.”</p></note> he must have
                    exercised his functions of magistrate at that place, but on the withdrawal of
                    the Roman garrisons from Britain probably retired for safety south of the wall
                    of Severus, where, as Patrick tells us, he had a small country place (villula)
                    near the town (vicus) of Bannavem Taberniae, whence Patrick was carried off. The
                    country along the south of the wall, especially near the Solway, was a region of
                    camps or military posts to which the designation Tabernia would be appropriate.
                    Bannavem seems to be a Romanized form of a British name signifying “river foot,”
                    and most probably was the Banna of the <hi rend="italic">Chorography</hi> of
                    Ravenas, and of the inscription on an altar said to have been found at
                    Birdoswald (the Romano-British Amboglanna), and now at Lanercost Priory. The
                    name also occurs on the well-known bronze cup found about two hundred years ago
                    at Rudge in Wiltshire, which dates from about 350. Banna must have been near
                    Petriana, the former being probably the vicus or town, and the latter the
                    military station proper. Towards the end of the 4th century, before the
                    withdrawal of the Roman garrisons, there were along the wall 10,300 foot and
                    1500 horse according to the <hi rend="italic">Notitiα Imperii,</hi> so that
                    Bannavem Taberniae, or Bannavem of the military posts or encampments, was
                    descriptive of the district, and the office of decurio in such a place one of
                    considerable dignity.</p>
                <p>The youth Succat or Patrick remained in hard slavery for six years, tending
                    cattle, probably on Slemish Mountain in the county Antrim. He seems to have been
                    of an enthusiastic temperament, and much given to prayer and meditation.
                    Learning of a means of escape, it so filled his mind as to give rise to visions.
                    The bays and creeks of the west and north-west of Ireland, especially Killala
                    Bay, were much frequented in ancient times, for they afforded secure retreats to
                    sea-rovers when they crept round the coast of Ireland and swooped down on that
                    of Roman Britain. Ptolemy’s town of Nagnata was probably on the bay just named;
                    it is celebrated in the stories of Fomorians, Norsemen, and other sea-rovers.
                    The kindred of the Ard Ri or paramount king of Ireland of the time, Dathi or
                    rather Athi, one of the greatest leaders among the invading Scots, dwelt there;
                    it was consequently a place which offered facilities for going to Britain, and
                    from that place most probably Patrick succeeded in escaping. After his escape he
                    appears to have conceived the noble idea of devoting himself to the conversion
                    of the Irish, and to have gone somewhere for a few years to prepare himself for
                    the priesthood. His biographers take him to Tours to St Martin, who was then
                    dead several years, afterwards to the island of Lerins in the Mediterranean, and
                    lastly to Rome, where he received a mission from Pope Celestine. For all this
                    there is no evidence whatever, the whole story being the result of the confusion
                    of Palladius with the real Patrick. The tradition of some connexion between the
                    Irish apostle and St Martin of Tours, the monastic type of the earliest Irish
                    Church, the doubts as to Patrick’s fitness for the work which led to his writing
                    his <hi rend="italic">Confession,</hi> and indeed all the difficulties that
                    beset the question of the origin of the Irish Church, receive a simple and
                    satisfactory explanation upon the hypothesis of Patrick having prepared himself
                    for the priesthood at <hi rend="italic">Candida Casa,</hi> the monastic
                    institution founded by St <hi rend="smallcaps">Ninian</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.vf.</hi></p>
                <p>Patrick tells us that after a few years <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> after his
                    escape) he was among the Britons with his kindred, who received him as a son. He
                    was evidently bent upon his mission, for they besought him after such
                    tribulations not to part from them again. Full of it, he dreams that a man whose
                    name was Victoricus came to him bearing innumerable epistles, one of which he
                    received and read; the beginning of it contained the words, “The voice of the
                    Irish”; whilst repeating these words he says, “I imagined that I heard in my
                    mind (in mente) the voice of those who were near the wood of Fochlad, which is
                    near <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n433/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0433-0412"/> the western sea, and thus they cried: We pray
                    thee, holy youth, to come and henceforward walk amongst us.” The wood here
                    referred to, which was in the neighbourhood of Killala Bay, was most probably
                    the place where he remained concealed when waiting for a boat to make his escape
                    from slavery. This dream was followed by others, which shows how completely his
                    mission occupied his mind. Patrick was about twenty-two years of age when he
                    escaped from slavery, and, if we allow seven or eight years for the “few years’”
                    preparation, he probably was not more than thirty years of age when he entered
                    on his mission about 425. There is a passage in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confession</hi> which shows that he was still a young man when he commenced his
                    work: “You know and God knows how I have lived among you from my youth up.”
                    Probus, the author of the fifth life published by Colgan, who has many claims
                    upon our confidence, supports this view that Patrick began his mission while
                    still a priest. We see in Patrick’s own authentic acts that he must have sought
                    among his friends in Britain to be made a bishop, for he complains in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Confession</hi> that a friend to whom he had communicated some
                    fault he had committed when about fifteen years old had urged this thirty years
                    after as a reason against his being consecrated to the higher office. This
                    proves that he was only about forty-five years old when made bishop. If we
                    assume that 411 was the year he was carried off as a slave, his consecration as
                    bishop would fall in about 441, the fifteenth year of his mission, a date which
                    corresponds with the results of Dr Todd’s speculations based on a close analysis
                    of all available chronological data. Compare in general on the conversion of
                    Ireland what has been said in vol. xiii. p. 247 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi></p>
                <p>The date of St Patrick’s death is as uncertain as that of every other event
                    connected with him. The <hi rend="italic">Annals of the Four Masters</hi> give
                    493, with which Ussher agrees; Tirechan’s <hi rend="italic">Annotations,</hi> on
                    the other hand, state that Loegaire, son of Niall, king of Ireland, lived from
                    two to five years after St Patrick. According to this account the death of St
                    Patrick took place in 469, and that of Loegaire in 471 or 474, after a reign of
                    thirty-six years, so that Loegaire’s reign began either in 435 or 438. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Annals of the Four Masters</hi> record the death in 457 of Senn
                    Patraicc, or Old Patrick, and of Loegaire in the following year, 458. The
                    Patrick who died in 493 is a fiction due to the fusion of the acts of the two
                    real Patricks, Palladius Patrick and Senn Patraicc, doubtless so called because
                    he was the Patrick known as a priest before the arrival of the Roman bishop.
                    Assuming Tirechan’s statement as correct, and that St Patrick died in 469, his
                    mission as priest and bishop lasted about forty-four years.</p>
                <p>The materials for a life of the apostle of Ireland are very scanty; they consist
                    indeed of only two Latin pieces—one the so-called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confession</hi> and the other an <hi rend="italic">Epistle</hi> about a certain
                    Coroticus. Some persons, apparently in Britain or Gaul, seem to have accused
                    Patrick of presumption in having undertaken so great a work as the
                    Christianizing of Ireland, and of incapacity for the task; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confession</hi> is a defence of himself against these charges, and is a kind of
                    autobiographical sketch. The <hi rend="italic">Epistle</hi> is a denunciation of
                    a British chief called Coroticus, supposed to be Caredig or Ceredig, son of
                    Cynedda, conqueror of North Wales, who had ravaged the coast of Ireland, killed
                    a number of Christian neophytes on the very day of their baptism while still
                    clad in white garments, carried off others into slavery, and scoffed at a
                    deputation of clergy Patrick had sent to ask their release. There is a copy of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Confession</hi> in the MS. called the “Book of Armagh,”
                    written about the year 807, and apparently made from Patrick’s autograph, which
                    the scribe several times complains of being then obscure. There are copies in
                    other MSS. which contain nearly as much additional matter not in the “Book of
                    Armagh” as would, if put together, be nearly equal to the text of the MS. just
                    named. Are these additions part of the original work of Patrick omitted by the
                    scribe because they were illegible, or for some other reason, or are they
                    interpolations? Judging by many examples in other Irish MSS.. the former appears
                    to be the better interpretation, for they are written in the same rude and
                    archaic style, exhibit the same peculiarity of grammatical construction somewhat
                    like Irish, and are not inconsistent with the rest. He modestly tells us himself
                    that he is unlearned (indoctus) and very rustic (rusticissimus). The <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistle</hi> is not in the “Book of Armagh,” but both pieces
                    possess all the characteristics of the time and place, and may be regarded as
                    genuine documents, and have been so regarded by nearly all scholars who have
                    written on the subject.</p>
                <p>There are also several old lives of the saint, seven of which have been published
                    by Colgan in his <hi rend="italic">Trias Thaumaturga,</hi> the last of which,
                    known as the Tripartite life, is the most copious. These lives are based upon
                    the two genuine documents above mentioned, and are a tissue of legends and
                    miracles, and, though no doubt containing a few genuine traditions, are only of
                    value for manners and customs, and even for this purpose require much care in
                    their use.</p>
                <p>The place, time, and circumstances of Patrick’s labours have largely contributed
                    to the obscurity which surrounds him. His very name has helped to increase it.
                    Patricius, like Augustus, s,eems to have been commonly used, even down to the
                    7th century, in the sense of nobleman or gentleman; thus Dynamius, who lived in
                    the beginning of the century just referred to, is described as “Virillustris ac
                    <hi rend="italic">patricius</hi> Galliarum.” Patrick’s real name, according to
                    tradition, was Succat, but in his own writings he calls himself Patrick. There
                    was, however, another Patrick whó under the name of Palladius was unquestionably
                    sent as bishop to Ireland by Pope Celestine in the year 431, that is, the year
                    before the other Patrick commenced his mission according to the generally
                    received accounts. Irish writers also mention a third Patrick, Senn Patraicc, or
                    Old Patrick, the head of St Patrick’s community (caput sapientum seniorum ejus)
                    according to one account, and his tutor according to another. The three Patricks
                    have sorely puzzled hagiologists, and created so much confusion and conjecture
                    in the history of the early church that some have doubted the existence of such
                    a personage as St Patrick at all. The absence of any contemporary reference to
                    him, or of any mention of him by Columbanus, Bede, and indeed with very few
                    exceptions by any writers outside of Ireland before the 9th century, adds very
                    much to the uncertainty and obscurity of the subject. (W. K. S.)</p>
