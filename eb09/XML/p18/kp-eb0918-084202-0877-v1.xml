                <p><label type="entry">PHRENOLOGY</label>. This name was given by Forster in 1815 to
                    the empirical system of psychology formulated by Gall and developed by his
                    followers, especially by Spurzheim and Combe. At first it was named
                    “cranioscopy,” “craniology,” “physiognomy,” or “zoonomy,” but Forster’s name was
                    early adopted by Spurzheim, and became that whereby the system is now known. The
                    principles upon which it is based are four: (1) the brain is the organ of the
                    mind; (2) the mental powers of man can be analysed into a definite number of
                    independent faculties; (3) these faculties are innate, and each has its seat in
                    a definite region of the brain; (4) the size of each of these regions is the
                    measure of the power of manifesting the faculty associated with it. - While
                    phrenology is thus, on the one hand, a system of mental philosophy, it has a
                    second and more popular aspect as a method whereby the disposition and character
                    of the individual may be ascertained. These two sides of the subject are

                    the brain as the coldest and most bloodless of bodily organs, of the nature of

                    heart, as the cooler regions of the firmament condense the vapours rising from
                    the earth. In his view, as in that of most of the earlier writers of other
                    nations of antiquity, the heart is the seat of life; to it, not to the brain,
                    the Hebrew writers refer thoughts and affections, while they considered judgment
                    as seated sometimes in the head, sometimes in the kidneys.<note anchored="true"

                    notice this dependence of mind on brain; for example, in the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The two founders of anatomical science, Erasistratus and Herophilus, who lived in
                    the days of Ptolemy Soter, taught not only that the brain was the seat of
                    sensation and of intellect, but also that there was therein a certain degree of
                    localization of function. Erasistratus believed that the sensory nerves arose
                    from the brain-membranes, the motor from the cerebral substance. Herophilus was
                    apparently the first who held that the vital forces resided in and circulated
                    from the ventricles of the brain, at least so we gather from Celsus and the
                    other authors who have preserved his views. By the influence of the writings of

                    became universally received among philosophers. According to the Galenical
                    theory of life, the animal spirits arising from the brain are conveyed thence by
                    the arteries through the body. These animal spirits have their origin in the
                    ventricles of the brain, and pass thence to the heart. It is true that in one

                    ventricular theory was that adopted by his followers. This view is held by the

                            have assailed this doctrine of spirits,—on what ground is not apparent,
                            as he certainly expresses himself as a believer in the old view; see <hi

                    have anything to do with intellect, as the ass, a proverbially stupid animal,

                    purpose of lightening the brain and facilitating its movements. Succeeding
                    anatomists simply varied these localizations according to their respective
                    fancies. Lancisi placed sense-perception in the corpus callosum, Vieussens in
                    the centrum ovale majus. Descartes supposed the soul to be seated in the pineal

                    intellectual peculiarity; but it is not known to the present writer whether he
                    ever carried this into effect. In a more special manner Prochaska of Vienna may
                    be looked upon as the father of phrenology, as in his work on the nervous
                    system, published in Vienna in 1784, are to be found the germs of the later
                    views which were propounded in that city twelve years later.<note

                <p>The system formulated by Gall is thus a modern expansion of an old empirical
                    philosophy, and its immediate parentage is easily traced, although, according to

                    independent observations. These, he tells us, he began to make at an early age,
                    by learning to correlate the outward appearances and mental qualities of his
                        schoolfellows.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For a

                    the <hi rend="italic">Deutscher</hi><hi rend="italic">Merkur</hi> of December
                    1798, but his principal expositions were oral, and attracted much popular
                    attention, which largely increased when, in 1802, he was commanded by the
                    Austrian Government, at the instance of the ecclesiastical authorities, to
                    discontinue his public lectures. In 1804 he obtained the co-operation of
                    Spurzheim (1776-1832), a native of Long-wich near Treves, who became his pupil
                    in 1800, and proved a powerful ally in promulgating the system. Master and pupil
                    at first taught in harmony, but they found it advisable to separate in 1813; and
                    we find Spurzheim, several years after their parting, declaring that Gall had
                    not introduced any new improvements into his system since their separation
                    (notes to Chenevix, p. 99). “My philosophical views,” he also says, “widely
                    differ from those of Gall.”</p>
                <p>In Paris, where he settled in 1807, Gall made many influential converts to his
                    system. Broussais, Blainville, Cloquet, Andral, Geoffroy St-Hilaire, Vimont, and
                    others warmly attached themselves to it, and countenanced its progress. Gall
                    visited Great Britain, but the diffusion of phrenology there was chiefly due to
                    Spurzheim, who lectured through the country and through America, and, with the
                    aid of his pupil George Combe, soon attracted a large popular following. His
                    most influential disciples were Elliotson, Andrew Combe, Mackenzie, Macnish,
                    Laycock, and Archbishop Whately, and in America Caldwell and Godman. On the
                    opposite side many influential men took up a strongly antagonistic position,
                    prominent among whom were Barclay the anatomist, Roget, Sir Charles Bell, Sir W.
                    Hamilton, Jeffrey, Brougham, T. Brown, and Sir B. Brodie. The nature of the
                    system rendered it eminently fitted to catch public attention, and it rapidly
                    attained to so great a degree of popularity that in 1832 there were twenty-nine
                    phrenological societies in Great Britain, and several journals devoted to
                    phrenology in Britain and America; of these the <hi rend="italic">Phrenological
                        Journal,</hi> a quarterly edited chiefly by George Combe with aid from
                    others of the Edinburgh confraternity, notably Sir George Mackenzie and Macnish,
                    “the modern Pythagorean,” lived from 1823 to 1847, through twenty volumes. The
                    controversy in many places was heated and often personal, and this largely
                    increased the popular interest. In the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>
                    the theory was severely criticized by Thomas Brown, and afterwards in a still
                    more trenchant manner by Jeffrey. In <hi rend="italic">Blackwood</hi> it was
                    ridiculed by Professor Wilson. Being a subject which lent itself easily to
                    burlesque, it was parodied cleverly in a long rhyme by two authors, “The
                    Craniad,” 87 pages long, published in 1817, while, on the other hand, verse was
                    pressed into its service in the rhyme “Phrenology in Edinburgh” in 1824.<note

                <p>The popularity of phrenology has waned, and few of the phrenological societies
                    now survive; the cultivation of the system is confined to a few enthusiasts such
                    as will be found attached to any cause, and some professional teachers who
                    follow phrenology as a vocation. Like many similar systems, it has a much larger
                    following in America than in Europe. Based, like many other artificial
                    philosophies, on an admixture of assumption and truth, certain parts will
                    survive and become incorporated into scientific psychology, while the rest will
                    in due course come to be relegated to the limbo of effete heresies.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Faculties and their Localities.—</hi> The system of Gall
                    was constructed by a method of pure empiricism, and his so-called organs were
                    for the most part identified on slender grounds. Having selected the place of a
                    faculty, he examined the heads of his friends and casts of persons with that
                    peculiarity in common, and in them he sought for the distinctive feature of
                    their characteristic trait. Some of his earlier studies were made among low
                    associates, in jails, and in lunatic asylums, and some of the qualities 1ocated
                    by him were such as tend to become perverted to crime. These he named after
                    their excessive manifestations, mapping out organs of murder, theft, &amp;c.;
                    but as this cast some discredit on the system the names were changed by
                    Spurzheim, who claimed as his the moral and religious considerations associated
                    with it. Gall marked out on his model of the head the places of twenty-six
                    organs as round enclosures with vacant interspaces. Spurzheim and Combe divided
                    the whole scalp into oblong and conterminous patches (see the accompanying
                    figures). Other methods of division and other names have been suggested by
                    succeeding authors, especially by Cox, Sidney Smith (not Sydney), Toulmin Smith,
                    Carus of Dresden, Don Mariano Cubi i Solar, Powell of Kentucky, Buchanan of
                    Cincinnati, Hittel of New York. Some, like the brothers Fowler, raise the number
                    of organs to forty-three; but the system of Spurzheim and Combe is that which
                    has always been most popular in Britain.</p>
                <p>Spurzheim separated the component faculties of the human mind into two great
                    groups and subdivided these as follows.</p>
                <p>I. Feelings, divided into—</p>
                <p>1. Propensities, internal impulses inviting only to certain actions.</p>
                <p>2. Sentiments, impulses λvhich prompt to emotion as well as to action.</p>
                <p>A. Lower,—those common to man and the lower animals. B. Higher,—those proper to
                    man.</p>
                <p>II. Intellectual faculties.</p>

                    who are closely attached put their heads together.</p>

                    stimulated by alcohol. It was verified by comparing this region with the same
                    part of the head of a quarrelsome young lady.</p>
                <p>(6) Destructiveness <hi rend="italic">{Instinct</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >carnassier),</hi> above the ear meatus. This is the widest part of the
                    skulls of carnivorous animals, and was found large in the head of a student so
                    fond of torturing animals that he became a surgeon, also large in the head of an
                    apothecary who became an executioner.</p>
                <p>(6α) Alimentiveness, over the temporal muscle and above the ear. Hoppe describes
                    it as being large in a gourmand acquaintance, and he therefore supposes it to be
                    the organ of selecting food.</p>
                <p>(7) Secretiveness <hi rend="italic">(Ruse, Finesse),</hi> the posterior part of
                    the squamous suture.</p>
                <p>(8) Acquisitiveness <hi rend="italic">(Sentiment</hi><hi rend="italic">de la
                        propriété),</hi> on the upper edge of the front half of the squamous suture.
                    This part of the head Gall noticed to be prominent in the pickpockets of his
                    acquaintance.</p>
                <p>(9) Constructiveness <hi rend="italic">(Sens de méchanique),</hi> on the
                    stephanion; detected by its prominence on the heads of persons of mechanical
                    genius. It was found large on the head of a milliner of uncommon taste and on a
                    skull reputed to be that of Raphael.</p>
                <p>The organ of Vitativeness, or love of life, is supposed by Combe to be seated at
                    the base of the skull. To this locality Herophilus referred most of the
                    intellectual powers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lower Sentiments.</hi></p>
                <p>(10) Self-esteem <hi rend="italic">(Orgueil, Fierté),</hi> at and immediately
                    over the obelion; found by Gall in a beggar who excused his poverty on account
                    of his pride. This was confirmed by the observation that proud persons held
                    their heads backwards in the line of the organ.</p>
                <p>(11) Love of Approbation <hi rend="italic">(Vanité),</hi> outside the obelion;
                    the region in which Gall saw a protuberance on the head of a lunatic who fancied
                    herself queen of France.</p>
                <p>(12) Cautiousness <hi rend="italic">(Circonspection),</hi> on the parietal
                    eminence; placed here because an ecclesiastic of hesitating disposition and a
                    vacillating councillor of state had both large parietal eminences.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Superior Sentiments.</hi></p>
                <p>(13) Benevolence <hi rend="italic">(Bonté),</hi> on the middle of the frontal
                    bone in front of the coronal suture; here Gall noticed a rising on the head of
                    the highly-commended servant of a friend, as well as on a benevolent schoolmate
                    who nursed his brothers and sisters when they were ill. To this spot Xenocrates
                    referred the intellectual powers.</p>
                <p>(14) Veneration <hi rend="italic">(Sentiment réligieux),</hi> median at the
                    bregma. Gall noted when visiting churches that those who prayed with the
                    greatest fervour were prominent in this region, and it was also prominent in a
                    pious brother.</p>
                <p>(15) Conscientiousness, unknown to Gall; recognized by Spurzheim usually from its
                    deficiency, and placed between the last and the parietal eminence.</p>
                <p>(16) Firmness <hi rend="italic">(Fermeté),</hi> median, on the sagittal suture
                    from behind the bregma to the front of the obelion. Lavater first pointed out
                    that persons of determination« had lofty heads.</p>
                <p>(17) Hope, not regarded as primary by Gall, who believed hope to be akin to
                    desire and a function of every faculty which desires, and left this territory
                    unallocated.</p>
                <p>(18) Wonder, said to be large in vision-seers and many psychic researchers. A
                    second similar organ placed between this and the next is called Mysterizingness
                    by Forster, and is said to preside over belief in ghosts and the
                    supernatural.</p>
                <p>(19) Ideality <hi rend="italic">(Poésie),</hi> noted by Gall from its prominence
                    in the busts of poets; said to be the part touched by the hand when composing
                    poetry.</p>
                <p>(20) Wit <hi rend="italic">(Esprit</hi><hi rend="italic">caustique),</hi> the
                    frontal eminence, the organ of the sense of the ludicrous, prominent in Rabelais
                    and Swift.</p>
                <p>(21) Imitation <hi rend="italic">(Faculté d’imiter),</hi> disposition to mimicry,
                    placed between Benevolence and Wonder.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Perceptive Faculties.</hi></p>
                <p>(22) Individuality, over the frontal sinus in the middle line; the capacity of
                    recognizing external objects and forming ideas therefrom; said to have been
                    large in Michelangelo, and small in the Scots.</p>
                <p>(23) Form <hi rend="italic">(Mémoire des personnes),</hi> capacity of recognizing
                    faces; gives a wide interval between the eyes; found by Gall in a squinting girl
                    with a good memory for faces.</p>
                <p>(24) Size, over the trochlea at the orbital edge; described by Spurzheim and
                    Vimont as the capacity of estimating space and distance.</p>
                <p>(25) Weight, outside the last on the orbital edge and, like it, over the frontal
                    sinus. The prominence of ridge here is due to large sinus or a projecting bone.
                    Certain old writers, such as Strato Physicus, located the whole intellect in
                    this ridge.</p>
                <p>(26) Colour, also on the orbital edge external to the last.</p>
                <p>(27) Locality <hi rend="italic">(Sens</hi><hi rend="italic">de localité),</hi>
                    placed above Individuality on each side, and corresponding to the upper part of
                    the frontal sinus and to the region immediately above it.</p>
                <p>(28) Number, on the external angular process of the frontal bone, large in a
                    calculating boy in Vienna.</p>
                <p>(29) Order, internal to the last, first noted by Spurzheim in an orderly
                    idiot.</p>
                <p>(30) Eventuality <hi rend="italic">(Mémoire</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                        choses),</hi> the median projection above the glabella, supposed to be the
                    seat of the memory of events.</p>
                <p>(31) Time, below the frontal eminence and a little in front of the temporal
                    crest.</p>
                <p>(32) Tune <hi rend="italic">(Sens des rapports des tons),</hi> on the foremost
                    part of the temporal muscle, where Gall noticed a bulge on the head of a musical
                    prodigy of five.</p>
                <p>(33) Language <hi rend="italic">(Sens des mots),</hi> behind the eye. This was
                    the first organ noticed by Gall, as a clever schoolfellow, quick at languages,
                    had prominent eyes. Old authors have noted the connexion between prominent
                    eyeballs and mental development; thus Gazzali and Syenensis Medicus Cyprius
                    place the intellect and soul in and behind the eyeballs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Reflective Faculties.</hi></p>
                <p>(34) Comparison <hi rend="italic">(Sagacité</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >comparative),</hi> median, at the top of the bare region of the forehead,
                    where a savant friend of Gall’s, fond of analogies, had a prominent boss.</p>
                <p>(35) Causality <hi rend="italic">(Esprit</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >métaphysique),</hi> the eminence on each side of Comparison, noticed on the
                    head of Fichte and on a bust of Kant; the seat of the faculty of correlating
                    causes and effects.</p>
                <p>The first identification of each organ was made by an induction from very limited
                    data, but the founders and exponents of the system have collected all available
                    instances wherein enlargements of each of these regions coexisted with increased
                    powers of the faculty supposed to reside therein, and in some cases they have
                    discovered coincidences of a surprising nature. When, however, such do not
                    exist, a convenient excuse is found by reference to the indefinite article of
                    temperament, or by a supposed explanation of the faculty in question as not
                    simple but produced by the co-operation of other influences. Thus, as Sheridan’s
                    bump of wit was small, he is said not to have been truly witty, but to have had
                    comparison and memory strongly developed. The girl Labrosse (described in
                    Férussac’s <hi rend="italic">Bulletin</hi> for October 1831 ), who exhibited
                    strong amativeness but had a rudimentary cerebellum, is said to have obliterated
                    it by over-use. Thurtell, a cold-blooded murderer whose organ of benevolence was
                    large, is said to have been generous, as he once gave half a guinea to a friend,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The method whereby the sizes of organs are estimated is arbitrary and the
                    boundaries of the regions indefinite. The attempts of Nicol, Straton, and Wight
                    to devise mechanical and accurate modes of measurement have not been very
                    successful and have not found favour with the professional phrenologist.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Anatomical Aspect of Phrenology.—</hi> The phrenological
                    controversy served the useful purpose of stimulating research into the anatomy
                    of the brain; but we owe very little of solid progress to the advocates of the
                    system. Gall is the oιdy writer of his creed in whose works original
                    observations of value are to be found. Although the study of the surface of the
                    cerebrum is of the essence of phrenology, yet nowhere in the circle of
                    phrenological literature are the convolutions of the brain accurately described;
                    our knowledge of their order and disposition comes from the morphologist, not
                    from the phrenologist. The first real step towards their systematic description
                    was made by Rolando,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    a satisfactory basis. Most of the anatomical details contained in the works on
                    phrenology relate to controversial matters of secondary importance, and
                    presuppose the truth of the theory; but even in connexion with these they give
                    us no statistical details of any value. It would be important, for instance, to
                    have tabulated a sufficiently large number of measurements of the relative
                    thicknesses of scalp and skull in different regions, of the variations in
                    development of the diploe, of the varying range of the frontal sinus; but of
                    these we find no sufficient nor definite researches in the whole circle of books
                    cited below.</p>
                <p>As under <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy</hi> (vol. i. p. 874) a careful description
                    of the brain has been given, we need only allude to such anatomical points
                    involved in the examination of phrenology as are not included in that
                    account.</p>
                <p>1. Any psychological theory which correlates brain-action and mental phenomena
                    requires a correspondence between brain-size and mental power; and, speaking
                    generally, we find that the brains of those whose capacities are above the
                    average are larger than those of the general run of their fellow-men. The
                    details of brain-weights will be found at pp. 879, 880 of the article cited.</p>
                <p>2. Direct measurements of the relative developments of different portions of
                    brains are difficult and troublesome to make; but their importance to
                    phrenologists is so great that it is remarkable that no attempts to obtain any
                    such were made by them. The series given by Wagner of the relative sizes of the
                    cerebral lobes of four brains is almost the only record of importance in this
                    direction, and is appended.</p>

                <p>From this it appears that the woman exceeded Gauss in perceptive and reflective
                    organs, exceeded Fuchs in sentiment, and fell be low the workmay in
                    propensities. It must be said, however, that the phrenological divisions do not
                    accurately coincide with the anatomical. Other series constructed along these
                    lines are very much wanted, and it would furnish important physiological data if
                    the brains of men distinguished for special qualities were examined in this or
                    some comparable way.</p>
                <p>3. It is important in relation to phrenology to ascertain the constancy of the
                    convolutions. Many varieties in the detail of the surface-patterns have been
                    recorded by Tenehini, Poggi, Giacomini, Rüdinger, and Sernow,<note

                    general plan is fairly uniform. A still more important question has been
                    recently raised by Langley, viz., how far identical spots on identical
                    convolutions in different brains consist of nerve-cells with precisely the same
                    connexions. The convoluted arrangement results from growth of brain-surface
                    under constraint, hence as the different tracts of surface undergo proportional
                    overgrowth they fold along different lines. The occurrence of small differences
                    in the rate of overgrowth, testified to by the varieties of the resulting
                    pattern, will cause considerable alteration in the place of definite territories
                    of grey cells. Some method for the determination of the limits of these
                    shiftings of place is much required.</p>
                <p>4. The comparison of the rate of growth of brain with the development of mental
                    faculties is important not only to the phrenologist but to the psychologist. No
                    observations on this point were made by phrenological writers, and they simply
                    refer to the first and rather crude observations of the earlier anatomists. We
                    have, however, recently learned from the researches of Bischoff, Tuczec, and
                        Exner<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    brain-growth. At birth the brain weighs one-tenth of the weight of the body, and
                    averages about 11 ounces. For the first year brain-growth and consequently
                    expansion of the skull proceed with great rapidity, the growth during a large
                    part of this period averaging one cubic centimetre daily. This enormous increase
                    is chiefly due to the rapid development of medullated nerve-fibres, which are
                    deficient in the foetal brain. During the second and third years growth takes
                    place more slowly, the occipital and parietal lobes increasing more than the
                    frontal or temporo-sphenoidal. During these and the four succeeding years the
                    base elongates commensurately with the increasing depth of the face. In the
                    sixth and seventh years the frontal lobes grow faster than the parietals, and at
                    seven the average brain has attained the weight of 1340 grammes, being to the
                    weight of the body as 1: 20. In the period between seven years and puberty
                    growth is slight, but at puberty the whole brain grows actively, especially the
                    frontal lobes. This activity lasts until about eighteen years of age, then
                    diminishes; but the average brain does not reach its maximum size until about
                    thirty, from a little after which period the brain tends to diminish towards
                        senility.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Weisbach,

                    supposed by Davaine to subsist between development of the brain and stature is
                    not borne out by statistics.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>5. The estimation of the relative development of grey and white matter in the
                    several lobes is important to any theory of cerebral dynamics which allocates
                    functions specifically diverse to each separate part of the brain-surface; but
                    no attempt has been made by the phrenologist to obtain precise results in this
                    direction, nor even to determine the physical constants of the two forms of
                    brain-matter. The recently - introduced method of Bourgoin and Danilewski, based
                    upon the differing specific gravities of grey and white matter, promises to give
                    definite information as to the relative amounts of these forms of brain-matter;
                    but further experiments are needed to perfect the method.<note anchored="true"

                <p>6. The relations, if any, between the alterations which take place in the shape
                    and position of the head and alterations in brain-surface have been speculated
                    on by the phrenologist. Broussais is reported to have said that his organ of
                    causality had enlarged with increasing use, and a list of cases of similar
                    alterations of head-shape is given by Deville <hi rend="italic">(Phrén.
                        Jοur.,</hi> xiv. 32), most of which are simply age-changes, of the kind
                    described by Professor Cleland <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1870).
                    There are no exact measurements recorded which indicate the occurrence of
                    topical increases of a normal brain in special directions coincident with the
                    cultivation of definite faculties. All the so-called cases are given vaguely,
                    with no measurements, and the careful measurements of George Combe in such cases
                    as were available to him showed no appreciable alterations in adult heads even
                    at long intervals of time (see also Andrew Combe, <hi rend="italic">Phren.
                        Jοurn. X.</hi> 414).</p>

                <p>7. The phrenological want of knowledge of the topography of the brain-surface was
                    necessarily correlated with ignorance of the exact relations of the convolutions
                    to the interior of the cranial bones; these have been carefully worked out by
                    Huschke, Heffler, Turner, and Reid. Some latitude, however, must be allowed in
                    topography, as the exact relation of convolution to skull varies with the shape
                    of the skull. Giacomini showed that the fissure of Rolando is perceptibly
                    farther back from the coronal suture in dolichocephalic than in brachycephalic
                    skulls, and it is still farther back in the extreme boat-shaped form of
                    long-headedness. Passet shows that there is a slight topographical difference in
                    the two sexes <hi rend="italic">{Arch, f Anthrop.,</hi> 1882, xiv. 89), and in
                    the heads of those with un symmetrically-shaped skulls there is often a want of
                    lateral symmetry of convolution. Artificial deformations likewise alter the
                    topographical relations of convolutions, and have served not a little to puzzle
                    the phrenologist. Thus, the artificial dolichocephaly of the Caribs having
                    bulged the squama occipitis, they decided that these people must be amiable
                    lovers of children,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>Martius tells us that the Caribs castrate their own children, fatten
                            and eat them, an abuse of the organ of philoprogenitiveness; see also
                            Garcilaso de la Vega, <hi rend="italic">Hist, des Incas,</hi> i.

                <p>8. The existence of structural differences between different areas of cerebral
                    surface is important to any theory of cerebral localization, but no phrenologist
                    has given us any original information on this point. Since the investigation of
                        Baillarger,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                                rend="italic">Mém. de</hi><hi rend="italic">VAcad,</hi><hi
                                rend="italic">de Médecine,</hi> 1840, viii. 149.</p></note> it has
                    been shown that some local differentiations of structure do really exist. Thus
                    in the convolutions around the fissure of Rolando the. ganglion-cells of the
                    fourth layer are of large size (giant-cells of Betz), and in the convolutions of
                    the temporo-sphenoidal lobe a layer of small angular cells (granule-cells) is
                    interposed between the larger pyramidal and the ganglion-cells, so that, while
                    in the parts of the brain above the fissure of Sylvius the grey cortex is for
                    the most part five-layered, below and behind that fissure it is six-layered.
                    There is no abrupt passage from the one to the other, the only sudden transition
                    of structure of the grey cortex being at the hippocampal sulcus; and
                    giant-cells, although of smaller size, and less like those of the anterior cornu
                    of the spinal cord, are scattered over other parts of the cerebral grey
                        matter.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For further

                    can be seen by comparing that figure with the foregoing series.</p>
                <p>The teachings of anatomy with regard to phrenology may be summarized thus: (1)
                    the rate of growth of brain is concurrent with the rate of development of mental
                    faculty; (2) there is some degree of structural differentiation as there are
                    varying rates of development of different parts of the cerebral surface; (3)
                    there is no accordance between the regions of Gall and Spurzheim and definite
                    areas of cerebral surface.</p>

                    Brougham and Jeffrey as against the theory of phrenology; but the doctrine that
                    the brain is the organ of the mind is now universally received. While it is
                    probable that certain molecular changes in the grey matter are antecedents or
                    concomitants of mental phenomena, the precise nature of these processes, to what
                    extent they take place, or how they vary among themselves have not as yet been
                    determined experimentally; the occurrence of the change can only be demonstrated

                    yet not a single step has been made towards the understanding of the connexion
                    between the molecular changes in the nerve-cell and the phenomena of thought and

                    division of labour in the nerve-centres, is largely hypothetical and based on
                    anatomical structure. Certain masses of grey nerve-matter situated in the spinal
                    cord and medulla oblongata are so linked by nerve-cords to organs outside the
                    nervous system which are set apart for the discharge of separate functions that
                    they obviously form parts of the mechanism for the fulfilment of such functions.
                    In the cases where these can be subjected to experiment we learn that they are
                    nervous centres presiding over the discharge of such functions; and it has been
                    determined by experiment, or else deduced from anatomical structure, that in
                    those lower parts of the nervous centres which are more directly connected with
                    the segmental elements of the body there is a certain localization of function;
                    hence the centres of pelvic actions, of respiration, cardiac action, and
                    inhibition of vaso-motor influence, deglutition, secretions, &amp;c., can be
                    mapped out in ascending series. As certain of these centres are united by bands
                    of fibres to the larger and higher-lying grey portions of the nervous centres
                    there is an <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> presumption in favour of the
                    extension of this principle of localization. This has been premised on
                    metaphysical as well as on anatomical grounds. Bonnet believed each portion of
                    the brain to have a specifically separate function, and Herbert Spencer has said
                    that “no physiologist can long resist the conviction that different parts of the
                    cerebrum subserve different kinds of mental action. Localization of function is
                    the law of all organization whatever; separateness of duty is universally
                    accompanied with separateness of structure, and it would be marvellous were an
                    exception to exist in the cerebral hemispheres. Let it be granted that the
                    cerebral hemispheres are the seats of the higher psychical activities; let it be
                    granted that among these higher psychical activities there are distinctions of
                    kind which, though not definite, are yet practically recognizable, and it cannot
                    be denied, without going in direct opposition to established physiological
                    principles, that these more or less distinct kinds of psychical activity must be
                    carried on in more or less distinct parts of the cerebral hemisphere.”</p>

                        >Physiology,</hi> section “Nervous System.”</p>
                <p>There is a large weight of evidence, which cannot be explained away, in favour of
                    the existence of some form of localization of function. So little is known of
                    the physical changes which underlie psychical phenomena, or indeed of the
                    succession of the psychical processes themselves, that we cannot as yet judge as
                    to the nature of the mechanism of these centres. So much of the psychic work of
                    the individual life consists in the interpretation of sensations and the
                    translation of these into motions that there are strong <hi rend="italic">a
                        priori</hi> grounds for expecting to find much of the material of the
                    nerve-centres occupied with this kind of work, but in the present conflict of
                    experimental evidence it is safer to suspend judgment. That these local areas
                    are not centres in the sense of being indispensable parts of their respective
                    motor apparatuses is clear, as the function abolished by ablation of a part
                    returns, though tardily, so that whatever superintendence the removed region
                    exercised apparently becomes assumed by another part of the brain.<note

                <p><hi rend="italic">Psychological Aspect.—</hi> The fundamental hypothesis which
                    underlies phrenology as a system of mental science is that mental phenomena are
                    resolvable into the manifestations of a group of separate faculties. A faculty
                    is defined as “a convenient expression for the particular states into which the
                    mind enters when influenced by particular organs; it is applied to the feelings
                    as well as to the intellect, thus the faculty of benevolence means every mode of
                    benevolence induced by the organ of benevolence” (Combe). In another work the
                    same author says it is “used to denote a particular power of feeling, thinking,
                    perceiving, connected with a particular part of the brain.” The assumption is
                    contained in the definition that the exercise of a faculty is the physical
                    outcome of the activity of the organ, and in several of the standard works this
                    is illustrated by analogies between these and other organs; thus the organs of
                    benevolence and of firmness are said to be as distinct as the liver and
                    pancreas. The mind, according to another author, consists of the sum of all the
                    faculties. In this view the unity of consciousness is somewhat difficult to
                    explain, and consequently there is assumed by others a single unifying
                    substratum, and on this the organs are supposed to act; thus thoughts are
                    defined as “relations of the simple substance, mind, to certain portions of the
                    encephalon” (Welsh, <hi rend="italic">Plιrcn. Journ.,</hi> i. 206). Gall himself
                    believed that there was but a single principle which saw, felt, tasted, heard,
                    touched, thought, and willed <hi rend="italic">(Fonctions du Cerveau,</hi> i.
                    243); and the American exponent of phrenology, Caldwell, says “the mind is as
                    single in its power as it is in its substance; it is a quickening and operating
                    principle, essential to all the mental faculties, but does not, by any means,
                    possess them itself” <hi rend="italic">(Elements,</hi> p. 16). It is not easy to
                    understand the supposed relation of this hypothetical substratum to the separate
                    faculties acting on it. It must be both immaterial and unconnected with the
                    brain, as the whole two thousand million cells supposed to exist in the cerebral
                    hemispheres are all parcelled out among the faculties, and none are left for the
                    unifying <hi rend="italic">nous.</hi></p>
                <p>Each organ is considered as engaged, either independently in bringing forth its
                    own product, or collectively with others in elaborating compound mental states,
                    and according to their several degrees of development and activity they are
                    considered capable of perceiving, conceiving, recollecting, judging, or
                    imagining each its own subject. This mechanical conception of the division of
                    labour in the production of the phenomena of mind has the charm of simplicity,
                    but is attended with the difficulty that arises in discriminating the operations
                    of the different organs one from the other. Phrenologists are apt to be vague
                    respecting the limits of the several faculties, as about the boundaries of the
                    separate organs. It was pointed out by Jeffrey that the lines of demarcation
                    between benevolence, adhesiveness, and philoprogenitiveness were indeterminate,
                    although the organs are not very close, and the same applies to other
                    organs.</p>
                <p>It is unfortunate for the clearness of the definition that, although historically
                    the faculties were the first phenomena noted, independent of and previous to
                    their localization, yet in the definition the faculties are defined in terms of
                    their localities.'</p>
                <p>The following arguments are adduced in favour of the fundamental separateness of
                    the faculties; (1) analogy,— elsewhere in the animal economy division of labour
                    is the rule; (2) the variety of mental endowment observed among children before
                    they are influenced by education, and the inequalities in the mental endowments
                    of individuals; (3) the phenomena of insanity, especially of monomania; (4) the
                    varying periods at which individual faculties attain their maximum development;
                    (5) the phenomena of dreams, and the awakening of a limited number of faculties
                    during them; (6) pain being felt in an organ when it is overtaxed.<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is interesting in this
                            connexion to note that in a case published by Professor Hamilton in <hi
                                rend="italic">Brain</hi> (April 1884), where a tumour existed on the
                            occipital lobe, the pain was persistently referred to the forehead. Many
                            similar cases are to be noticed among the records of localized
                            brain-lesions. Bearing on this point also it is worth noting, once for
                            all, that in nothing is the purely hypothetical nature of phrenological
                            description better realized than in the accounts of what these authors
                            call the “natural language of the faculties, ”—that poets are supposed
                            to touch ideality when composing, musicians to press on tone and time,
                            and painters on form and colour, when in the exercise of their arts! Yet
                            we are gravely taught this in the standard works on the
                        subject.</p></note></p>
                <p>Such faculties are supposed to be primary—(1) as exist in some animals and not in
                    others, (2) as vary in their development in the sexes, (3) as are developed in
                    varying proportions with regard to other faculties, (4) as may act separately
                    from other faculties, (5) as are not necessarily simultaneous with other
                    faculties in action, (6) as are hereditary, and (7) as may be singly
                    diseased.</p>
                <p>According to the development of their powers mankind may be divided into six
                    classes: (1) those in whom the highest qualities are largely developed and the
                    animal qualities feeble; (2) those with the reversed conditions developed, with
                    large animal and feeble intellectual and moral faculties; (3) those in whom good
                    and evil are in constant war, with active animal and strong intellectual
                    faculties and sentiments; (4) those partial geniuses in whom a few qualities are
                    unusually developed, while the rest are at or below the mediocre standard; (5)
                    those men of moderate endowment in whom some faculties are nearly or quite
                    deficient; (6) those with an unvarying standard of undistinguished mediocrity in
                    all their faculties.</p>
                <p>It is perhaps unfortunate that the word “faculty” has been used in this sense of
                    original power by phrenologists. It would have been better to employ, as Mr
                    Lewes suggests, the term “function” for the native activity of an organ, and to
                    leave “faculty” for the expression of an acquired activity. “Faculty is properly
                    limited to active power, and therefore is abusively applied to the mere passive
                    affections of the mind” (Hamilton, <hi rend="italic">Lectures,</hi> i. 177).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Practical Application.—</hi> “Die Schädellehre ist allerdings
                    nicht so sehr Irrthum in der Idee als Charlatanerie in der Ausführung,” says one
                    of its most acute critics. Even though no fault could be found with the
                    physiology and psychology of phrenology, it would not necessarily follow that
                    the theory could be utilized as a practical method of reading character; for,
                    although the inner surface of the skull is moulded on the brain, and the outer
                    surface approximates to parallelism thereto, yet the correspondence is
                    sufficiently variable to render conclusions therefrom uncertain. The spongy
                    layer or diploe which separates the two compact tables may vary conspicuously in
                    amount in different parts of the same skull, as in the cases described by
                    Professor Humphry <hi rend="italic">(Journ. of Anat.,</hi> vol. viii. p. 137).
                    The frontal sinus, that <hi rend="italic">opprobrium ρhrenologicum,</hi> is a
                    reality, not unfrequently of large size, and may wholly occupy the regions of
                    five organs. The centres of ossification of the frontal and parietal bones, the
                    muscular crests of these and of the occipital bones also, differ in their
                    prominence in different skulls. Premature synostoses of sutures mould the brain
                    without doing much injury to its parts. Artificial malformations alter the
                    apparent skullshape considerably and affect the relative development of the
                    brain but little. All these and other cogent reasons of a like kind, whose force
                    can be estimated by those accustomed to deal with the component soft parts of
                    the head, should lead phrenologists to be careful in predicating relative
                    brain-development from skull-shape. Psychology, physiology, and experience alike
                    contribute to discredit <pb break="no"

                    so-called diagnoses of character really are. Its application by those who are
                    its votaries is seldom worse than amusing, but it is capable of doing positive
                    social harm, as in its proposed application to the discrimination or selection
                    of servants and other subordinate officials. It has even been proposed to use it
                    for the purposes of the guarantee society and for the selection of parliamentary
                    representatives. The sarcastic suggestion which originated with Christopher
                    North of moulding children’s heads so as to suppress the evil and foster the
                    good was actually repeated in good faith by a writer on phrenology, but
                    experience of the effects of malformation leads one to be sceptical as to the
                    feasibility of this mode of producing a social Utopia. The application of
                    phrenology to the art of painting and sculpture has been suggested, but a
                    careful examination of some of the best pictures of the best masters, who were
                    close observers of nature, shows that no phrenological principles were accepted
                    by them in their works. An application to ethnology has also been proposed; but,
                    although there are in most cases well-marked racial characters presented by the
                    skull, yet all attempts at correlating national characteristics therewith have
                    been groundless and worthless. For further particulars on allied subjects, see

                    different periods that a sketch of its history must precede any account of the

                    closely akin to certain tribes of Macedonia and Thrace; and their near
                    relationship to the Hellenic stock is proved by all that is known of their
                    language and art, and is accepted by almost every modern authority. The country
                    named Phrygia in the better known period of history lies inland, separated from
                    the sea by Paphlagonia, Bithynia, Mysia, and Lydia. Yet we hear of a Phrygian

                    in Asia Minor and in Europe, and many other examples might be added. The
                    inference has been generally drawn that the Phrygians were a stock widespread in
                    the countries which lie round the Aegean Sea. There is, however, no decisive
                    evidence, and no agreement among modern scholars, as to whether this stock came
                    from the East over Armenia, or whether it was European in origin and crossed the

                <p>According to Greek tradition there existed in early time a Phrygian kingdom in
                    the Sangarius valley, ruled by kings among whom the names Gordius and Midas were
                    common. It was known to the ancient Greeks of Ionia and the Troad as something
                    great and half-divine. When the goddess appeared to her favourite Anchises she
                    represented herself as daughter of the king of Phrygia; the Phrygians were said

                    (Herod., v. 55). The royal road followed a route so difficult and circuitous
                    that it is quite unintelligible as the direct path from any centre in Persia,
                    Assyria, or Syria to the west of Asia Minor. It can be understood only by
                    reference to an imperial centre far in the north. The old trade-route from
                    Cappadocia to Sinope, which had passed out of use centuries before the time of
                    Strabo (pp. 540, 546), fixes this centre with precision. It must be far enough

                    must have stood the capital of some great empire connected with its extremities,
                    Sardis or Ephesus on the west, Sinope on the north, the Cilician Gates on the
                    south, by roads so well made as to continue in use for a long time after the
                    centre of power had changed to Assyria, and the old road-system had become

                    presents on all sides a perpendicular face of rock 50 to 200 feet in height. In
                    part, at least, this natural defence was crowned by a wall built of large

                    Phrygian kingdom and art therefore took the place of an older civilization. It
                    is as yet impossible to determine the relation in which the Phrygians stood to
                    the ruling race of that older period, whether they came in from the north-west,
                    or whether they were a primitive people taught, and for a time ruled, by
                    foreigners from Cappadocia, but at last expelling their teachers. It is probable
                    that the tradition of battles between the Phrygians and the Amazons on the banks
                    of the Sangarius preserves the memory of a struggle between the two races.<note

                <p>Of the monuments that exist around this city two classes may be confidently
                    referred to the period of Phrygian greatness. That which is inscribed with the
                    name of “Midas the King” is the most remarkable example of one class, in which a
                    large perpendicular surface of rock is covered with a geometrical pattern of
                    squares, crosses, and maeanders, surmounted by a pediment supported in the
                    centre by a pilaster in low relief. In some cases a floral pattern occupies part
                    of the surface, and in one case the two sides of the pediment are filled by two
                    sphinxes of extremely archaic type.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    lower part; the door is usually closed, but in one case, viz., the sphinx
                    monument just alluded to, the valves of the door are thrown wide open and give
                    access to a little chamber, on the back of which is sculptured in relief a rude
                    image of the Mother-goddess Cybele, having on each side of her a lion which
                    rests its forepaws on her shoulder and places its head against hers. Sometimes a
                    grave has been found hidden behind the carved front; in other cases no grave can
                    be detected, but it is probable that they are all sepulchral.<note

                            fall into two groups, which probably mark the sites of two cities about
                            16 miles distant from each other. One group lies round the villages of
                            Kumbet, Yapuldak, and Bakshish; the other beside Liyen, Bei Keui,
                            Demirli, and Ayazin.</p></note> The imitation of wood-work is obvious on
                    several monuments of this kind. The second class is marked by the heraldic type
                    of two animals, usually lions rampant, facing one another, but divided by a
                    pillar or some other device. This type is occasionally found conjoined with the
                    preceding; and various details common to both classes show that there was no
                    great difference in time between them. The heraldic type is used on the
                    monuments which appear to be the older, and the geometrical pattern is often
                    employed on the inscribed monuments, which are obviously later than the
                    uninscribed. Monuments of this class are carved on the front of a sepulchral
                    chamber, the entrance to which is a small doorway placed high and inaccessible
                    in the rocks.</p>
                <p>Early Phrygian art stands in close relationship with the art of Cappadocia, but
                    has such individuality, such freedom from conventionality, such power of varying
                    and combining types learned from other peoples, as to show that the Phrygians
                    possessed high artistic faculty very similar in character to the Greek. The
                    monuments of the type of the Midas tomb are obviously imitated from patterns
                    employed in cloth and carpets. Such patterns were used in Cappadocia, and the
                    priest in the rocksculpture at Ibriz wears an embroidered robe strikingly
                    similar in style to the pattern on the Midas tomb; but the idea of using the
                    pattern as the Phrygians did seems peculiar to themselves. The heraldic type of
                    the second class is found also in the art of Assyria, and was undoubtedly
                    adopted by the Phrygians from earlier art; but it is used so frequently in
                    Phrygia as to be specially characteristic of that country.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The heraldic type continues on
                            gravestones down to the latest period of paganism. Carpets with
                            geometrical patterns of the Midas-tomb style are occasionally found at
                            the present time in the houses of the peasantry of the
                        district.</p></note> While Phrygian art is distinctly non-Oriental in
                    spirit, its resemblance to archaic Greek art is a fact of the greatest
                    importance. It is not merely that certain types are employed both in Phrygia and
                    in Greece, but most of the favourite types in early Greek art can be traced in
                    Phrygia, employed in similar spirit and for similar purposes. The heraldic type
                    of the two lions is the device over the principal gateway of Mycenae, and stamps
                    this, the oldest great monument on Greek soil, with a distinctly Phrygian
                    character. Mycenae was the city of the Pelopidae, whom Greek tradition
                    unhesitatingly declares to be Phrygian immigrants. A study of the topography of
                    the Argive plain leads to the conclusion that Mycenae, Midea, and Tiryns form a
                    group of cities founded by an immigrant people in opposition to Argos, the
                    natural capital of the plain and the stronghold of the native race. Midea <pb

                    that binds Mycenae to Phrygia. This connexion, whatever may have been its
                    character, belongs to the remote period when the Phrygians inhabited the Aegean
                    coasts. In the 8th and probably in the 9th century B.c. communication with
                    Phrygia seems to have been maintained especially by the Greeks of Cyme, Phocaea,
                    and Smyrna. About the end of the 8th century Midas king of Phrygia married
                    Damodice, daughter of Agamemnon, the last king of Cyme. Gyges, the first Mermnad
                    king of Lydia (687-653), had a Phrygian mother. The worship of Cybele spread
                    over Phocaea to the west as far as Massilia: rock monuments in the Phrygian
                    style and votive reliefs of an Anatolian type are found near Phocaea. Smyrna was
                    devoted to the Phrygian Meter Sipylene. It is then natural that the lays of the
                    Homeridae refer to Phrygia in the terms above described, and make Priam’s wife a
                    Phrygian woman. After the foundation of the Greek colony at Sinope in 751 there
                    can be no doubt that it formed the link of connexion between Greece and Phrygia.
                    Phrygian and Cappadocian traders brought their goods, no doubt on camels, to
                    Sinope, and the Greek sailors, the <hi rend="italic">dεινaυτaι of</hi> Miletus,
                    carried home the works of Oriental and Phrygian artisans. The Greek alphabet was
                    carried back to Phrygia and Pteria, either from Sinope or more probably from
                    Cyme, in the latter part of the 8th century. The immense importance of Sinope in
                    early times is abundantly attested, and we need not doubt that very intimate
                    relations existed at this port between the Ionic colonists and the natives. The
                    effects of this commerce on the development of Greece were very great. It
                    affected Ionia in the first place, and the mainland of Greece indirectly; the
                    art of Ionia at this period is almost unknown, but it was probably most closely
                    allied to that of Phrygia.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                            Winckelm. Progr., 1884. The closest analogies of old Phrygian art are to
                            be found in the earliest Greek bronze work in Olympia, Italy, and the
                            northern lands.</p></note> A striking fact in this connexion is the
                    frequent use of a very simple kind of Ionic capital on the early Phrygian
                    monuments, making it practically certain that the “protoIonic” column came to
                    Greece over Phrygia. It is obvious that the revolution which took place in the
                    relations between Phrygians and Greeks must be due to some great movement of
                    races which disturbed the old paths of communication. Abel is probably correct
                    in placing the inroads of the barbarous European tribes, Bithynians, Thyni,
                    Mariandyni, &amp;c., into Asia Minor about the beginning of the 9th century B.c.
                    The Phrygian element on the coast was weakened and in many places annihilated;
                    that in the interior was strengthened; and we may suppose that the kingdom of
                    the Sangarius valley now sprang into greatness. The kingdom of Lydia appears to
                    have become important about the end of the 8th century, and to have completely
                    barred the path between Phrygia and Cyme or Smyrna. Ionian maritime enterprise
                    opened a new way over Sinope.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        century.</p></note></p>
                <p>The downfall of the Phrygian monarchy can be dated with comparative accuracy.
                    Between 680 and 670 the Cimmerians in their destructive progress over Asia Minor
                    overran Phrygia; the king Midas in despair put an end to his own life; and from
                    henceforth the history of Phrygia is a story of slavery, degradation, and decay,
                    which contrasts strangely with the earlier legends. The catastrophe seems to
                    have deeply impressed the Greek mind, and the memory of it was preserved. The
                    date of the Cimmerian invasion is fixed by the concurrent testimony of the
                    contemporary poets Archilochus and Callinus, of the late chronologers Eusebius,
                    &amp;c., and of the inscriptions of the Assyrian king Essar-haddon. The
                    Cimmerians were finally expelled from Asia Minor by Alyattes before his war with
                    the Medes under Cyaxares (590-585 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> The
                    Cimmerians, therefore, were ravaging Asia Minor, and presumably held possession
                    of Phrygia, the only country where they achieved complete success, till some
                    time between 610 and 590. Phrygia then fell under the Lydian power, and by the
                    treaty of 585 the Halys was definitely fixed as the boundary between Lydia and
                    Media. The period from 675 to 585 must therefore be considered as one of great
                    disturbance and probably of complete paralysis in Phrygia. After 585 the country
                    was ruled again by its own princes, under subjection to Lydian supremacy. To
                    judge from the monuments, it appears to have recovered some of its old
                    prosperity, but the art of this later period has to a great extent lost the
                    strongly-marked individuality of its earlier bloom. The later sepulchral
                    monuments belong to a class which is widely spread over Asia Minor, from Lycia
                    to Pontus. The graves are made inside a chamber excavated in the rock, and the
                    front of the chamber imitates a house or temple. No attempt is made to conceal
                    the entrance or render it inaccessible. The architectural details are in some
                    cases unmistakably copied without ntentional modification from the architecture
                    of Greek temples, others point perhaps to Persian influence, while several—which
                    are perhaps among the early works of this period—show the old freedom and power
                    of employing in new and original ways details partly learned from abroad. This
                    style continued in use under the Persians, under whose rule the Phrygians passed
                    when Cyrus defeated Croesus in 546, and probably lasted till the 3d century <hi

                    however, be quite wrong to suppose that the influence of truly Hellenic art on
                    Phrygia began with the conquest of Alexander. Under the later Mermnad kings the
                    Lydian empire was penetrated with Greek influence, and Xanthus, the early Lydian
                    historian, wrote his history in Greek. Under the Persian rule perhaps it was
                    more difficult for Greek manners to spread far east; but we need not think that
                    European influence was absolutely unfelt even in Phrygia. The probability is
                    that Alexander found in all the large cities a party favourable to Greek manners
                    and trade. Very little is to be learned from the ancient writers with regard to
                    the state of Phrygia from 585 to 300. The slave-trade flourished: Phrygian
                    slaves were common in the Greek market, and the Phrygian names Midas and Manes
                    were stock-names for slaves. Herodotus (i. 14) records that a king Midas of
                    Phrygia dedicated his own chair at Delphi; the chair stood in the treasury of
                    Cypselus, and cannot have been deposited there before 680 to 660 B.c. It is not
                    improbable that the event belongs to the time of Alyattes or Craesus, when Greek
                    influence was favoured throughout the Lydian empire; and it is easy to
                    understand how the offering of a king Midas should be considered, in the time of
                    Herodotus, as the earliest made by a foreign prince to a Greek god. The Phrygian
                    troops in the army of Xerxes were armed like the Armenians and led by the same
                    commander.</p>
                <p>It is to be presumed that the cities of the Sangarius valley gradually lost
                    importance in the Persian period. Formerly the great line of communication
                    across Anatolia traversed the Sangarius valley, but a better and shorter path
                    south of the Salt Desert came into use in this period, from which these cities
                    were far distant. The final catastrophe was the invasion of the Gauls about 270
                    to 250; and, though the circumstances of this invasion are almost <pb break="no"

                    the complete devastation of northern Phrygia. At last Attalus I. settled the
                    Gauls permanently in eastern Phrygia, and a large part of the country was
                    henceforth known as Galatia. Strabo mentions that the great cities of ancient
                    Phrygia were in his time either deserted or marked by mere villages. The great
                    city over the tomb of Midas has remained uninhabited down to the present day.
                    About 5 miles west of it, near the modern Kumbet, stood Merus, a bishopric in
                    the Byzantine time, but never mentioned under the Roman empire.</p>
                <p>Alexander the Great placed Phrygia under the command of Antigonus, who retained
                    it when the empire was broken up. When Antigonus was defeated and slain at the
                    decisive battle of Ipsus, Phrygia came under the sway of Seleucus. As the
                    Pergamenian kings grew powerful, and at last confined the Gauls in eastern
                    Phrygia, the western half of the country was incorporated in the kingdom of
                    Pergamum. Under the Roman empire Phrygia had no political existence under a

                    time it was common for the Phrygians to date from this era. The imperial rule
                    was highly favourable to the spread of Hellenistic civilization, which under the
                    Greek kings had affected only a few of the great cities, leaving the mass of the
                    country purely Phrygian. A good deal of local self-government was permitted: the
                    cities struck their own bronze coins, inscribed on them the names of their own

                    empire were reorganized and divided into “themata” the two Phrygias were broken
                    up between the Anatolic, Opsician, and Thracesian themes, and the name Phrygia
                    finally disappeared. Almost the whole of the Byzantine Phrygias is now included
                    in the vilayet of Broussa or Khodavendikya, with the exception of a small part
                    of Parorius and the district about Themisonium (Karayuk Bazar) and Ceretapa
                    (Kayadibi), which belong to the vilayet of Koniyeh, and the district of Laodicea
                    and Hierapolis, which belongs to Aidin. The principal modern cities are Kutayah
                    (Cotyaeum), Eski Sheher (Dorylaeum), Afium Kara Hissar (near Prymnessus), and
                    Ushak (near Trajanopolis).</p>
                <p>It is impossible to say anything definite about the boundaries of Phrygia before
                    the 5th century. Under the Persians Great Phrygia extended on the east to the
                    Halys and the Salt Desert; Xenophon <hi rend="italic">{Anab.,</hi> i. 2, 19)
                    includes Iconium on the south-east within the province, whereas Strabo makes
                    Tyriaeum the boundary in this direction. The southern frontier is unknown: the
                    language of Livy (xxxviii. 15) implies that Metropolis (in the Tchul Ova)
                    belonged to Pisidia; but Strabo (p. 629) includes it in Phrygia. Celaenae,
                    beside the later city of Apamea (Dineir), and the entire valley of the Lycus
                    were Phrygian. The Maeander above its junction with the Lycus formed for a
                    little way the boundary between Phrygia and Lydia. The great plateau now called
                    the Banaz Ova was entirely or in great part Phrygian. Mount Dindymus (Murad
                    Dagh) marked the frontier of Mysia, and the entire valley of the Tembrogius or
                    Tembris (Porsuk Su) was certainly included in Phrygia. The boundaries of the two
                    Byzantine Phrygias were not always the same. Taking Hierocles as authority, the
                    extent of the two provinces at the beginning of the 6th century will be readily
                    gathered from the accompanying list, in which those towns which coined money
                    under the Roman empire are italicized and the nearest modern village is

                <p>Besides these, certain cities beyond the bounds of the Byzantine Phrygias
                    belonged under the Roman empire to the province of Asia and are usually
                    considered Phrygian—(1) in Byzantine Pisidia, <hi rend="italic">Philomelium</hi>

                <p>Phrygia contains several well-marked geographical districts. (1) <hi

                    north-west to south-east between the Sultan Dagh and the Emir Dagh from Holmi
                    (about Tchai) to Tyriaeum (Ilghin); its waters collect within the valley, in
                    three lakes, which probably supply the great fountains in the Axylum, and
                    through them the Sangarius. (2) <hi rend="smallcaps">Axylum,</hi> the vast

                    assigned to Galatia. (3) The rest of Phrygia is mountainous (except the great
                    plateau, Banaz Ova), consisting of hill-country intersected by rivers, each of
                    which flows through a fertile valley of varying breadth. The northern half is
                    drained by rivers which run to the Black Sea; of these the eastern ones, Porsuk
                    Su (Tembris or Tembrogius), Seidi Su (Parthenius), Bardakchi Tchai (Xerabates),
                    and Bayat Tchai (Alandrus), join the Sangarius, while the western,<note

                    (Rhyndacus) and Simav Tchai (Macestus), meet and flow into the Propontis. The
                    Hermus drains a small district included in the Byzantine Phrygia, but in earlier
                    times assigned to Lydia and Mysia. Great part of southern and western Phrygia is
                    drained by the Maeander with its tributaries, Sandykly Tchai (Glaucus), Banaz
                    Tchai, Kopli Su (Hippurius), and Tchuruk Su (Lycus); moreover, some upland
                    plains on the south, especially the Dombai Ova (Aulocra), communicate by
                    underground channels with the Maeander. Finally, the Karayuk Ova in the extreme
                    south-west drains through the Kazanes, a tributary of the Indus, to the Lycîan
                    Sea. Phrygia Parorius and all the river-valleys are exceedingly fertile, and
                    agriculture was the chief occupation of the ancient inhabitants; according to
                    the myth, Gordius was called from the plough to the throne. The high-lying
                    plains and the vast Axylum furnish excellent pasturage, which formerly nourished
                    countless flocks of sheep. The Romans also obtained fine horses from Phrygia.
                    Grapes, which still grow abundantly in various parts, were much cultivated in
                    ancient times. Other fruits are rare, except in a few small districts. Figs
                    cannot be grown in the country, and the ancient references to Phrygian figs are
                    either erroneous or due to a loose use of the term Phrygia.<note anchored="true"

                    parts of the Banaz Ova, and a few other districts, form exceptions. The
                    underground wealth is not known to be great. Iron was worked in the district of
                    Cibyra, and the marble of Synnada, or more correctly of Docimium, was largely
                    used by the Romans. The scenery is generally monotonous; even the mountainous
                    districts rarely show striking features or boldness of character; where the
                    landscape has beauty, it is of a subdued melancholy character. The water-supply
                    is rarely abundant, and agriculture is more or less dependent on an uncertain
                    rainfall. The circumstances of the country are well calculated to impress the
                    inhabitants with a sense of the overwhelming power of nature and of their
                    complete dependence on it. Their mythology, so far as we know it, has a
                    melancholy and mystic tone, and their religion partakes of the same character.
                    The two chief deities were Cybele, the Mother, the reproductive and nourishing
                    power of Earth, and Sabazius, the Son, the life of nature, dying and reviving
                    every year. The annual vicissitudes of the life of Sabazius, the Greek Dionysus,
                    were accompanied by the mimic rites of his worshippers, who mourned with his
                    sufferings and rejoiced with his joy. They enacted the story of his birth and
                    life and death; the Earth, the Mother, is fertilized only by an act of violence
                    by her own child; the representative of the god was probably slain each year by
                    a cruel death, just as the god himself died.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    one curious point of Semitic religion never penetrated west of the Halys: the
                    pig was always unclean and abhorred among the Semites, whereas it was the animal
                    regularly used in purification by the Phrygians, Lydians, Lycians, and
                        Greeks.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cleon, the
                            Phrygian, when high priest of the Cappadocian goddess at Comana, caused
                            much scandal by using pigs in the sacred precincts (Strabo, p. 574); he
                            only carried out the customs of his country. Pigs were used in all Greek
                            purificatory rites, which were also practised in Lydia (Herod., i. 35).
                            A pig is under the seat of the deified dead on the harpy
                        tomb.</p></note> The Phrygian religion exercised a very strong influence on
                    Greece. In the archaic period the Dionysiae rites and orgies spread from Thrace
                    into Greece, in spite of opposition which has left many traces in tradition, and
                    the worship of Demeter at Eleusis was modified by Cretan influence ultimately
                    traceable to Asia Minor. Pindar erected a shrine of the Mother of the gods
                    beside his house, and the Athenians were directed by the Delphic oracle to atone
                    for the execution of a priest of Cybele during the Peloponnesian War by building
                    the Metroon. In these and other cases the Phrygian character was more or less
                    Hellenized; but wave after wave of religious influence from Asia. Minor
                    introduced into Greece the unmodified “barbarian” ritual of Phrygia. The rites
                    spread first among the common people and those engaged in foreign trade. The
                    comic poets satirized them, and Plato and Demosthenes inveighed against them;
                    but they continued to spread, with all their fervid enthusiasm, their
                    superstition, and their obscene practices, wide among the people, whose
                    religious cravings were not satisfied with the purely external religions of
                    Hellenism. The orgies or mysteries were open to all, freemen or slaves, who had
                    duly performed the preliminary purifications, and secured to the participants
                    salvation and remission of sins. Under <hi rend="smallcaps">Mysteries</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">{q.v.)</hi> a distinction of character has been pointed out
                    between the true Hellenic mysteries, such as the Eleusinian, and the Phrygian;
                    but there certainly existed much similarity between the two rituals. In the
                    first centuries after Christ only the Phrygian and the Egyptian rites retained
                    much real hold on the Graeco-Roman world. Phrygia itself, however, was very
                    early converted to Christianity. Christian inscriptions in the country begin in
                    the 2d and are abundant in the 3d century. There is every appearance that the
                    great mass of the people were Christians before 300, and Eusebius <hi
                        rend="italic">{H. E.,</hi> v. 16) is probably correct in his statement that
                    in the time of Diocletian there was a Phrygian city in which every living soul
                    was Christian. The great Phrygian saint of the 2d century was named Abercius;
                    the mass of legends and miracles in the late biography of him long brought his
                    very existence into dispute, but a recently-discovered fragment of his
                    gravestone has proved that he was a real person, and makes it probable that the
                    wide-reaching conversion of the people attributed to him did actually take
                    place. The strange enthusiastic character of the old Phrygian religion was not
                    wholly lost when the country became Christian, but is clearly traced in the
                    various heresies that arose in central Anatolia. Especially the wild ecstatic
                    character and the prophecies of the Montanists recall the old type of religion.
                    Montanus (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Montanism,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 775) was born on
                    the borders of Phrygia and Mysia (doubtless in the Murad Dagh), and was
                    vehemently opposed by Abercius.</p>
                <p>Of the old Phrygian language very little is known; a few words are preserved in
                    Hesychius and other writers. Plato mentions that the Phrygian words for “dog,”
                    “fire,” &amp;c., were the same as the Greek; and to these we may add from
                    inscriptions the words for “mother” and “king.” A few inscriptions of the
                    ancient period are known, and a somewhat larger number of the Roman period have
                    been found, but not yet published.</p>
                <p>Owing to the scantiness of published material about Phrygia frequent reference
                    has been made in this article to unpublished monuments, and historical views are
                    stated which have only quite recently been published by the writer. Besides the
