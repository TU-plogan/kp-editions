                    Onofrio at Naples, where he studied under Durante, and in process of time rose
                    to the position of assistant master. For the theatre of the Conservatorio he
                    wrote some intermezzi, one of which attracted so much notice that he was invited
                    to write two operas, <hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic">Pupilla</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">II</hi><hi rend="italic">Mondo</hi><hi rend="italic">al
                    Rovescio,</hi> for Bologna, and a third, <hi rend="italic">Il Marchese di
                    Tulipano,</hi> for Rome. His reputation being now firmly established, he settled
                    for some years at Naples, where, notwithstanding the popularity of Piccini,
                    Cimarosa, and Guglielmi, of whose triumphs he was bitterly jealous, he produced
                    a series of highly successful operas, one of which, <hi rend="italic">L'Idolo
                    Cinese,</hi> made a deep impression upon the Neapolitan public. In 1776
                    Paisiello was invited by the empress Catherine II. to St Petersburg, where he
                    remained for eight years, producing, among other charming works, his
                    masterpiece, <hi rend="italic">Il</hi><hi rend="italic">Barbiere</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">di Siυiglia,</hi> which soon attained a European reputation. The
                    fate of this delightful opera marks an epoch in the history of Italian art; for
                    with it the gentle suavity cultivated by the masters of the 18th century died
                    out to make room for the dazzling brilliancy of a later period. When, in 1816,
                    Rossini set the same libretto to music, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Almaviva,</hi> it was hissed from the stage; but it made its way, nevertheless,
                    and under its true title, <hi rend="italic">Il</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Barbiere,</hi> is now acknowledged as Rossini’s greatest work, while
                    Paisiello’s opera is consigned to oblivion,—a strange instance of poetical
                    vengeance, since Paisiello himself had many years previously endeavoured to
                    eclipse the fame of Pergolesi by resetting the libretto of his famous
                    intermezzo, <hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic">serva</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">padrona.</hi></p>
                <p>Paisiello quitted Russia in 1784, and, after producing <hi rend="italic">II Re
                    Teodoro</hi> at Vienna, entered the service of Ferdinand IV. at Naples, where he
                    composed many of his best operas, including <hi rend="italic">Nina</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">La Molinara.</hi> After many vicissitudes, resulting from
                    political and dynastic changes, he was invited to Paris (1802) by Napoleon,
                    whose favour he had won five years previously by a march composed for the
                    funeral of General Hoche. Napoleon treated him munificently, while cruelly
                    neglecting two far greater composers, Cherubini and Méhul, to whom the
                    new’favourite transferred the hatred he had formerly borne to Cimarosa,
                    Guglielmi, and Piccini. But he entirely failed to conciliate the Parisian
                    public, who received his opera <hi rend="italic">Proserpine</hi> so coldly that,
                    in 1803, he requested and with some difficulty obtained permission to return to
                    Italy, upon the plea of his wife’s ill health.</p>
                <p>On his arrival at Naples Paisiello was reinstated in his former appointments by
                    Joseph Bonaparte and Murat, but he no longer enjoyed the brilliant reputation
                    for the attainment of which he had so industriously laboured. He had taxed his
                    genius beyond its strength, and was unable to meet the demands nowmade upon it
                    for new ideas. His prospects, too, were precarious. The power of the Bonaparte
                    family was tottering to its fall; and Paisiello’s fortunes fell with it. The
                    death of his wife, in 1815, tried him severely. His health failed rapidly. His
                    constitutional jealousy of the popularity of others was a continual source of
                    worry and vexation. And on June 5, 1815, he died, a disappointed man,
                    notwithstanding his extraordinary successes and well-earned fame.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to believe that even the best of Paisiello’s operas would be
                    listened to at the present moment with patience, yet they abound with melodies
                    the graceful beauty of which is still warmly appreciated. Perhaps the best known
                    of these charming airs is the famous <hi rend="italic">Nel</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >corpiù</hi> from <hi rend="italic">La Molinara,</hi> immortalized by
                    Beethoven’s delightful variations. The greatest singers of the time spread the
                    fame of this and other similar effusions throughout the length and breadth of
                    Europe. The part of Nina conduced to one of Pasta’s most splendid triumphs; and
                    of the ninety-four operas which Paisiello is known to have composed not one can
                    be said to have been unsuccessful. His church music was very voluminous,
                    comprising one hundred and three masses, besides many smaller works; he also
                    produced fifty-one instrumental compositions of more or less importance, and
                    many detached pieces. MS. scores of many of his operas were presented to the
                    library of the British Museum by the late Signor Dragonetti.</p>
