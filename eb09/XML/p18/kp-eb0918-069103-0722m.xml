                    >Buda</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.vf</hi> on the opposite bank, and the joint city,
                    officially styled Budapest (Ger. <hi rend="italic">Pest-Ofen),</hi> is the
                    capital of Hungary, the second residence of the Austrian emperor, the seat of
                    the Hungarian ministry, diet, and supreme courts, and the headquarters of the
                    commander of the Honvéds or Hungarian landwehr.</p>
                <p>The imposing size of the Danube, here somewhat wider than the Thames at London,
                    and the sharp contrast of the two banks, place Budapest among the most
                    finely-situated of the larger towns of Europe. On the one side is a flat sandy
                    plain in which lies Pesth, modern of aspect, regularly laid out, and presenting
                    a long frontage of handsome white buildings to the river. On the other the
                    ancient town of Buda straggles capriciously over a series of small and steep
                    hills, commanded by the fortress and the Blocksberg, and backed by spurs of the
                    vine-clad mountains beyond. The Danube is crossed by three bridges; the fine
                    suspension bridge constructed by the brothers Clark in 1842-49, at a cost of
                    £440,000; the iron Margarethenbrücke, a little farther up, dating from 1872-76;
                    and a long railway bridge at the lower end of the town.</p>
                <p>Budapest is divided into ten municipal districts, three of which are on the right
                    bank and belong to Buda. The nucleus of the town on the left bank is formed by
                    the inner town or old Pesth on the Danube, in a semicircle round which lie the
                    districts of Leopoldstadt, Theresienstadt, Elisabethstadt, Josephstadt, and
                    Franzstadt, while to the east of these is the outer district of Steinbruch.
                    Perhaps the most attractive part of Pesth is the line of broad quays on the
                    Danube, which extend for a distance of 2 J miles, from the Margarethenbrücke to
                    the customhouse, and are lined with imposing white buildings. The inner town,
                    part of which is somewhat irregularly built, is separated from the other
                    quarters by a ring of spacious boulevards on the site of the old wall, and the
                    lines of demarcation between the different districts also consist of wide
                    tree-shaded streets, mostly paved with asphalt. Most of the larger public
                    buildings are in the Leopoldstadt, which shares in the fine frontage on the
                    Danube, or in the handsome new Radial Strasse, which traverses the
                    Theresienstadt, with a width of 100 to 150 feet. Pesth covers more ground than
                    most towns of a similar population on account of the large number of one-storied
                    houses, which form 70 per cent, of its buildings (as compared with 8 per cent,
                    in Paris, 3 per cent, in Leipsic, <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> tc.).</p>
                <p>Though of ancient origin, Pesth has nothing to show in the shape of venerable
                    buildings; and the modern edifices may perhaps be described as more noticeable
                    for the general air of prosperity they diffuse than for marked individual merit.
                    The oldest ecclesiastical edifice is the parish church, dating from 1500, while
                    the university church and those of the Leopoldstadt and the Franzstadt are the
                    best of the more modern structures. The synagogue, however, is finer in many
                    respects than .any of its Christian rivals. The long range of substantial
                    buildings fronting the Danube <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0723-0692"/> includes the new houses of parliament, the
                    academy, the exchange, the redoute, a large structure in a mixed Romanesque and
                    Moorish style, erected for balls and other social purposes, the Greek church,
                    the parish church, the old town-house, the extensive custom-house at the lower
                    end of the quays, and several fine hotels and insurance offices. In the Radial
                    Strasse are the new opera-house, the academy of music, the exhibition building,
                    and the national drawing-school. The largest building in Pesth is the so-called
                    New Building, in the Leopoldstadt, erected by Joseph II., and covering as much
                    ground as an ordinary London square. It is at present used as artillery
                    barracks; and the Carl’s Barracks in the inner town, also used for housing
                    troops, are little inferior in size. Another large military establishment is the
                    Ludoviceum, or officers’ college, at the south-east end of the town. The
                    remaining buildings remarkable for their size or interest are the new
                    town-house, the post-office, the national museum, the theatres (of which there
                    are about half a dozen), and the palaces of several of the Hungarian magnates.
                    To the south-east of the town lie the new slaughter-houses, which are admirably
                    fitted up, and, with the adjacent cattle-market, cover nearly 30 acres of
                    ground.</p>
                <p>The artistic and scientific culture of Pesth, and indeed of Hungary, finds its
                    most conspicuous outward expression in the academy of sciences and the national
                    museum, two large and handsome modern buildings. The academy, founded for the
                    encouragement of the study of the Hungarian language and the various sciences,
                    possesses a library of 100,000 volumes, and harbours the national picture
                    gallery, a good collection of 700 to 800 works, formed by Prince Eszterházy, and
                    purchased for £130,000. The national museum contains extensive collections of
                    antiquities, natural history, and ethnology, a gallery of mediocre paintings,
                    and a library of 150,000 printed volumes and 12,000 documents. Pesth also
                    possesses numerous societies for the cultivation of science and art, most of
                    which, however, limit their usefulness by publishing their proceedings in the
                    Magyar tongue alone. The university of Pesth, the only one in Hungary proper,
                    was established at Tyrnau in 1635, removed to Buda in 1777, and transferred to
                    Pesth in 1783. It is attended by upwards of 2000 students, and possesses the
                    usual medical and scientific collections, an admirable chemical laboratory, a
                    botanic garden, and a library of 120,000 volumes. Pesth also contains a
                    Protestant theological college and a rabbinical institute. The second place
                    among the educational establishments of the town is taken by the Polytechnic
                    Institute, with its three faculties of applied chemistry, engineering and
                    architecture, and mechanics; it is attended by about 1000 students. The other
                    schools comprise six gymnasia, six normal seminaries, and a large number of
                    special and elementary schools, in spite of which 32 per cent, of the adult
                    population were unable to read or write in 1880. The charitable institutions of
                    the city are on a liberal scale. Characteristic of Budapest is the large number
                    of its public baths, the most interesting of which are at Buda.</p>
                <p>In commerce and industry Budapest is by far the most important town in Hungary,
                    and in the former, if not also in the latter, it is second to λ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> τ</hi> ienna alone in the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy. The
                    chief articles of manufacture are machinery, railway plant, carriages, gold and
                    silver wares, chemicals, cutlery, starch, tobacco, and the usual articles
                    produced in large towns for home consumption. The great staple of trade is
                    grain, of which about 4∣ million bushels are brought into the town annually.
                    One-fourth of this amount merely passes through Pesth, while most of the
                    remainder is ground into flour and exported in this form. Other important
                    articles of commerce are wine, wool, cattle, timber, hides, honey, wax, and
                    “slivovitza,” an inferior spirit made from plums. The imports, so far as they do
                    not belong to the transit trade, consist chiefly of manufactured articles and
                    colonial produce. The four annual fairs, formerly attended by many thousand
                    customers, have now lost much of their importance. The swine market of
                    Steinbruch is the largest in Hungary, about half a million animals being
                    annually disposed of. The trade of Pesth is in great part carried on by the
                    Danube, the navigation of which has increased enormously since the introduction
                    of steamboats in 1830; but the town is also connected by railway with all the
                    chief places of Austria and Hungary.</p>
                <p>The largest and most popular of the public gardens and promenades in Pesth itself
                    is the Stadtwäldchen on the north-east side, with its pleasant lake and trees. A
                    still more delightful resort, however, is the Margaret Island, a long narrow
                    island in the Danube, laid out in the style of an English park, with fine trees,
                    velvety turf, and a group of villas and bath-houses.</p>
                <p>Few European towns have grown so rapidly as Pesth during the present century, and
                    probably none has witnessed such a thorough transformation in the last twenty
                    years. In 1780 Pesth was still a badly-built town of the third rank, with only
                    13,500 inhabitants, and it was not till 1799 that its population (29,000)
                    surpassed that of Buda (24,000). By 1840, however, Buda had added but 14,000
                    souls to its population, while that of Pesth had more than doubled; and of the
                    joint population of 270,000 in 1869 fully 200,000 fell to the share of Pesth. In
                    1880 the population of Budapest was 370,767 souls, including a garrison of
                    10,000 men, showing an increase since 1869 of 32 per cent., and since 1800 of an
                    average of 6 per cent, per annum. Of this total 198,746 were returned as having
                    Hungarian for their mother-tongue, 119,902 as Germans, and 21,581 as Slovaks.
                    Divided according to religious sects, we find 242,981 Roman Catholics, 70,879
                    Jews, 42,254 Protestants, and 3014 members of the Greek Church. Of these the
                    Jews show the greatest relative increase since 1869 (56 per cent.) and the Roman
                    Catholics the least. Of the gross increase of population in Hungary between 1869
                    and 1880 no less than two-thirds are due to Budapest alone, which in the same
                    interval rose from the twenty-third to the fifteenth place among the towns of
                    Europe. About 25 per cent, of the population are supported by trade and
                    industry, 20 per cent, are engaged in service, and 4 per cent, belong to the
                    professional and official classes. Nearly 50 per cent., including women and
                    children, are returned as belonging to the non-working classes, but less than 1
                    per cent, are described as living on their capital or property. In spite of the
                    large proportion of one-storied houses, the ratio of inhabitants to each
                    dwelling-house is somewhat high (33, as compared with 8 in London, 35 in Paris,
                    and 59 in Vienna).</p>
                <p>As Paris is sometimes said to be France, so may Pesth with almost greater truth
                    be said to be Hungary. Its composite population is a faithful reflexion of the
                    heterogeneous elements in the empire of the Hapsburgs, and the trade and
                    industry of Hungary are centralized at Pesth in a way that can scarcely be
                    affirmed of any other European capital. In virtue of its museum and academy it
                    is also the scientific centre of Hungary, and nine-tenths of all books in the
                    Magyar tongue are published here. The average rate per head of imperial taxation
                    is five or six times as great in Pesth as in the rest of Hungary. The recent
                    patriotic movement in favour of Magyarizing all institutions has found its
                    strongest development in Pesth, where the German names have all been removed
                    from the streets and buildings. It is found, too, that the children of German
                    parents born in Pesth easily become Magyarized, while a survey of Hungary at
                    large during the last sixty years shows a relative increase of barely 1 per
                    cent, in the Hungarian as opposed to the German tongue. The inhabitants are
                    good-natured, hospitable, and fond of luxury and display. The upper classes are
                    much addicted to sports of all kinds, and cultivate horse-racing, fox-hunting,
                    and rowing with energy and success. Almost the only popular festival of
                    importance is that of St Stephen on the 20th August, when thousands of people
                    flock to inspect the relics of that saint in the palace-church of Buda.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The origin of Pesth proper is obscure, but the
                    name, apparently derived from the old Slavonic “pestj,” a stove (like Ofen, the
                    German name of Buda), seems to point to an early Slavonic settlement. The Romans
                    never gained a foothold on this side of the river, though Aquincum, on the site
                    of old Buda, is believed, from the extant remains, to have contained about
                    80,000 inhabitants. When it first appears in history Pesth was essentially a
                    German settlement, and a chronicler of the 13th century describes it as “Villa
                    Teutonica ditissima.” Christianity was introduced early in the 11th century. In
                    1241 Pesth was destroyed by the Tatars, after whose departure in 1244 it was
                    created a royal free <pb break="no"

                    various nationalities. The succeeding period seems to have been one of
                    considerable prosperity, though Pesth was completely eclipsed by the sistertown
                    of Buda with its fortress and palace. In 1526 Pesth was taken and pillaged by
                    the Turks, and from 1541 to 1686 Buda was the seat of a Turkish pasha. Pesth in
                    the meantime entirely lost its importance, and on the departure of the Turks was
                    left little more than a heap of ruins. Its favourable situation and the renewal
                    of former privileges helped it to revive, and in 1723 it became the seat of the
                    highest Hungarian officials. Maria Theresa and Joseph II. did much to increase
                    its importance, but the rapid growth which enabled it completely to outstrip
                    Buda belongs entirely to the 19th century. A signal proof of its vitality was
                    given in 1838 by the speed and ease with which it recovered from a disastrous
                    inundation that destroyed 3000 houses. In 1848 Pesth became the seat of the
                    revolutionary diet, but in the following year the insurgents had to retire
                    before the Austrians under Windischgrätz. A little later the Austrians had to
                    retire in their turn, leaving a garrison in the fortress of Buda, and, while the
                    Hungarians endeavoured to capture this position, General Hentzi retaliated by
                    bombarding Pesth, doing great damage to the town. The inhabitants to the number
                    of 80,000 took refuge in the Stadtwäldchen. Between 1867 and 1873 Pesth is said
                    to have doubled in size, and during the last four or five years the building
                    activity has been little if at all inferior.</p>
