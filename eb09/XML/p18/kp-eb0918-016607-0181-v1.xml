                    the 17th to the latter part of the 18th century) two distinct German districts,
                    the Upper or Bavarian Palatinate, and the Lower Palatinate or the Palatinate on
                    the Rhine. The Upper Palatinate, a duchy, belonged to the Nordgau and Bavarian
                    circle, and was bounded by Baireuth, Bohemia, Neuburg, Bavaria, and the
                    territory of Nuremberg. In 1807 (with Cham and Sulzbach) it had 283,800
                    inhabitants. The Lower Palatinate belonged to the electoral Rhenish circle, and
                    was bounded by Mainz, Katzenellenbogen, Wurtemberg, Baden, Alsace, Lorraine, and
                    Treves. It took in the Electoral Palatinate (with a population, in 1786, of
                    305,000), the principality of Simmern, the duchy of Zweibrücken, half of the
                    county of Sponheim, and the principalities of Veldenz and Lautern.</p>
                <p>The palsgraves of the Rhine originally had their seat in Aix-la-Chapelle. In the
                    11th century the country called the Palatinate belonged to them as an hereditary
                    fief, in virtue of which they ranked among the foremost princes of the empire.
                    In 1156, after the death of Palsgrave Hermann III. without heirs, the Palatinate
                    was granted by the emperor Frederick I. to his step-brother Duke Conrad of
                    Swabia. Conrad was succeeded by his son-in-law, Duke Henry of Brunswick, the
                    eldest son of Henry the Lion. In the contest for the crown between Otho IV. and
                    Frederick II., Henry took part with Otho IV., his brother; and in 1215 Frederick
                    II. punished him by putting him to the ban of the empire, and by granting the
                    Palatinate to Louis, duke of Bavaria. Louis was never able to assert his claims
                    with complete success; but his son Otho II. married Agnes, the daughter and
                    heiress of Henry, and thus the Palatinate passed into the hands of the Bavarian
                    family. In 1256 the whole territory of the family was divided between Louis II.
                    and Henry, Otho’s sons,—Louis II. obtaining the Palatinate and Upper Bavaria,
                    and Henry Lower Bavaria. The possessions of Louis II. were inherited in 1294 by
                    his two sons, Rudolph I. and Louis, the Palatinate and the electoral dignity
                    going to the former, while the latter (who ultimately became emperor) received
                    Upper Bavaria, to which Lower Bavaria was afterwards added. The claims of Louis
                    to the imperial crown were contested by Frederick the Fair, duke of Austria;
                    and, as Rudolph I. supported Frederick, his brother deprived him of his lands,
                    which were then held in succession by Rudolph’s three sons, Adolph, who died in
                    1327, Rudolph II., who died in 1353, and Rupert I., who died in 1390. Rudolph
                    II. concluded a treaty with the emperor Louis, whereby the electoral vote was to
                    be delivered alternately by Bavaria and by the Palatinate: <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0918-0182-0167"/> but the emperor Charles IV., in return for a
                    part of the Upper Palatinate, conferred on Rupert I. and his. heirs the
                    exclusive right to the electoral dignity. Rupert I., in 1386, founded the
                    university of Heidelberg. He was succeeded by his nephew, Adolph’s son, Rupert
                    II., whose son and successor, Rupert III., was elected emperor in 1400. After
                    the death of Rupert III. in 1410, his hereditary territories were divided among
                    his four sons, Louis III., John, Stephen (who became palsgrave of Simmern and
                    Zweibrücken), and Otho. The families of John and Otho soon died out, and the
                    last representative of the line of Louis III.—Otho Henry—died in 1559. The lands
                    of Otho Henry and the electoral dignity then passed to Frederick III., of the
                    Simmern line; and Frederick III. marked an important epoch in the history of the
                    electorate by definitely associating himself and his house with the Reformed or
                    Calvinistic Church. His immediate successors were Louis VI., Frederick IV., and
                    Frederick V. The latter, in 1619, rashly accepted the crown of Bohemia; and the
                    result was that, after his expulsion from his new kingdom, the Palatinate was
                    given by the emperor Ferdinand II. to Maximilian, duke of Bavaria. In virtue of
                    the treaty of Westphalia, Charles Louis, Frederick V.’s son, who died in 1680,
                    received back the Lower Palatinate, and in h⅛⅛ favour an eighth electorate was
                    created, with which was associated the office of lord high treasurer
                    (Erzschatzmeisteramt). The house of Bavaria retained the Upper Palatinate, with
                    the office of arch-sewer (Erztruchsessamt), and with the rank which had formerly
                    been held in the electoral college by the counts palatine; but it was arranged
                    that, if the male line of Bavaria died out, the lands and rights which had
                    belonged to the rulers of the whole Palatinate should be restored to their
                    descendants. Charles, Charles Louis’s son, who died in 1685, was the last
                    representative of the Simmern line. The electoral dignity and the lands
                    connected with it then passed to Charles’s kinsman, Philip William, of the
                    Neuburg line, which sprang from Louis the Black, the second son of Stephen, son
                    of Rupert III. Of Louis the Black’s two grandsons, Louis and Rupert, the latter
                    was the ancestor of the Veldenz line, which died out in 1694, while from the
                    former sprang all other palatine lines—the Neuburg line, the Neuzweibrücken
                    line, the Birkenfeld line, the Sulzbach line. Philip William, of the Neuburg
                    line, died in 1690, and was succeeded by his son John William, who in 1694
                    inherited Veldenz, and during the war of the Spanish succession received the
                    Upper Palatinate and all the ancient rights of his house. At the conclusion of
                    the war, however, both rights and lands were restored to the elector of Bavaria.
                    In 1716 John William was succeeded by his brother Charles Philip; and with
                    Charles Philip, who died in 1642, the Neuburg line came to an end, and the Lower
                    Palatinate was inherited by Charles Theodore, of the Sulzbach line. In 1777 the
                    male line of Bavaria became extinct by the death of the elector Maximilian
                    Joseph; and then, in accordance with the treaty of Westphalia, the Upper
                    Palatinate and the Lower Palatinate were reunited, and the palsgrave resumed the
                    office of arch-sewer and the ancient place of his family in the electoral
                    college, while the office of lord high treasurer was transferred to the elector
                    of Brunswick. The successor of Charles Theodore, who died childless in 1799, was
                    Maximilian Joseph, duke of Zweibrücken. By the treaty of Lunéville in 1801 his
                    territories were divided, the part which lay on the left bank of the Rhine being
                    taken by France, while portions on the right bank were given to the grand-duchy
                    of Baden, to Hesse-Darmstadt, to the prince of Leiningen-Dachsburg, and to
                    Nassau. By the treaties of Paris concluded in 1814 and in 1815, the palatine
                    lands on the left bank of the Rhine were restored to Germany, the larger part of
                    them being granted to Bavaria, and the rest to Hesse-Darmstadt and Prussia. The
                    Prussian part of the Palatinate is in the Rhine province; the Hesse-Darmstadt
                    part is included in the province of Starkenburg and Rhine Hesse; the Bavarian
                    part is known as Rhenish Bavaria; and the Baden part is in the Lower Rhine
                    district, which in 1865 was divided into the districts of Mannheim, Heidelberg,
                    and Mosbach.</p>
