                    exaggeration, that no ancient writer except Aristotle has found so many
                    interpreters. But there is perhaps none about whose history and era there has
                    been so much controversy, nor is the controversy yet settled with absolute
                    certainty. He hides himself so completely behind the mask of his fictitious
                    personages that we learn nothing of his fortunes, position, or even of the
                    century to which he belonged, directly from himself. He does not belong to any
                    of the classes of “viri illustres” (poets, orators, historians, philosophers,
                    grammarians, and rhetoricians) whose lives were written by Suetonius. Though he
                    is mentioned by critics, commentators, and grammarians of a late date (such as
                    Macrobius, Servius, and Priscian), the only hint we have of anything bearing on
                    his personal position is contained in two lines of Sidonius Apollinaris, a
                    writer of the latter part of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> who
                    associates him with the masters of Latin eloquence, Cicero, Livy, and Virgil, in
                    the lines—</p>
                <p>“Et te, Massiliensium per hortos Sacri stipitis, Arbiter, colonum Hellespontiaco
                    parem Priapo.”</p>
                <p>If these lines are to be construed as implying that Petronius lived and wrote his
                    work at Marseilles, this inference could hardly be reconciled with the indirect
                    evidence which leads to the identification of the author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Satirae</hi> with the C. Petronius of whom Tacitus has painted so
                    vivid a picture in the sixteenth book of the <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> (ch.
                    18,19). His place of residence in his later years at least was not Marseilles
                    but Rome. There is nothing, however, in what Tacitus says incompatible with the
                    supposition that Marseilles was his birthplace; or perhaps the allusion might be
                    explained by the supposition—supported by a note of Servius on Virgil, <hi
                    rend="italic">Aen.,</hi> iii. 57—that the scene in the early part of the long
                    novel, of which two fragmentary books have been preserved, was laid at
                    Marseilles. The chief personages of the story, as they appear in these fragments
                    of books xv. and xvi., are evidently strangers in the towns of the south of
                    Italy where the adventures in which they share are supposed to take place. Their
                    Greek-sounding names (Encolpius, Ascyltos, Giton, &amp;c.), and their literary
                    training also, accord with the characteristics of the old Greek colony in the
                    1st century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> The high position among Latin writers
                    assigned by Sidonius to Petronius, and the mention of him by Macrobius in
                    juxtaposition with Menander, when compared with the absolute silence of such
                    writers as Quintilian, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0752-0721"/> Juvenal, and Martial, who might have been
                    expected to have taken some notice of him if he had flourished immediately
                    before their own day, seem adverse to the generally received opinion that the
                    <hi rend="italic">Satirae</hi> was a work of the age of Nero. Yet the silence of
                    Quintilian may be explained by the fact that Petronius is not one of those
                    writers who were capable of being turned to use in the education of an orator.
                    The silence of Martial and Juvenal may be accidental. Even if it is to be
                    explained on the ground of want of appreciation, this would prove nothing more
                    than that a work so abnormal in form and substance was more highly prized by
                    later generations than by the author’s contemporaries.</p>
                <p>But, if we pass from these faint traces of external evidence to that afforded by
                    the style of the book and the state of manners described in it, we are led to
                    the inference that there is no other age to which it can be assigned on better
                    grounds than the age of Nero. If, again, we compare the impression we form of
                    the character, genius, and habits of the writer with the elaborate picture which
                    Tacitus paints of a man who, so far as he plays any part in history, is merely
                    one of the victims of an abortive conspiracy, we find grounds of probability for
                    identifying them with one another. Tacitus does not tell us that he was the
                    author of any important work, and this has been urged as conclusive on the
                    question. But Tacitus does not think it necessary in what he tells us of
                    Germanicus or Claudius to mention their poetical and historical works. In
                    introducing Silius Italicus as the witness of a particular occurrence he does
                    not add that he was the author of the poem on the Punic War. He mentions that
                    the poetical gifts and reputation of Lucan and Seneca were among the causes that
                    excited Nero’s jealousy, but he does not mention the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pharsalia</hi> of the one or the <hi rend="italic">Tragedies</hi> of the other.
                    The prominence which Tacitus gives to the portrait of Petronius points to his
                    enjoyment of greater notoriety than was due to the part he played in history. He
                    paints him with the keen and severe eye with which he fastens on the traits of
                    character and the manner of life illustrative of the moral corruption of the
                    time, but at the same time with that appreciation of intellectual power which
                    forces him to do justice to men who in other respects were detestable. Such a
                    work as the <hi rend="italic">Satirae</hi> he could, from a moral point of view,
                    have regarded with no other feelings than those of detestation; yet he could not
                    have refused his admiration to the unmistakable proof it affords of easy
                    careless power, and of a spirit, if not courageous in any good sense, yet
                    indifferent to death, and capable of meeting calamity with Epicurean irony.</p>
                <p>The account he gives of C. Petronius is “that he spent his days in sleep, his
                    nights in attending to his official duties or in amusement, that by his
                    dissolute life he had become as famous as other men by a life of energy, and
                    that he was regarded as no ordinary profligate, but as an accomplished
                    voluptuary. His reckless freedom of speech, being regarded as frankness,
                    procured him popularity. Yet during his provincial government, and later when he
                    held the office of consul, he had shown vigour and capacity for affairs.
                    Afterwards returning to his life of vicious indulgence, he became one of the
                    chosen circle of Nero’s intimates, and was looked upon as an absolute authority
                    on questions of taste (‘arbiter elegantiae’) in connexion with the science of
                    luxurious living.” This excited the jealousy of Tigellinus, and led to his
                    condemnation. Petronius’s death is then described, which was in keeping with his
                    mode of life and character. He selected the slow process of opening his veins
                    and having them bound up again, while in conversing with his friends he avoided
                    the serious subjects natural at such a time, and listened to their recitation of
                    light odes and trifling verses. He then dined luxuriously, slept for some time,
                    and, so far from imitating the practice of others by flattering Nero or
                    Tigellinus in his will, he wrote, sealed, and sent to the emperor a document
                    which professed to give, with the names of the partners of his vices, a detailed
                    account of the scandalous life of the court.</p>
                <p>That this portrait, drawn with such characteristic lines, and painted in such
                    sombre colouring, is sketched from the life in Tacitus’s most graphic manner is
                    unquestionable. A fact confirmatory of its general truth is added by the elder
                    Pliny (who calls him T. Petronius), who mentions that just before his death he
                    destroyed a murrhine vase of great value to prevent its falling into the hands
                    of Nero. The question arises whether there is ground for identifying the author
                    of the fragment which we possess under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Satirae</hi> with the person so minutely and faithfully described by Tacitus.
                    Do the traits of this picture agree with that impression of himself which every
                    writer of marked individuality unconsciously leaves on his work? Further, is
                    there any reason for supposing, as some have maintained, that in this fragment
                    we possess the actual document sent to Nero? The last question may be at once
                    dismissed. The only fragments connected by any kind of continuity which we
                    possess profess to be extracts of the fifteenth and sixteenth books of a work
                    that must have extended to a great length. It would have been impossible to have
                    composed one-tenth part even of this fragment in the time in which Petronius is
                    said to have composed his memorial to Nero. Those who find in the representation
                    of the vulgar, ostentatious, illiterate, but tolerably goodnatured Trimalchio a
                    satire on Nero or Tigellinus are capable of finding any meaning they desire in
                    any literary work of a past age.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The supposition of Μ. Gaston Boissier that the individual
                    satirized is Pallas, the freedman of Claudius, is much more probable.</p></note>
                    But at the same time it is legitimate to note that the author of the banquet of
                    Trimalchio and of the lives of Encolpius and Giton had both the experience and
                    the literary gifts which would enable him to describe with scathing mockery
                    the</p>
                <p>“Luxuriam imperii veterem noctesque Neronis,” and that he was not one to be
                    restrained by any prudery from describing them in their most revolting
                    details.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the arguments against identifying the writer of the fragment
                    with the original of the portrait of Tacitus, based on the silence of the
                    historian as to his authorship, may be explained by reference to the historian’s
                    practice in regard to the authors of other literary works. Unless these works
                    had any bearing on the part which their authors played in history, he did not
                    feel himself called upon to mention them; and such a work as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Satirae</hi> he would have regarded as especially beneath the
                    dignity of history, of which he had so proud a consciousness. The impression of
                    his personality produced by the author corresponds closely with that of the
                    Petronius of the <hi rend="italic">Annals,</hi> not only in the evidence it
                    affords of intimate familiarity with the vices of the age, but in the union of
                    an immoral sensualism with a rich vein of cynical humour and an admirable taste,
                    which we should expect to find in one who rose to favour by his social and
                    convivial qualities, and who received the title of “elegantiae arbiter.” The
                    Epicurean maxims, such as—</p>
                <p>“Vivamus dum licet esse bene,” quoted by his actors, and the frequent
                    introduction of short poems into their conversations, are in conformity with the
                    opinions and tastes of one who in his last hours “audiebat referentes nihil de
                    immortalitate animae et sapientium placitis, sed levia carmina et faciles
                    versus.” Further, the name “Arbiter,” by which he is mentioned in later writers,
                    is not an ordinary Latin cognomen, but may have been bestowed on him by his
                    contemporaries from the fact that his judgment was regarded as the criterion <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n753/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0753-0722"/> of good taste, and Tacitus, in the phrase he
                    perpetuates, may have fixed this as his designation for later writers.</p>
                <p>The style of the work, where it does not purposely reproduce the solecisms,
                    colloquialisms, and slang of the vulgar rich—for the most part freedmen of
                    foreign origin—is recognized by the most competent critics as written in the
                    purest Latin of the Silver Age. Coincidences of expression and thought with
                    passages in the satires of Persius are not infrequent.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">E.g.,</hi> compare Persius,
                    ii. 9, 10—</p><p>“O si</p><p>Ebulliat patruus, praeclarum funus, et O si Sub
                    rastro erepet argenti mihi seria dextro Hercule ’’—</p><p>with <hi rend="italic"
                    >Satirae</hi> 88, “Alius domum promittit, si propinquum divitem extulerit, alius
                    si thesaurum effoderit,” &amp;c. The “ebulliat patruus” may be compared with a
                    phrase in the dinner of Trimalchio, “homo bellus tam bonus chrysanthus animam
                    ebulliit.” Persius has the phrase “Dives arat Curibus quantum non milvus
                    oberrat,” which is a close parallel to Petr., 37, “fundos habet qua milvi
                    volant.” Again, both Persius and Petronius use the rare word “baro,” which
                    occurs only two or three times elsewhere.</p></note> The false taste in
                    literature and expression fostered by the false style of education is condemned
                    by Persius and Petronius on the same grounds. When the latter speaks of the
                    “mellitos verborum globulos” he may possibly have had Seneca in his eye. Again,
                    there would have been no point in putting into the mouth of the old poet whom
                    the adventurers pick up verses on the capture of Troy and the Civil War at any
                    other era than that in which the <hi rend="italic">Troica</hi> of Nero and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Pharsalia</hi> of Lucan were the fashionable poems. The
                    pertinacity of the reciting poet, which is exposed with such quiet humour by
                    Petronius, is a feature of the age, common to it with the age of Martial and
                    Juvenal. But we learn from Tacitus that the luxury of the table, which appears
                    so profuse and extravagant in the “dinner of Trimalchio,” reached its highest
                    pitch under Nero, and afterwards fell out of fashion (Tac., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ann.,</hi> iii. 55).</p>
                <p>The internal evidence based on the style and character of the work thus appears
                    to favour the opinion that the book was written in the time of Nero; nor is
                    there any one more likely to have been its author than the C. Petronius whose
                    manner of life and whose death are so elaborately described by Tacitus.</p>
                <p>The work, of which there have been preserved 141 sections or chapters of a
                    narrative, in the main consecutive, •although interrupted by frequent gaps, must
                    have been one of great originality as regards form, subject-matter, and mode of
                    treatment. The name <hi rend="italic">Satirae,</hi> by which it is designated in
                    the best MSS., indicates that it claims to be of the type of the original
                    “satura” or “miscellany” to which Varro, in imitation of the Greek writer
                    Menippus, had given the character of a medley of prose and verse composition.
                    But, while in the title and form of the work it belonged to a familiar type, yet
                    from another point of view it is to be regarded as the earliest extant specimen
                    of an original and most important invention in Roman literature. We find in it
                    indeed not only a medley of prose and verse composition, in which the former is
                    much the most prominent element, but also much desultory matter, disquisitions
                    on art and eloquence, stories and anecdotes, &amp;c. But the novelty of form
                    recognized in Petronius consists in the string of fictitious narrative by which
                    these are kept together. The original Italian satura, superseded by the Latin
                    comedy, had developed into the poetical satire of Lucilius and Horace, and into
                    the miscellaneous prose and verse essays of Varro. In the hands of Petronius it
                    assumed a new and most important phase in its development. The careless prodigal
                    who gave his days to sleep and his nights to pleasure was so happily inspired in
                    his devices for amusing himself as to introduce into Roman literature, and
                    thereby transmit to modern times, the novel based on the ordinary

                    adventures described there seems no reason why the book should not have gone on
                    to an interminable length.</p>
                <p>The fragment opens with the appearance of the hero, Encolpius, who seems to be an
                    itinerant lecturer travelling with a companion named Ascyltos and a boy Giton,
                    in a portico of a Greek town, apparently in Campania. Encolpius delivers a
                    lecture, full of admirable sense, on the false taste in literature, resulting
                    from the prevailing system of education, which is replied to by a rival
                    declaimer, Agamemno, who shifts the blame from the teachers to the parents. The
                    central personages of the story next go through a series of questionable
                    adventures, in the course of which they are involved in a charge of robbery. A
                    day or two after they are present at a dinner given by a freedman of enormous
                    wealth, Trimalchio, who had risen, as he boasted, “from a penny,” and who
                    entertained with ostentatious and grotesque extravagance a number of men of his
                    own rank, who had not been so prosperous in life. We see actually in flesh and
                    blood specimens of those “Cappadocian knights” to whom we have many pointed
                    references in Martial and Juvenal. We witness their feats of gluttony; we listen
                    to the ordinary talk of their guests about their neighbours, about the weather,
                    about the hard times, about the public games, about the education of their
                    children. We recognize in a fantastic and extravagant form the same kind of
                    vulgarity and pretension which the satirist of all times delights to expose by
                    pen or pencil in the illiterate and ostentatious millionaires of the age. Next
                    day Encolpius separates from his companions in a fit of jealousy, and, after two
                    or three days’ sulking and brooding on his revenge, enters a picture gallery,
                    where he meets with an old poet, who, after talking sensibly on the decay of art
                    and the inferiority of the painters of the age to the old masters, proceeds to
                    recite in a public portico some verses on the capture of Troy, till his audience
                    take to stoning him. The scene is next on board ship, where Encolpius finds he
                    has fallen into the hands of some old enemies. They are shipwrecked, and
                    Encolpius, Giton, and the old poet get to shore in the neighbourhood of Crotona,
                    where, with the view of attracting the attention of the inhabitants, notorious
                    fortune-hunters, the adventurers set up as men of fortune. The fragment ends
                    with a new set of questionable adventures, in which prominent parts are played
                    by a beautiful enchantress named Circe, a priestess of Priapus, and a certain
                    matron who leaves them her heirs, but attaches a condition to the inheritance
                    which even Encolpius might have shrunk from fulfilling.<note anchored="true"

                <p>What, then, may be said to be the purpose of the book, and what is its ethical
                    and literary value? It can hardly be called a satire in the ordinary, and
                    certainly not in the Roman sense of the word. There is no trace of any purpose
                    of exposing vice with any wish to correct it. If we can suppose the author to
                    have been animated by any other motive than the desire to amuse himself, it
                    might be that of convincing himself that the world in general was as bad as he
                    was himself. Juvenal and Swift are justly regarded as among the very greatest of
                    satirists, and their estimate of human nature is perhaps nearly as unfavourable
                    as that of Petronius; but their attitude towards human degradation is not one of
                    complacent amusement but of indignant condemnation. They too, like Petronius,
                    take pleasure in describing things most repugnant to all sense of delicacy with
                    the coarsest realism, but theirs is the realism of disgust, not, like that of
                    Petronius, a realism of sympathy. It might have been thought difficult to sink
                    lower in the cynical tolerance of immorality than Martial occasionally has sunk.
                    But there is all the difference in the world between Martial and Petronius.
                    Martial does not gloat over the vices of which he writes with cynical frankness.
                    He is perfectly aware that they are vices, and that the reproach of them is the
                    worst that can be cast on any one. But further, Martial, with all his faults,
                    is, in his affections, his tastes, his relations to others, essentially human,
                    friendly, generous, true. There is perhaps not a single sentence in Petronius
                    which implies any knowledge of or sympathy with the existence of affection,
                    conscience, or honour, or even the most elementary goodness of heart, or of that
                    amount of mutual confidence which is necessary to keep a band of brigands or a
                    circle of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n754/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0754-0723"/> swindlers together. In estimating such a work,
                    which in its spirit not less than in its form and its literary execution is
                    essentially abnormal, it is necessary to bear in mind that it has reached us in
                    so fragmentary and mutilated a shape that we may altogether have missed the key
                    to it, and that it may have been intended by its author to be a sustained
                    satire, written in a vein of reserved and powerful irony, of the type realized
                    in our modern <hi rend="italic">Jonathan Wild</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Barry
                    Lindon.</hi> But, if this is not the explanation, we must fall back on the more
                    obvious but still difficult solution that, in the entire divorce of intellectual
                    power and insight from any element of right human feeling, the work is an
                    exceptional phenomenon in literature. From an ethical and human point of view it
                    is valuable only as a gauge of the degradation in which much of Roman society
                    was sunk in the age when Persius wrote his satires—a work more pervaded by a
                    spirit of moral purity than any other in Latin literature—and Christianity made
                    its first converts in Rome.</p>
                <p>But, as a work of original power, of humorous representation, of literary
                    invention and art, the fragment deserves all the admiration which it has
                    received. We recognize the “arbiter elegantiae” in the admirable sense of the
                    remarks scattered through it on education, on art, on poetry, and on eloquence.
                    Though a better critic than a poet, yet he can write verse not only with good
                    taste and simplicity, rare among the poets of that age, but with a true feeling
                    of nature, as, for instance, in his description of a grove of plane-trees,
                    cypresses, and pines—</p>
                <p>“Has inter ludebat aquis errantibus amnis Spumeus et querulo vexabat rore
                    lapillos.”</p>
                <p>And in some of his shorter pieces he anticipates the terseness and elegance of
                    Martial. The long fragment on the Civil War does not seem to be written so much
                    with the view of parodying as of entering into rivalry with the poem of Lucan,
                    but he has caught the tone and style of the author whom he censures. In the
                    epigram extemporized by Trimalchio late on in the banquet,</p>
                <p>“Quod non expectes, ex transverso fit— Et supra nos Fortuna negotia curat, Quare
                    da nobis vina Falerna, puer,”</p>
                <p>we have probably a more deliberate parody of the style of verses produced by the
                    illiterate aspirants to be in the fashion of the day. We might conjecture that
                    the chief gift to which Petronius owed his social and his literary success was
                    that of humorous mimicry, in which the most intellectual and at the same time
                    sensual among the Romans—as, for instance, Sulla—took a great delight. The man
                    who could describe the dinner of Trimalchio and mimic the talk and peculiarities
                    of the various guests with such humorous zest was just the man to keep the table
                    in a roar during the prolonged revels in the palace of Nero. If the old “vexata
                    quaestio” of the distinction between wit and humour were to be revived, the
                    critic who could determine by analysis what is the essence of the talent of
                    Martial on the one hand and of Petronius on the other would go very near to
                    solving it. He would have, however, to abandon the theory that humour is more
                    essentially humane and sympathetic than wit. Petronius is perhaps the most
                    strictly humorous among Latin writers, and humour is in him combined with the
                    rarer gift of conceiving and representing character. In Trimalchio and his
                    various guests, in the old poet, in the cultivated, depraved, and moody
                    Encolpius, in the Chrysis, Quartilia, Polyaenis, &amp;c., we recognize in living
                    examples the play of those various appetites, passions, and tendencies which
                    satirists deal with as abstract qualities. Another gift he possesses in a high
                    degree, which must have availed him in society as well as in literature,— the
                    gift of story-telling; and some of the stories which first appear in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Satirae—e.g.,</hi> that of the Matron of Ephesus—have enjoyed a
                    great reputation in later times. His style, too, is that of one who must have
                    been an excellent talker, who could talk sense when sense was wanted, who could
                    have discussed questions of taste and literature with the most cultivated men of
                    any time as well as amused the most dissolute society of any time in their most
                    reckless revels. One phrase of his is often quoted by many who have never come
                    upon it in its original context, “Horatii curiosa felicitas.”</p>
                <p>Perhaps next after a day spent in the ruins of Pompeii nothing else makes us feel
                    so near the actual daily life of the Roman world in all its petty details in the
                    1st century A.n. as this fragment of Petronius. Another obvious observation that
                    is suggested by it is that of the superiority of the novel over any other form
                    of literature for the purpose of literally reproducing the commonplace
                    experience of actual life in every age. Opinions may differ as to the value or
                    interest of the literal reproduction of the customs and manners of such an age
                    as that of Nero.</p>
                <p>Compared with tlιe amount of attention which was given to Petronius both by
                    scholars and men of letters in the 17tħ and 18th centuries, comparatively little
                    has been done for him in recent times. The only good critical edition of the
                    fragments is that of Buehler. An interesting chapter is devoted to him in Μ.

                    modern translation, the French version by Μ. H. De Guerle is the one to be
