                    capital of the Chinese empire, is situated in 39° 54' 36" N. lat. and 116° 27'
                    E. long., and stands on the northern extremity of the great alluvial delta which
                    extends southwards from its walls for 700 miles. For the last nine centuries
                    Peking, under various names and under the dominion of successive dynasties, has,
                    with some short intervals, remained an imperial city. Its situation near the
                    northern frontier recommended it to the Tatar invaders as a convenient centre
                    for their power, and its peculiarly fortunate position as regards the
                    supernatural terrestrial influences pertaining to it has inclined succeeding
                    Chinese monarchs to accept it as the seat of their courts. In 986 it was taken
                    by an invading force of Khitan Tatars, who adopted it as their headquarters and
                    named it Nanking, or the “southern capital.” During the early part of the 12th
                    century the Chinese recaptured it and reduced it from the rank of a metropolis
                    to that of a provincial city of the first grade, and called it Yen-shan Foo. In
                    1151 it fell into the hands of the Kin Tatars, who made it a royal residence
                    under the name of Chung-tu, or “central capital.” Less than a century later it
                    became the prize of Jenghiz Khan, who, having his main interests centred on the
                    Mongolian steppes, declined to move his court southwards. To his great successor
                    Kublai Khan (1280-1294), however, the establishment of a capital within the
                    frontiers of China became a necessity, and, following the example set him by
                    preceding sovereigns, he made choice of Yenking, as he .rechristened the city.
                    With his usual magnificence, he rebuilt the town, which became known in Chinese
                    as Ta-tu, or “great capital,” and in Mongolian as Khanbalik, or “city of the
                    khan.” During the reign of the first emperor of the dynasty (1368-1399) which
                    succeeded that founded by Jenghiz Khan the court resided at the modern Nanking,
                    but in the eyes of the succeeding sovereign Yung-lo (1403-1425) the political
                    advantages of a northern residence appeared so obvious that he transferred his
                    court to Peking <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the northern capital), which has
                    ever since been the seat of government.</p>
                <p>During the periods above mentioned the extent and boundaries of the city varied
                    considerably. Under the Kin dynasty the walls extended to the south-west of the
                    Tatar portion of the present city, and the foundations of the northern ramparts
                    of the Khan-balik of Kublai Khan are still to be traced at a distance of about 2
                    miles in a northerly direction beyond the existing walls. The modern city
                    consists of two parts, the <hi rend="italic">nui</hi><hi rend="italic">ch</hi> ’
                    <hi rend="italic">ing,</hi> or inner city, commonly known to foreigners as the
                    “Tatar city,” and the <hi rend="italic">ιvai ch</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic"
                    >ing,</hi> or outer city, known in the same way as the “Chinese city.” These
                    names are somewhat misleading, as the inner city is not enclosed within the
                    outer city, but adjoins its northern wall, which, being longer than the <hi
                    rend="italic">nui ch'ing</hi> is wide, outflanks it considerably at both ends,
                    as may be seen in the accompanying plan. The outer walls of the double city
                    contain an area of about 25 square miles, and measure 30 miles in circumference.
                    Unlike the walls of most Chinese cities, those of Peking are kept in perfect
                    order. Those of the Tatar portion, which is the oldest part of the city, are 50
                    feet high, with a width of 60 feet at the base and 40 feet at the top, while
                    those of the Chinese city, which were built by the emperor Kea-tsing in 1543,
                    measure 30 feet in height, and have a width of 25 feet at the base and 15 feet
                    at the top. The terre-plein is well and smoothly paved, and is defended by a
                    crenellated parapet. The outer faces of the walls are strengthened by square
                    buttresses built out at intervals of 60 yards, and on the summits of these stand
                    the guard-houses for the troops on duty. Each of the sixteen gates of the city
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n491/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0491-0470"/> is protected by a semicircular enceinte, and is
                    surmounted with a high tower built in galleries and provided with countless
                    loopholes.</p>
                <p>The population of Peking is reckoned to be about 1,000,000, a number which is out
                    of all proportion to the immense area enclosed within its walls. This disparity
                    is partly accounted for by the facts that large spaces, notably in the Chinese
                    city, are not built over, and that the grounds surrounding the imperial palace,
                    private residences, and temples are very extensive. Viewed from the walls Peking
                    looks like a city of gardens. Few crowded neighbourhoods are visible, and the
                    characteristic features of the scene which meets the eye are the upturned roofs
                    of temples, palaces, and mansions, gay with blue, green, and yellow glazed
                    tiles, glittering among the groves of trees with which the city abounds.
                    Enclosed within the Tatar city is the <hi rend="italic">Hwang citing,</hi> or
                    “Imperial city,” which in its turn encloses the <hi rend="italic">Tsze-kin
                    ch</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">ing,</hi> or “Purple Forbidden city,” in λvhich
                    stands the emperor’s palace. On the north of the Tsze-kin ch’ing, and separated
                    from it by a moat, is an artificial mound known as the <hi rend="italic">King
                    skan,</hi> or “Prospect Hill.” This mound, which forms a prominent object in the
                    view over the city, is about 150 feet high, and is topped with five summits, on
                    each of which stands a temple. It is encircled by a wall measuring upwards of a
                    mile in circumference, and is prettily planted with trees, on one of which the
                    last emperor of the Ming dynasty (1644), finding escape from the Manchu invaders
                    impossible, hanged himself. On the west of Prospect Hill is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Se yuen, or</hi> “Western Park,” which forms part of the palace
                    grounds. This park is tastefully laid out, and is traversed by a lake, which is
                    mainly noticeable from the remarkably handsome marble bridge which crosses it
                    from east to west. Directly northwards from Prospect Hill stand the residence of
                    the Titu, or “governor of the city,” and the Bell and the Drum Towers, both of
                    which have attained celebrity from the nature of their contents,—the first from
                    the huge bell which hangs in it, and the second from the appliances it contains
                    for marking the time. The bell is one of five which the emperor Yung-lo ordered
                    to be cast. In common with the others, it weighs 120,000 Ib, is 14 feet high, 34
                    feet in circumference at the rim, and is 9 inches thick. It is struck by a
                    wooden beam swung on the outside, and only at the changes of the nightwatches,
                    when its deep tone may be heard in all parts of the city. In the Drum Tower
                    incense-sticks, specially prepared by the Astronomical Board, are kept burning
                    to mark the passage of time, in which important duty their accuracy is checked
                    by a clepsydra. Another of Yung-lo’s bells is hung in a Buddhist temple outside
                    the north-west angle of the city wall, and is covered both on the inside and
                    outside with the Chinese texts of the <hi rend="italic">Lankavatara Sutra,</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Saddharma pundarikα Sutra.</hi></p>
                <p>Turning southwards we again come to the Purple Forbidden city, the central
                    portion of which forms the imperial palace, where, in halls which for the
                    magnificence of their proportions and barbaric splendour are probably not to be
                    surpassed anywhere, the Son of Heaven holds his court, gives audience to
                    ambassadors from tributary states, and receives the congratulations of his
                    ministers at the annual seasons of rejoicing. In the eastern and western
                    portions of this city are situated the residences of the highest dignitaries of
                    the empire; while beyond its confines on the south stand the offices of the six
                    official boards which direct the affairs of the eighteen provinces. It was in
                    the “yarnun” of one of these boards—the <hi rend="italic">Le Pu</hi> or board of
                    rites—that Lord Elgin signed the treaty at the conclusion of the war in 1860,—an
                    event which derives especial interest from the fact of its having been the first
                    occasion on which a European plenipotentiary ever entered Peking accompanied by
                    all the pomp and circumstance of his rank.</p>
                <p>Outside the Purple Forbidden city the most noteworthy building is the Temple of
                    Heaven, which stands in the outer or Chinese city. Here at early morn on the 2
                    2d of December the emperor offers sacrifice on an open altar to Shang-ti, and at
                    periods of drought or famine presents prayers for relief to the same supreme
                    deity. The altar at which these solemn rites are performed “consists of a triple
                    circular marble terrace, 210 feet wide at the base, 150 in the middle, and 90 at
                    the top.” The uppermost surface is paved with blocks of the same material
                    forming nine concentric circles, the innermost consisting of nine blocks, and
                    that on the outside of eighty-one blocks. On the central stone, which is a
                    perfect circle, the emperor kneels, “surrounded first by the circles of the
                    terraces and their enclosing walls, and then by the circle of the horizon.” In
                    the same temple stands the altar of prayer for good harvests, which is
                    surmounted by a triple-roofed circular structure 99 feet in height. The tiles of
                    these roofs are of glazed porcelain of the most exquisite deepblue colour, and
                    add a conspicuous element of splendour to the shrine, which even without their
                    aid would inspire admiration by the grace of the design and the rare beauty of
                    the materials employed in its construction.</p>
                <p>The other powers of nature have shrines dedicated to them at the altar to Earth
                    on the north of the city, the altars to the Sun and Moon outside the
                    north-eastern and north-western angles respectively of the Chinese city, and the
                    altar of Agriculture inside the south gate of the Chinese city. Next to these in
                    religious importance comes the Confucian temple, known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kwo-tsze-keen.</hi> Here there is no splendour; everything is quite plain; and
                    one hall contains all that is sacred in the building. There the tablets of “the
                    soul of the most holy ancestral teacher, Confucius,” and of his ten principal
                    disciples stand as objects of worship for their countless followers. In one
                    courtyard of this temple are deposited the celebrated ten stone drums which bear
                    poetical inscriptions commemorative of the hunting expeditions of King Suen
                    (827-781 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), in whose reign they are believed,
                    though erroneously, to have been cut; and in another stands a series of stone
                    tablets on which are inscribed the names of all those who have obtained the
                    highest literary degree of <hi rend="italic">Tsin-sze</hi> for the last five
                    centuries.</p>
                <p>In the south-eastern portion of the Tatar city is the observatory, which was
                    built by order of Kublai Khan in 1296. During the period of the Jesuit
                    ascendency in the reign of K’ang-he (1661-1721), the superintendence of this
                    institution was confided to Roman Catholic missionaries, under whose guidance
                    the bronze instruments now existing were constructed. Unlike the thoroughfares
                    in the cities of central and southern China, the streets of Peking are wide and
                    open, but, being unpaved and the soil being light and alluvial, they easily
                    become almost impassable from mud in wet weather and ankle-deep in dust in dry
                    weather. The inhabitants of Peking being consumers only, and in no way
                    producers, the trade of the city is very small, and the article of the European
                    treaties which prohibits foreign merchants from trading within the walls is,
                    therefore, to be regretted only as an instance of the narrow-mindedness of the
                    Chinese Government.</p>
