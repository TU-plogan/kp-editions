                    first used by physicists to describe the property possessed by many substances

                    certain animals were observed to be similarly endowed, the word “phosphorescent”
                    was applied to them also. It is clear, however, that the light derived from
                    previous exposure to light, which thus becomes, as it were, stored up, is hardly
                    comparable with that which is produced by living protoplasm and evidently under
                    the control of the nervous system. It has been suggested that this latter should
                    have a special name appropriated to it, and here it will certainly be convenient
                    to divide the subject into two heads in accordance with this distinction.</p>

                    phosphorescence after insolation already alluded to (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Light,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 603) many minerals exhibit this property under other
                    circumstances: (a) on heating to a temperature much below what is known as “red
                    heat” (fluorspar, lepidolite, quinine)—this being often attended with a change
                    in molecular structure or in specific heat; (6) on friction, as in the case of
                    fused calcium chloride (Homberg’s phosphorus); <hi rend="italic">(c)</hi> on
                    cleavage, a property manifested by mica, the two split portions becoming
                    electrified— the one positive, the other negative; (√) on crystallization, as
                    boracic acid after fusion, or water on rapid freezing.<note anchored="true"

                <p>A few meteorological phenomena may here be mentioned. Rain has been seen to
                    sparkle on striking the ground, and waterspouts and meteoric dust have presented

                    much difference of opinion: Kirby and Spence suggest that it may be due to
                    luminous insects; but this explanation will certainly not apply in all cases,
                    and it is perhaps on the whole more reasonable to believe that the phenomenon is
                    caused by the slow combustion of marsh gas (methyl hydride).</p>

                    others the radial canals and ovaries, that are luminous. In other groups of

                    Italian fire-fly, in which both male and female are luminous. As in the
                    glow-worm, the organ consists of two layers: the dorsal contains large
                    quantities of uric acid salts; while in the ventral layer there are clear cells
                    arranged in cylindrical lobules, which surround vertically-disposed tracheal
                    limbs—a structure comparable to the stellate tracheal cells of Schultze. The
                    luminous organs are regarded as homologous to the “fat body” so common in
                    insects. The ultimate branches of the tracheae ramify in these and terminate in
                    peculiar star-like cells; nervefibres are also present. The Mexican fire-flies
                    <hi rend="italic">{Pyrophorus)</hi> are in most respects similar to the

                    the extremity of a long curved proboscis. Many crustaceans are luminous, but in
                    most cases it has not been observed from what part of the body the light
                    emanates; in some instances, however (<hi rend="italic">Tlιysanopoda</hi><hi

                    constitute a highly complicated luminous -apparatus, the lenticular body of the
                    organs, generally described as a true eye-lens, acting as a condenser, which . .
                    . enables the animal to produce at will a very bright flash of light in a given
                    direction.” Mr John Murray in the same place records the occurrence of a very
                    brilliant display of this phosphorescence during the “Triton” expedition in the

                    the property has been manifested by molluscs and other animals, and even by the
                    human body. Furthermore, a few startling but apparently well-authenticated
                    instances are on record in which human beings have been luminous while yet alive
                    owing to certain states of disease.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    rend="italic">Causes of Phosphorescence.—</hi> On this head it is at present
                    impossible to write with certainty; it seems likely, however, from the variety
                    of the effects produced by different chemical and physical agents, that the
                    causes are manifold. In many instances light is only emitted after stimulation,
                    either mechanically, chemically (by fresh water, milk, ammonia), or by
                    electricity, though there are cases in which this last has no effect whatever.
                    The fact that the nervous system is so often closely connected with the luminous
                    organs indicates that the exhibition of the light is either dependent on the
                    volition of the animal or is the reflex result of the stimulation of sensory
                    nerves (Panceri). In the glow-worm the distribution of tracheae (air-tubes)
                    throughout the photogenic apparatus, and the fact that carbonic acid
                    extinguishes the light while oxygen intensifies it, suggest that it is due to
                    some form of slow combustion, while the fatty contents of the luminous cells of
                    this and many other animals point to the probability that a fat containing free
                    phosphorus is the active agent in the process. Since a large number of luminous
                    organs retain their power after the death of the animal, and even after
                    desiccation and subsequent moistening, there seems no necessity to adopt the
                    theory that we have to deal with an instance of the direct transformation of
                    vital into radiant energy.</p>

                    state that fishes avoid nets in which phosphorescent <hi rend="italic"
                    >Medusae</hi> have become entangled; if such be the case, it would be possible
                    for animals otherwise defenceless to obtain protection by acquiring this
                    property.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Verrill, in

                    hypothesis has been propounded with respect to the Italian fire-fly,<note

                    has been generally believed that the light serves to attract the opposite sex,
                    and the same has been stated with respect to the earth-worm. The fact that so
                    many deep-sea animals are phosphorescent, coupled with the discovery that many
                    fish from those regions have large and normally-developed eyes whilst others
                    have organs which appear to be adapted for the production of light, has led to
                    the belief that this source of light becomes of great importance in the depths
                    of the ocean where no sunlight penetrates,—an hypothesis which is known as the
                    “abyssal theory of light.” (W. E. HO.) <pb break="no"
