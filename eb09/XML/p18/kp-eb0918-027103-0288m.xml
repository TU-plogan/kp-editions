                    discretion, as a means of adjusting the different degrees of moral guilt in
                    crimes or of rectifying a miscarriage of justice. By the law of England pardon
                    is the sole prerogative of the king, and it is declared by 27 Hen. VIII. c. 24
                    that no other person has power to pardon or remit any treasons or felonies
                    whatsoever. This position follows logically from the theory of English law that
                    all offences are breaches of the king’s peace. Indictments still conclude with a
                    statement that the offence was committed “against the peace of our lady the
                    queen, her crown and dignity.” The crown by pardon only remits the penalty for
                    an attack upon itself. The prerogative is in modern times exercised by
                    delegation, the crown acting upon the representation of the secretary of state
                    for the home department in Great Britain, of the lord lieutenant in Ireland. The
                    prerogative of the crown is subject to some restrictions. (1) The committing of
                    a <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n289/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0289-0272"/> subject of the realm to a prison out of the realm
                    is by the Habeas Corpus Act a <hi rend="italic">prxmunire,</hi> unpardonable
                    even by the king (31 Car. II. c. 2, § 12). (2) The king cannot pardon an offence
                    in a matter of private rather than of public wrong, so as to prejudice the
                    person injured by the offence. Thus a common nuisance cannot be pardoned while
                    it remains unredressed, or so as to prevent an abatement of it. fine or penalty
                    imposed for the offence may, however, be remitted. By 22 Vict. c. 32 Her Majesty
                    is enabled to remit wholly or in part any sum of money imposed upon conviction,
                    and, if the offender has been imprisoned in default of payment, to extend to him
                    the royal mercy. There are other statutes dealing with special offences, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.&lt;∕.,</hi> by 38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. 80 Her Majesty may remit
                    any penalty imposed under 21 Geo. III. c. 49 (an Act for preventing certain
                    abuses and profanations on the Lord’s Day called Sunday). (3) The king’s pardon
                    cannot be pleaded in bar of an impeachment. This principle, first asserted by a
                    resolution of the House of Commons in the earl of Danby’s case, 5th May 1679,
                    forms one of the provisions of the Act of Settlement, 12 à 13 Will. III. c. 2.
                    It is there enacted “that no pardon under the great seal of England shall be
                    pleadable to an impeachment by the Commons in parliament,” § 3. This provision
                    does notextend to abridging the prerogative after the impeachment has been heard
                    and determined. Thus three of the rebel lords were pardoned after impeachment
                    and attainder in 1715. (4) In the case of treason, murder, or rape, a pardon is
                    ineffectual unless the offence be particularly specified therein (13 Rich. II.
                    c. 1, § 2). Before the Bill of Rights, 1 Will. &amp; Μ. c. 2, § 2, this statute
                    seems to have been frequently evaded by a <hi rend="italic">non, obstante</hi>
                    clause. But, since by the Bill of Rights no dispensation by <hi rend="italic"
                    >non obstante</hi> is allowed, general words contrary to the statute of Richard
                    II. would seem to be ineffectual.</p>
                <p>Pardon may be actual or constructive. Actual pardon is by warrant under'the great
                    seal, or under the sign-manual countersigned by a secretary of state (7 &amp; 8
                    Geo. IV. c. 28, § 13). Constructive pardon is obtained by endurance of the
                    punishment. By 9 Geo. IV. c. 32, §3, the endurance of a punishment on conviction
                    of a felony not capital has the same effect as a pardon under the great seal.
                    This principle is reaffirmed in the Larceny Act, 1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. 96,
                    § 109), and in the Malicious Injuries to Property Act, 1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vict.
                    c. 97, § 67). Further, pardon may be free or conditional. A conditional pardon
                    most commonly occurs where an offender sentenced to death has his sentence
                    commuted to penal servitude or any less punishment. The condition of his pardon
                    is the endurance by him of the substituted punishment. The effect of pardon,
                    whether actual or constructive, is to put the person pardoned in the position of
                    an innocent man, so that he may have an action against any one thenceforth
                    calling him traitor or felon. He cannot refuse to give evidence respecting the
                    offence pardoned on the ground that his answer would tend to criminate him. A
                    pardon may be pleaded on arraignment in bar of an indictment (though not of an
                    impeachment), or after verdict in arrest of judgment. No doubt it would
                    generally be advantageous to plead it as early as possible.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that, though the crown is invested with the right to pardon, this
                    does not prevent pardon being granted by the higher authority of an Act of
                    Parliament. Acts of Indemnity have frequently been passed, the effect of which
                    is the same as pardon or remission by the crown. Recent examples of Acts of
                    Indemnity are two private Acts passed in 1880 to relieve Lords Byron and Plunkct
                    from the disabilities and penalties to which they were liable for sitting and
                    voting in the House of Peers without taking the oath.</p>
                <p>Civil rights are not divested by pardon. The person injured may have a right of
                    action against the offender in spite of the pardon of the latter, if the right
                    of action has once vested, for the crown cannot affect private rights. In
                    Scotland this civil right is specially preserved by various statutes. Thus 1593,
                    c. 174, provides that, if any respite or remission happen to be granted before
                    the party grieved be first satisfied, the same is to be mill and of none avail.
                    The assythment, or indemnification due to the heirs of the ]&gt;erson murdered
                    from the murderer, is due if the murderer have received pardon, though not if he
                    have suffered the penalty of the law. The pardon transmitted by the secretary of
                    state is applied by the supreme court, who grant the necessary orders to the
                    magistrates in whose custody the convict is.</p>
                <p>In the United States the power of pardon vested in the president is without any
                    limitation, except in the case of impeachments (U. S. Constitution, art. ii. §
                    2). The power of pardon is also vested in the executive authority of the di
                    flerent States, with or without the concurrence of the legislative authority.
                    Thus by the New York Code of Criminal Procedure, 1881, §§692, 693, the governor
                    of the State of New York has power to grant reprieves, commutations, and
                    pardons, except in the case of treason, where he can only suspend the execution
                    of the sentence until the case can be reported to the legislature, with whom the
                    power of pardon in this case rests. The usual form of pardon in the United
                    States is by deed under seal of the executive.</p>
