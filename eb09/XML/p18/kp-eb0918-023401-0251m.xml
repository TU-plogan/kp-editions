                    she relinquished upon her marriage. Paracelsus’s name was Theophrastus Bombast
                    von Hohenheim; for the names Philippus and Aureolus good authority is wanting,
                    and the epithet Paracelsus, like some similar compounds, was probably one of his
                    own making, and was meant to denote his superiority to Celsus. In 1502-3 his
                    father, taking his family with him, removed to Villach in Carinthia; and he
                    resided there in the practice of the medical art till his death in 1534. In one
                    of his works, dedicated to the magistracy of the town, Paracelsus refers to the
                    esteem in which his father was held, and expresses his own gratitude for it.</p>
                <p>Of the early years of Paracelsus’s life there is hardly anything known. His
                    father was his first teacher, and took pains to instruct him in all the learning
                    of the time, especially in medicine. Doubtless Paracelsus learned rapidly what
                    was put before him, but he seems at a comparatively early age to have questioned
                    the value of what he was expected to acquire, and to have soon struck out ways
                    for himself. As he grew older he was taken in hand by several distinguished
                    churchmen, although it has been objected that dates will not warrant the idea of
                    actual personal instruction. This, however, is not correct, for all the men
                    Paracelsus mentions were alive in his lifetime, though he was so young that he
                    could hardly have profited by their lessons, unless on the supposition that he
                    was a quick and precocious boy, which it is very likely he was. At the age of
                    sixteen he entered the university of Basel, but probably soon abandoned the
                    studies therein pursued. He next went to Trithemius, the bishop of Sponheim and
                    Würzburg, under whom he prosecuted chemical researches. Trithemius is the
                    reputed author of some obscure tracts on the great elixir, and as there was no
                    other chemistry going Paracelsus would have to devote himself to the reiterated
                    operations so characteristic of the notions of that time. But the confection of
                    the stone of the philosophers was too remote a possibility to gratify the fiery
                    spirit of a youth like Paracelsus, eager to make what he knew, or could learn,
                    at once available for practical medicine. So he left school chemistry as he had
                    forsaken university culture, and started for the mines in Tyrol owned by the
                    wealthy family of the Fuggers. The sort of knowledge he got there pleased him
                    much more. There at least he was in contact with reality. The struggle with
                    nature before the precious metals could be made of use impressed upon him more
                    and more the importance of actual personal observation. He saw all the
                    mechanical difficulties that had to be overcome in mining; he learned the nature
                    and succession of rocks, the physical properties of minerals, ores, and metals;
                    he got a notion of mineral waters; he was an eye witness of the accidents which
                    befel the miners, and studied the diseases which attacked them; he had proof
                    that positive knowledge of nature was not to be got in schools and universities,
                    but only by going to Nature herself, and to those who were constantly engaged
                    with her. Hence came Paracelsus’s peculiar mode of study. He attached no value
                    to mere scholarship; scholastic disputations he utterly ignored and despised,—
                    and especially the discussions on medical topics, which turned more upon
                    theories and definitions than upon actual practice. He therefore went wandering
                    over a great part of Europe to learn all that he could. In so doing he was one
                    of the first physicians of modern times to profit by a mode of study which is
                    now reckoned indispensable. In the 16th century the difficulty of moving about
                    was much greater than it is now; still Paracelsus faced it, and on principle.
                    The book of nature, he affirmed, is that which the physician must read, and to
                    do so he must walk over the leaves. The humours and passions and diseases of
                    different nations are different, and the physician must go among the nations if
                    he will be master of his art; the more he knows of other nations, the better he
                    will understand his own. For the physician it is ten times more necessary and
                    useful to know the powers of the heavens and the earth, the virtues of plants
                    and minerals, than to spend his time on Greek and Latin grammar. And the
                    commentary of his own and succeeding centuries upon these very extreme views is
                    that Paracelsus was no scholar, but an ignorant vagabond. He himself, however,
                    valued his method and his knowledge very differently, and argued that he knew
                    what his predecessors were ignorant of, because he had been taught in no human
                    school. “Whence have I all my secrets, out of what writers and authors? Ask
                    rather how the beasts have learned their arts. If nature can instruct irrational
                    animals, can it not much more men <hi rend="italic">1”</hi> In this new school
                    discovered by Paracelsus, and since attended with the happiest results by many
                    others, he remained for about ten years. He had acquired great stores of facts,
                    which it was impossible for him to have reduced to order, but which gave him an
                    unquestionable superiority to his contemporaries. So in 1526 or 1527, on his
                    return to Basel, he was appointed town physician, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n252/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0252-0235"/> and shortly afterwards he gave a course of
                    lectures on medicine in the university. Unfortunately for him, the lectures
                    broke away from tradition. They were in German, not in Latin; they were
                    expositions of his own experience, of his own views, of his own methods of
                    curing, adapted to the diseases that afflicted the Germans in the year 1527, and
                    they were not commentaries on the text of Galen or Avicenna. Unfortunately they
                    attacked, not only these great authorities, but the German graduates who
                    followed them and disputed about them in 1527. They criticized in no measured
                    terms the current medicine of the time, and exposed the practical ignorance, the
                    pomposity, and the greed of those who practised it.</p>
                <p>The truth of Paracelsus’s doctrines was apparently confirmed by his success in
                    curing or mitigating diseases for which the regular physicians could do nothing.
                    For about a couple of years his reputation and practice increased to a
                    surprising extent. But at the end of that time people bega <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> n to recover themselves. Paracelsus had burst upon
                    the schools with such novel views and methods, with such irresistible criticism,
                    that all opposition was at first crushed flat. Gradually the sea began to rise.
                    His enemies watched for slips and failures; the physicians maintained that he
                    had no degree, and insisted that he should give proof of his qualifications. His
                    manner of Jife was brought up against him. It was insinuated that he was a
                    profane person, that he was a conjurer, a necromancer, that, in fact, he was to
                    be got rid of at any cost as a troubler of the peace and of the time-honoured
                    traditions of the medical corporations. Moreover, he had a pharmaceutical system
                    of his own which did not harmonize with the commercial arrangements of the
                    apothecaries, and he not only did not use up their drugs like the Galenists,
                    but, in the exercise of his functions as town physician, urged the authorities
                    to keep a sharp eye on the purity of their wares, upon their knowledge of their
                    art, and upon their transactions with their friends the physicians. The growing
                    jealousy and enmity culminated in the Lichtenfels dispute; and, as the judges
                    sided with the canon, to their everlasting discredit, Paracelsus had no
                    alternative but to tell them his opinion of the whole case and of their notions
                    of justice. So little doubt left he on the subject that his friends judged it
                    prudent for him to leave Basel at once, as it had been resolved to punish him
                    for the attack on the authorities of which he had been guilty. He departed from
                    Basel in such haste that he carried nothing with him, and some chemical
                    apparatus and other property were taken charge of by Oporinus, his pupil and
                    amanuensis. He went first to Esslingen, where he remained for a brief period,
                    but had soon to leave from absolute want. Then began his wandering life, the
                    course of which can be traced by the dates of his various writings. He thus
                    visited in succession Colmar, N uremberg, Appenzell, Zurich, Pfäffers, Augsburg,
                    Villach, Meran, Middelheim, and other places, seldom staying a twelvemonth in
                    any of them. In this way he spent some dozen years, till 1541, when he was
                    invited by Archbishop Ernst to settle at Salzburg, under his protection. After
                    his endless tossing about, this seemed a promise and place of repose. It proved,
                    however, to be the complete and final rest that he found, for after a few months
                    he died on the 24th of September. The cause of his death, like most other
                    details in his history, is uncertain. His enemies asserted that he died in a low
                    tavern in consequence of a drunken debauch of some days’ duration. Others
                    maintain that he was thrown down a steep place by some emissaries either of the
                    physicians or of the apothecaries, both of whom he had during his life most
                    grievously harassed. In proof of this surgeons have pointed out in Paracelsus’s
                    skull a flaw or fracture, which could have been produced only during life.
                    Authorities, however, are not agreed on this point, and it may be simplest to
                    suspend belief until more evidence is got. He was buried in the churchyard of St
                    Sebastian, but in 1752 his bones were removed to the porch of the church, and a
                    monument of reddish-white marble was erected to his memory.</p>
                <p>In making the attempt to ascertain what was Paracelsus’s character, and what were
                    his philosophical and medical opinions, a very considerable difficulty presents
                    itself at the outset. Of the voluminous writings which pass under his name, what
                    are really his work, and what, if not actually composed by him, express his
                    ideas? To this question no complete critical reply has as yet been given, though
                    many opinions have been expressed. Dr Marx, for example, will admit only ten
                    treatises as genuine. Dr Haeser allows seventeen for certain, a considerable
                    number—some twenty-four—as doubtful, and the rest—he enumerates eleven—as
                    spurious. Dr Mook does not accept these estimates, or the criteria by which the
                    genuineness of a treatise is ascertained. But neither does he give altogether
                    convincing criteria of his own, and, what is still less satisfactory, he does
                    not apply them—such as they are—to decide the numerous doubtful cases. The only
                    thin» Mook has done is to draw up a list of the different editions of
                    Paracelsus’s so-called works. This list is not complete in the enumeration of
                    editions, and it is quite imperfect in bibliographical description, but with
                    these and other serious defects it is the fullest at present extant. The first
                    book by Paracelsus was printed at Augsburg in 1529. It is entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Practica</hi><hi rend="italic">D.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Theophrasti</hi><hi rend="italic">Paracelsi,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >gemacht</hi><hi rend="italic">auff Europen,</hi> and forms a small quarto
                    pamphlet of five leaves. Prior to this, in 1526-27, appeared a programme of the
                    lectures he intended to deliver at Basel, but this can hardly be reckoned a
                    specific work. During his lifetime fourteen works and editions were published,
                    and thereafter, between 1542 and 1845, there were at least two hundred and
                    thirty-four separate publications according to Mook’s enumeration. The first
                    collected edition was made by Johann Huser in German. It was printed at Basel in
                    1589-91, in eleven volumes quarto, and is the best of all the editions. Huser
                    did not employ the early printed copies only, but collected all the manuscripts
                    which he could procure, and used them also in forming his text. The only
                    drawback is that rather than omit anything which Paracelsus may have composed,
                    he has gone to the opposite extreme and included writings with which it is
                    pretty certain Paracelsus had nothing to do. The second collected German edition
                    is in four volumes folio, 1603-5. Parallel with it in 1603 the first collected
                    Latin edition was made by Palthenius. It is in eleven volumes quarto, and was
                    completed in 1605. Again, in 1616-18 appeared a reissue of the folio German
                    edition of 1603, and finally in 1658 came the Geneva Latin version, in three
                    volumes folio, edited by Bitiskius.</p>
                <p>The works were originally composed in Swiss-German, a vigorous speech which
                    Paracelsus wielded with unmistakable power. The Latin versions were made or
                    edited by Adam von Boden stein, Gerard Dorn, Michael Toxites, and Oporinus,
                    about the middle of the 16th century. A few translations into other languages
                    exist, as of the <hi rend="italic">Chirurgia</hi><hi rend="italic">Magna</hi>
                    and some other works into French, and of one or two into Dutch, Italian, and
                    even Arabic. The translations into English amount to about a dozen, dating
                    mostly from the middle of the 17th century. The original editions of
                    Paracelsus’s works are getting less and less common; even the English versions
                    are among the rarest of their class. Over and above the numerous editions, there
                    is a bulky literature of an explanatory and controversial character, for which
                    the world is indebted to Paracelsus’s followers and enemies. A good deal of it
                    is taken up with a defence of chemical, or, as they were called, “spagyric,”
                    medicines against the attacks of the supporters of the Galenic
                    pharmacopoeia.</p>
                <p>The aim of all Paracelsus’s writing is to promote the progress of medicine, and
                    he endeavours to put before physicians a grand ideal of their profession. In his
                    attempts he takes the widest view of medicine. He bases it on the general
                    relationship which man bears to nature as a whole; he cannot divorce the life of
                    man from that of the universe; he cannot think of disease otherwise than as a
                    phase of life. He is compelled therefore to τest his medical practice upon
                    general theories of the present state of things; his medical system—if there is
                    such a thing—is an adaptation of his cosmogony. It is this latter which has been
                    the stumbling-block to many past critics of Paracelsus, and unless its character
                    is remembered it will be the same to others in the future. Dissatisfied with the
                    Aristotelianism of his time, Paracelsus turned with greater expectation to the
                    Neoplatonism which was reviving. His eagerness to understand the relationship of
                    man to the universe led him to the Kabbala, where these mysteries seemed to be
                    explained, and from these unsubstantial materials he constructed, so far as it
                    can be understood, his visionary philosophy. Interwoven with it, however, were
                    the results of his own personal experience and work in natural history and
                    chemical pharmacy and practical medicine, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n253/mode/1up"

                    and so shrewd an observer as Paracelsus was must have often felt that his
                    philosophy and his experience did not agree with one another. It was doubtless a
                    very great ideal of medicine which Paracelsus raised; but when it came to
                    realizing it in every-day life he could hardly do else than fail. During the
                    three hundred years which have elapsed since his time knowledge both of the
                    macrocosm and of the microcosm has increased far beyond what Paracelsus could
                    have understood, even had it been all foretold him; the healing art has advanced
                    also, though perhaps scarcely at the same rate, but it would be as hard for us
                    as for him to apply any cosmogony, however rational, to curing disease. We are
                    not one whit nearer the solution of the problems which puzzled Paracelsus than
                    he was; the mystery of the origin, continuànce, and stoppage of life is, perhaps
                    through the abundance of light shed on other phenomena, even darker tlιan it may
                    have seemed to Paracelsus. If this be so it is no matter for • surprise, or
                    blame, or ridicule that he missed constructing a theory of the universe which at
                    the same time would be a never-failing guide to him in the practical work of
                    alleviating the evils which a residence in this universe seems to entail.</p>
                <p>Some of his doctrines have been already alluded to in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Medicine (j.u),</hi> and it would serve no purpose to give even
                    a brief sketch of his views, seeing that their influence has passed entirely
                    away, and that they are of interest only in their place in a general history of
                    medicine and philosophy. Defective, however, as they may have been, and
                    unfounded in fact, his kabbalistic doctrines led him to trace the dependence of
                    the human body upon outer nature for its sustenance and cure. The doctrine of
                    signatures, the supposed connexion of every part of the little world of man with
                    a corresponding part of the great world of nature, was a fanciful and false
                    exaggeration of this doctrine, but the idea carried in its train that of
                    specifics. This led to the search for these, which were not to be found in the
                    bewildering and untested mixtures of the Galenic prescriptions. Paracelsus had
                    seen how bodies were purified and intensified by chemical operations, and he
                    thought if plants and minerals could be made to yield their active principles it
                    would surely be better to employ these than the crude and unprepared originals.
                    He had besides arrived by some kind of intuition at the conclusion that the
                    operations in the body were of a chemical character, and that when disordered
                    they were to be put right by counter operations of the same kind. It may be
                    claimed for Paracelsus that he embraced within the idea of chemical action
                    something more than the alchemists did. Whether or not he believed in the
                    philosopher’s elixir is of very little consequence. If he did, he was like the
                    rest of his age; but he troubled himself very little, if at all, about it. He
                    did believe in the immediate use for therapeutics of the salts and other
                    preparations which his practical skill enabled him to make. Technically he was
                    not a chemist he did not concern himself either with the composition of his
                    compounds or with an explanation of what occurred in their making. If he could
                    get potent drugs to cure disease he was content, and he worked very hard in an
                    empirical way to make them. That he found out some new compounds is certain; but
                    not one great and marked discovery can be ascribed to him. Probably therefore
                    his positive services are to be summed up in this wide application of chemical
                    ideas to pharmacy and therapeutics; his indirect and possibly greater services
                    are to be found in the stimulus, the revolutionary stimulus, of his ideas about
                    method and general theory. It is not difficult, however, to criticize Paracelsus
                    and to represent him as so far below the level of his time as to be utterly
                    contemptible. It is difficult, but perhaps not impossible, to raise Paracelsus
                    to a place among the great spirits of mankind. It is most difficult of all to
                    ascertain what his true character really was, to appreciate aright this man of
                    fervid imagination, of powerful and persistent convictions, of unbated honesty
                    and love of truth, of keen insight into the errors (as he thought them) of his
                    time, of a merciless will to lay bare these errors and to reform the abuses to
                    which they gave rise, who in an instant offends us by his boasting, his
                    grossness, his want of self-respect. It is a problem how to reconcile his
                    ignorance, his weakness, his superstition, his crude notions, his erroneous
                    observations, his ridiculous inferences and theories, with his grasp of method,
                    his lofty views of the true scope of medicine, his lucid statements, his
                    incisive and epigrammatic criticisms of men and motives.</p>
                <p>A character full of contradictory elements cannot but have had contradictory
                    judgments passed on it; and after three hundred years the animus is as strong
                    and the judgments are as diverse as ever. (j. <hi rend="smallcaps">f.)</hi></p>
