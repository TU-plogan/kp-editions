                    height commanding a wide view of the hill-encircled plain known as the “cuenca”
                    or “bowl” of Pamplona. It is a station on the Ebro railway connecting Alsasua
                    with Saragossa. The climate in general is cold and moist, but owing to the
                    purity of the air and the excellence of its drainage the town is not unhealthy.
                    From its position Pamplona has always been the principal fortress of Navarre.
                    The fortifications form a rectangle of which the north-east and north-west sides
                    face the river (here crossed by several bridges), while on the south-west side
                    stands the citadel, which owes its present construction to Philip II., who
                    modelled it on that of Antwerp. It is a pentagon, separated from the city by an
                    esplanade, and is calculated to accommodate 7500 men. The streets of the town
                    are regular and broad; there are three <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> plazas,”
                    the principal of which, containing the Casa de la Diputacion and the theatre, is
                    sometimes on festive occasions turned into a bull-ring. The cathedral is a late
                    Gothic structure begun in 1397 by Charles III. (El Noble) of Navarre, who is
                    buried within its walls; of the previous structure raised by Don Sancho about
                    1123 only a small portion of the cloisters remains. The interior, which is fine,
                    is remarkable for the peculiar structure of its apse; the wood carvings of the
                    choir, in English oak, by Miguel Ancheta, a native artist, are excellent. The
                    principal façade is Corinthian, from designs of Ventura Rodriguez (1783). The
                    same architect designed the superb aqueduct by which the city is supplied with
                    water from Monte Francoa, some nine miles off. The beautiful cloisters on the
                    south side of the cathedral, and the chapter-house beyond them, as well as the
                    old churches of San Saturnino (Gothic) and San Nicolas (Romanesque), are also of
                    interest to the student of architecture. Among •other places of public resort in
                    Pamplona may be mentioned the bull-ring, capable of accommodating 8000
                    spectators, and the tennis court (El Trinquete). The town has a well-equipped
                    secondary school, two normal and numerous primary schools, as well as an academy
                    of design; and there are three hospitals. Of the public gardens and walks the
                    finest is La Taconera. The surrounding district is fertile, producing wine as
                    well as grain and other seeds; the manufactures are comparatively unimportant,
                    the chief being that of linen. The yearly fair in connexion with the feast of
                    San Fermin (July 7), the patron saint of the city, attracts a large concourse
                    from all parts of the country. Population of ayuntamiento in 1877, 25,630.</p>
                <p>Originally a town of the Vascones, Pamplona was rebuilt in 68 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> by Pompey the Great, whence the name Pompaelo or
                    Pompeio (Strabo). It was captured by Euric the Goth in 466 and by the Franks
                    under Childebert in 542; it was dismantled by Charlemagne in 778, but repulsed
                    the emir of Saragossa in 907. In the 14th century it was greatly strengthened
                    and beautified by Charles III., who built a citadel on the site now occupied by
                    the Plaza de Toros and by the Basilica de S. Ignacio, the church markingthe spot
                    where Ignatius Loyala received his wound in defending the place against André de
                    Foix in 1521. From 1808 it was occupied by the French until taken by Wellington
                    in 1813. In the Carlist war of 1836-40 it was held by the Cristinos, and in
                    1875-76 it was more than once attacked, but never taken, by the Carlists.</p>
