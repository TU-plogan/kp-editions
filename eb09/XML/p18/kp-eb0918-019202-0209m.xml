                    schoolboy he showed the characteristic bent of his mind by picking up the Romany
                    tongue and a great familiarity with the inner life of the Gipsies. He was not,
                    however, remarkably bookish, and from school was sent to London as a clerk in
                    the City. Palmer disliked this life, and varied it by learning French and
                    Italian, mainly by frequenting the society of foreigners wherever he could find
                    it. He had a peculiar gift for making himself at home with all manner of strange
                    people, which served him throughout life, and was as effective with Orientals as
                    with Europeans. His linguistic faculty was in fact only one side of a great
                    power of sympathetic imitation. He learned always from men rather than from
                    books, and by throwing his whole flexible personality into unison with those
                    from whom he was learning. In 1859 Palmer returned to Cambridge, apparently
                    dying of consumption. He had an almost miraculous recovery, and in 1860, while
                    he was thinking of a new start in life, fell in at Cambridge with a certain
                    Sayyid Abdullah, a teacher of Eastern languages. Under his influence he resolved
                    to give himself to Oriental studies, in which he made very rapid progress. He
                    now attracted the notice of two fellows of St John’s College, became an
                    undergraduate there, and in 1867 was elected a fellow on the ground of his
                    attainments, especially in Persian and Hindustani. He was soon engaged to join
                    the survey of Sinai, and followed up this work in 1870 by exploring the
                    Wilderness of the Wandering along with Drake. After a visit to Palestine and the
                    Lebanon he returned to England in 1870, and next year published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Desert of the Exodus.</hi> In the close of the year 1871 he became
                    Lord Almoner’s Professor of Arabic at Cambridge, married, and settled down to
                    teaching work. Unhappily his affairs were somewhat straitened, mainly through
                    the long illness of his wife, whom he lost in 1878; he was obliged to use his
                    pen for Oriental and other work in a way that did not do full justice to his
                    talents, and at length he became absorbed in journalism. In 1881, two years
                    after his second marriage, he finally left Cambridge and ceased to teach. In the
                    following year he was asked by the Government to go to the East and assist the
                    Egyptian expedition by his knowledge and his great influence over the Arabs of
                    the desert Al-Tih. It was a hazardous task, but Palmer rightly judged that he
                    could not refuse his country a service which no one else was able to render. He
                    went to Gaza, and without an escort made his way safely through the desert to
                    Suez—an exploit of singular boldness, which gave the highest proof of his
                    capacity for dealing with the Bedouins. From Suez he was again sent into the
                    desert with Captain Gill, to procure camels and do other service of a very
                    dangerous kind, and on this journey he and his companion were attacked and
                    murdered (August 1882). Their remains were recovered after the war, and now lie
                    in St Paul’s Cathedral.</p>
                <p>Palmer’s highest qualities appeared in his travels, especially in the heroic
                    adventures of his last journeys. His brilliant scholarship is also seen to
                    advantage in what he wrote in Persian and other Eastern languages, but not so
                    much so in his English books, which were generally written under pressure. His
                    scholarship was wholly Eastern in character, and lacked the critical qualities
                    of the modern school of Oriental learning in Europe. All his works show a great
                    linguistic range and very versatile talent; but he was cut off before he was
                    able to leave any permanent literary monument worthy of his powers. His chief
                    writings are <hi rend="italic">The Desert of the Exodus,</hi> 1871.; <hi
                    rend="italic">Poems of Behd ed Din</hi> (Ar. and Eng., 2 vols.), 1876-77; <hi
                    rend="italic">Arabic Grammar,</hi> 1877; <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Jerusalem,</hi> 1871 (by Besant and Palmer—the latter wrote the part taken from
                    Arabic sources); <hi rend="italic">Persian Dictionary,</hi> 1876, and <hi

                    translation of the <hi rend="italic">Qu’rân</hi> (unsatisfactory), 1880. He also
                    did good service in editing the <hi rend="italic">Name Lists</hi> of the
                    Palestine Exploration.</p>
