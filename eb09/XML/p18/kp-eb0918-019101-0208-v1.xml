                <p><label type="entry">PALMA</label>, the chief town of the Spanish province of
                    Baleares, the residence of a captain general, a bishop’s see, and a flourishing
                    seaport, is situated 135 miles from Barcelona, on the south west coast of
                    Majorca, at the head of the fine Bay of Palma, which stretches inland for about
                    10 miles between Capes Cala Figuera and Regana. It is the meeting place of all
                    the highways in the island, and the terminus of the railway which (opened in
                    1875) runs to Inca and (1879) Manacor, and will be extended to Alcudia. The
                    ramparts, which enclose the city on all sides except towards the port (where
                    they were thrown down in 1872), have a circuit of a little more than 4 miles.
                    Though begun in 1562, after the plans of Georgio Fretin, they were not finished
                    till 1836. Palma has undergone considerable change since 1860; streets have been
                    widened and houses built in the ordinary modern style, and the fine old-world
                    Moorish character of the place has suffered accordingly. The more conspicuous
                    buildings are the cathedral, the exchange, the palace, now occupied by the
                    captain-general and the law courts, the general hospital (1456), the town-house
                    (end of the 16th century), the picture gallery, and the college. At the time of
                    the partial suppression in 1835 there were twenty-five monastic buildings in
                    Palma; none of those still extant are of much note. The church of San Francisco
                    is interesting for the tomb of Raymond Lully, a native of Palma. The cathedral,
                    a fine Gothic building with massive buttresses, crowns the summit of the hill on
                    which the city stands. It was erected and dedicated to the Virgin in terms of a
                    vow made by King Jayme as he sailed to the conquest of Majorca, but, though
                    commenced in 1230, it was not finished till 1601. The older and more interesting
                    portions are the royal chapel (1232), with the tomb (1779) of Jayme II., and the
                    south front with the doorway known as <hi rend="italic">del</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">mirador</hi> (1389). The principal dimensions of the edifice
                    are— length from the door to the high altar, 347 feet; width, including the
                    chapels, 190 feet; height of the central nave, 147 feet; height of the side
                    naves, 78 feet; and height of the belfry tower, 166. Of the architecture of the
                    exchange <hi rend="italic">(lonja'),</hi> a Gothic building begun in 1426, the
                    people of Palma are particularly proud, as it excited the admiration of the
                    emperor Charles V. The columns of the windows, in black and grey marble, are of
                    almost unexampled slimness. The harbour (formed by a mole constructed to a
                    length of 387 yards in the 14th century and afterwards extended to more than 650
                    yards), has been greatly improved and enlarged since 1875 by dredging operations
                    and a further addition to the mole of 136 yards. Previously it was not
                    accessible to vessels drawing more than 18 feet, and men-of-war and large
                    merchant steamers were obliged to anchor in the bay, which is sometimes rendered
                    dangerous by violent storms. Porto Pi, about 2 miles from the city, was once a
                    good harbour, but is now fit only for small craft. Shoemaking, tanning, and
                    ropespinning are prosecuted on a very extensive scale; and direct commerce is
                    carried on with Valencia, Barcelona, Algeria, Marseilles, Cuba, Porto Rico,
                    &amp;c. Many of the Majorcan vessels used to be Palma-built, but the increase of
                    steam navigation has changed the character of the trade. The population of the
                    ayuntamiento, 53,019 in 1860, was 58,224 in 1877. There is a considerable number
                    of Christian Jews (Chuetas) who were formerly confined to their own quarter.</p>
                <p>Palma probably owes, if not its existence, at least its name (symbolized on the
                    Roman coins by a palm branch), to Metellus Balearicus, who in 123 B.c. settled
                    three thousand Roman and Spanish colonists cn the island. The bishopric dates
                    only from the 14th century, its foundation having been strongly opposed by the
                    bishop of Barcelona. About a mile south-west of Palma is the castle of Bellver,
                    where Jovellanos and Arago were imprisoned.</p>
