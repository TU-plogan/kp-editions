                <p><label type="entry">PATRIARCH</label><hi rend="italic">(πατριάρχης,</hi> lit. the
                    head or ruler of a <hi rend="italic">πάτριά,</hi> tribe, family, or clan) occurs
                    four times in the New Testament, being applied to Abraham, the twelve sons of
                    Jacob collectively, and David, and several times in the LXX., where the word is
                    used to denote the officials called by the chronicler “princes of the tribes of
                    Israel,” “princes of hundreds,” “chiefs of the fathers.” Under the late Roman
                    empire the title was officially applied down to the 5th century to the chief
                    rabbi in Palestine (see <hi rend="italic">Cod. Tkeod.,</hi> xvi. 8, 1; and comp.
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Israel,</hi> vol. xiii. p. 428); the head of the synagogue
                    at Babylon appears also to have been known as patriarch until 1038. The title at
                    an early date passed over into the Christian church as an honorific though not
                    official designation of all bishops; thus Gregory of Nyssa <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Or. Pun. in Melf)</hi> alludes to the fathers assembled in council at
                    Constantinople as “these patriarchs.” Afterwards the Easterns showed a tendency
                    to limit the appellation to the occupants of the more important sees, just as in
                    the West the so-called “metropolitans” began to receive more definite
                    recognition. At the present day the heads of the various extant churches and
                    sects in the East are very commonly called patriarchs (see vol. xi. p. 154 <hi
                    rend="italic">sqf),</hi> and in the West the Roman Church gives the honorary
                    title to several dignitaries, such as the archbishops of Lisbon and Venice. In a
                    strictly technical sense, however, that church recognizes only five
                    patriarchates, those of Constantinople, Alexandria, Jerusalem, Antioch, and
                    Rome. This peculiar restriction of the word, which may be said to date from the
                    council of Chalcedon in 451, can be traced downwards from the time of
                    Constantine, when the altered political circumstances and the civil division of
                    the empire into four prefectures (Orientis, Illyrici Orientalis, Italiae,
                    Galliarum), each containing a number of “dioceses,” gave a new importance to
                    questions of ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Thus the council of Nice (can. 6)
                    adjusted the jurisdiction of the “bishop” of Alexandria so as to include Libya
                    and Pentapolis as well as Egypt, the ancient rights of Rome, Antioch, and the
                    other “eparchies” being at the same time conserved. The third canon of the
                    council of Constantinople assigned precedence to the “bishop” of Constantinople
                    immediately after the “bishop” of Rome; and by the 28th of Chalcedon the
                    “metropolitans” of Thrace, Pontus, and Asia were appointed to receive their
                    consecration at his hands. The same council invested the bishop of Jerusalem,
                    formerly under the jurisdiction of the metropolitan of Antioch, with supremacy
                    over the whole of Palestine. Thenceforward a certain co-ordinate primacy was
                    thus accorded to Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria, and Jerusalem; but
                    it is to be observed that in no official document belonging to this period is
                    the title “patriarch” given to the bishop of any one of these sees, though the
                    word “eparch” or “exarch” is occasionally employed. We find Theodosius, however,
                    so designating the bishop of Rome, and not only is it given to the bishop of
                    Constantinople in the <hi rend="italic">NoveUae</hi> of Justinian, but we find
                    Mennas in 536 claiming to be called ó <hi rend="italic">oικovptvικoς</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">πατριάρχης,</hi> not, of course, without violent protest in the
                    West. After the fall of Jerusalem (637), Antioch (638), and Alexandria (640)
                    into the hands of the Saracens, the importance of these sees became of course
                    nominal merely, and it grew easier for Rome, at the head of the unbroken Western
                    church, to give practical expression to its claims of superiority<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n432/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0432-0411"/> over its sole surviving Eastern rival. Finding it
                    difficult, however, to avoid the appearance of equality that was involved in the
                    name of “patriarch,” now conventionally bestowed on the occupants of other
                    ancient and apostolic sees, the bishops of Rome rather avoided the title,
                    preferring the more colourless designation of papa or pope (see <hi
