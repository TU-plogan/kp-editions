                <p>The partnership of modern legal systems is based upon the <hi rend="italic"

                    any of the Roman jurists. But the Roman view is no doubt sufficiently expressed
                    in the definition by Voet:— <hi rend="italic">societas</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >societas</hi> was presumed to be contemplated in the absence of proof that any
                    other kind was intended. <hi rend="italic">Societas</hi> was a consensual
                    contract, and rested nominally on the consent of the parties—really, no doubt
                    (though this was not in terms acknowledged by the Roman jurists), on the fact of
                    valuable consideration moving from each partner. No formalities were necessary
                    for the constitution of a <hi rend="italic">societas.</hi> Either property or

                <p>There is no statutory or judicial definition of partnership in English law. It is
                    defined by the Indian Contract Act, § 239,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The definition was adopted in the Partnership Bill which was
                    introduced into parliament in 1880; see Appendix to Pollock’s <hi rend="italic"

                    them.” Sir N. Lindley declines to pledge himself to any definition, but lays
                    down the following principles :—( 1 ) partnership is the result of an agreement
                    to share profits and losses; (2) partnership is <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">facie</hi> the result of an agreement to share profits, although
                    nothing may be said about losses, and although there may be no common stock; (3)
                    partnership is <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi> the
                    result of an agreement to share profits, although community of loss is
                    stipulated against; (4) partnership is not the result of an agreement to share
                    gross returns; (5) partnership is not the result of an agreement which is not
                    concluded; (6) partnership is not the result of an agreement to share profits so
                    long as anything remains to be done before the right to share them accrues (1
                    Lindley, bk. i. ch. i., § 1). It was held in 1793, in the case of Waugh <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Carver, (2 H. Blackstone, 235), that sharing in profits
                    constituted partnership, though no partnership was in fact contemplated by the
                    parties. But in 1860 the House of Lords in Cox <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Hickman
                    (8 House of Lords Cases, 268), established the principle that persons who share
                    the profits of a business do not incur the liabilities of partners unless the
                    business is carried on by themselves or their real or ostensible agents. In 1865
                    the Act 28 &amp; 29 Vict. c. 86 (which applies to the United Kingdom, and is
                    commonly called Bovill’s Act) was passed in order to remove certain difficulties
                    arising from Cox <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Hickman. It enacts that the advance
                    by way of loan to a person engaged or about to engage in any trade or
                    undertaking, upon a contract in writing that the lender is to receive a rate of
                    interest varying with the profits, or a share of the profits, is not of itself
                    to constitute the lender a partner (§ 1); that no contract for the remuneration
                    of a servant or agent by a share of the profits is of itself to render such
                    servant or agent responsible as a partner or give him the rights of a partner (§
                    2); that no widow or child of a partner of a trader receiving by way of annuity
                    a portion of the profits is, by reason only of such receipt, to be deemed to be
                    a partner (§ 3); that no person receiving by way of annuity or otherwise a
                    portion of the profits in consideration of the sale of the goodwill is, by
                    reason only of such receipt, to be deemed to be a partner (§ 4); that in the
                    event of any such trader being adjudged bankrupt, &lt;fcc., the lender of any
                    such loan is not to be entitled to recover his principal or profits and
                    interest, or the vendor of a goodwill his profits, until the claims of -the
                    other creditors for valuable consideration have been satisfied. Participation in
                    profits has thus ceased to be an absolute test of partnership. Another test that
                    has been proposed is the existence of such a participation as to constitute the
                    relation of principal and agent. But this has been objected to on the ground
                    that agency is deducible from partnership and not partnership from agency (see
                    Holme <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Hammond, <hi rend="italic">Law Pep.</hi> 7 Exch.
                    218). The principles laid down by Sir N. Lindley above no doubt form the best
                    means of deciding the matter, but every case must depend to a large extent upon
                    its own particular circumstances. Though participation in profits is of itself
                    no evidence of partnership, on the other hand societies and clubs, the object of
                    which is not to share profits, are not partnerships. The liability of clubs or
                    provisional committee men depends entirely upon <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n351/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0351-0330"/> the question of agency. They are not as a rule in
                    the position of partners as against third persons. No partnership can exist in
                    an office depending upon personal confidence, as the office of executor or
                    trustee. Joint tenants or tenants in common are not necessarily partners. If A
                    and B agree to contribute a sum for the purchase of goods to be divided between
                    them, they are joint owners after purchase and before division. But if they
                    resell the goods and divide the profits, they then become partners (Smith’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Mercantile Law,</hi> bk. i. ch. ii.).</p>
                <p>A valid contract of partnership can be entered into by any person not under the
                    disability of minority or unsoundness of mind, or of being a convict within the
                    Felony Act, 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 23), or an alien enemy. It is presumed
                    that the disability of coverture no longer exists since the Married Women’s
                    Property Act, 1882. An infant may nominally be a partner, but he incurs no
                    liability, and may disaffirm past transactions when he comes of age. A clergyman
                    becoming a partner for purposes of trade is (with certain exceptions) liable to
                    ecclesiastical penalties, but the contracts of the partnership are not void, 1
                    &amp; 2 Vict. c. 106, § 31. At common law there is no limit to the number of
                    partners, but by the Companies Act, 1862 (25 &amp; 26 Vict. c. 89, § 4), not
                    more than ten persons can carry on the business of bankers, and not more than
                    twenty any other business, unless (with some exceptions) they conform to the
                    provisions of the Açt. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Company.)</hi></p>
                <p>A partnership may be constituted by deed or other •writing, or it may be implied
                    from acts. It is usually, though not of necessity, evidenced by deed. The usual
                    clauses in a partnership deed provide for the nature of the business, the time
                    of the commencement of the partnership and its duration, the premium, the
                    capital and property, the interest and allowances, the conduct and powers of the
                    partners, the custody of the books, the taking of the accounts, retirement,
                    dissolution, and expulsion, the valuation and transmission of shares, annuities
                    to widows of deceased partners, prohibition against carrying on business in
                    opposition after retirement, sale of goodwill, getting in debts, indemnity to
                    outgoing partners, and arbitration clauses. Though a deed may serve to adjust
                    the rights of the partners <hi rend="italic">inter se,</hi> their liabilities to
                    third persons cannot be affected by provisions in a deed of which the latter are
                    ignorant. Whether a partnership exists in a particular case is a mixed question
                    of law and fact. The partnership may last for any time agreed upon by the
                    partners. It is determinable at will unless it has been agreed that it shall
                    endure for a specified period, or unless it is dissolved by some of the
                    circumstances which will be hereafter mentioned. A partnership may be general or
                    special, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the ownership of a single race-horse, or
                    the conduct of a .single case by a firm of solicitors. The rights and
                    liabilities of partners may be considered as they affect the partners (1) <hi
                    rend="italic">inter se,</hi> and (2) in their relation to third persons.</p>
                <p>1. The shares of partners are <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >facie</hi> equal. Inequality must be proved by evidence. Each member of a
                    partnership is entitled to take a share in its management, unless, as is
                    frequently the case, one member is appointed managing partner. A partner is in a
                    fiduciary position. It is therefore his duty to use reasonable diligence, to
                    keep within the limits of his authority, and to observe good faith, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> not to compete with the partnership. He may be a
                    partner in another firm, and the fact of his being a partner in firms A and B
                    does not make A and B partners, for <hi rend="italic">socius mei</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sodi non</hi><hi rend="italic">est meus socius.</hi> In matters
                    which are within the ordinary course of the business of the partnership, such as
                    the period of division of profits, if the partnership articles be silent on the
                    subject, the minority must yield to the majority. In matters beyond the scope of
                    the partnership business, such as a change in the character of the business, one
                    dissentient can forbid a change, and can obtain an injunction to prevent the
                    change from being carried out. A partner is entitled to have accounts kept, and
                    to inspect them at proper times. Where a partner has as agent for the firm paid
                    more than his share, he is entitled to contribution from the rest. One partner
                    cannot be expelled by the others unless there is a special power of expulsion
                    given by the articles. A partner has no right to assign his share without the
                    express or implied consent of the other partners. If the partnership be one at
                    will, the assignment <hi rend="italic">ipso facto</hi> dissolves it; if not at
                    will, the others are entitled to treat the assignment as a ground of
                    dissolution. The assignee takes the share subject to the claims of the other
                    partners. Each partner has an equitable lien upon the partnership property,
                    enabling him within certain limits to control the disposition of it. On the
                    death of a partner his share goes to his representatives, not, as in
                    joint-tenancy, by accretion to the survivors. It is an ancient maxim of law that
                    <hi rend="italic">jus</hi><hi rend="italic">accrescendi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >inter</hi><hi rend="italic">mercatores</hi><hi rend="italic">non</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">habet</hi><hi rend="italic">locum</hi> (Coke upon Littleton, 182
                    <hi rend="italic">a).</hi></p>
                <p>2. A more important and difficult question is the relation of partners to those
                    not members of the partnership. From this point of view partnership is to a
                    great extent a branch of the law of agency (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Agent).
                    As</hi> far as contracts are concerned, it is the rule that one partner is its
                    general agent for the transaction of its business in the ordinary way, and the
                    firm is responsible for whatever is done by any of the partners when acting for
                    the firm within the limits of the authority conferred by the nature of the
                    business which it carries on (1 Lindley, bk. ii. ch. i.). The authority is
                    defined by the business, not by any private understanding between the partners.
                    Thus a merchant can bind his partners by accepting a bill of exchange for the
                    firm, but a solicitor or medical man cannot. A partner cannot execute a deed,
                    except a simple release of a debt, so as to bind the firm. In many cases an act
                    not warranted by authority, such as a submission to arbitration, may be adopted
                    by ratification so as to bind the firm. And in other cases the rights of a <hi
                    rend="italic">bona fide</hi> claimant will prevail, even though the authority
                    has been exceeded and there has been no ratification, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> where a bill given by a partner on his private account passes into
                    the hands of a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> holder for value. Where the
                    partner contracts on behalf of the partnership, it is the latter and not the
                    individual who is primarily liable. If the name of a firm and an individual is
                    the same, a bill drawn in that name for partnership purposes is <hi
                    rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi> a bill of the firm
                    (Yorkshire Banking Co. <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Beatson, <hi rend="italic">Law
                    Pep.,</hi> 5 C. P. D., 109). But a partner may hold himself out as the sole
                    partner, and so make himself separately liable. Every member of a partnership is
                    at common law liable <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">solido</hi> for
                    the debts of the firm, a liability co-extensive with his power to transfer the
                    whole property of the firm. This liability cannot be restricted except by
                    statute (as the Companies Act) or by express contract with the creditors. A
                    dormant partner is liable, like an ostensible partner, for debts contracted
                    during his partnership; if, however, the ostensible partners have been sued to
                    judgment, an action cannot be brought to charge the dormant partner (Kendall <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Hamilton, <hi rend="italic">Law Pep.,</hi> 4 App. Cas.,
                    504). The liability of a dormant and an ostensible partner terminates in a
                    different manner, in the former case by his simple retirement without notice, in
                    the latter only after notice, a general notice in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gazette</hi> being the usual means of informing the public of the change, while
                    special notice is given to known customers. It is a question of fact whether the
                    liability of the new <pb break="no"

                    previous firm. A guarantee to or for a firm ceases upon a change in the firm
                    unless it appears by express stipulation or necessary implication that the
                    guarantee is to continue, 19 &amp; 20 Vict. c. 97, § 4. There are cases in which
                    a relation of quasi-partnership is created, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in
                    which persons not partners <hi rend="italic">inter se</hi> become partners <hi
                    rend="italic">qua</hi> third persons. A person who holds himself out as a
                    partner incurs the liability of a partner. This was clearly laid down by Lord
                    Chief Justice Eyre in Waugh <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Carver, and is now an
                    established principle of law. “Holding out” means that credit has been obtained
                    by the use of his name, or even by permitting reference to him as one who wishes
                    to have his name concealed.</p>
                <p>Where the liability arises out of tort, the law is not quite the same as it is
                    where the liability arises from contract. The presumption is against the
                    authority of a partner to commit a tort, and so opposed to the presumption in
                    the case of contract. But a partnership is liable jointly and severally for any
                    wrongful act or omission of one of its members in conducting the business of the
                    firm, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the neglect of a managing partner to keep the
                    shaft of a mine in order, but not for a wilful wrong unconnected with the
                    business, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> malicious prosecution. With respect to
                    fraud by misappropriation of money, some obligation on the part of the firm to
                    take care of the money must be shown. A receipt from the firm <hi rend="italic"
                    >prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi> imposes this obligation.</p>
                <p>An action should be brought by all the partners (except merely nominal partners,
                    who need not be joined unless in an action on a contract under seal). They
                    cannot delegate a right of action to one of themselves for convenience. This can
                    only be done by statute, as 7 Geo. IV. c. 46, enabling banking companies to sue
                    and be sued by a public officer. All the partners ought to be sued, subject to
                    any statutory exception, as that contained in the Carriers’ Act, 11 Geo. IV.,
                    and 1 WilL IV. c. 68, §§ 5, 6. But misjoinder or nonjoinder of parties does not
                    defeat an action <hi rend="italic">{Pules of the Supreme Court,</hi> 1883, ord.
                    xvi. r. 11). The method of procedure does not affect the principle of the
                    liability of each partner <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >solido,</hi> a principle on which is based one of the main points of difference
                    between a partnership and a corporation. In a corporation the collective whole
                    is distinct from the individuals composing it (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Corporation).</hi> But in a partnership the firm, as distinct from the
                    individual partners, is recognized by English law only to a very limited extent,
                    and as matter of procedure rather than of substantive law. Since the Judicature
                    Acts, in an action against a partnership, power is given to sue and be sued in
                    the firm name, but the partners are bound to disclose the names of the persons
                    constituting the firm, and, though judgment goes against the firm, execution may
                    issue against a partner <hi rend="italic">{Rules of the Supreme Court,</hi>
                    1883, ord. vii. r. 2, xvi. r. 14, xlii. r. 10). An adjudication of bankruptcy
                    cannot be made against the firm in the firm name, but only against the partners
                    individually <hi rend="italic">{Bankruptcy Rules,</hi> 1883, r. 197).</p>
                <p>A partnership at will is dissolved by determination of the will or assignment of
                    the partnership share. A partnership other than a partnership at will is
                    dissolved by (1) effluxion of time; (2) retirement of a partner; (3) alienation
                    by operation of law of a partner’s share, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> by
                    bankruptcy or (formerly) by marriage of a female partner; (4) death; (5)
                    business becoming unlawful, as by a partner becoming an alien enemy; (6)
                    assignment of partnership share; (7) lunacy; (8) liability of a partner to
                    criminal prosecution; (9) impossibility of carrying on the business. In the last
                    four cases the partnership is not <hi rend="italic">ipso facto</hi> dissolved,
                    but they are grounds on which the court may order a dissolution (see Pollock,
                    art. 47 <hi rend="italic">sqf.</hi> Where a partner has been induced to enter
                    into a partnership by fraud, he has in general the option of affirming or
                    rescinding the contract at his election.</p>
                <p>The dissolution of partnerships and the taking of partnership accounts are
                    matters specially assigned to the Chancery Division (Judicature Act, 1873, §
                    34). After dissolution the persons who constituted the partnership become
                    tenants in common of the partnership property until the division of assets,
                    unless any other provision is made by agreement. The partnership debts are paid
                    out of the partnership assets, and the private debts out of the private
                    assets.</p>
                <p>The principle of law that a partnership debt is joint and several comes into
                    operation where the partnership is dissolved by bankruptcy or death. The joint
                    estate is the primary fund for the payment of joint debts, but the joint
                    creditors can look to any surplus of the separate estate (after payment of the
                    separate debts) to satisfy any deficiency in the joint estate. See the
                    Bankruptcy Act, 1883, § 59. Partners cannot compete with the creditors of the
                    firm either against the joint estate or the several estate of a partner; that is
                    to say, they cannot be satisfied until all the debts of the firm have been paid.
                    In the case of death, although the partnership is dissolved by death, it is
                    still treated as subsisting for the purposes of administration. The creditor has
                    the same rights against the estate of the deceased as he would have had in his
                    lifetime in some cases, so that he may proceed against this estate in the first
                    instance, without recourse to the surviving partners (see the judgment of Lord
                    Selborne in Kendall <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Hamilton, <hi rend="italic">Law
                    Rep.,</hi> 5 App. Cas. 539). Further, the death of a partner has the result of
                    converting the real property of the firm. “Whenever a partnership purchases real
                    estate for partnership purposes, and with partnership funds, it is, as between
                    the real and personal representatives of the partners, personal estate” (Darby
                    <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Darby, 3 Drewry 506).</p>
                <p>At common law no criminal prosecution was maintainable by one partner against
                    another for stealing the property of the firm. But this difficulty has been
                    removed by 31 &amp; 32 Vict. c. 116.</p>
                <p>Though the English law of partnership is based upon Roman law, there are several
                    matters in which the two systems differ. (1) There was no limit to the number of
                    partners in Roman law. (2) In <hi rend="italic">societas</hi> one partner could
                    generally bind another only by express <hi rend="italic">mandatum ∙,</hi> one
                    partner was not regarded as the implied agent of the others. (3) The debts of a
                    <hi rend="italic">societas</hi> were apparently joint, and not joint and
                    several. (4) The <hi rend="italic">heres</hi> of a deceased partner could not
                    succeed to the rights of the deceased, even by express stipulation. There is no
                    such disability in England. (5) In actions between partners in Roman law, the
                    <hi rend="italic">beneficium competentiae,</hi> applied, that is, the privilege
                    of being condemned only in such an amount as the partner could pay without being
                    reduced to destitution. (6) The Roman partner was in some respects more strictly
                    bound by his fiduciary position than is the English partner. For instance, a
                    Roman partner could not retire in order to enjoy alone a gain which he knew was
                    awaiting him. (7) There was no special tribunal to which matters arising out of
                    <hi rend="italic">societas</hi> were referred.</p>
                <p>The law of Scotland as to partnership agrees in the main with the law of England.
                    The principal difference is that Scots law recognizes the firm as an entity
                    distinct from the individuals composing it. English law, as has been said, does
                    this only to a very limited extent. The firm of the company<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The term “company” is not confined, as in
                    England, to an association existing by virtue of the Companies Act, 1862, or
                    similar Acts.</p></note> is either proper or descriptive. A proper or personal
                    firm is a firm designated by the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n353/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0353-0332"/> name of one or more of the partners. A
                    descriptive firm does not introduce the name of any of the partners. The former
                    may sue and be sued under the company name; the latter only with the addition of
                    the names of three at least (if there are so many) of tfie j·artners. A
                    consequence of this view of the company as a separate person is that an action
                    cannot be maintained against a partner personally without application to the
                    company in the first instance, the individual partners being in the position of
                    cautioners for the company rather than of principal debtors. The provisions of
                    the Mercantile Law Amendment Act, 1856 (19 &amp; 20 Vict. c. 60, § 8), do not
                    affect the case of partners. But, though the company must first be discussed,
                    diligence must necessarily be directed against the individual partners.
                    Heritable property cannot be held in the name of a firm; it can only stand in
                    the name of individual partners. Notice of the retirement of even a dormant
                    partner is necessary. The law of Scotland draws a distinction between joint
                    adventure and partnership. Joint adventure or joint trade is a partnership
                    confined to a particular adventure or speculation, in which the partners,
                    whether latent or unknown, use no firm or social name, and incur no
                    responsibility beyond the limits of the adventure. In the rules applicable to
                    cases of insolvency and bankruptcy of a company and partners, Scots law differs
                    in several respects from English. Thus a company can be made bankrupt without
                    the partners being made so as individuals. And, when both company and partners
                    are bankrupt, the company creditors are entitled to rank on the separate estates
                    of the partners for the balance of their debts equally with the separate
                    creditors. But in sequestration, by 19 &amp; 20 Vict. c. 79, § 66, the creditor
                    of a company, in claiming upon the sequestrated estate of a partner, must deduct
                    from the amount of his claim the value of his right to draw payment from the
                    company’s funds, and he is ranked as creditor only for the balance. (See
                    Erskine’s <hi rend="italic">Inst.,</hi> bk. iii. tit. iii.; Bell’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Comm.,</hi> ii. 500-562; Bell’s <hi rend="italic">Principles,</hi>
                    §§ 350-403.)</p>
                <p>In the United States the English common law is the basis of the law. Most States
                    have, however, their own special legislation on the subject. Partneι <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> ship is defined by Chancellor Kent to be “a contract
                    of two or more competent persons to place their money, effects, labour, and
                    skill, or some or all of them, in lawful commerce or business, and. to divide
                    the profit and bear the loss in certain proportions” (3 Kent’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Comm.</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> lect. xliii. ). The definition of the New
                    York Civil Code, art. 1283, runs thus :— “partnership is the association of two
                    or more persons for the purpose of carrying on business together, and dividing
                    its profits between them.’ The most striking feature of the law in the United
                    States is the existence of limited partnerships, corresponding to the <hi
                    rend="italic">sociétés en.</hi><hi rend="italic">commandite</hi> established in
                    France by the ordinance of 1673. The State of New York was the first to
                    introduce this kind of partnership by legislative enactment. The provisions of
                    the New York Act have been followed by most of the other States. In many States
                    there can be no limited partnership in banking and insurance. In this form of
                    partnership one or more persons responsible <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">solido</hi> are associated with one or more dormant partners
                    liable only to the extent of the funds supplied by them. In Louisiana such
                    partnerships are called partnerships <hi rend="italic">in commendam</hi> (Civil
                    Code, art. 2810). In New York the respon sible partners are called <hi
                    rend="italic">general</hi> partners, the others <hi rend="italic">special</hi>
                    partners. Such partnerships must, by the law of most States, be registered. (In
                    1880 a bill providing for the legislation of such partnerships in the United
                    Kingdom was introduced in the House of Commons, but failed to become law.) In
                    Louisiana universal partnerships (the <hi rend="italic">societates universorum
                    bonorum</hi> of Roman law) must be created in writing and registered (Civil
                    Code, art. 2800). In some States the English law as it stood before Cox <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Hickman is followed, and participation in profits is still
                    regarded as the test of partnership, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Leggett <hi
                    rend="italic">v.</hi> Hyde (58 New York Rep. 272). In some States nominal
                    partners are not allowed. Thus in New York, where the words “and Company” or
                    “and Co.” are used, they must represent an actual partner or partners. A breach
                    of this rule subjects offenders to penalties. In most States claims against the
                    firm after the death of a partner must, in the first instance, be made to the
                    survivors. The creditors cannot, ,as in England, proceed directly against the
                    representatives of the deceased. The law. as to the conversion of realty into
                    personalty on the administration of the estate of a deceased partner in some
                    States agrees with English law, in others does not. (See 3 Kent’s <hi
