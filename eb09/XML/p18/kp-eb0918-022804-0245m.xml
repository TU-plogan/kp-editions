                <p><label type="entry">PAPIN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Denis</hi></label> (1647-c.1712),
                    French physicist, and one of the inventors of the steam-engine, was a native of
                    Blois, where he was born in 1647. In 1661 or 1662 he entered upon the study of
                    medicine at the university of Angers, where he graduated in 1669, with the
                    intention apparently of settling as a practising physician in that city. Some
                    time prior to 1674 he removed to Paris and assisted Huygens in his experiments
                    with the air-pump, the results of which <hi rend="italic">{Expériences du
                    Vuidé)</hi> were published at Paris in that year, and also in the form of five
                    papers by Huygens and Papin jointly, in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions</hi> for 1675. Shortly after the publication of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Expériences,</hi> Papin, who had crossed to London hoping to find
                    some congenial employment, was hospitably received by Boyle, and gave him some
                    assistance in his laboratory and with his writings; about this time also he
                    introduced into the air-pump the improvement of making it with double barrels,
                    and replacing by the two valves the turn-cock hitherto used. He is said,
                    moreover, to have been the first to use the plate and receiver, which are organs
                    of capital importance in the modern form of the instrument. Subsequently he
                    invented the condensing-pump, and in 1680 he was admitted, on Boyle’s
                    nomination, to the Royal Society. In the following year he communicated to the
                    Society an account of his famous steam “digester, or engine for softening
                    bones,” afterwards described in a tract published at Paris, and entitled <hi

                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">amollir les os et de faire couire toutes

                    la marmite, ses propriétés et ses usages.</hi> In this instrument the principle
                    of the safety-valve was applied for the first time. After some further
                    experiments with the digester he accepted an invitation to Venice to take part
                    in the work of the recently founded Academy of the Philosophical and
                    Mathematical Sciences; here he remained until 1684, when he returned to London
                    and received from the Royal Society an appointment as “temporary curator of
                    experiments,” with a small salary. In this capacity he carried <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n246/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0246-0229"/> on numerous and varied investigations, in the
                    course of which he discovered a siphon acting in the same manner as the “Sipho
                    Wirtembergicus” <hi rend="italic">{Phil. Tr.,</hi> 1685), and also constructed a
                    model of an engine for raising water from a river by means of pumps worked by a
                    water-wheel driven by the current. In November 1687 he was appointed to the
                    chair of mathematics in the university of Marburg, and here he remained until
                    1696, when he removed to Cassel. From the time of his settlement in Germany he
                    carried on an active correspondence with Huygens and Leibnitz, which is still
                    preserved, and in one of his letters to Leibnitz, in 1698, he mentions that he
                    is engaged on a machine for raising water to a great height by the force of
                    fire; in a later communication he speaks also of a little carriage he had
                    constructed to be propelled by this force. Again in 1702 he wrote about a steam
                    “ballista,” which he anticipated would “promptly compel France to make an
                    enduring peace.” In 1705 Leibnitz sent Papin a sketch of Savery’s engine for
                    raising water, and this stimulated him to further exertions, which resulted two
                    years afterwards in the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Ars</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nova ad</hi><hi rend="italic">aquam</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ignis</hi><hi rend="italic">adminiculo efficacissime elevandam</hi> (Cassel,
                    1707), in which his high-pressure boiler and its applications are described (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Steam-Engine).</hi> In 1707 he resolved to quit Cassel for
                    London, and on September 24th of theft year he sailed with his family from
                    Cassel in an ingeniously constructed boat, propelled by paddlewheels, to be
                    worked by the crew, with which he apparently expected to reach the mouth of the
                    Weser. The expedition, however, came to an ignominious end at Münden, where the
                    vessel was confiscated at the instance of the boatmen, who objected to the
                    invasion of their exclusive privileges in the Weser navigation. Papin, on his
                    subsequent arrival in London, found himself without resources and almost without
                    friends; various applications through Sloane to the Royal Society for grants of
                    money were made in vain, and he died in total obscurity, probably about the
                    beginning of 1712.</p>
                <p>The published writings of Papin, besides those already referred to, consist for
                    the most part of a large number of papers, principally on hydraulics and
                    pneumatics, contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Savans,</hi> the
