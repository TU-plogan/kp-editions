                    distinguished himself by unusual precocity. After a brief experience of business
                    he elected to devote himself to study and the pursuit of literature, living with
                    his mother on their private means. His first books were poetical, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Monks of St Mark</hi> (1804), <hi rend="italic">Palmyra</hi>
                    (1806), <hi rend="italic">The Genius of the Thames</hi> (1810), <hi
                    rend="italic">The Philosophy of Melancholy</hi> (1812),— works of no great
                    merit. He also made several dramatic attempts, which did not find their way to
                    the stage. He served for a short time as secretary to Sir Home Popham at
                    Flushing, and paid several visits to Wales. In 1812 he became acquainted with
                    Shelley, who made him his executor together with Lord Byron. In 1815 he evinced
                    his peculiar power by writing <hi rend="italic">Headlong Hall,</hi> the
                    prototype of all his subsequent novels. It was published in 1816, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Melincourt</hi> followed in the ensuing year. During 1817 he lived
                    at Great Marlow, enjoying the almost daily society of Shelley, and writing <hi
                    rend="italic">Nightmare Abbey</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rhododaphne,</hi> by
                    far the best of his long poems. In 1819 he received the appointment of assistant
                    examiner at the India House, at the same time as Mill and Strachey. Peacock’s
                    nomination appears to have been due to the influence of his old schoolfellow
                    Peter Auber, secretary to the East India Company, and the papers he prepared as
                    tests of his ability were returned to him with the high encomium, “Nothing
                    superfluous and nothing wanting.” This was characteristic of the whole of his
                    intellectual work; and equally characteristic of the man was his marriage about
                    this time to a Welsh lady, to whom he proposed by letter, not having seen her
                    for eight years. His official duties greatly interfered with independent
                    composition. <hi rend="italic">Maid Marian</hi> nevertheless appeared in 1822,
                    <hi rend="italic">The Misfortunes of Elphin</hi> in 1829, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crotchet Castle</hi> in 1831; and he would probably have written more but for
                    the death in 1833 of his mother, to whom he was deeply attached. He also
                    contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Examiner.</hi> His services to the East India Company, outside the
                    usual official routine, were considerable. He defended it successfully against
                    the attacks of Mr J. S. Buckingham and the Liverpool salt interest, and made the
                    subject of steam navigation to India peculiarly his own. He represented the
                    company before the various parliamentary committees on this question; and in
                    1839 and 1840 superintended the construction of iron steamers, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0466-0445"/> which not only made the voyage round the Cape
                    successfully, but proved very useful in the Chinese war. He also framed
                    instructions for the Euphrates expedition, pronounced by General Chesney to be
                    models of sagacity. In 1836 he succeeded Mill as chief examiner, and in 1856 he
                    retired upon a pension. During his later years he contributed several papers to
                    <hi rend="italic">Fraser's Magazine,</hi> including reminiscences of Shelley. He
                    also wrote in the same magazine his last novel, <hi rend="italic">Gryll
                    Grange</hi> (1860), inferior to his earlier writings in humour and vigour, but
                    still a surprising effort for a man of his age. He died 23d January 1866 at
                    Lower Halliford, near Chertsey, where, so far as his London occupations would
                    allow him, he had resided for more than forty years.</p>
                <p>Peacock’s position in English literature is unique. There was nothing like his
                    type of novel· before his time; though there might have been if it had occurred
                    to Swift to invent a story as a vehicle for the dialogue of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Polite Conversation.</hi> But, while Swift’s interlocutors
                    represent ordinary types, Peacock’s are highly exceptional; while the humour of
                    the former consists in their stereotyped conventionality or unconscious folly,
                    the talk in Peacock’s novels is brilliant; and, while Swift’s characters utter
                    proverbs, Peacock’s are equipped from the author’s own stores of humorous
                    observation or reflexion. He speaks as well in his own person as through his
                    puppets; and perhaps no writer since Pope has enriched English literature with
                    such an abundance of quotable things. This pithy wit and sense, combined with
                    remarkable grace and accuracy of natural description, atone for the primitive
                    simplicity of plot and character. There is just enough of both to keep the story
                    going, and the author’s plan required no more. Of his seven fictions, <hi
                    rend="italic">Nightmare Abbey</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Crotchet Castle</hi>
                    are perhaps on the whole the best, the former displaying the most <hi
                    rend="italic">vis comica</hi> of situation, the latter the fullest maturity of
                    intellectual power, and the most skilful grouping of the motley crowd of
                    “perfectibilians, deteriorationists, statu-quo-ites, phrenologists,
                    transcendentalists, political economists, theorists in all sciences, projectors
                    in all arts, morbid visionaries, romantic enthusiasts, lovers of music, lovers
                    of the picturesque, and lovers of good dinners,” who constitute the <hi
                    rend="italic">dramatis personae</hi> of that comedy in narrative, the
                    Pea-cockian novel. <hi rend="italic">Maid Marian</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Misfortunes of Elphin</hi> are hardly less entertaining, but are somewhat
                    cramped by the absence of portraiture from the life and the necessity for
                    historical colouring. Both contain descriptive passages of extraordinary beauty.
                    <hi rend="italic">Melincourt</hi> is a comparative failure, the excellent idea
                    of an orangoutang mimicking humanity being insufficient as the sole groundwork
                    of a novel. <hi rend="italic">Headlong Hall,</hi> though more than foreshadowing
                    the author’s subsequent excellence, is marred by a certain bookish awkwardness
                    characteristic of the recluse student, which reappears in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gryll Grange</hi> as the pedantry of an old-fashioned scholar, whose likes and
                    dislikes have become inveterate and whose sceptical liberalism, always rather
                    inspired by hatred of cant than enthusiasm for progress, has petrified into only
                    too earnest conservatism. Pianos and perspective equally with competitive
                    examinations and “panto-pragmatism” are the objects of the writer’s distaste,
                    and for the first time in his career we feel inclined to laugh at him, being no
                    longer able to laugh with him. The book’s quaint resolute paganism, however, is
                    very refreshing in an age eaten up with introspection; it is the kindliest of
                    Peacock’s writings, and contains the most beautiful of his poems, “Years Ago,”
                    the reminiscence of an early attachment. In general the ballads and songs
                    interspersed through his tales are models of exact and melodious diction, and
                    instinct with true feeling. His more ambitious poems are worth little, except
                    <hi rend="italic">Rhododaphne,</hi> attractive as a story and perfect as a
                    composition, but destitute of genuine poetical inspiration. His critical and
                    miscellaneous writings are always interesting, especially the restorations of
                    lost classical plays in the <hi rend="italic">Horae Drαmαticae,</hi> but the
                    only one of great mark is the witty and crushing exposure in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> of Moore’s ignorance of the manners and
                    belief he has ventured to portray in his <hi rend="italic">Epicurean.</hi>
                    Peacock resented the misrepresentation of his favourite sect, the good and ill
                    of whose tenets were fairly represented in his own person. Somewhat sluggish and
                    self-indulgent, incapable of enthusiasm or self-sacrifice, he yet possessed a
                    deep undemonstrative kindliness of nature; he could not bear to see any one near
                    him unhappy or uncomfortable; and his sympathy, no less than his genial humour,
                    gained him the attachment of children, dependants, and friends. His feelings
                    were steady rather than acute; he retained throughout life with touching
                    fidelity the memory of an early affection. In official life he was upright and
                    conscientious; his judgment was shrewd and robust, and the quaint crotchets and
                    prejudices which contrasted so curiously with his usual sagacity were in general
                    the exaggeration of .sound ideas held with undue exclusiveness. As a candidate
                    for literary immortality he should be safe. The same causes which restrict his
                    popularity ensure his permanence. His novels depend but slightly on temporary
                    phases of manners, but are vitally associated with standard literature, and with
                    general tendencies innate in the human mind. Neither his intellectual liberalism
                    nor his constitutional conservatism will ever be out of date; and what Shelley
                    justly termed “the lightness, strength, and chastity” of his diction secures him
                    an honourable rank among those English writers whose claims to remembrance
                    depend not only upon matter but upon style.</p>
                <p>Peacock’s works were collected, though not completely, and published in three
                    volumes in 1875, at the expense of his friend and former protégé, Sir Henry
                    Cole, with an excellent memoir by his grand-daughter Mrs Clarke, and a critical
                    essay by Lord Houghton. Other criticisms have been written, by Mr Spedding in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Bdin-bιιrgh Review</hi> and by James Hannay in the <hi
