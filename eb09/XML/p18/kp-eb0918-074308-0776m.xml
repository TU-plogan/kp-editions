                <p><label type="entry">PHILIP II</label>. (1527-1598), king of Spain, was the son of
                    the emperor Charles V. and Isabella of Portugal, and was born at Valladolid on
                    21st May 1527. He was brought up in Castile under the care of his mother, who
                    died when he was twelve years old. As Philip grew up, his father, though he
                    rarely saw his son, watched carefully over his education and strove to fit him
                    for political life. In 1543 Philip married Mary of Portugal, who died in 1545,
                    soon after the birth of a son, Don Carlos. In 1548 Charles V. summoned Philip to
                    Brussels, that he might gain some experience of the peoples whom he would be
                    called upon to rule. He was not, however, popular with his future subjects. He
                    had already formed his character upon the model of Spanish haughtiness. He was
                    cold, reserved, punctilious about decorum, and wanting in geniality. The
                    Italians did not care for him; the Flemings disliked him; the Germans hated him.
                    His appearance and manner did not further his father’s plan of securing his
                    election to the empire. The scheme failed, and Philip’s presence was in no way
                    helpful. In 1551 he returned to the more congenial task of governing Spain.</p>
                <p>The death of Edward VI. of England opened out to Charles V. new prospects for his
                    son. Queen Mary regarded the emperor as her only friend, and submitted herself
                    entirely to his guidance. She received with joy a proposal for her marriage with
                    Philip. The English opposition broke down with the failure of Wyatt’s rebellion,
                    and in 1554 Philip came to England to claim his bride. Charles V. resigned to
                    him Naples and Sicily that he might not come as a.nθθdy prince. Philip was well
                    supplied with Spanish gold, and was charged by his father to spare no pains in
                    conciliating the English. He tried his best; but his cold, ungenial manner was a
                    hopeless obstacle to his success. Mary was devotedly attached to her hus <pb

                    the queen’s zeal for the re-establishment of Catholicism. Charles V. wished to
                    secure England as an ally, and subordinated religious to political
                    considerations. Philip was not naturally fitted for conciliatory action, and was
                    not happy in England. He found that his wife was destined to be childless and
                    that he had no prospect of succeeding to the English crown. At the end of 1555
                    he joyfully obeyed his father’s summons to go to Brussels. Charles V., worn out
                    by the fatigue of a long reign, resolved to abdicate in favour of his son, and
                    this he did on 16th January 1556.</p>
                <p>Philip II. was now king of Spain, Naples, and Sicily, duke of Milan, lord of
                    Franche Comté and the Netherlands, ruler of Tunis and the Barbary coast, the
                    Canaries and Cape de Verd Islands, the Philippines and Spice Islands, large
                    colonies in the West Indies, and the vast territories of Mexico and Peru. These
                    great dominions had fallen into his father’s hands and were united only by their
                    dependence on their ruler. It was Philip’s task to give them an organic unity
                    and combine them into a system. First he had to face a threatening league
                    against his power. Pope Paul IV., a Neapolitan, was imbued with hatred of the
                    Spanish rule, and formed an alliance with Henry II. of France. Philip sent the
                    duke of Alva, who speedily reduced the intractable pope. But Philip was too good
                    a Catholic to press his victory. He was content to leave the pope powerless, and
                    Alva on his knees asked pardon for bearing arms against the church. The war
                    against France was pursued with equal success and greater results. Philip’s
                    army, led by Philibert of Savoy, entered Picardy and besieged St Quentin. The
                    French were defeated in an attempt to relieve the city, and St Quentin was
                    stormed. The French retaliated by seizing Calais from England, and thence
                    advanced into Flanders, where they were again defeated in the bloody battle of
                    Gravelines. Both Philip II. and Henry II. were destitute of resources and wished
                    for peace; but Philip II. was the better diplomatist. The treaty of Cateau
                    Cambrésis in 1559 restored to him all that France had won by its long warfare
                    against Charles V. in Italy and the Netherlands.</p>
                <p>Thus Philip began his reign with glory, and Europe saw that Charles V. had no
                    unworthy successor. Yet Philip was not anxious for military glory. His finances
                    were embarrassed and he felt the need of a period of peace. For the purpose of
                    maintaining his political supremacy he proposed to continue his English alliance
                    by marrying Elizabeth when she succeeded Mary on the English throne. Elizabeth
                    did not at once reject the proposal; but she gradually entered upon a religious
                    policy which made marriage with Philip impossible. The Spanish king rapidly
                    changed his plans and cemented his alliance with France by a union (24th June
                    1559) with Isabella, daughter of Henry II. He made arrangements for the
                    government of the Netherlands, and at the end of 1559 returned to Spain, where
                    he remained for the rest of his life.</p>
                <p>The policy of Philip was steadily directed towards welding his dominions together
                    in dependence on himself and extending his influence over Europe. The power of
                    Charles V. had had no definite centre. The emperor had recognized the claims of
                    his separate dominions upon him, and had striven to be neither German, Spanish,
                    Flemish, nor Italian. Philip identified himself entirely with Spain. Castile was
                    to be the seat of his monarchy, and that monarchy was to be absolute. He was
                    devoted to Catholicism, and during his reign superseded the pope as the head of
                    the Catholic party in Europe. But the interests of Catholicism were in his mind
                    identified with his own personal interests, and under the cover of zeal for the
                    church he pursued the aggrandizement of Spain. In Spain itself his care for the
                    maintenance of the Catholic faith accorded with the temper of the people. The
                    long continuance of war against the Moors had identified orthodoxy with purity
                    of race, and heresy was regarded as a taint in the blood. The rigour of the
                    Inquisition preserved the national honour; the auto-da-fé was a means of ridding
                    the land of dangerous elements. This uncompromising spirit of Spain in religious
                    matters its king wished to extend to the rest of his dominions.</p>
                <p>Philip had none of his father’s personal activity. Though his mind was always
                    engaged in the business of the state, he did not care for the excitement of
                    personal conflict. He was no warrior, and never took the field. He felt himself
                    best qualified to direct his policy from afar. He was resolved to make the
                    fullest use of others, yet to keep the guidance of affairs in his own hands. He
                    increased the number of councils for the management of the business of the
                    different provinces of his realm, and in these councils natives of the various
                    provinces had seats. But the general direction of affairs was in the hands of a
                    privy council, entirely composed of Spaniards. At first this council consisted
                    chiefly of the members of Philip’s household, the men whom he had known in early
                    days. Foremost amongst them were the duke of Alva and Ruy Gomez do Silva, prince
                    of Eboli. Alva was a general, Gomez a courtier, and the two men were in
                    permanent opposition. This exactly suited Philip’s views. He was never present
                    in person at the sittings of the council. All questions on which he wished for
                    its opinion were reduced to writing and laid before it. Its recommendations were
                    similarly submitted to the king in writing. There was no initiative except by
                    his pleasure, no decision which was not due to his personal approval. He gained
                    all the advantages of opposing views amongst his ministers without identifying
                    himself with any. No minister could become a necessity to him, and he could
                    withdraw his favour at will. Philip’s regents and ministers in the several
                    provinces had large authority, but were never allowed to forget their dependence
                    on the central power. Every land was submissive except the Netherlands, where
                    the nobles resented their exclusion from the government, and saw with alarm the
                    steady advance of Philip’s system. A new ecclesiastical organization increased
                    the number of bishops, who were all dependent on the king, and diminished the
                    revenues of the monasteries, which furnished provisions for the younger members
                    of the noble families. The introduction of the Spanish Inquisition threatened to
                    destroy entirely the political importance of the nobles. In the general
                    discontent the Protestant feeling of the towns made common cause with the
                    national jealousy of the nobles. A strong opposition was formed, and in 1566 the
                    Netherlands were in revolt. For a time Philip wavered between a policy of
                    conciliation and a policy of repression. At last he listened to the advice of
                    the duke of Alva, and sent him to reduce the rebels. Alva treated the revolted
                    provinces with merciless severity; he crushed, but he could not subdue. The
                    Netherlands were still unpacified, while Alva’s cruelty destroyed their
                    commerce. Their wealth had been the chief source of revenue to Charles V.;
                    Philip II. no longer found it flow into his coffers. For seven years Alva
                    resolutely tried his policy of repression; but the spirit of the Netherlands
                    remained unbroken, and round their slumbering revolt all the enemies of the
                    Spanish monarchy began to gather. Alva was recalled and fell into disgrace. A
                    more pacific successor, Don Luis de Requesens, was sent to try a more
                    conciliatory policy.</p>
                <p>In domestic life, meanwhile, Philip was unhappy. His son Don Carlos developed an
                    ungovernable temper, and did not hesitate to condemn his father’s caution as
                    unworthy of the traditions of his house. He wished to distinguish himself, and
                    was on the point of quitting <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n778/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0778-0745"/> Spain when his father, as a measure of
                    precaution, had him imprisoned. In prison Don Carlos yielded to sullen despair,
                    and gave way to excesses, which Philip did not try to check. In consequence of
                    this unwholesome life Don Carlos died in 1568, and it was a bitter blow to the
                    haughty king to inform foreign princes of the facts. It would seem that Philip
                    was glad to be rid of one whom he could not manage; he did not hasten the death
                    of Don Carlos, but he took no steps to prevent it. A few months later died Queen
                    Isabella, leaving Philip without a male heir. In 1570 he married his fourth
                    wife, Anne of Austria, his niece, who died in 1580. Only one of her sons
                    survived to manhood, and he succeeded his father as Philip III.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the hopes of Spain were fixed on Philip’s halfbrother, Don John of
                    Austria, who first showed his military skill by putting down a serious revolt of
                    the Moriscos in the Alpuxarras, and was then sent to command the Spanish fleet
                    in the joint expedition of the Mediterranean powers against the Turk. He
                    commanded at the decisive battle of Lepanto in 1571, which stemmed the tide of
                    Turkish conquest. Brave and ambitious, Don John longed for a kingdom, and
                    offered to undertake the conquest of the African coast. But Philip did not wish
                    his brother togain too much military glory. He sent him in 1576 to succeed
                    Requesens in the Netherlands. Don John was full of great schemes,—to pacify the
                    Netherlands, invade England, release Mary Queen of Scots, and become her
                    husband. But the Spanish treasury was exhausted. Philip would send no more
                    supplies, and left Don John to temporize with the Netherlander, a task for which
                    he was entirely unfit. Overwhelmed with disappointment and the sense of failure,
                    Don John died in 1578, leaving the work which he could not accomplish to be
                    undertaken by the patient genius of Alexander Farnese.</p>
                <p>Don John had had the art of impressing his great schemes on those around him. He
                    sent his secretary, Escovedo, to urge his wishes on Philip, whose jealous mind
                    was filled with suspicion. Escovedo awakened the personal dislike of Antonio
                    Perez, and was murdered by that minister’s instrumentality (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Perez).</hi> The fall of the old parties in the council brought
                    forward new men and inaugurated a new policy. Cardinal Granvella, Juan Idiaquez,
                    and Christoval de Moura became the king’s chief advisers. They were men who
                    depended solely on his favour, and were not connected with the old nobility of
                    Castile. Hitherto Philip’s policy had been in the main pacific. He had aimed at
                    the internal consolidation of the monarchy, and had striven by every means to
                    overcome the revolt of the Netherlands. But the resolute temper of the
                    Netherlanders was encouraged by hopes of foreign help. England, France, and even
                    Austria in turn displayed their jealousy of Philip’s power by helping to keep
                    alive the insurrection. Round the revolt of the Netherlands centred the chief
                    questions of European politics. Philip at length determined to make the
                    subjection of the rebellious provinces part of a great scheme to extend the
                    power of Spain over Europe. In the second period of his reign he came forward as
                    tha disturber of European peace, determined to reduce western Christendom to
                    religious unity under his own rule. He interfered in the internal politics of
                    eveτy country and seized on every opportunity for pursuing his own schemes. His
                    first step in the career of aggrandizement was taken in 1580 by the reduction of
                    Portugal, when he claimed the vacant crown by right of his mother. The duke of
                    Alva overran the country before any other power had time to interfere. The last
                    of the great Spanish nobles, who had already felt the weight of the king’s
                    displeasure, was still a willing instrument in extending the royal despotism.
                    Philip succeeded in impressing on Spain an unreasoning loyalty, which took the
                    place of its old chivalrous patriotism. In the Netherlands he put William of
                    Orange under the ban, and the assassination of William was the first sign of the
                    fanatical bitterness which Philip was ready to encourage and to use. In France
                    he resolved to check the power of the court and obtain an influence over French
                    affairs. The strongly Catholic party resented the favour shown by Henry III. to
                    the Huguenots, and was anxious about the succession to the crown. Headed by the
                    Guises, they formed a league with Philip in January 1585, which plunged France
                    into long and bitter warfare. The rapid advance of the League in France and the
                    successes of Alexander Farnese in the Netherlands awakened the alarm of England.
                    Troops were sent to the Netherlands, and the English privateers redoubled their
                    attacks upon the treasure-ships of the Indies in the Spanish Main. Resolved to
                    remove all hindrances from his path, Philip undertook the reduction of England.
                    He trusted to the strength of the Spanish navy, the military skill of Alexander
                    Farnese, and the discontent of the English Catholics. In 1588 the French king
                    had become a mere instrument of the League, and Philip sent against England the
                    “Invincible Armada.” Its failure involved the failure of all his schemes, though
                    this fact was not at first obvious. Philip bore his loss with resignation. “I
                    sent my ships,” he said, “against men, not against the billows. I thank God that
                    I can place another fleet upon the sea.” But he was never able to renew his
                    attack upon England. The murder of Henry III. of France raised the question of
                    the succession to the French crown, and Philip’s protectorate over the titular
                    Charles X. was admitted. On the death of Charles the Catholic party were willing
                    to recognize Philip’s daughter Isabella as their queen. But the resolute bearing
                    of Henry of Navarre kindled anew the national feeling, and the discussions about
                    Isabella’s future husband brought political questions into the foreground and
                    weakened the cohesion of the League. The death of Alexander Farnese in 1592
                    deprived Philip of the great general who alone could hold in check Henry of
                    Navarre, and Henry’s change of religion and absolution by the pope in 1593 did
                    much to remove the religious difficulty to his recognition by all parties in
                    France. Philip’s schemes for a general European ascendency entirely failed. He
                    could not even recover the Netherlands for the Spanish monarchy. The northern
                    provinces, banded together as the United Netherlands, made good their
                    independence. The southern provinces returned to their obedience, but were ceded
                    by Philip to his daughter Isabella and her husband Albert of Austria. The
                    English cruisers became more and more dangerous in the Spanish Main, and in 1596
                    the English fleet sacked Cadiz. Philip H.’s reign ended in general failure. His
                    resources were exhausted, and in 1597 he repudiated his debts. His economic
                    policy was disastrous. He checked commerce by unwise taxes, trusted unduly to
                    the wealth of the Indies, and encouraged the indolent haughtiness of the
                    Castilians. He raised Spain to a high position, but left it with a ruinous
                    system of government, which could only end in financial decay. Yet he was
                    resolute and persevering to the end. He bore w ith constancy a painful and
                    lingering illness, and his last words were, “I die like a good Catholic, in
                    faith and obedience to the Holy Roman Church.” But he knew that he left a feeble
                    successor. His jealous temper showed itself in the narrow education and secluded
                    fife which he prescribed for his son, and thereby intensified the boy’s natural
                    timidity. “God has* not been pleased,” he sadly said at the last, “to grant me a
                    successor capable of ruling my great realm.” He died at the Escorial in
                    September 1598.</p>

                    solitude of the Guadarrama hills. The mighty mass of buildings contained a
                    monastery, a burying-ρlace for the royal house, and a palace for the king. It
                    was built in consequence of a vow made at the battle of St Quentin. The battle
                    was fought on St Lawrence’s day 1557, and this fact was commemorated by
                    arranging the building in the form of a gridiron. The cloister of the monastery
                    supplied the bars, and the royal palace projected like the handle. Philip loved
                    solitude. It harmonized with his habits of quiet industry. He governed his
                    dominions by means of despatches, as a merchant seated in his office transacts
                    commercial business in different quarters of the globe. All that could be done
                    by patient industry, without political insight, Philip II. did. His strength lay
                    in his steady persistency. During his reign he was the foremost figure in
                    European history, but the only work which he accomplished was the formation of
                    the Spanish character into the definite shape in which it influenced European
                    culture.</p>
