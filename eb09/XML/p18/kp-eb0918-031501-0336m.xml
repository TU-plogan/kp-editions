                    case he cannot have been born before 519; but, in the absence of evidence that
                    any such meeting took place, it is reasonable to regard this as one of Plato’s
                    many anachronisms. However this may be, Parmenides was a contemporary, perhaps a
                    somewhat younger contemporary, of Heraclitus, with whom the first succession of
                    physicists ended; while Anaxagoras and Empedocles, with whom the second
                    succession of physicists began, as well as Protagoras, the earliest of those
                    humanists whose rejection of physical research prepared the way for the Platonic
                    metaphysic, were very decidedly his juniors. Belonging, it is said, to a rich
                    and distinguished family, Parmenides attached himself, at any rate for a time,
                    to the aristocratic society or brotherhood which Pythagoras had established at
                    Croton; and accordingly one part of his system, the physical part, is apparently
                    Pythagorean. To Xenophanes, the founder of Eleaticism,—whom he must have known,
                    even if he was never in any strict sense of the word his disciple,—Parmenides
                    was, perhaps, more deeply indebted, as the theological speculations of that
                    thinker unquestionably suggested to him the theory of Being and Not-Being, of
                    the One and the Many, by which he sought to reconcile Ionian monism with
                    Italiote dualism. Tradition relates that Parmenides framed laws for the Eleates,
                    who each year took an oath to observe them.</p>
                <p>Parmenides embodied his tenets in a short poem called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nature,</hi> of which fragments, amounting in all to about a hundred and sixty
                    lines, have been preserved in the writings of Sextus Empiricus, Simplicius, and
                    others. <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> is traditionally divided into three
                    parts—the * <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> Proem,” “Truth” (τα τrpoς dλι)0∈ιαv),
                    and “Opinion” (τα <hi rend="italic">τrpoς</hi><hi rend="italic">δόξαν).</hi> In
                    “Truth,” starting from the formula “the Ent (or existent) is, the Nonent (or
                    non-existent) is not,” Parmenides attempted to distinguish between the unity or
                    universal element of nature and its variety or particularity, insisting upon the
                    reality of its unity, which is therefore the object of knowledge, and upon the
                    unreality of its variety, which is therefore the object, not of knowledge, but
                    of opinion. In “Opinion” he propounded a theory of the world of seeming and its
                    development, pointing out, however, that, in accordance with the principles
                    already laid down, these cosmological speculations do not pretend to anything
                    more than probability. In spite of the contemptuous remarks of Cicero and
                    Plutarch about Parmenides’s versification, <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> is not
                    without literary merit. The introduction, though rugged, is forcible and
                    picturesque; and the rest of the poem is written in a simple and effective style
                    suitable to the subject. It is, however, a summary rather than an exposition,
                    and its brevity sometimes leads to obscurity. Partly for this reason, but partly
                    also in consequence of the mutilations and the corruptions of the text, the
                    interpretation of the system which <hi rend="italic">Nature</hi> represents
                    early became a matter of controversy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“Proem.</hi> ”—In the “Proem” the poet describes his journey
                    from darkness to light. Borne in a whirling chariot, and attended by the
                    daughters of the Sun, he reaches a temple sacred to an unnamed goddess
                    (variously identified by the commentators with Nature, Wisdom, or Themis), by
                    whom the rest of the poem is spoken. He must learn all things, she tells him,
                    both truth, which is certain, and human opinions; for, though in human opinions
                    there can be no confidence, they must be studied notwithstanding for what they
                    are worth.</p>

                    There are three ways of research, and three ways only. Of these, one asserts the
                    non-existence of the existent and the existence of the non-existent <hi
                    rend="italic">[i.e.</hi>, Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes suppose the single
                    element which they respectively postulate to be transformed into the various
                    sorts of matter which they discover in the world around them, thus assuming the
                    non-existence of that which is elemental and the existence of that which is
                    non-elemental]; another, pursued by “restless” persons, whose “road returns upon
                    itself,” assumes that a thing “is and is not,” “is the same and not the same”
                    [an obvious reference, as Bernays points out in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rheinisches</hi><hi rend="italic">Museum,</hi> vii. 114 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.,</hi> to Heraclitus, the philosopher of flux]. These are ways of error,
                    because they confound existence and non-existence. In contrast to them the way
                    of truth starts from the proposition that “the Ent is, the Nonent is not.”</p>
                <p>On the strength of the fundamental distinction between the Ent and the Nonent,
                    the goddess next announces certain characteristics of the former. The Ent is
                    uncreated, for it cannot be derived either from the Ent or from the Nonent; it
                    is imperishable, for it cannot pass into the Nonent; it is whole, indivisible,
                    continuous, for nothing exists to break its continuity in space; it is
                    unchangable [for nothing exists to break its continuity in time]; it is perfect,
                    for there is nothing which it can want; it never was, nor will be, but only is;
                    it is evenly extended in every direction, and therefore a sphere, exactly
                    balanced; it is identical with thought <hi rend="italic">[he.,</hi> it is the
                    object, and the sole object, of thought as opposed to sensation, sensation being
                    concerned with variety and change].</p>
                <p>As then the Ent is one, invariable, and immutable, all plurality, variety, and
                    mutation belong to the Nonent. Whence it follows that all the states and
                    processes which we commonly recognize — generation and destruction, being and
                    not-being [predicated of things], change of place, alteration of colour, and the
                    like—are no more than empty words.</p>

                    throughout time, which reason discovers beneath the variety and the mutability
                    of things] being now complete, it remains in “Opinion” to describe the plurality
                    of things, not as they are, for they are not, but as they seem to be. In the
                    phenomenal world then, there are, it has been thought [and Parmenides accepts
                    the theory, which appears to be of Pythagorean origin], two primary
                    elements—namely, fire, which is gentle, thin, homogeneous, and night [or earth],
                    which is dark, thick, heavy. Of these elements [which, according to Aristotle,
                    were, or rather were analogous to, the Ent and the Nonent respectively] all
                    things consist, and from them they derive their several characteristics. The
                    foundation for a cosmology having thus been laid in dualism, the poem went on to
                    describe the generation of “earth, and sun, and moon, and air that is common to
                    all, and the milky way, and furthest Olympus, and the glowing stars”; but the
                    scanty fragments which have survived suffice only to show that Parmenides
                    regarded the universe as a series of concentric rings or spheres composed of the
                    two primary elements and of combinations of them, the whole system being
                    directed by an unnamed goddess established at its centre. Next came a theory of
                    animal development. This again was followed by a psychology, which made mind
                    depend upon bodily structure, thought [as well as sensation, which was conceived
                    to differ from thought only in respect of its object] being the excess of the
                    one or the other of the two constituent elements, fire and night. “Such, opinion
                    tells us, was the generation, such is the present existence, such will be the
                    end, of those things to which men have given distinguishing names.”</p>

                    >μeταξv τι,</hi> it is air, it is fire. Thus, while their question meant, or

                    apparent plurality of the material world? their answers, Parmenides conceived,
                    by attributing to the selected element various and varying qualities,
                    reintroduced the plurality which the question sought to eliminate. If we would
                    discover that which is common to all things at all times, we must, he submitted,
                    exclude the differences of things, whether simultaneous or successive. Hence,
                    whereas his predecessors had confounded that which is universally existent with
                    that which is not universally existent, he proposed to distinguish carefully
                    between that which is universally existent and that which is not universally
                    existent, between <hi rend="italic">5ν</hi> and <hi rend="italic">μη Sν.</hi>
                    The fundamental truism is the epigrammatic assertion of this distinction.</p>
                <p>In short, the single corporeal element of the Ionian physicists was, to borrow a
                    phrase .from Aristotle, a permanent ουσία having <hi rend="italic">πάθη</hi>
                    which change; but they either neglected the <hi rend="italic">πάθη</hi> or
                    confounded them with the ουσία. Parmenides sought to reduce the variety of
                    nature to a single corporeal element; but he strictly discriminated the
                    inconstant <hi rend="italic">πάθη</hi> from the constant ουσία, and,
                    understanding by “existence” universal, invariable, immutable being, refused to
                    attribute to the <hi rend="italic">πάθη</hi> anything more than the semblance of
                    existence.</p>
                <p>Having thus discriminated between the permanent unity of nature and its
                    superficial plurality, Parmenides proceeded to the separate investigation of the
                    Ent and the Nonent. The universality of the Ent, he conceived, necessarily
                    carries with it certain characteristics. It is one; it is eternal; it is whole
                    and continuous, both in time and in space; it is immovable and immutable; it is
                    limited, but limited only by itself; it is evenly extended in every direction,
                    and therefore spherical. These propositions having been reached, apart from
                    particular experience, by reflexion upon the fundamental principle, we have in
                    them, Parmenides conceived, a body of information resting upon a firm basis and
                    entitled to be called “truth.” Further, the information thus obtained is the sum
                    total of “truth;” for, as “existence” in the strict sense of the word cannot be
                    attributed to anything besides the universal element, so nothing besides the
                    universal element can properly be said to be “known.”</p>
                <p>If Parmenides’s poem had had “Being” for its subject, it would doubtless have
                    ended at this point. Its subject is, however, “Nature”; and nature, besides its
                    unity, has also the semblance, if no more than the semblance, of plurality.
                    Hence the theory of the unity of nature is necessarily followed by a theory of
                    its seeming plurality, that is to say, of the variety and mutation of things.
                    The theory of plurality cannot indeed pretend to the certainty of the theory of
                    unity, being of necessity untrustworthy, because it is the partial and
                    inconstant representation of that which is partial and inconstant in nature.
                    But, as the material world includes, together with a real unity, the semblance
                    of plurality, so the theory of the material world includes, together with the
                    certain theory of the former, a probable theory of the latter. “Opinion” is then
                    no mere excrescence; it is the necessary sequel to “Truth.”</p>
                <p>Thus, whereas the Ionians, confounding the unity and the plurality of the
                    universe, had neglected plurality, and the Pythagoreans, contenting themselves
                    with the reduction of the variety of nature to a duality or a series of
                    dualities, had neglected unity, Parmenides, taking a hint from Xenophanes, made
                    the antagonistic doctrines supply one another’s deficiencies; for, as Xenophanes
                    in his theological system had recognized at once the unity of God and the
                    plurality of things, so Parmenides in his system of nature recognized at once
                    the rational unity of the Ent and the phenomenal plurality of the Nonent.</p>
                <p>The foregoing statement of Parmenides’s position differs from Zeller’s account of
                    it in two important particulars. First, whereas it has been assumed above that
                    Xenophanes was theologian rather than philosopher, whence it would seem to
                    follow that the philosophical doctrine of unity originated, not with him, but
                    with Parmenides, Zeller, supposing Xenophanes to have taught, not merely the
                    unity of God, but also the unity of Being, assigns to Parmenides no more than an
                    exacter conception of the doctrine of the unity of Being, the justification of
                    that doctrine, and the denial of the plurality and the mutability of things.
                    This view of the relations of Xenophanes and Parmenides is hardly borne out by
                    their writings; and, though ancient authorities may be quoted in its favour, it
                    would seem that in this case as in others they have fallen into the easy mistake
                    of confounding successive phases of doctrine, “construing the utterances of the
                    master in accordance with the principles of his scholar—the vague by the more
                    definite, the simpler by the more finished and elaborate theory” (W. H.
                    Thompson). Secondly, whereas it has been argued above that “Opinion” is
                    necessarily included in the system, Zeller, supposing Parmenides to deny the
                    Nonent even as a matter of opinion, regards that part of the poem wffiich has
                    opinion for its subject as no more than a revised and improved statement of the
                    views of opponents, introduced in order that the reader, having before him the
                    false doctrine as well as the true one, may be led the more certainly to embrace
                    the latter. In the judgment of the present writer, Parmenides, while he denied
                    the real existence of plurality, recognized its apparent existence, and
                    consequently, however little value he might attach to opinion, was bound to take
                    account of it: “pour celui même qui nie l’existence réelle de la nature,” says
                    Renouvier, “il reste encore à faire une histoire naturelle de l’apparence et de
                    l’illusion.”</p>
                <p>The teaching of Parmenides variously influenced both his immediate successors and
                    subsequent thinkers. By his recognition of an apparent plurality supplementary
                    to the real unity, he effected the transition from the monism of the first
                    physical succession to the pluralism of the second. While Empedocles and
                    Democritus are careful to emphasize their dissent from “Truth,” it is obvious
                    that “Opinion” is the basis of their cosmologies. The doctrine of the
                    deceitfulness of “the undiscerning eye and the echoing ear” soon established
                    itself, though the grounds upon which Anaxagoras, Empedocles, and Democritus
                    maintained it were not those which were alleged by Parmenides. Indirectly,
                    through the dialectic of his pupil and friend Zeno and otherwise, the doctrine
                    of the inadequacy of sensation led to the humanist movement, Λvhich for a time
                    threatened to put an end to philosophical and scientific speculation. But the
                    positive influence of Parmenides’s teaching was not yet exhausted. To say that
                    the Platonism of Plato’s later years, the Platonism of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parmenides,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Philebus,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Timaeus,</hi> is the philosophy of Parmenides enlarged and reconstituted, may
                    perhaps seem paradoxical in the face of the severe criticism to which Eleaticism
                    is subjected, not only in the <hi rend="italic">Parmenides,</hi> but also in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Sophist.</hi> The criticism was, however, preparatory to a
                    reconstruction. Thus may be explained the selection of an Eleatic stranger to be
                    the chief speaker in the latter, and of Parmenides himself to take the lead in
                    the former. In the <hi rend="italic">Sophist</hi> criticism predominates over

                    in attributing (as he certainly did) to the fundamental unity extension and
                    sphericity, so that “the worshipped <hi rend="italic">3ν</hi> is after all a

                    Eleaticism being here represented by Zeno, its spirit, as Plato conceived it, by
                    Parmenides. Not the least important of the results obtained in this dialogue is
                    the discovery that, whereas the doctrine of the “one” and the “many” is suicidal
                    and barren so long as the “solitary one” and the “indefinitely many” <hi
                    rend="italic">are</hi> absolutely separated (137 C <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>
                    and 163 B <hi rend="italic">sqf,</hi> it becomes consistent and fruitful as soon
                    as a “definite plurality” is interpolated between them (142 B <hi rend="italic"

                    In short, Parmenides was no idealist, but Plato recognized in him, and rightly,
                    the precursor of idealism.</p>
