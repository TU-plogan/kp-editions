                <p><label type="entry">PEACOCK</label> (the first syllable from the Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">Pavo,</hi> in Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic">Pawe,</hi> Dutch <hi
                    rend="italic">Pauuw,</hi> German <hi rend="italic">Pfau,</hi> French <hi
                    rend="italic">Paon),</hi> the bird so well known from the splendid plumage of
                    the male, and as the proverbial personification of pride. A native of the Indian
                    peninsula and Ceylon, in some parts of which it is very abundant, its
                    domestication dates from times so remote that nothing can be positively stated
                    on that score. Setting aside its importation to Palestine by Solomon (1 Kings x.
                    22; 2 Chron. ix. 21), its assignment in classical mythology as the favourite
                    bird of Hera or Juno testifies to the early acquaintance the Greeks must have
                    had with it; but, though it is mentioned by Aristophanes and other older
                    writers, their knowledge of it was probably very slight until after the
                    conquests of Alexander. Throughout all succeeding time, however, it has never
                    very freely rendered itself to domestication, and, retaining much of its wild
                    character, can hardly be accounted an inhabitant of the poultry-yard, but rather
                    an ornamental denizen of the pleasure-ground or shrubbery; while, even in this
                    condition, it is seldom kept in large numbers, for it has a bad reputation for
                    doing mischief in gardens, it is not very prolific, and, though in earlier days
                    highly esteemed for the table,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Classical authors contain many allusions to its high
                    appreciation at the most sumptuous banquets; and mediaeval bills of fare on
                    state occasions nearly always include it. In the days of chivalry one of the
                    most solemn oaths was taken “on the Peacock ”, which seems to have been served
                    up garnished with its gaudy plumage.</p></note> it is no longer considered the
                    delicacy it was once thought.</p>
                <p>As in most cases of domestic animals, pied or white varieties of the ordinary
                    Peacock, <hi rend="italic">Pavo</hi><hi rend="italic">cristatus,</hi> are not
                    unfrequently to be seen; and, though lacking in proportion the gorgeous
                    resplendence for which the common bird stands unsurpassed, they are valued as
                    curiosities. Greater interest, however, attends what is known as the “japanned”
                    Peacock, often erroneously named the Japanese or Japan Peacock, a form which has
                    received the name of <hi rend="italic">P. nigripennis,</hi> as though it were a
                    distinct species. In this form the cock, besides other less conspicuous
                    differences, has all the upper wing-coverts of a deep lustrous blue instead of
                    being mottled with brown and white, while the hen is of a more or less
                    greyish-white, deeply tinged with dull yellowish-brown near the base of the neck
                    and shoulders. It “breeds true”; but occasionally a presumably pure stock of
                    birds of the usual coloration throws out one or more having the “japanned”
                    plumage, leading to the conclusion that the latter may be due to “reversion to a
                    primordial and otherwise extinct condition of the species ”, and it is to be
                    observed that the “japanned” male has in the coloration of the parts mentioned
                    no little resemblance to that of the second indubitably good species, the <hi
                    rend="italic">P. muticus</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">P. spicifer</hi> of some
                    writers) of Burma and Java, though the character of the latter’s crest—the
                    feathers of which are barbed along their whole length instead of at the tip
                    only—and its golden-green neck and breast furnish a ready means of distinction.
                    The late Sir R. Heron was confident that the “japanned” breed had arisen in
                    England within his memory,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This is probably not the case. The present writer has a distinct
                    recollection of having seen a bird of this form represented in an old Dutch
                    picture, though when or where he cannot state.</p></note> and Darwin <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anim. and Plants under Domestication,</hi> i. pp. 290-292) was
                    inclined to believe it only a variety; but its abrupt appearance, which rests on
                    indisputable evidence, is most suggestive in the light that it may one day throw
                    on the question of evolution as exhibited in the origin of “species ”. It should
                    be stated that the “japanned” bird is not known to exist anywhere as a wild
                    race. The accompanying woodcut is copied from a plate drawn by Mr Wolf, given in
                    Mr Elliot’s <hi rend="italic">Monograph of the Phasianidae.</hi></p>
                <p>The Peafowls belong to the group <hi rend="italic">Gallinae,</hi> from the normal
                    members of which they do not materially differ in structure; and, though by some
                    systematists they are raised to the rank of a Family, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pavonidae,</hi> most are content to regard them as a Subfamily of <hi
                    rend="italic">Phasianidae</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(Pheasant,</hi> g <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>.u). Akin to the genus <hi rend="italic">Pavo</hi> is
                    <hi rend="italic">Poty-plectrτιm,</hi> of which the males are armed with two or
                    more spurs on each leg, and near them is generally placed the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Argusianus,</hi> containing the Argus-Pheasants, remarkable for
                    their wonderfully ocellated plumage, and the extraordinary length of the
                    secondary quills of their wings, as well as of the tail-feathers. It must always
                    be remembered that the so-called “tail” of the Peacock is formed not by the
                    rectrices or true tail-feathers, but by the singular development of the
                    tail-coverts, a fact of which any one may be satisfied by looking at the bird
                    when these magnificent plumes are erected and expanded in disk-like form as is
                    his habit when displaying his beauty to his mates. (A. N. )</p>
