                <p><label type="entry">PARAFFIN</label>. In the course of his classical
                    investigation on the tar produced in the dry distillation of wood, Reichenbach
                    in 1830 discovered in it, amongst many other things, a colourless wax-like solid
                    which he called paraffin <hi rend="italic">(parum affinis)</hi> because he found
                    it to be endowed with an extraordinary indifference towards all reagents. A few
                    years later he isolated from the same material a liquid oil chemically similar
                    to paraffin, to which he gave the name of <hi rend="italic">eupion (eυπiωv,</hi>
                    very fat). For many years both these bodies were known only as chemical
                    curiosities, and even scientific men looked upon them as things entirely <hi
                    rend="italic">sui generis</hi>; this was natural enough as far as paraffin is
                    concerned, but it is rather singular that it took so long before it was realized
                    that eupion or something very much like it forms the body of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Petroleum</hi><hi rend="italic">(g.v.),</hi> which had been
                    known, since the time of Herodotus at least, to well up abundantly from the
                    bowels of the earth in certain places. Though extensively known, it was used
                    only as an external medicinal agent, until the late Mr James Young conceived the
                    idea of industrially working a comparatively scanty oil-spring in Derbyshire,
                    and subsequently found that an oil similar to petroleum is obtained by the dry
                    distillation of cannel coal and similar materials at low temperatures. This
                    discovery developed into a grand industry, which may be said to have led to the
                    utilization of those immense natural stores of petroleum in America. Scientific
                    chemists naturally directed their attention to the products of these new
                    industries, and it was soon ascertained that solid paraffin and eupion, as well
                    as natural and artificial petroleum, are substantially more or less impure
                    mixtures of saturated hydrocarbons; and so it comes that, on the proposal of H.
                    Watts, the word paraffin in scientific chemistry has been adopted as a generic
                    term for this class of compounds of carbon and hydrogen.</p>
                <p>When the electric light is generated within an atmosphere of hydrogen, then, at
                    the immense temperature of the electric arc, part of the carbon of the charcoal
                    terminals unites with the hydrogen into acetylene gas, C <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, Apart from this isolated fact, which was
                    discovered by Berthelot in 1862, it might be said that the two elements are not
                    capable of uniting directly, although an innumerable variety of hydrocarbons
                    exist in nature, and can be produced artificially from organic substances.
                    Individual hydrocarbons may differ very much in their properties. At ordinary
                    temperature and pressure a few are gases; the majority present themselves as
                    liquids; not a few are solids. But the solids are fusible; and all liquid or
                    liquefied hydrocarbons, at a high enough temperature, volatilize, as a rule
                    without decomposition. To the latter circumstance to a great extent we owe our
                    precise knowledge of their chemical constitution.</p>
                <p>In all the numerous series of hydrocarbons the percentages of carbon vary from 75
                    (in marsh gas) to 94 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7 (in chrysene). Within this
                    narrow range of some 20 per cent, several dozens of elementary compositions have
                    to be accommodated; and many of these, to be represented in formulae C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> x</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, with an adequate degree
                    of precision, require formulae in which the coefficients <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> are so large that, by means of integers
                    less than these, any fancy composition (within our limits) may be expressed with
                    a degree of exactitude which is quite on a par with the analyses. But these
                    hydrocarbons, in general, can be volatilized into gases, and in regard to these
                    Avogadro’s law tells us that quantities proportional to the molecular weights
                    <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the weights represented by the true chemical
                    formulae) occupy the same volume. Hence, to find the true value, M = C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> x</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>,, of the formula as a
                    whole, we need only determine the vapour density, and from it calculate the
                    weight of the respective hydrocarbon which, as a gas at <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> a</hi> and P millimetres pressure,
                    occupies the same volume as, for instance, H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O
                    parts of steam. This is Μ. The elementary analysis enables us to calculate the
                    weight <hi rend="italic">x</hi> × C of carbon contained in Μ parts, and the
                    analysis must be very poor to leave us in doubt as to whether it is for instance
                    6 × 12 parts of carbon or 7 × 12 parts that we have to deal with. The reader
                    will now understand how it has been possible to ascertain the elementary
                    composition of all pure hydrocarbons with a degree of precision which goes
                    beyond that of the analysis, and to prove what analysis could never have done by
                    itself, namely, that there are numerous groups of hydrocarbons which have
                    absolutely identical elementary compositions,—cases of isomerism, as they are
                    called. We speak of " isomerism in the narrower sense” when the atomic formulae
                    are identical (there are, for instance, two hydrides of butyl, C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi>), while we speak of
                    “polymeric” bodies when the several formulae are integer multiples of the same
                    primitive group <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> ethylene, 2×CH <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and butylene, 4×CH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, are
                    polymers to one another).</p>
                <p>The following table gives an idea of the several classes of hydrocarbons which
                    for us come more particularly into consideration.</p>

                    with <hi rend="italic">n</hi> atoms of carbon. Instead of pointing out those
                    regularities, in regard to the atomic proportions in which carbon and hydrogen
                    can unite into compounds, which the table illustrates so forcibly, let us rather
                    state that the “benzols,” in opposition to all that stands to their left in the
                    table, are things of their own kind. In them six atoms of the carbon are most
                    firmly united (into a “ring,” as a certain theory says), and the rest are, so to
                    say, hooked on to the ring in a less intimate fashion. Thus benzol is (C <hi

                    from which one of the six hydrogen atoms has been removed, and in which the gap
                    left has been filled by a “methyl,” CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>:— <hi

                <p>But similarly two dehydrogenated benzols, C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi

                    firmly in such a manner that two carbon atoms of the one ring do sendee for the
                    two rings, and a double ring is formed firmly united by these two common
                    carbons, the four hydrogens of the original two benzols being away. This gives

                <p>Generally speaking, a hydrocarbon is the more volatile the less the number of
                    carbon atoms and the greater the number of hydrogen atoms in the molecule. Thus,
                    in the series of “paraffins,” CH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> (marsh gas) and C
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> (ethane) are gases,
                    C <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> (propane) and C
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> (butane) are very
                    volatile liquids, and C <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">
                    12</hi>, &lt;fcc., are liquids,—with higher and higher boiling points as we
                    ascend the series. From a certain value of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> upwards we
                    find ourselves amongst the paraffins proper, which are solids, more or less
                    easily fusible, but not, in general, volatile without decomposition. Benzol, C
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, and its
                    neighbouring homologues are volatile liquids. Naphthalene and anthracene are
                    crystalline solids, fusible at 79° ’ 2 and 180° C., and boiling at 217° and
                    above 300° C. respectively without decomposition.</p>
                <p>All hydrocarbons agree in this, that they are practically insoluble in water, but
                    more or less readily soluble (in general) in alcohol and in ether. They are all
                    combustible; the more readily volatile ones are inflammable. Any complete
                    combustion, of course, leads to the formation of only carbonic acid and water,
                    with evolution of a large amount of heat; but the mechanism of the process is
                    more or less complex. Naphthalene and anthracene remain undecomposed at a red
                    heat; only at the very high temperature of their flames, and by the co-operation
                    of the oxygen of the air, they are decomposed with large elimination of
                    charcoal; a similar, though less, stability is exhibited by the benzols. The
                    paraffins, on the other hand, are relatively unstable. Marsh gas, it is true,
                    stands a red heat; but, to pass to the other end of the series, the paraffins
                    proper, and also the higher liquid paraffins to some extent, even when being
                    distilled, and especially when distilled “under pressure,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> at higher temperatures than their natural boiling points, break up
                    into olefines and lower paraffins (Thorpe and John Young). Similar changes take
                    place when the vapours of paraffins are passed through red-hot tubes; only the
                    products formed then suffer deeper-going decomposition with formation of
                    hydrogen, marsh-gas, acetylene, ethylene, and charcoal, and, last not least,
                    benzols and naphthalene. To this latter fact the paraffins owe their pre-eminent
                    fitness as illuminating agents.</p>
                <p>When organoid minerals, such as cannel coal, shale, &amp;c., al·e subjected to
                    dry distillation, all the several classes of hydrocarbons are in general
                    produced at the same time; but, from what we have said it will be understood
                    that, even with the same material, the quantitative composition of the complex
                    vapour which comes out of the retort depends on the way in which the
                    distillation is being conducted. If we operate at the lowest practicable
                    temperature, comparatively little gas is produced, and in the condensible part
                    of the vapour the paraffins predominate largely; at a bright red heat, such as
                    is used in making coal gas, and especially if the vapours have to pass along
                    red-hot surfaces before they get into the condenser pipes, more gas is produced,
                    and the place of the liquid paraffins is taken by benzols. These latter,
                    however, are always accompanied by naphthalene, often also by anthracene, and
                    invariably by certain ternary benzol-derivatives, namely, by “phenols,” feebly
                    acid bodies containing hydroxyl groups, OH’s, where the corresponding
                    hydrocarbon bore plain hydrogens (ordinary phenol, C <hi rend="subscript">
                    6</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> (OH), derived from benzol, C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> H, is a representative
                    example), and, secondly, basic compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Of
                    the latter aniline and picoline— both C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 7</hi> N, but widely different in their properties —may be
                    quoted as examples. The gas produced in this case through the presence in it of
                    the vapour of higher hydrides, but especially of acetylene, C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and benzol is highly
                    luminous. Supposing now, as a third instance, the distillation to be conducted
                    at a white heat, and so that the primary vapour has to wind its way through a
                    spiral pipe kept at a bright red heat, the proportion of gas increases largely,
                    and there is an increased yield of retort charcoal; but the liquid hydrocarbons
                    of all classes almost vanish; the gas consists mainly of hydrogen, marsh gas,
                    carbonic oxide, and carbonic acid, and gives little light when kindled.</p>
                <p>The aim of the paraffin oil manufacturer is to produce the best possible
                    approximation to a mixture of paraffins, wherefore he conducts his distillation
                    at the lowest working temperature. Of course his paraffin mixture contains more
                    or less of the other classes of bodies referred to, whose removal, however,
                    offers no great difficulty. In the laboratory we should commence by shaking the
                    crude oil with caustic alkali ley, which withdraws the phenols and other acid
                    bodies, as part of a lower layer, the upper being purified oil. By shaking the
                    latter with dilute sulphuric acid the bases are removed as a solution of their
                    sulphates, and a still purer oil results. Application of concentrated sulphuric
                    acid to the latter removes part at least of the benzols and olefines as
                    sulpho-acids, and also of the phenols and all the bases, should the two
                    preceding operations have been omitted. But the most thorough mode of getting
                    quit of the benzols and their derivatives is —after having exhausted the milder
                    agents—to shake the oil with first aqueous and then stronger and stronger nitric
                    acid, which reagent converts the benzol-bodies into nitroproducts, soluble in
                    the acid, or removable, after separation of the acid layer, by aqueous alkali.
                    By all these tortures the paraffins—being what the name implies—are not much
                    affected, so that what ultimately survives all belongs to their family. The
                    separation of the individual paraffins from one another is a very difficult
                    problem which has not yet found a satisfactory solution. What we know of
                    individual paraffins is derived chiefly from the investigation of decompositions
                    of pure chemical substances leading to the formation of that one paraffin
                    principally if not solely. To split up a mixture of paraffins approximately the
                    only known method is fractional distillation (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Distillation,</hi> vol. vii. p. 260), preferably by means of an apparatus so
                    constructed that the vapour, before reaching the condenser, ascends through an
                    intermediate inverted condenser or still-head, and there suffers partial
                    condensation at some suitable temperature (enforced in the most perfect form of
                    the apparatus by an oil-bath surrounding the stillhead). In this latter case,
                    singularly—not as a matter of course by any means—what goes over boils very
                    nearly at the temperature of the still-head. This particular form of the method
                    therefore lends itself chiefly for the final purification of an unitary
                    substance of known boiling point already purified by preceding distillations.
                    With mixtures of unknown composition the process is very tedious, and may assume
                    something like this form.</p>
                <p>We distil the substance (slowly and with ample chance of partial condensation)
                    and collect as separate fractions what came over at, for instance, 100° to 105°,
                    105° to 110°, 110° to 115°, &lt;fcc., as I., II., III., IV., &amp;c. Each of
                    these when redistilled yields I. and II. and III. and IV., <hi rend="italic"
                    >iιc.,</hi> which parts are poured into the respective receptacles, and on this
                    principle we continue working. If the substance happens to be of comparatively
                    simple composition, it usually turns out, after a while, that (say) the two
                    fractions II. and VI. increase while the rest get less and less; and by working
                    on we may be able to isolate two bodies of the constant boiling points <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 6</hi> respectively, with formation of
                    “tails” of other boiling points. Unfortunately, even a constant boiling point is
                    no proof of chemical purity; and, if a constant-boiling substance is a <pb

                    the difficulty.</p>

                <p>Probably all the paraffins enumerated in the table are present in paraffin oil
                    and in petroleum; those marked * have been actually found in the one or the
                    other. The solid paraffins are not known as unitary chemical substances; no
                    chemist as yet has succeeded in splitting up solid paraffin into its proximate
                    components. The manufacturer, in regard to the liquid paraffins even, does not
                    trouble himself with the isolation of chemical species; he contents himself with
                    splitting up his oil into fractions corresponding to certain ranges of boiling
                    point, and consequently adapted to certain practical applications. But even the
                    boiling point is not much heeded industrially; the several kinds of oil are
                    defined by their specific gravity at 60° F., which, as experience shows,
                    increases as the boiling point rises. But it is as well here to point out that
                    the same (initial) boiling point even, and in a much higher degree the same
                    specific gravity, may be exhibited by oils of widely different proximate
                    composition. Hence a relatively (and in a sense sufficiently) high specific
                    gravity is no guarantee against dangerous inflammability; the degree of
                    inflammability in an oil must be—and in practice always is being—determined by
                    direct experiment. For this purpose it is not sufficient to heat a sample oil in
                    an open vessel gradually to higher and higher temperatures, and to note the
                    temperature at which the atmosphere over the oil proves inflammable when a
                    lighted taper is brought in contact with it. By this method (which formerly was
                    the universally recognized test) the most varying results may be obtained with
                    the same oil. Far more trustworthy is the close test first proposed by Keates
                    about 1870, the principle of which is to heat the oil within a close vessel
                    which is opened only from time to time to apply a light to its atmosphere. For
                    the execution of this test many varieties of apparatus have been proposed. That
                    adopted by Abel, and now (1884) legally recognized in Great Britain, is made of
                    sheet copper, the exact thickness of which is prescribed for every part. The oil
                    is placed in a close cup, suspended in an air-bath, which latter is heated by
                    immersion in a warmwater bath, provided with an air-jacket. The top of the oil
                    cup is pierced with three circular orifices, one in the centre for trying the
                    best flame, and two smaller lateral holes for admitting air at the dose of each
                    trial. The holes are covered by a slide so contrived that when the central hole
                    has become almost uncovered the lateral ones are also open. The slide carries a
                    small colza-oil lamp suspended on trunnions, having a flame of a prescribed
                    size. A pendulum two feet in length vibrates in front of the observer, who, in
                    testing, withdraws the slide slowly during three vibrations, tilts the lamp to
                    bring its flame in contact with the atmosphere of the vessel, and quickly shuts
                    the slide during the fourth vibration. To execute a test the oil at about 60° F.
                    is placed in the cup, which is immersed in the water-bath having water of 130°
                    F. A thermometer plunged into the oil and another in the water-bath indicate
                    their temperatures. When the oil has approached its presumable flashing point,
                    trials are made at each rise of 1° F. in the temperature of the oil. The lowest
                    temperature at which the atmosphere of the cup inflames is the flashing point of
                    the oil tested. The legal minimum flashing point of burning oil by the close
                    test is 75° F., corresponding to about 100°F. by the obsolete open test.</p>
                <p>The variety of mixed paraffins which the oil-distiller produces may be arranged
                    under the following heads :— (1) oils too volatile to be available for domestic
                    illumination, serving chiefly as solvents; (2) burning oils, as required for
                    house lamps; (3) oils of very high boiling point, available, and used chiefly,
                    for lubricating purposes; (4) solid paraffin.</p>
                <p>The products of the second class have long come to practically supersede the
                    colza oil which used to be the illuminating oil <hi rend="italic">par
                    excellence.</hi> Over it they offer the advantages of greater cheapness and of
                    giving, weight for weight, more light. But their drawbacks are that, however
                    carefully refined they may be, they have, when allowed to leak out, or in lamps
                    of inferior construction, a somewhat disagreeable pungent odour, and that there
                    is always a lurking danger in the possible presence of highly volatile
                    inflammable hydrocarbons. Colza oil will never burn without a wick; paraffin oil
                    or petroleum may do so.</p>
                <p>Products of the second and third classes, separately or combinedly, are of course
                    available as fuels proper, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> for the production of
                    heat. At the time when mineral oil was first produced in great quantity in
                    America, the advantages it would offer as a fuel for marine boilers especially
                    were very emphatically insisted on. Of course mineral oil can be more
                    economically stored than coal, and its combustion-heat is susceptible of more
                    exhaustive utilization. The latter fact forms the <hi rend="italic"
                    >raison</hi><hi rend="italic">d’être</hi> of those beautiful petroleum
                    kitchen-stoves and culinary lamps which are very much used on the Continent
                    where gas is not at hand. But to talk of mineral oil as a cheap fuel for
                    wholesale heating is nonsense. H. St Claire Deville, about 1870, made an
                    extensive investigation on the calorific value of American petroleum which, as
                    we know, is pretty much the same thing as paraffin oil. He used a large
                    apparatus, enabling him to burn several hundred litres of oil in one experiment;
                    in fact he realized <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n257/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0257-0240"/> more fully than other experimenters had ever done
                    the conditions prevailing in the working of steam-boilers; the only difference
                    was that he took care to collect all the heat produced in a large mass of water
                    of known weight, and measured the heat by the increase of temperature produced
                    in this heat receptacle. He found that even heavy Virginia lubricating oil gave
                    not more than 10,180 units of heat (Centigrade) per unit-weight of fuel burned.
                    But, on the other hand, in direct experiments made by Scheurer-Kestner, a coal
                    containing 88 ’ 4 per cent, of carbon, <hi rend="italic">4'4 of</hi> hydrogen,
                    and 7 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 2 per cent, of oxygen, nitrogen, and ash
                    gave 9628 units of heat, while another coal of the same elementary composition
                    gave 9117 units. Gas retort coke (though a far closer approximation to pure
                    carbon) yields only 8050 units. Supposing coal yielded just that in opposition
                    to the 10,000 units from petroleum, it is clear that the latter must not cost
                    more than 1 ’ 25 times as much as coal weight for weight, or else it is the more
                    expensive fuel. Take one ton of coal at 10s.; eighttenths of a ton of petroleum
                    is its calorific equivalent; but this weight of the oil (taking the specific
                    gravity at 0 ’ 8) measures 224 gallons. Hence petroleum, to be as cheap as coal,
                    must not cost more than about a halfpenny a gallon. Cheap as mineral oil is
                    nowadays, it has not yet come down to this level.</p>
                <p>To pass to the lubricating oil (third class), it, like the burning oil, competes
                    with the fats and fatty oils which until lately were exclusively employed. In
                    opposition to these it offers other and very substantial advantages besides its
                    lower price. Good mineral lubricating oil may have such very high flashing point
                    that it may be positively less inflammable than fatty oils or tallow; and, as a
                    lubricant for high pressure steam cylinders, it offers the great advantage that
                    it is not, like fatty oils, decomposed by hot steam into glycerin and fatty
                    acids, which latter cannot but attack the metal of the machinery to some extent.
                    A still more important feature in mineral lubricating oil is that, even when
                    diffused throughout a mass of cotton (or other textile) waste, it shows no
                    tendency towards spontaneous combustion. In exhaustive experiments by Galletly
                    and by Coleman, it was found that mineral lubricating oils diffused through
                    textile waste do not take fire at temperatures at which even colza oil ignites,
                    and also that fatty lubricants to which from 20 to 50 per cent, of mineral oil
                    was added were thereby prevented from igniting.</p>
                <p>Solid paraffin, industrially and commercially, is a substitute for the more
                    expensive stearin as a material for candles. To this latter it is more than
                    equivalent in lightgiving power; but it offers the drawback of greater softness
                    and lower fusing point. In practice paraffin is always alloyed with stearin to
                    produce candles possessing the necessary degree of hardness and stability of
                    form.</p>

                <p>In December 1847 Lyon Playfair drew the attention of the late Mr James Young,
                    F.R.S., a Glasgow chemist, to a spring or exudation of petroleum at Alfreton in
                    Derbyshire, and induced him to lease the spring, with the view of turning the
                    material to commercial advantage. In 1848-Mr Young commenced the purification
                    and preparation from this petroleum of two varieties of oil—one, thick, for
                    lubricating, the other, thin and limpid, for burning in lamps. It was found that
                    this crude petroleum contained paraffin in notable proportion; but the solid
                    paraffin was not separated for trade purposes, and that body continued still a
                    simple chemical curiosity. Within two years the quantity of petroleum yielded by
                    the spring began to decrease, and in the beginning of 1851 it was practically
                    exhausted, and the business there ceased. Meantime it had occurred to Mr Young
                    that the petroleum he was working might have been produced by the action of heat
                    on the underlying coal; and, under the impression that it might be possible by
                    artificial means to produce a similar substance, he began an extensive series of
                    experiments on the destructive distillation of coal. As the result of a
                    long-continued investigation in this direction, with many varieties of coal, Mr
                    Young in October 1850 secured a patent for the manufacture of paraffin and
                    paraffin oil from bituminous coal, which patent became the basis of the new
                    industry. “The coals,” the patentee says, “which I deem to be best fitted for
                    the purpose are such as are usually called parrot coal, cannel coal, and gas
                    coal, and which are much used in the manufacture of gas for the purpose of
                    illumination.” Early in 1850 Mr Young’s attention was called to the Boghead
                    mineral, which he found to be of all the substances experimented upon the most
                    promising for his purpose. That circumstance determined Mr Young and his
                    original partners to set up their works at Bathgate in the region of the Boghead
                    mineral, where consequently, in 1850, the necessary buildings and plant were
                    erected, and manufacturing operations were begun in 1851. In 1853 a lawsuit of
                    great importance, which turned on the scientific question “What is coal <hi
                    rend="italic">V</hi> ’ took place between the proprietor of a portion of the
                    Boghead mineral and his mineral tenant, who was entitled to work coal only. The
                    proprietor averred that the mineral in question was not coal; but, after a great
                    amount of scientific evidence on both sides had been heard, the decision was
                    that the substance came, so far as regarded the purposes of the lease, within
                    the definition of coal. Had the issue of the case been in favour of the
                    proprietor of the mineral, Mr Young’s patent would have beèn practically
                    valueless, for he claimed only the distillation of bituminous coal. The
                    distillation of mineral schists or shale at a low red heat had, moreover, been
                    previously patented by Du Buisson; and the only raw materials which have been
                    used to any extent in the Scottish industry are the Boghead mineral and
                    subsequently bituminous shale.</p>
                <p>The essential feature of Young’s invention was the distillation of bituminous
                    substances at the lowest temperature at which they could be volatilized to a
                    practically sufficient extent. In practice it was found that a temperature of
                    800° F. is the point about which the best results are obtained.</p>
                <p>The material exclusively distilled in the early years of the industry in Scotland
                    λvas the Boghead cannel or Torbanehill mineral. The supply of this mineral was
                    limited, and, as its value for gas-making as well as for oil distilling was very
                    great, it rapidly advanced in price from 13s. 6d. per ton, at which it was
                    contracted for when the Bathgate works began operations, till it rose to 90s.
                    per ton before its final disappearance from the market about 1866. As early as
                    1859 the bituminous shales which are found in the Scottish Carboniferous
                    formation began to attract attention as a possible source of raw material for
                    the industry, and in that year a seam was experimentally opened up at Broxburn,
                    Linlithgowshire. In 1861 a shale oil work was established at Gavieside, West
                    Calder, and by the period of the expiry of Young’s patent in 1864 several works
                    distilling shale were in operation. But, while from the Boghead mineral from 120
                    to 130 gallons of crude oil were obtainable for every ton distilled, the
                    ordinary bituminous shales yield at most only 35 gallons per ton; and even with
                    the improved methods of working in use at the present day the average yield of
                    crude oil from shales is not more than 32 gallons per ton.</p>
                <p>The bituminous shales of Scotland are found in a wide belt of the Carboniferous
                    formation, extending from Ayrshire in a north-easterly direction to the Fife
                    coast. In Ayr and Renfrew they are found to some extent in the true
                    Coal-measures; but, generally, and especially in the east, they are obtained in
                    the Lower Carboniferous series. These oil shales consist of fissile argillaceous
                    bands, highly impregnated with bituminous matter. As a rule the shale of the
                    west country yields a high percentage of crude oil, but the Linlithgow,
                    Midlothian, and Fife shales produce oils comparatively rich in lubricating oil
                    and solid paraffin, the most valuable product of the industry. The ordinary
                    Broxburn shale contains 17 per cent, of bituminous volatile matter, and leaves
                    76 per cent, of spent shale (char) on distillation. In contrast with this is the
                    composition of the Boghead mineral, which contained not less than 65 per cent,
                    of volatile bituminous matter and only 22 per cent, of ash.</p>
                <p>In the early years of the industry at Bathgate, the two classes of oil—heavy
                    (lubricant) and light (illuminating)—were the products to which attention was
                    principally directed. Paraffin was separated from the heavy oils; but the demand
                    for it was at first small, and many difficulties had to be overcome before
                    candles consisting principally of that body could be favourably brought into the
                    market. With the increased knowledge, improved methods, and eager competition of
                    the present day, the range of products has largely extended, and almost
                    everything obtainaole from the shale, except the incombustible ash, is turned to
                    profitable account. The commercial products embrace sulphate of ammonia,
                    illuminating and heating gas, gasoline and naphtha, highly volatile oils,
                    several grades of burning oil and of lubricating oil, heavy green oil used for
                    making oil gas, and solid paraffin. The sequence of manufacturing operations has
                    not changed in any essential particular since first established by Young; but at
                    every stage and in all the appliances numerous and important modifications have
                    been, and continue to be, actively introduced, all tending to greater economy of
                    work, increase of production, and improvement of the quality and variety of
                    commercial products.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Crude Works.—</hi> Bituminous shale as brought from the pits is
                    passed through powerful toothed cylinder machinery, reducing it to fragments not
                    larger than a man’s fist. In this state it is conveyed in hutches to the
                    retorts, in which it undergoes destructive distillation—the distinctive
                    operation under Mr Young’s patent. The retorts used have undergone many and
                    important modifications. Originally, as was natural, horizontal retorts arranged
                    in benches, in all respects like gas retorts, were employed, but these in the
                    Scottish trade very quickly gave way to the vertical retort. The form of
                    vertical retort originally in general use consisted of a cast-iron cylinder,
                    circular or oval in cross section, 8 or 10 feet in height and about 2 feet in
                    diameter, or equivalent thereto. It tapered at the top, where it was provided
                    with a hopper for charging the material to be distilled and a valve for closing
                    the retort mouth. The bottom end dipped into a trough of water, forming an
                    efficient lute, and effectually preventing the escape downwards of any of the
                    gaseous products of distillation. These retorts were arranged in linear benches
                    of six, three on each side of a furnace fed with coal, the heat from which
                    passed to each side into the chamber or oven in which the retort stood. The
                    distilled vapours passed away by a pipe at the upper end of the retort, their
                    emission being aided by a jet of superheated steam injected at the bottom. The
                    distillation in these retorts was continuous, a portion of spent shale being
                    withdrawn through the water in the trough every hour or thereby, and a
                    corresponding amount of fresh shale being added by the hopper.</p>
                <p>As competition with American petroleum increased, the efforts of manufacturers
                    were directed to cheapening the distilling process, by utilizing the spent shale
                    from the retorts in its hot condition as fuel for distilling the succeeding
                    charge. The difficulties in the way of accomplishing this were very great,
                    chiefly on account of the large proportion of ash in the coked residue,
                    amounting to from 85 to 90 per cent, of the whole. To use spent shale so poor in
                    carbon it was essential that it should be dropped into the furnace direct from
                    the retort without exposure to the air, and this was first successfully
                    accomplished by the improved retorts and furnace patented by Mr Norman Μ.
                    Henderson in 1873. According to the Henderson system, which has been adopted in
                    the more important Scottish oil works—a series of four vertical retorts are
                    arranged in quadrangular order over a common fire-chamber or furnace; the bottom
                    ends of the retorts are provided with doors capable of being closed gas-tight;
                    and immediately below each door there is a valve which, in one position, and
                    while the charge is being distilled, entirely cuts off the retort bottom from
                    the furnace or fire-chamber, leaving the retort bottom exposed to the external
                    air, but when the retort charge has been exhausted of oil, and is about to be
                    passed into the furnace as fuel, the valve can be turned over outwards, in which
                    position it forms an inclined shoot contiguous to the bottom of the retort and
                    the fire-chamber. The door-closing at the bottom of the retort having been first
                    withdrawn, and the valve drawn back, the contents of the retort pass freely into
                    the furnace, where their combustion is at first assisted by a jet of the
                    incondensible inflammable gas given off by the retorts themselves.</p>
                <p>Each Henderson retort can contain about 18 cwt. of shale. The four retorts
                    forming a set are being cleared in rotation at intervals of five hours, so that
                    each charge suffers distillation for twenty hours. The temperature is kept at
                    about 800° F., this giving the best results. The vapour produced in the retort
                    is led off by a pipe issuing from near the bottom, and, in order to avoid
                    unnecessarily prolonged sojourn of the vapour in the hot vessel, a jet of
                    superheated steam is constantly made to stream in above and guide the vapour
                    downwards. The vapour, which amounts to about 3000 cubic feet per ton of shale
                    distilled, is passed through a system of condensing pipes, communicating below
                    through a properly divided horizontal chest, like that used in gas works for the
                    condensation of the tar. From the last compartment of the condenser the still
                    uncondensed gas is drawn away by a fan or other “exhaust” through a set of
                    “scrubbers.” In the first of these the gas is washed with water and thus
                    stripped of what it still contains of ammonia; in the succeeding ones it is
                    washed with heavy oil, which withdraws a considerable portion of the vapours of
                    the more highly volatile hydrocarbons which are diffused throughout it. From
                    this heavy-oil solution the absorbed hydrocarbons are extracted by distillation
                    as “naphtha.” The gas, after having thus been freed from its more readily
                    condensible parts, is either led away into gasholders to be utilized as
                    illuminating gas or used directly as a fuel (sec above). The product which
                    collects in the condenser chests consists of crude oil (about one-fourth of it)
                    and a weak aqueous solution of ammonia and volatile ammonia salts, containing
                    from 2 to 5 per cent, of real ammonia, NH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, which,
                    however, in all cases represents only a small percentage of the potential
                    ammonia which was contained in the original shale in the form of nitrogenous
                    carbon compounds. In the golden days of paraffin oil making this ammonia liquor
                    was simply allowed to go to waste; but when the American petroleum began to
                    depress the prices of the oils the manufacturer saw the propriety of working up
                    the liquors for sulphate of ammonia by the same methods as are employed in
                    connexion with the coal-gas industry (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Nitrogen,</hi>
                    vol. xvii. p. 519). And as, during the last decade or two, the demand for
                    ammonia has been steadily increasing, the ammonia in the shale industry by and
                    by rose from the rank of a minor collateral to that of one of the principal
                    products, and a number of attempts have been made to recover that part of the
                    nitrogen which, in the ordinary process, is lost as a component of the coke. Dr
                    H. Grouven proved (1875-77) that all nitrogenous organic or organoid matter when
                    exposed to a current of steam at about 1000° C. burns into carbon oxides,
                    hydrogen, and ammonia, the last-named including all the nitrogen. Messrs G. T.
                    Beilby and William Young have worked out and patented a process for discounting
                    this fact in the shale industry for a more exhaustive extraction of the ammonia.
                    In one of the later forms of the process the shale is being distilled in retorts
                    standing over a firebrick chamber surrounded by flues and kept at a far higher
                    temperature than the retorts themselves. The coke from the retorts is discharged
                    straight into this chamber, and therein exposed to a mixed current of steam and
                    air, which burns away the carbonaceous part into carbonic acid, carbonic oxide,
                    hydrogen, and ammonia. The large mass of hot gas thus produced passes next
                    through the retorts above to aid in the distillation, and conjointly with the
                    retort vapour is subjected to systematic successive condensation. The
                    incondensible gas which is ultimately obtained includes all that the gas from
                    the ordinary process contains, and also a large proportion of hydrogen and
                    carbonic oxide from the hot-chamber process. It serves as a fuel for heating the
                    chamber and the retorts; but, as it does not furnish quite enough of heat for
                    all this, a combined retort and gas-producer is built into the beneh with the
                    shale retorts. This supplementary apparatus is charged with coal, which, in it,
                    is first distilled, then converted partially into gas by steam and at last
                    completely by a regulated current of air. The gas from the first and second
                    stages is scrubbed to strip it of its ammonia and tar, and then, conjointly with
                    the gas from the third, used as a fuel for the retorts. In this way the
                    advantages of gas-firing are secured at little expense, as the condensed
                    products are nearly equivalent in money value to the coal consumed. In the
                    Young-Beilby process, which is extensively used in Scottish works, the yield of
                    ammonia is on the average double, and in special cases five times, that obtained
                    in the ordinary process of distillation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Working of the Oil.—</hi> The composition of the crude oil
                    is very variable (see above). It generally forms a very dark green, almost
                    black, liquid, somewhat tarry in appearance, and endowed with a highly
                    unpleasant empyreumatic odour. The specific gravity ranges from 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 862 to 0 ’ 895. Each ton of shale distilled yields on
                    an average 30 gallons of crude oil (about 260 lb), 700 lb of coke, gas, and
                    loss, and 1270 lb of cinders. The crude oil on refining yields 38 to 44 per
                    cent, of oils available as “spirit” or for burning, 15 to 20 per cent, of
                    lubricating oil, and 9 to 12 per cent, of solid paraffin.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Refinery.—</hi> The first operation in oil refining consists in
                    submitting the crude oil to distillation in large pot-shaped stills capable of
                    holding 1200 or 1400 gallons. The distillation is continued till only a pure
                    vesicular coke remains in the still, and the vapours (condensed by the ordinary
                    worm-pipe arrangement) constitute “once-run oil,” which from its bright green
                    colour is also known as green oil. The once-run oil is the material from which,
                    by a repeated series of washings with sulphuric acid and caustic soda and
                    fractional distillations, the graduated series of purified products is finally
                    obtained.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Washing.—</hi> Once-run oil contains a series of basic and acid
                    components. To separate these the oil is first repeatedly treated with sulphuric
                    acid ot different degrees of strength, which is thoroughly intermixed and
                    brought in contact with the oil by mechanical means in an agitating tank or
                    washer. The acid first used is a weak tarry acid which has been already used in
                    a subsequent stage of the manufacture. This produces a copious tarry deposit,
                    which is removed; the process is repeated with a similar result; and thereafter
                    the oil is further treated with two successive washings of strong vitriol. After
                    settling and removal of the precipitated tars, a similar series of washings with
                    caustic soda solutions of increasing strength, and corresponding precipitation
                    and removal of tars which combine with the alkali, are carried out. During both
                    the acid and the soda treatments the oil is maintained at a temperature of about
                    100° F. by the circulation of steam through the tanks in coiled pipes. The
                    sulphuric acid tars are to some extent used as fuel in the fractionating
                    stills.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fractional Distillation. —</hi> The purified once-run oil is a
                    very mixed substance, giving off vapours within a wide range'of temperatures,
                    which condense into products of varied specific gravity. By the series of
                    fractional distillations to which it is submitted a series of products are
                    ultimately obtained comparatively homogeneous in constitution, which distil
                    within relatively narrow limits of temperature. The ordinary method of
                    fractionating once-run oil consists in running it into large cylindrical boiler
                    stills heated by furnaces in which the acid tar already spoken of is consumed.
                    The stills have led into them steam-pipes, through which steam is injected into
                    the oil in process of distillation as required. When the heat is first raised,
                    superheated steam is injected to aid in carrying off the lighter vapours, which
                    are condensed as naphtha or “spirit.” As the distillation proceeds, and the
                    gravity of the condensed product increases, it is run into separate receivers,
                    and thus a series of fractionated intermediate products is produced, the first
                    portion up to O'75O specific gravity being naphtha, while from 0'750 to 0'850 is
                    the burning oil portion, and the subsequent portion separated is heavy oil
                    containing paraffin. The portion remaining in the still is removed to the
                    residue stills, in which it is distilled till the still contains only coke. The
                    oil driven off from the residue stills is called “heavy oil and paraffin,” and
                    passes to the paraffin house for treatment there.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Improved Fractionating Stills.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    Many attempts have been made to adapt the fractionating still to a system of
                    continuous working by keeping the contents at a constant level as the
                    distillation proceeds. For a long period continuous distillation was only
                    imperfectly applicable, and yielded unsatisfactory results. The lighter
                    fractions alone were driven off, and as the distillation progressed the density
                    of the contents of the still gradually increased, making the difference between
                    the oil added to the still and that within it increasingly great. In the end the
                    contents of the still had to be removed and completely distilled as one charge
                    in a separate still. In 1883 Mr Norman Μ. Henderson, the patentee of the
                    Henderson retort, patented a continuous process of distillation which completely
                    obviates all difficulties, and largely reduces the time, labour, and cost of
                    fractionation as compared with the ordinary intermittent method. According to
                    Henderson’s system, purified once-run oil is fractionated continuously in a
                    connected series of three cylindrical stills. Each still is fitted with inlet
                    and outlet pipes, the mouths of which opening upwards are placed at opposite
                    extremities of the still. The outlet pipe of No. 1 passes as inlet into No. 2,
                    and similarly outlet of No. 2 is connected as inlet with No. 3, while the outlet
                    of No. 3 passes into one or more common residue stills. The inlet or feed pipe
                    of No. 1 traverses the long horizontal condensing pipes of the whole three, and
                    thus the once-run oil, while absorbing heat before entering No. 1 still, also
                    aids the condensation of the vapours. In working there is a constant feeding of
                    heated once-run oil into No. 1 still, a like steady flow from No. 1 to No. 2,
                    from No. 2 to No. 3, and from No. 3 to a residue still. The oil of course
                    increases in density as it passes onwards; but the specific gravity in each
                    still is practically constant, and, as the heat applied is increased in
                    proportion to the gravity, the oil vaporized in each separate still is of
                    uniform quality and specific gravity. In No. 3 still, where, in consequence of
                    the high gravity and temperature, there is a tendency to deposit carbonaceous
                    matter, circulating plates or dishes hinged to each side of the still, and
                    concentric with the bottom shell, are placed. The circulation of the oil from
                    the bottom up the sides in the space between the shell and the circulating
                    plates is directed and assisted by jets of steam from a pipe laid along the
                    bottom of the still. In this way the oil is kept in steady circulation up the
                    sides and down the centre, and any deposit of coke which may take place forms on
                    the inner surface of the circulating plates, from which there is provision for
                    its easy removal when required.</p>
                <p>The manufacturer has now his material split up into three products—naphtha,
                    burning oil, and heavy oil with paraffin. By renewed treatments with acid and
                    alkali and fractional distillations, these products are further purified and
                    differentiated. We cannot go into technical details, and in regard to the
                    principles upon which the processes are founded reference may be made to what
                    has been said above in connexion with corresponding laboratory methods. As a
                    final result the following products (or a similar series of other products) are
                    produced and sent out into the market :—</p>
                <p>1. Gasoline: a mixture of paraffins, so volatile that a current of air by being
                    passed through it at ordinary temperatures is converted into combustible
                    (nonexplosive) gas.</p>
                <p>2. Naphtha: a mixture of hydrocarbons which in volatility and otherwise are
                    equivalent to the crude benzol of the coal-gas industry.</p>
                <p>3. Burning oil: a mixture of oils sufficiently volatile and light to be suitable
                    for combustion in domestic lamps with wicks, and yet practically free of
                    dangerously volatile inflammable components.</p>
                <p>4. Heavy oil, corresponding to a range of very high boiling points; too heavy or
                    viscid to be raised by the wick of a lamp, but well adapted for lubricating
                    purposes. This part contains the solid paraffin which the manufacturer takes
                    care to extract as completely as possible before the oil is sold as “lubricating
                    oil.” The several kinds of crude paraffin extracted are classed as “hard scale”
                    or “soft scale,” according to their fusing points and consequent degrees of
                    hardness at ordinary temperatures.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Separation of Hard Scale.—</hi> The heavy oil forming the last
                    of the three portions into which once-run oil is fractionated, at ordinary
                    atmospheric temperatures, becomes thick and pasty by the abundant formation of
                    crystals of solid paraffin. This mixture of oil and paraffin is separated by
                    draining through canvas bags, or, as is now the almost universal practice, by
                    passing the magma into a filter press. This apparatus contains a series of
                    thirty or forty perforated plates about 2 feet square, the faces of which are
                    covered with filtering canvas. They are screwed up together in an oblong
                    horizontal frame, so that a space or chamber about an inch wide is left between
                    each pair of plates. Into these chambers the pasty mixture is forced under high
                    pressure, the material passing into and filling each chamber through an orifice
                    in the centre of the plates till the whole of the chambers are filled. The
                    pressure being kept up, the fluid oil exudes through the canvas and perforations
                    in the plates, leaving solid paraffin, which continues to accumulate till the
                    chambers are filled with it in a comparatively dry condition. The soft cake from
                    the filter press is further squeezed in canvas in an hydraulic press giving off
                    more fluid oil, and the cake from this pressure consists of commercial hard
                    scale or crude paraffin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Soft Scale.—</hi> The heavy oils separated in the second and
                    third fractionation of burning oils, and the oil from which the above hard scale
                    is separated, hold dissolved in them paraffin of low melting point, which can
                    only be crystallized out by bringing the oil to a very low temperature. For this
                    purpose the oils are reduced to from 18° to 20° F. by artificial refrigeration.
                    The method now employed consists in sufficiently cooling a continuous current of
                    brine or of chloride of calcium solution by passing it through an ether
                    refrigerating machine. This cold current of brine circulates through the
                    interior of a large cylinder or drum, which revolves slowly, dipping into a
                    trough containing the oil to be cooled. The cold surface of the drum in contact
                    with the oil takes on a deposit of solid paraffin crystallized out of the
                    mixture. It is removed by scrapers and made to fall into a separate receptacle,
                    whence it goes to the filter press and the hydraulic press in the same way as
                    the hard scale.</p>

                    paraffin are separated a,s above stated exhibits a blue fluorescence, and is
                    hence called blue oil. It receives an acid and soda series of washings^ after
                    which it is submitted to fractionation. The first portion given off, up to about
                    0'850 specific gravity, is transferred to the burning-oil series, with which it
                    is mixed for further treatment. The remainder is received as various grades of
                    lubricating oil, with specific gravity ranging from 0 '860 to 0 '890. These
                    heavy oils are again refrigerated, yielding a further crop of soft scale, after
                    which they get a final acid and alkali treatment, and are finished for use by
                    having steam blown through them for a prolonged period, the effect of which is
                    to reduce greatly their objectionable smell. Finally they are kept in warm
                    settling tanks at a temperature of not less than 90° F. for eight or ten days,
                    when they are ready for Qιe market.</p>
                <p>Occasion has already been taken to name the advantages which this kind of mineral
                    oil offers as a lubricating agent. Let us now add that it cannot quite take the
                    place of fatty lubricants, lacking the degree and kind of viscosity which fits
                    these for certain purposes. A mixture of fatty and mineral oil in proper
                    proportions is often found to work better than either component would by itself.
                    As mineral oil is far cheaper than all the fatty oils, it is largely used as
                    adulterant of these. Such adulteration can <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n260/mode/1up"

                    tests; all heavy mineral oils exhibit a characteristically strong blue
                    fluorescence, which becomes rather more prominent by the presence of fatty oil.
                    Manufacturers, however, have learned to remove the fluorescence by the addition
                    of certain chemical substances, and large quantities of such “bloomless” oil are
                    being sold and used as colza or other fatty oil.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Paraffin Refining.—</hi> The crude paraffin which remains to be
                    dealt with consists of soft scale, melting point between 90° and 105° F., and
                    hard scale melting between 115° and 120° F. The greater part of the soft scale
                    is disposed of in the crude state for impregnating match splints in
                    lucifer-match making. The remainder, hard and soft, is purified by an acid and
                    soda treatment, and decolorized by repeated washings with solvent naphtha. To
                    this end the scale is melted, mixed with 25 per cent, of naphtha, cooled down,
                    and . thus caused to crystallize, and subjected to hydraulic pressure. The
                    solvent naphtha is thus squeezed out, and this series of operations is repeated
                    two or three times. Each of the mother-liquors produced is utilized as a
                    purifying agent for the paraffin of a preceding stage of purity, so that it at
                    last arrives at and serves for the original crude scale.</p>
                <p>In its progress through these washings the naphtha takes up much heavy oil and
                    solid paraffin, which are extracted by systematic fractionation and
                    crystallization. The paraffin, after its last squeezing, is a dull
                    chalky-looking white mass strongly impregnated with naphtha, to drive off which
                    it is melted and has a current of steam blown through it, till no trace of
                    naphtha odour comes away with the steam. The ultimate decolorization is effected
                    by mixing the heated paraffin with animal charcoal, allowing the charcoal to
                    settle, and drawing off the paraffin through filters. The molten paraffin flows
                    into oblong tins which mould it into the beautiful translucent blocks used for
                    candle making and the several other purposes to which paraffin is applied.</p>
                <p>The soda-tar obtained in the various processes is to some extent collected and
                    treated for the recovery of a soda sufficiently pure to be used in the first
                    stages of purification of the crude oil. It is also employed to neutralize the
                    acid tar, after which both are distilled, yieldingas a bye-product an oil known
                    as “green oil,” largely used for the manufacture of oil-gas under Pintsch’s
                    patent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce.—</hi> The development of the paraffin industry under
                    Young’s patents, and the rapid increase of demand for the products, led directly
                    to the rise of the great petroleum industry in America. The United States acting
                    commissioner of patents, Mr John L. Hayes, in reporting on Μ Young’s claim for
                    an extension of his patent rights, states that “the manufactures of coal oil in
                    this country had their origin in Mr Young’s discovery. The use of petroleum
                    followed so directly and obviously from the use of coal oils that it can hardly
                    be denied that the one originated from the other.” The petroleum industry once
                    started, however, grew with so startling rapidity, and attained such gigantic
                    proportions, that it threatened the entire extinction of the parent manufacture.
                    In the early days of the trade a considerable development of manufacturing
                    activity took place in Wales, where an inferior kind of cannel coal was
                    distilled; and at many localities in Germany brown coal and sometimes peat were
                    utilized as the raw materials of a considerable industry. The pressure of the
                    competition with American oil was felt severely by all, and it was only with
                    much difficulty that the great Scottish companies succeeded in holding their
                    own, and in carrying on a constantly extending production. The Welsh industry
                    was practically extinguished, and the production in Germany, notwithstanding the
                    imposition of high protective duties, was greatly circumscribed. The chief seats
                    of the manufacture in Germany are now in Saxony, near Weissenfels, where a
                    peculiar variety of lignite called “pyropissite” forms the raw material for
                    distillation.</p>
                <p>In the Scottish industry there was in the middle of 1884 about £2,000,000 of
                    capital invested, the working capacity of works in operation being equal to the
                    distillation of 4170 tons of shale a day, while plant is being provided to
                    increase that capacity to 5920 tons. The following table represents the present
                    output of a year of 312 working days.</p>
