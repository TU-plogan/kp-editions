                    rulers of the house of Codrus.</p></note> Its advantageous position between two
                    good harbours, called Naustathmus and Lampter, is pointed out by Livy (xxxvii.
                    31), and was probably the cause which led the inhabitants to devote themselves
                    from an early period to maritime pursuits. We are expressly told by Herodotus
                    that the Phocaeans were the first of all the Greeks who undertook distant
                    voyages and made known to their countrymen the coasts of the Adriatic, as well
                    as those of Tyrrhenia and Spain. In the latter country they established friendly
                    relations with Arganthonius, king of Tartessus, who even invited them to
                    emigrate in a body to settle in his dominions, and, on their declining this
                    offer, [&gt;resented them with a large sum of money. This they employed in
                    constructing a strong wall of fortification around their city, a defence which
                    stood them in good stead when the Ionian cities were attacked by Cyrus in 546.
                    On that occasion they refused to submit when besieged by Harpagus, the general
                    of Cyrus; but, mistrusting their power of ultimate resistance, they determined
                    to abandon their city, and, embarking their wives and children and most valuable
                    effects, to seek a new home in the western regions, where they had already
                    founded several flourishing colonies, among others those of Alalia in Corsica
                    and the important city of Massilia in the south of Gaul. A large part of the
                    emigrants, however, relented, and, after having proceeded only as far as Chios,
                    returned to Phocaea, where they submitted to the Persian yoke. The rest,
                    however, having bound themselves by a solemn oath never to return, proceeded to
                    Corsica, where they settled for a time; but, being afterwards expelled from the
                    island, they founded the colony of Velia or Elea in southern Italy.</p>
                <p>Phocaea continued to exist under the Persian government, but greatly reduced in
                    population and commerce, so that, although it joined in the revolt of the
                    Ionians against Persia in 500, it was only able to send three ships to the
                    combined fleet that fought at Lade. Nor did it ever again assume a prominent
                    part among the Ionian cities, and it is rarely mentioned in Greek history. But
                    at a later period it was sufficiently powerful to oppose a vigorous resistance
                    to the Roman praetor Aemilius during the war against Antiochus in 191. On that
                    occasion the town was taken and plundered, but it continued to survive, and we
                    learn from its coins that it was a place of some importance throughout the Roman
                    empire. The ruins still visible on the site bear the name of Palea Foggia, but
                    they are of little interest. A small town in the immediate neighbourhood, known
                    as Nova Foggia, appears to date only from Byzantine times.</p>
