                <p><label type="entry">PARIS</label>, the son of Priam, king of Troy. Before he was
                    born his mother Hecuba dreamed that she was delivered of a firebrand. The dream
                    was interpreted that her child would ruin his country, and when Paris was born
                    he was exposed on Mount Ida. His life was saved by the herdsmen, and he grew up
                    among them, distinguished for beauty and strength, till he was recognized and
                    received by his parents. When the strife arose at the marriage of Peleus and
                    Thetis between Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite, each claiming the apple that should
                    belong to the most beautiful, Paris was selected as the judge. The three rivals
                    unveiled their divine charms before a mortal judge on Mount Ida. The scene
                    afterwards became a favourite subject in Greek art, and it is usual to represent
                    Hermes escorting the goddesses. Each tried to bribe the judge, Hera by promising
                    power, Athena wisdom, Aphrodite the most beautiful woman in the world. Paris
                    decided in favour of Aphrodite, and thus made Hera and Athena the bitter enemies
                    of his country. To gain the woman whom Aphrodite had promised, Paris set sail
                    for Lacedaemon, deserting his old love Oenone, daughter of the river-god Cebren,
                    who in vain tried to induce him to give up his purpose. He was hospitably
                    received by Menelaus, whose kindness he repaid by seducing his wife Helena to
                    flee with him to Troy. The details of the flight are variously related (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Helena).</hi> The siege of Troy by the united Greeks
                    followed. Paris proved a lazy and backward fighter, though not wanting in actual
                    courage when he could be roused to exert himself. Before the capture of the city
                    he was mortally wounded by Philoctetes with an arrow. He then bethought him of
                    the slighted nymph Oenone, who he knew could heal the wound. He was carried into
                    her presence, but she refused to save him. Afterwards, when she found he was
                    dead, she committed suicide. Paris is represented in Greek art as a beautiful
                    young man, beardless, wearing the pointed Phrygian cap, and often holding in his
                    hand the apple.</p>
