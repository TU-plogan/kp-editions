                <p>The Chilian portion, the main bulk of which is comprised under the title of

                    >Magallanes),</hi> is chiefly remarkable for the way in which the combined
                    action of glacier and sea has cut up the country into a multitude of rugged and
                    irregular islands and peninsulas, separated by intricate channels and fjords.
                    South of Chiloe, the first great island of the Chilian coast, the islands are
                    grouped under the name of the Chonos Archipelago, which is bounded on the south
                    by the spacious Gulf of Peñas. The Chonos Islands (upwards of 1000 in number,
                    without counting mere islets and rocks) are without exception mountainous, and
                    in some cases the summits remain white throughout the year, though in the
                    lowlands snow lies only a few days. The general temperature is remarkably even.
                    A thick covering of vegetation (low and stunted on the seaward parts) is spread
                    over nearly all the surface, but the layer of vegetable soil is very thin.
                    Potatoes grow wild, and cabbage, onions, radish, &amp;c., are cultivated. The
                    sea-elephant appears to be exterminated; seals still abound. On Taytao peninsula
                    is found the pudu, the. smallest known deer. The old Indian
                    inhabitants—Chonos—are practically extinct, though their sitting mummies give
                    name to Momias Bay, and they still occupy some of the islands far south near
                    Magellan’s Strait. There are only one or two permanent settlements in the whole
                    archipelago—on the Guaitecas Islands (43° 52' S. lat.) and at Puerto Americano
                    or Tangbac (45° S. lat.). Woodcutters, however, visit the islands in
                    considerable numbers for the sake of their valuable timber, mainly cipré <hi

                    Magdalena—which is by far the largest of the whole group and contains the
                    extinct volcano of Motalat, 5400 feet high—it is enough to mention Chaffers,
                    Forsyth, Johnson, Tahuenahuec, Narborough (named after the old English
                    explorer), Stokes, Benjamin, James, Melchor, Victoria, Luz, and Rivero Islands.
                    The broad Moraleda Channel, from 75 to 175 fathoms deep, which may be said to
                    separate the rest of the archipelago from Magdalena and the mainland, is
                    continued south by the Costa and Elefantes Channels, and would have proved of
                    great service to navigation had it not been that the southern exit is barred by
                    the narrow isthmus of Ofqui, which alone prevents the strangely formed Taytao
                    peninsula from being an island. The glacier of San Rafael, which discharges into
                    the lagoon of the same name on the north side of the isthmus, is nearer the
                    equator than any other coast-glacier in the world.<note anchored="true"

                <p>South of the Gulf of Peñas a navigable channel exists between the mainland and
                    the long succession of islands which, under the names of Wellington Island (150
                    miles long), Madre de Dios Archipelago, Hanover Island, and Queen Adelaide
                    Archipelago, extend for about 400 miles to the mouth of Magellan’s Strait; and
                    it is now regularly used by steamers, which are thus protected from the terrible
                    western storms that make the deep-sea passage along this coast so dangerous. At
                    one or two points only is the navigation difficult—at the English Narrows in
                    Messier Channel (as the northern division is called), and at the Guia Narrows
                    farther south. The scenery throughout is of the most beautiful and picturesque
                    description. Among the serviceable inlets are Connor Cove, Port Grappler, Puerto
                    Bueno (pointed out by Sarmiento), and Isthmus Harbour.<note anchored="true"

                    which separates the mainland from the countless islands of the Tierra del Fuego
                    archipelago and breaks it up into a number of very irregular peninsulas. Of
                    these the largest are King William IV. Land and Brunswick Peninsula, and between
                    them lies the extensive inlet of Otway Water, which is further connected
                    westward by Fitzroy Channel with Skyring Water. On the east coast of Brunswick
                    Peninsula, opposite the Broad Reach of the strait, and in the finest part of the
                    straitward district, lies the Chilian military post and penal settlement of
                    Punta Arenas or Sandy Point. It was founded in 1851 as a substitute for the
                    unfortunate Port Famine settlement, which lay farther south on the same coast.
                    In spite of convict mutinies (as in 1878) and the questionable character of many
                    of the settlers (chiefly Chilotes), Punta Arenas begins to flourish; in 1875 its
                    population was 915, and since that date a series of “factories” or
                    cattle-stations have been established along the coast to north and south. The
                    country behind the settlement, unlike the districts at either end of the strait,
                    is well wooded, mainly with Chilian beech <hi rend="italic">(Fagus

                    called after Captain Winter, Drake’s companion), and considerable quantities of
                    timber are exported. Coal also, though of inferior quality, is worked in the
                    neighbourhood.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Punta

                <p>Patagonia east of the Andes is for the most part a region of vast steppe-like
                    plains. Unlike the pampas of the Argentine Republic, with which it is
                    conterminous on the north, it rises in a succession of abrupt steps or terraces
                    about 300 feet at a time, and is covered, not with soft stoneless soil, but with
                    an enormous bed of shingle, which instead of luxuriant grass supports, where it
                    is not absolutely bare, only a thin clothing of coarse and often thorny
                    brushwood and herbage. So peculiar is this, the largest tract of shingle in the
                    world, that from DOrbigny downwards geologists have generally characterized it
                    simply as the Patagonian formation. It is of Tertiary marine origin; but, whilst
                    Bove makes it correspond to the Miocene subdivision, Doering (Roca’s expedition)
                    assigns it to the somewhat older Oligocène. Beneath the shingle, which is
                    sometimes at least 200 feet thick, and has its pebbles whitewashed and cemented
                    together by an aluminous substance, there stretches a vast deposit, sometimes
                    more than 800 feet thick, of a soft infusorial stone resembling chalk. In the

                <p>As the Andes are approached, a great change is observed in the whole condition of
                    the country. The shingle is replaced by porphyry and granite and vast masses of

                    clothing the ravines and hillsides; and, with the richer plant life, animal life
                    grows more abundant and varied, deer, peccaries, wild cattle, and wild

                    Jesuits in the neighbourhood of Lake Nahuel-Huapi have spread into vast natural
                    orchards, which furnish the local tribes of Araucanians with food and wine, and
                    have given rise to the designation Manzaneros or apple-folk by which they are
                    distinguished.</p>
                <p>Eastern Patagonia is traversed from west to east by a considerable number of
                    rivers, but few if any can ever be of much use as highways. In their passage
                    seawards they are joined by comparatively few tributaries from the low country;
                    rain falls seldom, and the water sinks away among the shingle and sand. The Rio
                    Negro, which separates the pampas from Patagonia proper, is formed by the
                    junction of the Neuquen and the Limay. The former collects by numerous channels
                    the drainage of the Andes between 36° 25' and 38° 40'; the latter has its main
                    source in the great NahuelHuapi Lake, which was discovered in 1690 by Mascardi
                    the Jesuit (whose station on the lake was maintained till 1723), and is reached
                    from Chili by the Bariloche pass, rediscovered by Jorje Rohde in 1882. For some
                    distance the Rio Negro is navigable for steamers drawing 12 feet, but only
                    vessels with powerful engines can make head against the current. South of this
                    river there stretches north and south a chain of hills—the Valchita and Uttak
                    range—which, lying from 50 to 100 miles from the coast, forms a secondary
                    watershed, draining westward into the plain as well as eastward to the Atlantic.
                    The next great Andean river is the Chubut (Chubat or Chuba, √.e., erosion),
                    which gives its name of</p>
                <p>Chubut Territory to the northern division of Argentine Patagonia, and is well
                    known from the Welsh colonies established in its valley in 1865 by Mr. Lewis
                    Jones. Its northmost affluent rises probably a little south of Nahuel-Huapi,
                    about 41° 25', and its southmost between 46° and 47°. The latter stream, the
                    Sengel or Senguer (explored by Durnford 1877, Moyano 1880), has this
                    peculiarity, that, before entering the shallow basin of Lake Colguape (Huapi),
                    Colhue, or, as Thomas and Moreno call it, Dillon, the volume of water is so much
                    larger than when it issues again that the Welsh settlers distinguish the lower
                    course of the stream as Sengellen or the Little Sengel.<note anchored="true"

                    (Puerto Deseado), well known in the early history of the coast, has its source
                    about 46° 42', in the vicinity of a large lake, Buenos Ayres (20 miles long by
                    14 broad), which lies, however, 600 feet below the level of the river, and
                    consequently has no connexion with it. Of the rivers which unite in the Santa
                    Cruz estuary the Rio Chico (explored by Musters, Moyano, and Lista) and the
                    Chatta or Sheuen (explored by Moyano and Moreno) have little that calls for
                    notice; but the Santa Cruz is connected with the most remarkable cluster of
                    mountain-lakes in the country. The largest of these is Capar or Viedma Lake
                    (discovered by Viedma in 1782); northward it communicates by a narrow channel
                    with what may be distinguished as Moreno Lake, which again opens into San
                    Martin, and southward it discharges into the very irregular Lago Argentine or
                    Fitzroy Lake (discovered, according to Musters, by an adventurer called Holstein
                    in 1868, and next visited by Fallberg), which in its turn probably has extensive
                    ramifications. From the east end of Lago Argentine issues the rapid current of
                    the Santa Cruz. Round these lakes the mountains rise with glaciers and
                    snow-fields from 3000 to 3500 feet, and at the north-west end of Viedma stands
                    the active volcano of Chalten. At the time of Moreno’s visit in March (the
                    latter part of summer) gigantic icebergs rising 70 feet above the water
                    continued to float about Lago Argentine. With the melting of the snows the river
                    rose rapidly, and by 17th March was 63 feet above its ordinary level. So swift
                    was its current that the explorers sped down the whole length of its course in
                    twenty-four hours, though they had taken a month to ascend. In some parts the
                    rate was at least 15 miles per hour. The Rio Gallegos, the last of the rivers of
                    Patagonia which flow west and east, is comparatively insignificant except during
                    thaw-floods, when it completely interrupts communication by its wide and raging
                    torrent (see Beerbohm’s exciting narrative). The eastern coast of Patagonia
                    contrasts strikingly with the western; hardly an island of any considerable size
                    exists on all the 2000 miles of its development, and it is scooped out into
                    spacious and open gulfs. The peninsula of San José or Valdes to the south of the
                    Gulf of San Matias is quite exceptional. But the whole seaboard offers only one
                    or two safe harbours; and submerged reefs, strong tides, currents, and overfalls
                    combine to render it highly perilous. Besides El Carmen or Patagones, near the
                    mouth of the Rio Negro, a place of 1690 inhabitants in 1869, there is hardly a
                    permanent settlement of any size from the river to the strait; but, since the
                    partition between Chili and the Argentine Republic, beginnings of colonization
                    have been made at the more promising points. A notice of the native Patagonians
                    is given in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Indians (American),</hi> vol. xii.
                    p. 829; and the history of the Araucanian tribes of the Chilian side has been

                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Patagonia was discovered in 1520 by Magellan,
                    who called the country Tierra de Patagones from the large footsteps observed
                    near his winter quarters at San Julian, and on his passage along the coast named
                    many of the hιore striking features—Bay of San Matias, Bay of Santa Cruz, Cape
                    of 11,000 Virgins (now simply Cape Virgin or De la Vierge), &amp;c. By 1611 the
                    Patagonian god Setebos (Settaboth in Pigafetta) was familiar to the hearers of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Tempest.</hi> Rodrigo de Isla, despatched inland in 1535
                    from San Matias by Alcazava Sotomayor (on whom western Patagonia had been
                    conferred by the king of Spain), was the first to traverse the great Patagonian
                    plain, and, but for the mutiny of his men, he would have struck across the Andes
                    to the Chilian side. Pedro de Mendoza, on whom the country was next bestowed,
                    lived to found Buenos Ayres, but not to carry his explorations to the south.
                    Camargo (1539), Ladrilleros (1557), Hurtado de Mendoza, and Ercilla (1558)
                    helped to make known the western coasts, and Drake’s voyage in 1577 down the
                    eastern coast through the strait and northward by Chili and Peru was memorable
                    for several reasons; but the geography of Patagonia owes more to Pedro Sarmiento
                    de Gamboa, who, devoting himself especially to the southwest region, made such
                    careful and accurate surveys that from twenty to thirty of the names which he
                    affixed still appear in maps (Kohl). The settlements which he founded at Nombre
                    de Dios and San Felipe were neglected by the Spanish Government, and the latter
                    was in such a miserable state when Thomas Cavendish visited it in 1587 that he
                    called it Port Famine. The district in the neighbourhood of Port Desire,
                    explored by John Davis about <pb break="no"

                    John Narborough in name of King Charles 11. in 1669. In the latter half of the
                    18th century our knowledge about Patagonia was considerably augmented by Byron
                    (1764-65), Wallis (1766), Bougainville (1766); Thomas Falkner, a Jesuit who
                    “resided near forty years in those parts,” published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Description of Patagonia</hi> (Hereford, 1774); Francesco Viedma founded El
                    Carmen, and Antonio advanced inland to the Andes (1782); and Villarino ascended
                    the Rio Negro (1782). The “Beagle” and “Adventure” expeditions under King
                    (1826-30) and Fitzroy (1832-36) were of first-rate importance, the latter
                    especially from the participation of Charles Darwin; but of the interior of the
                    country nothing was observed except 200 miles of the course of the Santa Cruz.
                    Captain Musters wandered in company with a band of natives through the whole
                    length of the country from the strait to the Manzaneros in the north-west, and
                    collected a great deal of information about the people and their mode of life.
                    Since that date explorations of a more scientific character have been carried on
                    by Moreno (1873-80), Rogers (1877), Lista (1878-80), and Moyano (1880, &amp;c.
                    ), a convenient survey of which will be found in <hi rend="italic"
