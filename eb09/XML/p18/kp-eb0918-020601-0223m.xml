                    the Pamphylians and Pisidians were really the same people, though the former had
                    received colonies from Greece and other lands, and from this cause, combined
                    with the greater fertility of their territory, had attained a higher degree of
                    civilization and more refinement than their neighbours of the interior. But the
                    distinction between the two seems to have been established at an early period.
                    Herodotus, who does not mention the Pisidians at all, enumerates the Pamphylians
                    among the nations of Asia Minor, while Ephorus mentions them both, correctly
                    including the one among the nations on the coast, the other among those of the
                    interior. Strabo distinctly describes the position of Pamphylia as - given
                    above, and assigns as its limits the pass of Mount Climax on the west, and the
                    fortress of Coracesium, which belonged to Cilicia, on the east. Under the Roman
                    administration the term Pamphylia was extended so as to include Pisidia and the
                    whole tract up to the frontiers of Phrygia and Lycaonia, and in this wider sense
                    it is employed by Ptolemy.</p>
                <p>Pamphylia is in one respect a country of peculiar character: although it consists
                    almost entirely of a plain, extending from the slopes of Mount Taurus to the
                    sea, this plain, though presenting an unbroken level to the eye, does not
                    consist, as in most similar cases, of alluvial deposits, but is formed almost
                    wholly of travertine. “The rivers pouring out of the caverns at the base of the
                    Lycian and Pisidian ranges of the Taurus come forth from their subterranean
                    courses charged with carbonate of lime, and are continually adding to the
                    Pamphylian plain. They build up natural aqueducts of limestone, and after
                    flowing for a time on these elevated beds burst their walls and take a new
                    course. Consequently it is very difficult to reconcile the accounts of this
                    district, as transmitted by ancient authors, with its present aspect, and the
                    distribution of the streams which water it. By the sea-side the travertine forms
                    cliffs from 20 to 80 feet high” (Forbes’s <hi rend="italic">Lycia,</hi> vol. ii.
                    p. 188). Strabo describes a river which he terms Catarractes as a large stream
                    falling with a great noise over a lofty cliff, but for the reason above given it
                    cannot now be identified with certainty. He places it between Olbia and Attalia,
                    where there is now no river of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n224/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0224-0207"/> any importance. East of the latter city is the
                    Cestrus, and beyond that again the Eurymedon, both of which are considerable
                    streams, navigable for some distance from the sea. Near the mouth of the latter
                    is a lake called Caprias, mentioned by Strabo, but it is a mere salt marsh.</p>
                <p>The chief towns on the coast are—Olbia, the first town in Pamphylia, near the
                    Lycian frontier; Attalia, founded by Attalus II., king of Pergamus, which still
                    retains the name of Adalia, and is the principal port in this part of Asia
                    Minor; and Side, about 15 miles east of the Eurymedon. On a hill above that
                    river, some distance inland, stood Aspendus, and in a similar position above the
                    river Cestrus was Perga, celebrated for its temple of Artemis. Between the two
                    rivers, but somewhat farther inland, stood Sylleum, a strong fortress, which
                    even ventured to defy the arms of Alexander. None of these towns are
                    historically known to have been Greek colonies; but the foundation of Aspendus
                    was traditionally ascribed to the Argives, and Side was said to be a colony from
                    Cyme in Aeolis. But it is certain that the inhabitants, even of these towns,
                    retained little of a Hellenic character, and spoke a semi-barbarous dialect. The
                    legend related by Herodotus and Strabo, which ascribed the origin of the
                    Pamphylians to a colony led into their country by Amphilochus and Calcha¾,after
                    the Trojan War, is merely one of those mythical fictions current among the
                    Greeks with regard to so many non-Hellenic races. The coins of Aspendus, though
                    of Greek character, present us with legends in a barbarous dialect.</p>
                <p>The Pamphylians never appear in history as an independent people. They are first
                    mentioned among the nations subdued by the kings of Lydia, and afterwards passed
                    in succession under the dominion of the Persian and Macedonian monarchs. After
                    the defeat of Antiochus III. in 190 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> they were
                    included among the provinces annexed by the Romans to the dominions of Eumenes,
                    king of Pergamum; but at a somewhat later period they joined with their
                    neighbours the Pisidians and Cilicians in their piratical ravages, and their
                    port of Side became the chief centre of the naval power of these freebooters,
                    and the place where the captives were sold as slaves. Pamphylia was for a short
                    time included in the dominions of Amyntas, king of Galatia, but after the death
                    of that monarch lapsed into the ordinary condition of a Roman province, and its
                    name is not again mentioned in history.</p>
