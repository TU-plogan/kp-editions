                    been ruled with a black-lead pencil; but the first distinct allusion to the
                    common form of the instrument occurs in the treatise on fossils by Conrad Gesner
                    of Zurich (1565), who describes an article for writing formed of wood and a
                    piece of lead, or, as he believed, an artificial composition called by some <hi
                    rend="italic">stimrni anglicamπn</hi> (English antimony). The famous Borrowdale
                    mine in Cumberland having been discovered about that time, it is probable that
                    we have here the first allusion to that great find of graphite which for so long
                    supplied the world with its best lead pencils. While the supply of the
                    Cumberland mine lasted, the material for the highly-esteemed English pencils
                    consisted simply of the native graphite as taken from the mine. The pieces were
                    sawn into thin veneers, which again were cut into the slender square rods
                    forming the “lead” of the pencil. These leads were either cased in pencil cedar
                    (the wood of the Virginian cedar, <hi rend="italic">Juniperus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">virginianaf</hi> forming ordinary pencils, or they were, by an
                    ingenious and delicate process of turning, in which ruby-cutters were used,
                    rendered circular to supply the “ever-pointed pencils,” which, however, are of
                    comparatively modern origin.</p>
                <p>Strenuous efforts were made on the Continent and in England to enable
                    manufacturers to become independent of the product of the Cumberland mine. In
                    Nuremberg, where the great pencil factory of the Faber family was established in
                    1761, pencils were made from pulverized graphite cemented into solid blocks by
                    means of gums, resins, glue, sulphur, and other such substances, but none of
                    these preparations yielded useful pencils. About the year 1795 Conté of Paris
                    devised the process by which now all black-lead pencils, and indeed pencils of
                    all sorts, are manufactured. In 1843 Mr Brockedon patented a process for
                    compressing pure black-lead powder into solid compact blocks by which he was
                    enabled to use the dust, fragments, and cuttings of fine Cumberland lead. He
                    submitted the powdered substance to enormous pressure, and, by concurrently
                    exhausting the air from the dies and the block of graphite in process of
                    compression, he succeeded in forming a dense compact and uniform cake which
                    could be treated in the same way as natural massive graphite from the mine.
                    Brockedon’s process would have proved successful and important had the supply of
                    fine English black lead continued, but the exhaustion of the Borrowdale supplies
                    and the excellence of Conté’s process have rendered it more of scientific
                    interest than of commercial value.</p>
                <p>The pencil leads prepared by the Conté process consist of a most intimate mixture
                    of graphite and clay, both first brought to a condition of the finest
                    subdivision. The graphite is reduced to fine powder in a mortar; it is sifted
                    and sometimes treated with mineral acid, to free it from iron, &amp;c., then
                    washed, and thereafter calcined at a bright-red heat. To get it in the condition
                    of fine division, it is mixed with water and poured into a vat, where the
                    heavier particles sink. From this vat the water bearing the lighter particles
                    passes into another at a lower level, and so into one or two more, in each of
                    which the comparatively heavy particles sink, and only the still finer particles
                    are carried over. That which sinks in the last of the series is in a condition
                    of extremely fine division, and is used for pencils of the highest quality. The
                    clay, which must be free of sand and iron, is treated in the same manner, and
                    brought to a state of great uniformity and smoothness. Clay and graphite so
                    prepared are mixed in varying proportions from about equal parts to two of clay
                    for one of graphite according as the pencils are to be hard or soft. They are
                    thoroughly incorporated and ground together, then placed in bags and squeezed in
                    a hydraulic press till they have the consistency of stiff dough, in which
                    condition they are ready for forming pencil rods. For this purpose the plastic
                    mass is placed in a strong upright cylinder of brass, into which a [Junger or
                    piston works, moved by a powerful screw-press. The bottom of the cylinder
                    consists of a thick bronze plate having in it a number of small apertures the
                    section and size of the leads to be made. By the application of pressure to the
                    plunger the graphite mixture is squeezed in continuous threads through the
                    holes, and these threads are received and arranged in straight continuous
                    lengths on a board, on which they are left to dry for some hours. For further
                    drying by gentle heat they are placed in straight grooves in a grooved board,
                    covered with another board, in which position they harden to stiff rods. These
                    are afterwards cut into lengths for pencils, which are packed with charcoal in a
                    covered crucible and submitted to a high furnace-heat. The two elements which
                    regulate the comparative hardness and blackness of pencils are the proportions
                    of graphite and clay in the leads and the heat to which they are raised in the
                    crucible. According as the proportion of graphite is greater and the heat lower
                    the pencil is softer and of deeper black streak.</p>
                <p>The cedar in which pencils are cased is cut into two sets of rectangular slips of
                    unequal thickness; but so that a thick and a thin slip put together form in
                    section a square. In the thick or body piece is formed the groove or depression
                    to receive the lead, which perfectly fits and fills it. The thinner covering
                    piece is glued on and the pencil rounded between revolving cutters working at
                    great speed. The cutters leave the rounded surface perfectly smooth, and it only
                    remains to stamp the finished pencil with name and grade, &amp;c. Very many
                    pencils—but not usually good English qualities—are lacquered or varnished, and
                    have the names, &amp;c., stamped in gold letters.</p>
                <p>Black pencils of an inferior quality are made from the dust of graphite melted up
                    with sulphur and run into moulds. Such, with a little tallow added to give them
                    softness, are the pencils commonly used by carpenters. Coloured pencils consist
                    of a mixture of clay, with appropriate mineral colouring matter, wax, and
                    tallow, treated by the Conté method as in making lead pencils. In the indelible
                    and copying pencils which have come into use in recent years, the colouring
                    matter is an aniline preparation mixed with clay and gum. The mixture not only
                    makes a streak which adheres to the paper, but, when the writing is moistened
                    with water, it dissolves and assumes the appearance and properties of an
                    ink.</p>
                <p>Nuremberg is the great centre of the pencil trade, possessing twenty-six
                    factories which give employment to 5500 persons, the annual output of pencils
                    numbering not less than 250 millions, of a value of upwards of £400,000. (J.
