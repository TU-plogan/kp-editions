                    70,753. The city is a picturesque one, with arcaded streets and many bridges
                    crossing the various branches of the Bacchiglione, which once surrounded the
                    ancient walls. The Palazzo della Ragione, with its great hall on the upper
                    floor, is reputed to have the largest roof unsupported by columns in Europe; the
                    hall is nearly rectangular, its length 267⅜ feet, its breadth 89 feet, and its
                    height 78 feet; the walls are covered with symbolical paintings in fresco; the
                    building stands upon arches, and the upper story is surrounded by an open
                    loggia, not unlike that which surrounds the basilica of Vicenza; the Palazzo was
                    begun in 1172, and finished in 1219; in 1306 Fra Giovanni, an Augustinian friar,
                    covered the whole with one roof; originally there were three roofs, spanning the
                    three chambers into which the hall was at first divided; the internal partition
                    walls remained till the fire of 1420, when the Venetian architects who undertook
                    the restoration removed them, throwing all three compartments into one, and
                    forming the present great hall. In the Piazza dei Signori is the beautiful
                    loggia called the Gran Guardia, begun in 1493 and finished in 1526, and close by
                    is the Palazzo del Capitanio, the residence of the Venetian governors, with its
                    great door, the work of Falconetto of Verona, 1532. The most famous of the
                    Paduan churches is the basilica dedicated to Saint Anthony, commonly called II
                    Santo; the bones of the saint rest in a chapel richly ornamented with carved
                    marbles, the work of various artists, among them of Sansovino and Falconetto;
                    the basilica was begun about the year 1230, and completed in the following
                    century; tradition says that the building was designed by Niccola Pisano; it is
                    covered by seven cupolas, two of them pyramidal. On the piazza in front of the
                    church is Donatello’s magnificent equestrian statue of Erasmo da Narni, the
                    Venetian general (1438-41). The Eremitani is an Augustinian church of the 13th
                    century, distinguished as containing the tombs of Jacopo (1324) and Ubertino
                    (1345) da Carrara, lords of Padua, and for the chapel of Sts James and
                    Christopher, illustrated by Mantegna’s frescos. Close by the Eremitani is the
                    small church of the Annunziata, known as the Madonna dell’ Arena, whose inner
                    walls are entirely covered with paintings by Giotto. Padua has long been famous
                    for its university, founded by Frederick II. in 1238. Under the rule of Venice
                    the university was governed by a board of three·* patricians called the
                    Riformatori dello Studio di Padova. The list of professors and alumni is long
                    and illustrious, containing, among others, the names of Bembo, Sperone Speroni,
                    Veselius, Acquapendente, Galileo, Pomponazzi, Pole, Scaliger, Tasso, and
                    Sobieski. The place of Padua in the history of art is nearly as important as her
                    place in the history of learning. The presence of the university attracted many
                    distinguished artists, as Giotto, Lippo Lippi, and Donatello; and for native art
                    there was the school of Squarcione (1394-1474), whence issued the great Mantegna
                    (1431-1506).</p>
                <p>Padua claims to be the oldest city in north Italy; the inhabitants pretend to a
                    fabulous descent from the Trojan Antenor, whose relics they recognized in a
                    large stone sarcophagus exhumed in the year 1274. Their real origin is involved
                    in that obscurity which conceals the ethnography of the earliest settlers in the
                    Venetian plain; but it is supposed that they were either Paphlagonians or
                    Etruscans. Padua early became a populous and thriving city, thanks to its
                    excellent breed of horses and the wool of its sheep. Its men fought for the
                    Romans at Cannae, and the city became so powerful that it was reported able to
                    raise two hundred thousand fighting men. Abano in the neighbourhood was made
                    illustrious by the birth of Livy, and Padua was the native place of Valerius
                    Flaccus, Asconius Pedianus, and Thrasea Paetus. Padua, in common with
                    north-eastern Italy, suffered severely from the invasion of the Huns under
                    Attila (452). It then passed under the Gothic kings Odoacer and Theodoric, but
                    made submission to the Greeks in 540. The city was seized again by the Goths
                    under Totila, and again restored to the eastern empire by Narses in 568.
                    Following the course of events common to most cities of north-eastern Italy, the
                    history of Padua falls under eight heads:—(1) the Lombard rule, (2) the Frankish
                    rule, (3) the period of the bishops, (4) the emergence of the commune, (5) the
                    period of the despots, (6) the period of Venetian supremacy, (7) the period of
                    Austrian supremacy, and finally (8) the period of united Italy. (1) Under the
                    Lombards the city of Padua rose in revolt (601) against Agilulph, the Lombard
                    king, and, after suffering a long and bloody siege, was stormed and burned by
                    him. The city did not easily recover from this blow, and Padua was still weak
                    when the Franks succeeded the Lombards as masters of north Italy. (2) At the
                    diet of Aix-la-Chapelle (828) the duchy and march of Friuli, in which Padua lay,
                    was divided into four counties, one of which took its title from that city. (3)
                    During the period of episcopal supremacy Padua does not appear to have been
                    either very important or very active. The general tendency of its policy,
                    throughout the war of investitures, was imperial and not Roman; and its bishops
                    were, for the most part, Germans. (4) But tinder the surface two important
                    movements were taking place. At the beginning of the 11th century the citizens
                    established a constitution composed of a general council or legislative assembly
                    and a credenza or executive; and during the next century they were engaged in
                    wars with Venice and Vicenza for the right of water-way on the Bacchiglione and
                    the Brenta,—so that, on the one hand, the city grew in power and self-reliance,
                    while, on the other, the great families of Camposampiero, D’Este, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n147/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0147-0132"/> and Da Romano began to emerge and to divide the
                    Paduan district between them. The citizens, in order to protect their liberties,
                    were obliged to elect a podestà, and their choice fell first on one of the
                    D’Este family (c. 1175). The temporary success of the Lombard league helped to
                    strengthen the towns; but their ineradicable jealous} <hi rend="superscript">
                    7</hi> of one another soon reduced them to weakness again, so that in 1236
                    Frederick II. found little difficulty in establishing his vicar Ezzelino da
                    Romano in Padua and the neighbouring cities, where he practised frightful
                    cruelties on the inhabitants. When Ezzelino met his death, in 1259, Padua
                    enjoyed a brief period of rest and prosperity: the university flourished; the
                    basilica of the saint was begun; the Paduans became masters of Vicenza. But this
                    advance brought them into dangerous proximity to Can Grande della Scala, lord of
                    Verona, to whom they had to yield in 1311.</p>
                <p>(5) As a reward for freeing the city from the Scalas, Jacopo da Carrara was
                    elected lord of Padua in 1318. From that date till 1405, with the exception of
                    two years (1388-90) when Gian Galeazzo Visconti held the town, nine members of
                    the Carrara family succeeded one another as lords of the city. It was a long
                    period of restlessness, for the Carraresi were constantly at war; they were
                    finally extinguished between the growing power of the Visconti and of Venice.
                    (6) Padua passed under Venetian rule in 1405, and so remained, with a brief
                    interval during the wars of the league of Cambray, till the fall of the republic
                    in 1797. The city was governed by two Venetian nobles, a podestà for civil and a
                    captain for military affairs; each of these was elected for sixteen months.
                    Under these governors the great and small councils continued to discharge
                    municipal business and to administer the Paduan law, contained in the statutes
                    of 1276 and 1362. The treasury was managed by two chamberlains; and every five
                    years the Paduans sent one of their nobles to reside as nuncio in Venice, and to
                    watch the interests of his native town. (7 and 8) After the fall of the Venetian
                    republic the history of Padua follows the history of Venice during the periods
                    of French and Austrian supremacy, and must be sought for in the article <hi
