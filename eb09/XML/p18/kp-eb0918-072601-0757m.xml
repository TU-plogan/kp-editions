                    (1797-1858), traveller, was born at Vienna, the daughter of a merchant named
                    Reyer, 14th October 1797. Ida was the only sister of six brothers, and in her
                    youth acquired masculine habits. Her training was Spartan, and accustomed her to
                    the endurance of hardships and deprivations. On 1st May 1820 she married Dr
                    Pfeiffer, a prosperous advocate of Lemberg, twenty-four years older than
                    herself. Through over-zeal in denouncing abuses her husband incurred official
                    persecution, and in a few years after his marriage was reduced to the greatest
                    poverty. Ida, living mostly apart from her husband, underwent great drudgery,
                    but, through her own exertions, managed to educate her two sons. After being
                    relieved of this responsibility she resolved to indulge her intense longing to
                    travel, and, with the most limited means, succeeded in making a series of
                    journeys which, in extent, are probably unparalleled in the case of any other
                    woman. In 1842 Madame Pfeiffer visited Egypt and Palestine, and, with
                    considerable hesitation, published an account of her journey in three small
                    volumes, <hi rend="italic">Reise einer Wienerin</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">das Heilige</hi><hi rend="italic">Land,</hi> in 1845. In the same
                    year she set out again, this time to Scandinavia and Iceland, describing her
                    tour in two volumes, <hi rend="italic">Reise nach</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >deni</hi><hi rend="italic">Skandinavischen</hi><hi rend="italic">Norden</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">der Insel</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Island</hi> (Pesth, 1846). In 1846 she started on her first journey round, the
                    world, visiting Brazil, Chili, and other countries of South America, Tahiti,
                    China, India, Persia, Asia Minor, and Greece, and reaching home in 1848. The
                    results were published in three volumes at Vienna in 1850, under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">Eine Frauenfahrt</hi><hi rend="italic">urn die Welt.</hi> For her
                    next and most extensive journey she received the support of the Austrian
                    Government to the small extent of <hi rend="italic">£1</hi> 50. Starting in
                    1851, she went by London to South Africa, her purpose being to penetrate into
                    the interior; but, this proving impracticable, she proceeded to the Malay
                    Archipelago, spending eighteen months in the Sunda Islands and the Moluccas.
                    After a visit to Australia, Madame Pfeiffer proceeded to California, Oregon,
                    Peru, Ecuador, New Granada, the Missiones Territory, and north again to the
                    American lakes, reaching home in 1854. Her narrative, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Meine</hi><hi rend="italic">zweite</hi><hi rend="italic">Weltreise,</hi> was
                    published in four volumes at Vienna in 1856. In May of the same year Ida set out
                    to explore Madagascar, where at first she was cordially received by the queen.
                    Unfortunately, she unwittingly allowed herself to be involved in the plot of a
                    Frenchman to overthrow the government, and, with brutal treatment, was expelled
                    from the country. After being detained by her sufferings in Mauritius for some
                    months, Ida returned by England to Vienna, where she died 27th October 1858. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Reise nach</hi><hi rend="italic">Madagascar</hi> was issued in
                    1861, with a biography by her son.</p>
                <p>All Madame Pfeiffer’s narratives have been translated into English as well as
                    other languages, and have maintained a steady popularity up to the present time.
                    Although Ida Pfeiffer can hardly be said to have broken up new ground in her
                    travels, she certainly did much to increase our knowledge of countries about
                    which our information was most meagre. Moreover, her scientific collections— for
                    she was as good a collector as observer—were of considerable extent, and great
                    value and novelty, and were regarded as important acquisitions by the Vienna
                    museum. She was made an honorary member of the Berlin and Paris Geographical
                    Societies, and received from the king of Prussia the gold medal of science and
                    art. Her travels altogether covered 150,000 miles by sea and 20,000 by land. Ida
                    Pfeiffer was short in stature, and latterly slightly bent; her manners were
                    simple, unassuming, and womanly.</p>
