                    Cythera. When the island was conquered by the Athenians in 424 Philoxenus was
                    sold as a slave to Agesylas, who gave him the name of Myrmex (“ant”). On the

                    made no reply but “Take me away to the quarries.” He is said to have quitted
                    Sicily in disgust at the luxury and vulgarity of the people, abandoning an
                    estate which he owned in the island. From Sicily he seems to have gone to
                    Tarentum, and thence perhaps to Corinth. He visited Colophon in Asia Minor and
                    died at Ephesus in 380. According to Suidas, Philoxenus composed twenty-four
                    dithyrambs and a lyric poem on the genealogy of the Aeacidae. In his hands the
                    dithyramb seems to have been a burlesque drama in verse, which was acted and
                    sung to the accompaniment of elaborate instrumental music and enlivened <pb

                    opera. The music, which Philoxenus himself composed, appears to have been of a
                    debased, Offenbachian character. His masterpiece was the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cyclops or</hi><hi rend="italic">Galatea,</hi> a pastoral burlesque on the love
                    of the Cyclops for the fair Galatea. Its general style may probably be gathered
                    from the sixth idyl of Theocritus. The work must have been well known before
                    388, for it was parodied by Aristophanes in his play the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plutus,</hi> performed in that year. Another work of Philoxenus, sometimes
                    attributed to a notorious parasite and glutton of the same name, is the Δείττνου
                    (Dinner), of which considerable fragments have been preserved by Athenaeus. This
                    poem, of which the text is very obscure and corrupt, is little more than an
                    elaborate bill of fare put into verse, and, as such, possesses more interest for
                    cooks than scholars. In the time of Aristotle it was the one book read by the
                    Athenian quidnuncs. The great popularity enjoyed by Philoxenus is attested not
                    only by the allusions to him in the comic poets of his day but also by a
                    complimentary resolution passed by the Athenian senate in 393 on the motion of
                    the dithyrambic poet Cinesias. The intention of the decree was doubtless mainly
                    political—to propitiate Dionysius—but the poet was included in it. Nor was his
                    popularity transient: the poet Antipha.nes of the Middle Comedy spoke of
                    Philoxenus as a god among men; Alexander the Great had his poems sent to him in
                    Asia along with the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides; the
                    Alexandrian grammarians received him into the canon; and down to the time of
                    Polybius his works λvere regularly learned and annually acted by the Arcadian
                    youth. The scanty fragments of his works are to be found in Bergk’s <hi
