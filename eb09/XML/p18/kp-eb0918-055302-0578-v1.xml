                    significance does not mean simply a machine which will go on moving for ever,
                    but a machine which, once set in motion, will go on doing useful work without
                    drawing on any external source of energy, or a machine which in every complete
                    cycle of its operation will give forth more energy than it has absorbed.
                    Briefly, a perpetual motion usually means a machine which will create
                    energy.</p>
                <p>The earlier seekers after the “perpetuum mobile” did not always appreciate the
                    exact nature of their quest; for we find among their ideals a clock that would
                    periodically rewind itself, and thus go without human interference as long as
                    its machinery would last. The energy created by such a machine would simply be
                    the work done in overcoming the friction of its parts, so that its projectors
                    might be held merely to have been ignorant of the laws of friction and of the
                    dynamic theory of heat. Most of the perpetual motionists, however, had more
                    practical views, and explicitly declared the object of their inventions to be
                    the doing of useful work, such as raising water, grinding corn, and so on. Like
                    the exact quadrature of the circle, the transmutation of metals, and other
                    famous problems of antiquity, the perpetual motion has now become a venerable
                    paradox. Still, like these others, it retains a great historical interest. Just
                    as some of the most interesting branches of modern pure mathematics sprang from
                    the problem of squaring the circle, as the researches of the alchemists
                    developed into the science of modern chemistry, so, as the result of the vain
                    search after the perpetual motion, there grew up the greatest of all the
                    generalizations of physical science, the principle of the conservation of
                    energy.</p>
                <p>There was a time when the problem of the perpetual motion was one worthy of the
                    attention of a philosopher. Before that analysis of the action of ordinary
                    machines which led to the laws of dynamics, and the discussion of the dynamical
                    interdependence of natural phenomena which accompanied the establishment of the
                    dynamical theory of heat, there was nothing plainly unreasonable in the idea
                    that work might be done by the mere concatenation of machinery. It had not then
                    been proved that energy is uncreatable and indestructible in the ordinary course
                    of nature; even now that proof has only been given by induction from long
                    observation of facts. There was a time when wise men believed that a spirit,
                    whose maintenance would cost nothing, could by magic art be summoned from the
                    deep to do his master’s work; and it was just as reasonable to suppose that a
                    structure of wood, brass, and iron could be found to work under like conditions.
                    The disproof is in both cases alike. No such spirit has ever existed, save in
                    the imagination of his describer, and no such machine has ever been known to
                    act, save in the fancy of its inventor.</p>
                <p>Tlιe principle of the conservation of energy, which in one sense is simply a
                    denial of the possibility of a perpetual motion, rests on facts drawn from every
                    branch of physical science; and, although its full establishment is not half a
                    century old, yet so numerous are the cases in which it has been tested, so
                    various the deductions from it that have been proved to accord with experience,
                    that it is now regarded as one of the best-established laws of nature.
                    Consequently, on any one who calls it in question is thrown the burden of
                    proving his case. If any machine were produced whose source of energy could not
                    at once be traced, a man of science (complete freedom of investigation being
                    supposed) would in the first place try to trace its power to some hidden source
                    of a kind already known; or in the last resort he would seek for a source of
                    energy of a new kind and give it a new name. Any assertion of creation of energy
                    by means of a mere machine would have to be authenticated in many instances, and
                    established by long investigation, before it could be received in modern
                    science. The case is precisely as with the law of gravitation; if any apparent
                    exception to this were observed in the case of some heavenly body, astronomers,
                    instead of denying the law, would immediately seek to explain the occurrence by
                    a wider application of it, say by including in their calculations the effect of
                    some disturbing body hitherto neglected. If a man likes to indulge the notion
                    that, after all, an exception to the law of the conservation of energy may be
                    found, and, provided he submits his idea to the test of experiment at his own
                    charges without annoying his neighbours, all that can be said is that he is
                    engaged in an unpromising enterprise. The case is otherwise with the projector
                    who comes forward with some machine which claims by the mere ingenuity of its
                    contrivance to multiply the energy supplied to it from some of the ordinary
                    sources of nature and sets to work to pester scientific men to examine his
                    supposed discovery, or attempts therewith to induce the credulous to waste their
                    money. This is by far the largest class of perpetual-motion-mongers nowadays.
                    The interest of such cases is that attaching to the morbid anatomy of the human
                    mind. Perhaps the most striking feature about them is the woful sameness of the
                    symptoms of their madness. As a body perpetual-motion seekers are ambitious,
                    lovers of the short path to wealth and fame, but wholly superficial. Their
                    inventions are very rarely characterized even by mechanical ingenuity. Sometimes
                    indeed the inventor has simply bewildered himself by the complexity of his
                    device; but in most cases the machines of the perpetual motionist are of
                    child-like simplicity, remarkable only for the extraordinary assertions of the
                    inventor concerning them. Wealth of ideas there is none; simply assertions that
                    such and such a machine solves the problem, although an identical contrivance
                    has been shown to do no such thing by the brutal test of standing still in the
                    hands of many previous inventors. Hosts of the seekers for the perpetual motion
                    have attacked their insoluble problem with less than a schoolboy’s share of the
                    requisite knowledge; and their confidence as a rule is in proportion to their
                    ignorance. Very often they get no farther than a mere prospectus, on the
                    strength of which they claim some imaginary reward, or offer their precious
                    discovery for sale; sometimes they get the length of a model which wants only
                    the last perfection (already in the inventor’s brain) to solve the great
                    problem; sometimes fraud is made to supply the motive-power which their real or
                    pretended efforts have failed to discover.</p>
                <p>It was no doubt the barefaced fallacy of most of the plans for perpetual motion
                    that led the majority of scientific men to conclude at a very early date that
                    the “perpetuum mobile” was an impossibility. We find the Parisian Academy of
                    Sciences refusing, as early as 1775, to receive schemes for the perpetual
                    motion, which they class with solutions of the duplication of the cube, the
                    trisection of an angle, and the quadrature of the circle. Stevinus and Leibnitz
                    seem to have regarded its impossibility as axiomatic; and Newton at the
                    beginning of his <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> states, so far as ordinary
                    mechanics are concerned, a principle which virtually amounts to the same thing
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mechanics,</hi> vol. xv. p. 715).</p>
                <p>The famous proof of De la Hire simply refers to some of the more common
                    gravitational perpetual motions, to which we shall refer shortly. The truth is,
                    as we have said already, that, if proof is to be given, or considered <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n579/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0918-0579-0554"/> necessary, it must proceed by induction from
                    all physical phenomena.</p>
                <p>It would serve no useful purpose here to give an exhaustive historical account of
                    the vagaries of mankind in pursuit of the “perpetuum mobile.” The reader may
                    consult on this subject the two volumes by Henry Dircks, C.E., published by E.
                    and F. N. Spon, London, 1861 and 1870, from which, for the most part, we select
                    the following facts to give the reader some idea of this department of the
                    history of human fallibility.</p>
                <p>By far the most numerous class of perpetual motions is that which seeks to
                    utilize the action of gravity upon rigid solids. We have not read of any actual
                    proposal of the kind, but the most obvious thing to imagine in this way would be
                    to procure some substance which intercepts gravitational attraction. If this
                    could be had, then, by introducing a plate of it underneath a body while it was
                    raised, we could elevate the body without doing work; then, removing the plate,
                    we could allow the body to fall and do work; eccentrics or other imposing device
                    being added to move the gravitation intercepter, behold a perpetual motion
                    complete! The great difficulty is that no one has found the proper material for
                    an intercepter.</p>
                <p>Fig. 1 represents one of the most ancient and oftenest-repeated of gravitational
                    perpetual motions. The idea is that the balls rolling in the compartments
                    between the felloe and the rim of the wheel will, on the whole, so comport
                    themselves that the moment about the centre of those on the descending side
                    exceeds the moment of those on the ascending side. Endless devices, such as
                    curved spokes, levers with elbowjoints, eccentrics, &lt;fcc., have been proposed
                    for effecting this impossibility. The modern student of dynamics at once
                    convinces himself that no machinery can effect any such result; because, if we
                    give the wheel a complete turn, so that each ball returns to its original
                    position, the whole work done by the ball will, at the most, equal that done on
                    it. If we were to start the wheel and balls in the most general way possible, we
                    should doubtless have a very pretty problem to solve; but we know that, if the
                    laws of motion be true, in each step the kinetic energy given to the whole
                    system of wheel and balls is equal to that taken from the potential energy of
                    the balls less what is dissipated in the form of heat by frictional forces, or
                        <hi rend="italic">nice versa,</hi> if the wheel and balls be losing kinetic
                    energy,—save that the friction in both cases leads to dissipation. So that,
                    whatever the system may lose, it can, after it is left to itself, never gain
                    energy during its motioη.</p>
                <p>The two most famous perpetual motions of history, viz., the wheels of the marquis
                    of Worcester and of Councillor Orffyreus were, probably of this type. The
                    marquis of Worcester gives the following account of his machine in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Century of Inventions</hi> (art. 56).</p>
                <p>“To provide and make that all the Weights of the descending side of a Wheel shall
                    be perpetually further from the Centre than those of the mounting side, and yet
                    equal in number and heft to the one side as the other. A most incredible thing,
                    if not seen, but tried before the late king (of blessed memory) in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Tower,</hi> by my directions, two Extraordinary Embassadors
                    accompanying His Majesty, and the Duke of <hi rend="italic">Richmond,</hi> and
                    Duke <hi rend="italic">Hamilton,</hi> with most of the Court, attending Him. The
                    Wheel was 14. Foot over, and 40. Weights of 50. pounds apiece. Sir <hi
                        rend="italic">William</hi><hi rend="italic">Bdlfore,</hi> then Lieutenant of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Tower,</hi> can justify it, with several others. They all
                    saw, that no sooner these great Weights passed the Diameterline of the lower
                    side, but they hung a foot further from the Centre, nor no sooner passed the
                    Diameter-line of the upper side but they hung a foot nearer. Be pleased to judge
                    the consequence.”</p>
                <p>Orffyreus (whose real name was Bessler) also obtained distinguished patronage for
                    his invention. His last wheel, for he appears to have constructed more than one,
                    was 12 feet in diameter and 1 foot 2 inches broad; it consisted of a light
                    framework of wood covered in with oil-cloth so that the interior was concealed,
                    and was mounted on an axle which had no visible connexion with any external
                    mover. It was examined and approved of by the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, in
                    whose castle at Weissenstein it is said to have gone for eight weeks in a sealed
                    room. The most remarkable thing about this machine is that it evidently imposed
                    upon the mathematician ’s Gravesande, who wrote a letter to Newton giving an
                    account of his examination of Orffyreus’s wheel undertaken at the request of the
                    landgrave, wherein he professes himself dissatisfied with the proofs theretofore
                    given of the impossibility of perpetual motion, and indicates his opinion that
                    the invention of Orffyreus is worthy of investigation. He himself, however, was
                    not allowed to examine the interior of the wheel. The inventor seems to have
                    destroyed it himself. One story is that he did so on account of difficulties
                    with the landgrave’s Government as to a licence for it; another that he was
                    annoyed at the examination by ’s Gravesande, and wrote on the wall of the room
                    containing the fragments of his model that he had destroyed it because of the
                    impertinent curiosity of Professor ’s Gravesande.</p>
                <p>The history of this case is noteworthy, because it contains all the characters
                    that usually appear in such comedies even now,—the fraudulent paradoxer, the
                    illustrious and intelligent patron, the simple-minded, unbiassed, scientific
                    witness.</p>
                <p>It is worthy of remark that the overbalancing-wheel perpetual motion seems to be
                    as old as the 13th century. In his second series Dircks quotes an account of an
                    invention by Wilars de Honecort, an architect whose sketch-book is still
                    preserved in the Écoles des Chartes at Paris. De Honecort says, “Many a time
                    have skilful workmen tried to contrive a wheel that shall turn of itself; here
                    is a way to do it by means of an uneven number of mallets, or by quicksilver.”
                    He thereupon gives a rude sketch of a wheel with mallets jointed to its
                    circumference. It would appear from some of the manuscripts of Leonardo da Vinci
                    that he had worked with similar notions.</p>
                <p>Another scheme of the perpetual motionist is a waterwheel which shall feed its
                    own mill-stream. This notion is probably as old as the first miller who
                    experienced the difficulty of a dry season. One form is figured in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Mathematical Magic</hi> of Bishop Wilkins (1614-1672); the
                    essential part of it is the water-screw of Archimedes, which appears in many of
                    the earlier machines of this class. Some of the later ones dispense with even
                    the subtlety of the water-screw, and boldly represent a water-wheel pumping the
                    water upon its own buckets.</p>
                <p>Perpetual motions founded on the hydrostatical paradox are not uncommon; Papin,
                    the well-known inventorof the digester, exposes one of these in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1685. The most naive of
                    these devices is that illustrated in fig. 2, the idea of which is that the
                    larger quantity of water in the wider part of the vessel weighing more will
                    overbalance the smaller quantity in the narrower part, so that the water will
                    run over at C, and so on continually.</p>
                <p>Capillary attraction has also been a favourite field for <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n580/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0918-0580-0555"/> the vain quest; for, if by capillary action
                    fluids can be made to disobey the law of never rising above their own level,
                    what so easy as thus to produce a continual ascent and overflow, and thus
                    perpetual motion? Various schemes of this kind, involving an endless band which
                    should raise more water by its capillary action on one side than on the other,
                    have been proposed. The most celebrated is that of Sir William Congreve, who
                    invented the rockets that bear his name. EFG- (fig. 3) is an inclined plane over
                    pulleys; at the top and bottom travels an endless band of sponge, <hi
                        rend="italic">abed,</hi> and over this again an endless band of heavy
                    weights jointed together. The whole stands over the surface of still water. The
                    capillary action raises the water in <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> whereas the same
                    thing cannot happen in the part <hi rend="italic">ad,</hi> since the weights
                    squeeze the water out. Hence, inch for inch, <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> is
                    heavier than <hi rend="italic">ad;</hi> but we know that if <hi rend="italic"
                        >ab</hi> were only just as heavy inch for inch as <hi rend="italic">ad</hi>
                    there would be equilibrium, if the heavy chain be also uniform; therefore the
                    extra weight of <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> will cause the chain to move round in
                    the direction of the arrow, and this will go on continually,</p>
                <p>The more recondite vehicles of energy, such as electricity and magnetism, are
                    more seldom drawn upon by perpetual-motion inventors than might perhaps be
                    expected. Instances do occur, but devices of this kind have not become a common
                    part of the folklore of nations like the overbalancing wheel and the
                    self-sufficient water-mill. Gilbert, in his treatise <hi rend="italic"
                        >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Magnete,</hi> alludes to some of them, and Bishop
                    Wilkins mentions among others a machine “wherein a loadstone is so disposed that
                    it shall draw unto it on a reclined plane a bullet of steel, which, still as it
                    ascends near to the loadstone, may be contrived to fall through some hole in the
                    plane and so to return unto the place whence at first it began to move, and
                    being there, the loadstone will again attract it upwards, till, coming to this
                    hole, it will fall down again, and so the motion shall be perpetual.” The fact
                    that screens do exist whereby electrical and magnetic action can be cut off
                    would seem to open a door for the perpetual-motion seeker. Unfortunately the
                    bringing up and removing of these screens involves in all cases just that gain
                    or loss of work which is demanded by the inexorable law of the conservation of
                    energy. A shoemaker of Linlithgow called Spence pretended that he had found a
                    black substance which intercepted magnetic attraction and repulsion, and he
                    produced two machines which were moved, as he asserted, by the agency of
                    permanent magnets, thanks to the black substance. The fraud was speedily
                    exposed, but it is worthy of remark that Sir David Brewster thought the thing
                    worth mentioning in a letter to the <hi rend="italic">Annales de Chimie,</hi>
                    1818, wherein he states “that Mr Playfair and Captain Kater have inspected both
                    of these machines and are satisfied that they resolve the problem of perpetual
                    motion.”</p>
                <p>Not very long ago the writer of this article received by post an elaborate
                    drawing of a locomotive engine which was to be worked by the agency of permanent
                    magnets. He forgets the details, but it was not so simple as the plan
                    represented in fig. 4, where Μ and N are permanent magnets, whose attraction is
                    “screened” by the wooden blocks A and B from the upper left and lower right
                    quadrants of the soft iron wheel W, which consequently is attracted round in the
                    same direction by both Μ and N, and thus goes on for ever.</p>
                <p>One more page from this chapter of the book of human folly; the author is the
                    famous John Bernoulli. We translate his Latin, as far as possible, into modern
                    phraseology-</p>
                <p>in the first place we must premise the following (see fig. 5).</p>
                <p>1. If there be. two fluids of different densities whose densities are in the
                    ratio of G to L, the height of equiponderating cylinders on equal bases will be
                    in the inverse ratio of L to G.</p>
                <p>2. Accordingly, if the height AC of one fluid, contained in the vase AD, be in
                    this ratio to the height EF of the other liquid, which is in a tube open at both
                    ends, the liquids so placed will remain at rest.</p>
                <p>3. Wherefore, if AC be to EF in a greater ratio than L to G, the liquid in the
                    tube will ascend; or if the tube be not sufficiently long the liquid will
                    overflow at the orifice E (this follows from hydrostatic principles).</p>
                <p>4. It is possible to have two liquids of different density that will mix.</p>
                <p>5. It is possible to have a filter, colander, or other separator, by means of
                    which the lighter liquid mixed with the heavier may be separated again
                    therefrom.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Construction. —</hi> These things being presupposed, I thus
                    construct a perpetual motion. Let there be taken in any (if you please, in
                    equal) quantities two liquids of different densities mixed together (which may
                    be had by Hyp. 4), and let the ratio of their densities be first determined, and
                    be the heavier to the lighter as G to L, then with the mixture let the vase AD
                    be filled up to A. This done, let the tube EF, open at both ends, be taken of
                    such a length that AC: EF &gt; 2L: G + L; let the lower orifice F of this tube
                    b∣ stopped, or rather covered with the filter or other material separating the
                    lighter liquid from the heavier (which may also be had by Hyp. 5); now let the
                    tube thus prepared be immersed to the bottom of the vessel CD; I say that the
                    liquid will continually ascend through the orifice F of the tube and overflow by
                    the orifice E upon the liquid below.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bemonstratioιι.—</hi> Because the orifice F of the tube is
                    covered by the filter (by constr. ) which separates the lighter liquid from the
                    heavier, it follows that, if the tube be immersed to the bottom of the vessel,
                    the lighter liquid alone which is mixed with the heavier ought to rise through
                    the filter into the tube, and that, too, higher than the surface of the
                    surrounding liquid (by Hyp. 2), so that AC: EF = 2L: G + L; but since (by
                    constr.) AC:EF&gt;2L:G + L it necessarily follows (by Hyp. 3) that the lighter
                    liquid will flow over by the orifice E into the vessel below, and there will
                    meet the heavier and be again mixed with it; and it will then penetrate the
                    filter, again ascend the tube, and be a second time driven through the upper
                    orifice. Thus, therefore, will the flow be continued for ever. Q.E.D.</p>
                <p>He then proceeds to apply this theory to explain the perpetual rise of water to
                    the mountains, and its flow in rivers to the sea, which others had falsely
                    attributed to capillary action,—his idea being that it was an effect of the
                    different densities of salt and fresh water.</p>
                <p>One really is at a loss with Bernoulli’s wonderful theory, whether to admire most
                    the conscientious statement of the hypothesis, the prim logic of the
                    demonstration, so carefully cut according to the pattern of the ancients, or the
                    weighty superstructure built on so frail a foundation. Most of our perpetual
                    motions were clearly the result of too little learning; surely this one was the
                    product of too much. <hi rend="smallcaps">(g. ch.)</hi></p>
