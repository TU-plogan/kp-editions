                    and Tamboff, and having an area of 15,000 square miles. The surface is

                    not reach more than 600 to 900 feet above sealevel. It is chiefly made up of
                    Cretaceous sandstones, sands, marls, and chalk, covered in the east by Eocene
                    deposits. Chalk, potter’s clay, peat, and iron are the chief mineral products,
                    in the north. The soil is a black earth, more or less mixed with clay and sand;
                    the only marshes of any extent occur in the Krasnoslobodsk district; and
                    considerable sand-areas appear in the broad valleys of the larger rivers. There
                    are extensive forests in the north, but the south shows the characteristic
                    features of a steppeland. The government is watered by the Moksha, the Sura
                    (both navigable), and the Khoper, belonging respectively to the Oka, Volga, and
                    Don systems. Timber is floated down several smaller streams, while the Moksha
                    and Sura are important means of conveyance for grain, spirits, timber, metals,
                    and oils. The climate is harsh and continental, the average temperature at Penza
                    being only 39° <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8 (12° <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>The population—1,356,600 in 1881, and in 1884 estimated at about
                    1,465,000—consists principally of Russians, mixed to some extent with
                    Mordvinians; there are also about 150,000 Mordvinians who are to a large extent
                    Russified; some 40,000 Mescheryaks, who have undergone the same process still
                    more fully; and 60,000 Tatars, who still keep their own religion, language, and
                    customs. The Russians profess the Greek faith, and very many, especially in the
                    north, are Raskolniks. Somewhat less than 10 per cent, of the population
                    (133,250 in 1881) live in towns; the chief occupation of the inhabitants is
                    agriculture, 61 per cent, of the soil being arable. Wheat and millet are raised
                    only to a limited extent, the chief crops being rye, oats, buckwheat, hemp,
                    potatoes, and beetroot. The averages for 1870-77 were 3,900,000 quarters of corn
                    and 1,779,200 bushels of potatoes. The chief centres of corn export are Penza,
                    Narovtchat, and Golovinshtchina. Market-gardening is successfully <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0540-0515"/> carried on in several districts, and improved
                    varieties of fruit-trees are being introduced through the imperial botanical
                    garden at Penza and a private school of gardening in the Gorodishtche district.
                    Fourteen per cent, of the area is under meadows or grazing land; and in 1881
                    there were within the government 244,000 head of cattle, 383,000 horses, and
                    235,000 pigs. Sheep-breeding is especially developed in Tchembar and Insar
                    (670,000 sheep, including 72,000 of finer breeds, in 1881). The Mordvinians are
                    very partial to beekeeping. The forests (620,000 acres) are a considerable
                    source of wealth, especially in Krasnoslobodsk and Gorodishtche, whence timber,
                    a variety of wooden wares, and also pitch and tar are exported to the south. As
                    many as 30 per cent, of the adult male population leave the government in search
                    of employment, either on the Volga or in southern Russia.</p>
                <p>The manufactures are few, employing only 13,300 hands. The yearly returns in 1879
                    did not exceed 13,325,000 roubles (£1,332,500). The distilleries come first
                    (£973,200), followed by the woollen cloth industry (£237,000), the paper
                    industry (£37,200), tanneries, soap-works, glass-works, machine-works,
                    iron-works, and beetroot-sugar factories. Trade, which has been favoured by the
                    completion of the railway from Tula to Samara, is still limited to the export of
                    corn, spirits, timber, hemp-seed oil, tallow, hides, honey, wax, some woollen
                    cloth, potash, and cattle, the chief centres for trade being Penza, Nijni
                    Lomoff, Mokshan, Saransk, Krasnoslobodsk, and Golovinshtchina.</p>
                <p>The government is divided into ten districts, the chief towns of which are
                    :—Penza (41,650), Gorodishtche (3200), Insar (5230), Kerensk (12,450),
                    Krasnoslobodsk (7000), Mokshan (13,050), Narovtchat (5150), Nijni Lomoff
                    (10,500), Saransk (13,450), and Tchembar (5320). Troitsk (5700), Verkíinii
                    Lomoff (7300), and Sheshkéeff (3500) also have municipal institutions.</p>
                <p>The present government of Penza was formerly inhabited by Mordvinians, who had
                    the Mescheryaks in the west, the Bulgars in the north, ajιd the Burtases in the
                    south. In the 13th century these populations fell under the dominion of the
                    Tatars, with whom they fought against Moscow. As early as the 14th century they
                    possessed the town of Narovtchat. The Russians penetrated into the country in
                    the 16th century, founding the town of Mokshan in 1535, and several others in
                    the course of that and the following centuries. Penza was founded in the
                    beginning of the 17th century, the permanent Russian settlement dating as far
                    back as 1666. Its wooden fort, on the site of the present cathedral of the
                    Saviour, protected the neighbourhood against risings of the Mordvinians and
                    Mescheryaks. In 1776 it was taken by Pugatcheff. The town was almost totally
                    destroyed by the great conflagrations of 1836, 1839, and 1858.</p>
