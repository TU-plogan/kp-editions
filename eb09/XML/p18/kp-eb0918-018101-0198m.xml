                    than to study. But, being roused by a reproof from one of his companions, he
                    used the remainder of his time to such advantage that he came out senior
                    wrangler at the end of his course. After taking his degree in 1763, Paley was
                    for about three years assistant in a school at Greenwich; but on his election to
                    a fellowship he returned to Cambridge, and became, in 1768, one of the junior
                    tutors of his college. His colleague in this office was John Law, son of Dr
                    Edmund Law, then master of Peterhouse, and afterwards bishop of Carlisle. To the
                    connexion thus formed Paley was afterwards indebted for his first preferments in
                    the church. As tutor at Christ’s, Paley lectured on Locke, Clarke, and Butler,
                    and also delivered a systematic course on moral philosophy, which formed the
                    basis, more than ten years later, of his well-known treatise. The subscription
                    controversy was then agitating the university, and Paley published an anonymous
                    <hi rend="italic">Defence</hi> of a pamphlet in which Bishop Law had advocated
                    the retrenchment and simplification of the thirty-nine articles. But, though
                    Paley was all for “worshipping God in that generality of expression in which He
                    himself has left some points,” he did not see his way to join the petitioners
                    for a relaxation of the terms of subscription. His own view of the articles, as
                    simply “articles of peace,” probably led him to consider their action as a piece
                    of overstrained conscientiousness. In 1776 Paley vacated his fellowship by
                    marriage, and retired to the rectory of Musgrave in Westmoreland, which had been
                    conferred on him the year before by the bishop of Carlisle. This very modest
                    living was soon supplemented by the vicarage of Dalston, and presently exchanged
                    for that of Appleby. In 1782 he became archdeacon of Carlisle on the appointment
                    of the younger Law to an Irish bishopric. His first important work, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Principles of Moral and Political Philosophy,</hi> was
                    published (as <hi rend="italic">Principles of Morality and Politics')</hi> in
                    1785, and Paley received the unusually large sum of &lt;£1000 for the copyright.
                    The book at once became the ethical text-book of the university of Cambridge,
                    and passed through fifteen editions in the author’s lifetime. It was followed in
                    1790 by his first essay in the field of Christian apologetics, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Horae Paulinae,</hi><hi rend="italic">or the Truth of the Scripture History of
                    St Paul evinced by a comparison of the Epistles which bear his name with the
                    Acts of the Apostles and with one another.</hi> Though the original idea of the
                    book was derived from Doddridge, this is probably the most original of its
                    author’s works. It was followed in 1794 by a more general work in the same
                    field, the celebrated <hi rend="italic">View of the Evidences of
                    Christianity.</hi> Paley’s latitudinarian views, combined with a certain homely
                    outspokenness in the <hi rend="italic">Moral and Political Philosophy</hi>
                    regarding the foundations of civil authority (“the divine right of kings is like
                    the divine right of constables ”), are said to have debarred him from the
                    highest positions in the church. But his able defence of the faith brought him
                    substantial acknowledgments from the episcopal bench. The bishop of London gave
                    him a stall in St Paul’s; the bishop of Lincoln made him subdean of that <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n199/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0199-0182"/> diocese; and the bishop of Durham conferred upon
                    him the rectory of Bishop-Wearmouth, worth £1200 a year. Paley transferred his
                    household to Bishop-Wearmouth in 1795. His wife, the mother of eight children,
                    had died four years before, and in the end of 1795 Paley married a second time.
                    During the remainder of his life his time was divided between Bishop-Wearmouth
                    and Lincoln. In 1800 he was attacked by the disease of the kidneys which
                    ultimately carried him off. It was in the intervals of comparative health and
                    ease that remained to him that his last, and in some respects his most
                    remarkable, work was produced, <hi rend="italic">Natural Theology, or Evidences
                    of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity collected from the Appearances of
                    Nature</hi> (1802). He endeavoured, as he says in dedicating the book to the
                    bishop of Durham, to repair in the study his deficiencies in the church. He died
                    on the 25th May 1805.</p>
                <p>In the dedication just referred to, Paley claims a systematic unity for his
                    works. It is true that “they have been written in an order the very reverse of
                    that in which they ought to be read”; nevertheless the <hi rend="italic">Natural
                    Theology</hi> forms “the completion of a regular and comprehensive design.” The
                    truth of this will be apparent if it is considered that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Moral and Political Philosophy</hi> admittedly embodies two presuppositions—(1)
                    that “God Almighty wills and wishes the happiness of His creatures,” and (2)
                    that adequate motives must be supplied to virtue by a system of future rewards
                    and’punishments. Now the second presupposition depends, according to Paley, on
                    the credibility of the Christian religion (which he treats almost exclusively as
                    the revelation of these “new sanctions” of morality). The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Evidences</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Horae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Paulin«.</hi> were inténded as a demonstration of this credibility. The
                    argument of these books, however, depends in turn upon the assumption of a
                    benevolent Creator desirous of communicating with His creatures for their good;
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Natural Theology,</hi> by applying the argument from
                    design to prove the existence of such a Deity, becomes the foundation of the
                    argumentative edifice. The sense of unity in the structure is increased to a
                    reader of the present day by the uniformity of the point of view from which the
                    world is regarded throughout. Paley has popularized for 19th-century use the
                    Deistic conception of the universe and the divine economy which was common
                    ground last century both to the assailants and the defenders of orthodox
                    Christianity. ·</p>
                <p>In his <hi rend="italic">Natural Theology</hi> Paley has adapted with consummate
                    skill the argument which Ray (1691) and Derham (1711) and Nieuwentyt<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Nieuwentyt (1654-1718) was a
                    Dutch disciple of Descartes, whose work, <hi rend="italic">Regt gebrvyk</hi><hi

                    was brought against Paley in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> for 1848.
                    Paley refers several times to Nieuwentyt, who uses the famous illustration of
                    the watch. But the illustration is not peculiar to Nieuwentyt, and had been
                    appropriated by many others before Paley. In the case of a writer whose chief
                    merit is the way in which he has worked up existing material, a general charge
                    of plagiarism is almost irrelevant.</p></note> (1730) had already ι <hi
                    rend="subscript"> t</hi> nade familiar to Englishmen. “For my part,” he says, “I
                    take my stand in human anatomy”; and what he everywhere insists upon is “the
                    necessity, in each particular case, of an intelligent designing mind for the
                    contriving and determining of the.forms which organized bodies bear.” This is
                    the whole argument, and the book consists of a mass of .well-chosen instances
                    marshalled in support of it. But by placing Paley’s facts in a new light, the
                    theory of evolution has deprived his argument of its force, so far as it applies
                    the idea of special contrivance to individual organs or to species. Paley’s idea
                    of contrivance is only applicable if we suppose a highly developed organism to
                    be dropped suddenly into foreign surroundings. But the relation of an organism
                    to its environment is not of this external nature, and the adaptation of the one
                    to the other must be regarded as the result of a long process of interaction in
                    the past history of the species. In thus substituting the operation of general
                    laws for Paley’s continual invocation of a supernatural cause, evolution passes
                    no judgment on the question of tne ultimate dependence of these laws upon
                    intelligence; but it evidently alters profoundly our general conception of the
                    relation of that intelligence to the world.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Evidences of Christianity</hi> is mainly a condensation of
                    Bishop Douglas’s <hi rend="italic">Criterion</hi> and Lardner’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Credibility of the Gospel History.</hi> But the task is so
                    judiciously performed that it would probably be difficult to get a more
                    effective statement of the external evidences of Christianity than Paley has
                    here presented. The general position, "however, that the action of the first
                    preachers of Christianity was due “solely” to their belief in the occurrence of
                    certain miraculous events is on the same level as the view that “the proper
                    business of a revelation” is to certify future rewards and punishments. It
                    betrays a defective analysis of the religious consciousness. For the rest, his
                    idea of revelation depends upon the same mechanical conception of the relation
                    of God to the λvorld which dominates his <hi rend="italic">Natural
                    Theology;</hi> and he seeks to prove the divine origin of Christianity by
                    isolating it from the general history of mankind, whereas later writers find
                    their chief argument in the continuity of the process of revelation.</p>

                <p>The face of the world has changed so greatly since Paley’s day that we are apt to
                    do less than justice to his undoubted merits. He is nowhere original, and
                    nowhere profound, but he justly claims to be “something more than a mere
                    compiler.” His strong reasoning power, his faculty of clear arrangement and
                    forcible statement, place him in the first rank of expositors and advocates. He
                    masses his arguments, it has been said, with a general’s eye. His style is
                    perfectly perspicuous, and its “strong home-touch” compensates for what is
                    lacking in elasticity and grace. Paley’s avoidance of ultimate speculative
                    questions commended him to his own generation, and enabled him to give full
                    scope to the shrewd practical understanding in which his strength lay. He
                    displays little or no spirituality of feeling; but this is a matter in which one
                    age is apt to misjudge another, and Paley was at least practically benevolent
                    and conscientiously attentive to his parish duties. The active part he took in
                    advocating the abolition of the slave-trade is evidence of a wider power of
                    sympathy. His unconquerable cheerfulness becomes itself almost religious in the
                    last chapters of the <hi rend="italic">Natural Theology,</hi> when we consider
                    the circumstances in which they were composed. The chapter on the goodness of
                    the Deity is more touched with feeling than any other part of his writings, and
                    impresses the reader with respect for his essential goodness of heart. (A. SE.
