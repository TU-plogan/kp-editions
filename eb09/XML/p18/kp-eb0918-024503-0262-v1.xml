                    produced in the apparent place of an object when it is viewed from a point other
                    than that of reference. In astronomy, the places of the moon and planets are
                    referred to the centre of the earth, those of the fixed stars to the centre of
                    the sun. It is shown in <hi rend="smallcaps">Astronomy</hi> (vol. it p. 775)
                    that, the maximum or horizontal parallax of a celestial object being known, its
                    parallax from any point of observation can be calculated. The present article
                    will be restricted to an account of the methods employed for determining the
                    solar and lunar parallaxes and those of the fixed stars.</p>

                    parallax (termed briefly the “solar parallax ”) is the angle which the

                    earth is at mean distance from the sun. For its determination it would appear
                    only necessary to observe the sun’s apparent position simultaneously<note

                            the apparent motion of the sun is accurately known) in reducing the
                            observations so as to represent the result as if the two observations
                            had been made at the same instant.</p></note> from two widely different
                    points on the earth’s surface; the difference of the apparent positions will be
                    due to displacement by parallax, from which displacement the mean equatorial
                    horizontal parallax can be readily deduced.</p>
                <p>The requirements of modern astronomy demand that the solar parallax shall be
                    determined with an accuracy of -∏⅛τj∙ part of its amount—that is, within less
                    than <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi> part of a
                    second of arc. But measures in the neighbourhood of the sun cannot be made with
                    any approach to this accuracy, not only on account of the effect of the sun’s
                    heat on the various parts of the instruments employed, but also of the
                    atmospheric currents created by heat, which tend to destroy steady atmospheric
                    definition and to render the solar image incapable of exact observation. It is
                    thus hopeless to look for any solution of the problem by the most direct method.
                    Two courses remain—either to seek some method which affords a larger angle to
                    measure, or one which permits a mode of observation affording a higher
                    precision. There are many relations to the solar parallax which are well
                    established.</p>
                <p>(1) The parallax of the moon is known with very considerable precision by direct
                    determination. The proportion of this parallax to that of the sun is an
                    important term in the lunar theory, and the constant of this term (the <hi
                        rend="italic">ftarallactic inequality</hi><note anchored="true"

                            vol. it p. 796.</p></note>) is a known function of the solar parallax.
                    Hence, if the constant of the parallactic inequality is independently
                    determined, the solar parallax becomes known. The elements of the orbits of
                    Venus and <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n263/mode/1up"

                    increase from year to year, from century to century, and at last acquire very
                    large values. These secular variations (on the assumption that all the terms of
                    the theories of the planets are mathematically accurate) have also a
                    well-determined relation to the solar parallax, and therefore afford a means of
                    determining that parallax with an accuracy which increases by the continuance of
                    observation.</p>
                <p>(2) It has been shown <hi rend="smallcaps">(Astronomy,</hi> vol. ii. p. 779 <hi

                    708) that the proportions of the interplanetary distances can be very accurately
                    determined and tables be computed from observations of the apparent places of
                    the planets, without any knowledge or assumption as to absolute distances
                    (although an accurate knowledge of the solar parallax is required for giving
                    final perfection to the lunar and planetary tables). In astronomical ephemerides
                    therefore the distances of planets from the earth are accurately expressed in
                    terms of the earth’s mean distance from the sun, the latter being reckoned
                    unity. Hence, to determine the solar parallax, it is only necessary to measure,
                    at some favourable opportunity, the parallax of any planet, and to multiply the
                    parallax so found by the number which expresses the relation of the distance of
                    the planet from the earth to the earth’s mean distance from the sun.</p>
                <p>(3) When Jupiter is in opposition he is nearer the earth by the diameter of the
                    earth’s orbit than when in conjunction; hence, since light occupies a very
                    sensible time to travel, eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites will seem to occur too
                    soon in the first case and too late in the latter, the difference between the
                    extremes of acceleration and retardation being the time occupied by light in
                    crossing the earth’s orbit. This time is about 16⅜ minutes for the mean diameter
                    of the earth’s orbit; hence, if the velocity of light can be independently
                    determined, the diameter of the earth’s orbit becomes known. The determination,
                    by employing the velocity of light, is also arrived at in another way. The
                    constant of aberration (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Astronomy,</hi> p. 757), or the
                    maximum apparent change of a star’s true place due to the motion of the
                    observer, depends on the relative velocity of the motion of the observer in
                    space compared with the velocity of light. The angular velocity of the observer
                    is perfectly known; hence if his linear velocity is known his radius of motion
                    is known. Thus, if the constant of aberration and the velocity of light are
                    independently determined, the radius of motion (that is the sun’s parallax) will
                    be found.</p>
                <p>There are thus three distinctive typical methods:—(1) the gravitational method,
                    depending on terms in the lunar and planetary theories, the constants of which
                    are determined by observation; (2) the geometrical, or direct observational,
                    method; and (3) the physical method.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The, Gτosυitational Method.—</hi> The moon’s parallactic
                    inequality appears, at first sight, to furnish a very accurate method, as its
                    constant is about 125", or fourteen times as great as the solar parallax, and
                    the existing observations are very numerous. Unfortunately its determination is
                    inextricably mixed up with the determination of the moon’s diameter—a diameter
                    increased by irradiation, and therefore different for every telescope, and
                    perhaps for every observer. But this is not all. The maximum and minimum effect
                    of the parallactic inequality occur at first and last quarter, ι.e., when the
                    moon is half full. One half of the observations for parallactic inequality
                    therefore are made when the sun is above the horizon, and a great portion of the
                    other half during twilight; whilst those on which the moon’s diameter depend are
                    made at midnight, when the irradiation is a totally different quantity from what
                    it is in daylight or during twilight. Newcomb has attempted to determine the
                    correction of the diameter by the errors in right ascension, derived by
                    comparing Hansen’s tables of the moon with observations made by daylight and at
                    night; but he confesses that the result is so mixed up with the correction of
                    the coefficient of the variation (and, he might have added, with the observer’s
                    personality and the telescope employed) that it cannot be relied upon.</p>

                <p>One cannot look with confidence upon a method which thus permits discordance of
                    more than one per cent, in the discussion of the <hi rend="italic">same
                        observations</hi> by different astronomers. The result arrived at must
                    depend on the adopted corrections of the moon’s diameter, and, since that
                    diameter is not capable of determination under the same circumstances of
                    illumination as those in which the observations for parallactic inequality are
                    made, the judgment of the theorist must step in and assign some more or less
                    hypothetical grounds for the adoption of a particular diameter; and upon this
                    assumption will turn the whole of the quantity of which we are in search.</p>
                <p>It is, however, not impossible that the method of observing a spot near the
                    centre of the moon, instead of the moon’s limb, may lead to a more reliable
                    result. But it will have to be shown by independent methods that the position of
                    the selected spot is not systematically affected by phase.</p>
                <p>Attention was first called to the method which employs the secular variations of
                    the elements of the orbits of Venus and Mars for determining the solar parallax
                    by a most able and comprehensive paper communicated by Leverrier to the Paris
                    Academy of Sciences, and published in their <hi rend="italic">Comptes
                        Rendus</hi> for 1872, July 22. The most important of these variations is
                    that of the perihelion of Mars. The earth’s attraction increases the
                    heliocentric position of Mars at perihelion by about 50" in a century, and this
                    change at a favourable opposition subtends an angle of 185" at the earth.</p>
                <p>On 1672, October 1, the star <hi rend="italic">ψ</hi> Aquarii was occulted by
                    Mars. The appulse was observed by Richer at Cayenne, by Picard near Beaufort,
                    and by Romer at Paris. The separate comparisons differ only 0" <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 5, 0" ’ 8, and 0" <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    3 respectively; and the star <hi rend="italic">ψ</hi> Aquarii was very
                    frequently observed by Bradley. The increase in two centuries of the geocentric
                    longitude, corresponding to the distance of the planet Mars from the earth on
                    1672, October 1, is 294". Hence Μ. Leverrier concludes that (attributing an
                    error not greater than 1" to the determination of the observed variation) the
                    time has arrived when the solar parallax can be determined with a probable error
                    not exceeding y⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> 75</hi> ∙ of its amount, or the concluded
                    parallax will be exact to nearly ±0" 01. The value of the parallax so deduced Μ.

                <p>Similarly he finds from the latitude of Venus, determined by the transits of
                    Venus in 1761 and 1769, combined with the latitude determined by meridian

                <p>8"∙859.</p>
                <p>These values from the theories of Venus and Mars accord in a wonderful manner,
                    and would appear at first sight to justify considerable confidence in the
                    result. But it is impossible to forget the extraordinary intricacy of the <pb

                    been evolved, and the liability to some systematic source of error, such, for
                    example, as some neglected term producing a long inequality which may become
                    mixed up with the secular variation.</p>
                <p>In 1874 the tabular errors of Venus, as determined by the planet’s transit across
                    the sun’s disk, amounted to more than 5" of arc both in R.A. and declination,
                    and the tabular errors of Mars amounted to more than 8" in R.A. and to about 3"
                    in declination at the opposition of 1877, equivalent to an error of 2'' <hi

                        rend="italic">R. A. S.,</hi> vol. xlvi. p. 172). Leverrier’s planetary
                    tables do not, therefore, possess the accuracy attributed to them by their
                    distinguished author, and the conclusions at which he arrived probably require
                    some further modification. Tisserand <hi rend="italic">(Comptes Rendus,</hi>
                    1881, March 21) has continued the researches of Leverrier, and finds that they
                    require modification, and are also subject to very considerable probable error.
                    The later researches of Tisserand appear to point to a value of the solar
                    parallax smaller than that found by Leverrier, but his work has not yet been
                    brought to final conclusion.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Geometrical Method.—</hi> The most favourable
                    opportunities for the application of this method are afforded, in a geometrical
                    sense, by the planets Venus and Mars, when the former is in conjunction and the
                    latter in opposition. Of these Venus approaches the earth within one-fourth of
                    the sun’s mean distance, whilst Mars, in the most favourable circumstances,
                    approaches only within one-third of the same distance.</p>
                <p>When Venus is near conjunction she is only visible as a slender crescent in the
                    neighbourhood of the sun, and at conjunction is only visible on the occasion of
                    a transit across the sun’s disk. It generally happens, therefore, that the only
                    means of determining the apparent position of Venus near conjunction is to refer
                    that position to the sun’s limb or sun’s centre. But the sun’s place is also
                    affected by parallax, so that when the position of Venus is referred to the sun
                    the parallactic displacement is only the <hi rend="italic">difference</hi> of
                    the parallax of the sun and Venus. Mars, on the other hand, can be referred to
                    stars of which the parallax is absolutely insensible; thus it happens that the
                    advantage of Venus in point of parallactic displacement is diminished till the
                    geometrical conditions are only 5 per cent, in favour of Venus. Transits of
                    Venus across the sun’s disk have been observed for parallax in 1761, 1769, 1874,
                    and 1882.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For conditions
                            when a transit will occur, and past and future transits, see <hi

                <p>If an astronomer at each of two widely separated stations observes the absolute
                    instant of apparent internal contact of Venus with the sun’s limb, he is sure
                    that the centres of the sun and Venus are separated by an angular distance equal
                    to the “semidiameter of the sun minus the semidiameter of Venus.” The difference
                    of the absolute times at the two stations is due to parallactic displacement,
                    and, the planet’s tabular motion being accurately known, the amount of
                    displacement becomes known. If instead of one contact only the two observers
                    note the instants of internal contact both at ingress and egress, then they
                    practically find the chords described by the planet as seen from both stations.
                    The difference of length of these chords (in time) being known, as well as the
                    approximate diameters of the sun and Venus, and their tabular motion, we have
                    the data for computing the difference of least distance of centres of the sun
                    and Venus at the two stations, and this distance being due to parallax, we have
                    the means of computing the parallax of Venus and thence the solar parallax. This
                    latter method (originally proposed by Halley in 1716) has the advantage of not
                    requiring a rigid determination of the <hi rend="italic">absolute instant</hi>
                    of each contact, but merely of the duration of the transit; in other words, it
                    involves no very rigid determination of the longitude or clock error, but only
                    an exact knowledge of the clock rate.</p>
                <p>It was Halley’s opinion that the instants of contact could be observed with an
                    accuracy within two or three tenths of a second of time, but experience has gone
                    to show that the actual errors are from ten to forty times this amount, and the
                    causes of those errors can now be assigned with considerable certainty. These
                    causes are— (1) irradiation and diffraction; (2) disturbance of the image by
                    irregular refraction in the earth’s atmosphere; (3) the effect of the atmosphere
                    of Venus in complicating the phenomena at the point of contact.</p>
                <p>(1) Irradiation increases the diameter of the sun and diminishes that of Venus.
                    Its extent depends on the aperture of the telescope, the perfection of its
                    optical quality, and the perfection of the focal adjustment. Its amount is also
                    changed by the brilliancy of the sun, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> is affected
                    by the transparency of the sky and the density of the sun shade employed. Also,
                    when the space between the limbs of the sun and Venus becomes smaller than the
                    diffraction disk of the object-glass employed, a greyness or shadow is perceived
                    at the point of past or approaching contact; therefore, within a minute angle
                    equal to the separating power (the diameter of the diffraction disk) of the
                    object-glass, the actual instant of contact can only be estimated by changes in
                    the diffraction phenomena. (2) When the images are thrown into rapid vibration
                    by irregular refraction in the earth’s atmosphere, it becomes impossible to
                    distinguish between the vibration of the image of the dark body of Venus across
                    the sun’s limb near the point of contact and the regular phenomena of
                    irradiation, provided that the atmospheric vibrations are sufficiently rapid to
                    produce a persistent image on the retina of the observer’s eye. Thus at the
                    transit of Venus in 1882 observers were instructed to note at ingress the time
                    when there was “a well-marked and persistent discontinuity in the illumination
                    of the apparent limb of the sun.” Now it so happened that at the Royal
                    Observatory, Cape of Good Hope, the definition was very bad—a south-easter was
                    blowing, the effect of which was, as is almost invariably the case, to create a
                    rapid minute vibration in the images of celestial objects (see Sir John
                    Herschel’s <hi rend="italic">Results of Observations at the Cape of Good
                        Hope,</hi> p. xiv.). Thus “a well-marked and persistent discontinuity in the
                    illumination of the apparent limb of the sun” was seen by all of five observers
                    at the Royal Observatory from 10 to 20 seconds of time longer than at the
                    adjoining stations in the Cape Colony, where the images were seen comparatively
                    steady and well-defined. The instant of occurrence of the above-described phase
                    is therefore a function of the state of the atmospheric definition, and no
                    accurate means exist of estimating such influence. (3) The observation is
                    besides complicated by the illuminated atmosphere of Venus, which forms an arc
                    of light round the planet near the point of contact. In many cases this light
                    has been confounded with the light of the sun, and has thus caused very
                    considerable errors of observation.</p>
                <p>From these various causes the apparent phenomena are different at different
                    stations; and probably also the same phenomena are described by different
                    observers in very different language. The real difficulty of the discussion of
                    the results arises when these different and differently described phenomena have
                    to be combined. It is of no consequence whether a real or seeming contact has
                    been observed; it is only necessary to be certain that those observations are
                    combined which represent the same phenomenon. The same phenomenon would
                    correspond with the same apparent angular distance of centres of the <pb

                        telescopes were alike, if all the telescopes were in perfect focal
                        adjustment, and if the atmospheric conditions of definition at all the
                        stations were perfect or identical.</hi> But if these conditions are not
                    realized (and they cannot be realized in practice) the same apparent phenomena
                    will not represent corresponding phases; and, further, the observers at
                    different stations use such different language to express what they saw that it
                    becomes impossible to select even apparent corresponding phases with any
                    certainty.</p>
                <p>The value of the solar parallax deduced from a series of observations of the
                    contacts of Venus with the sun’s limb will therefore entirely depend upon the
                    interpretation put .upon the language of the various observers. The result will
                    besides be systematically affected if the state of atmospheric definition is
                    systematically different in the opposite stations.</p>
                <p>It is thus not surprising that very different results have been arrived at by
                    different astronomers from different transits, and even from different
                    discussions of the same observations of the same transit.</p>

                <p>Besides observing the contacts, another method was employed by the Germans, the
                    Russians, the Dutch, by Lord Lindsay’s expedition at the transit of Venus in
                    1874, and by the Germans in 1882, viz., the heliometric method. This consists in
                    observing with the heliometer (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Micrometer,</hi> vol.
                    xvi. pp. 252-254) the distance of V en us from opposite limbs of the sun along
                    known position-angles nearly in the line of greatest and least distance of Venus
                    from the sun’s limb. The method possesses many apparent advantages, because it
                    affords the opportunity of multiplying the observations and of eliminating many
                    sources of error.</p>
                <p>At first sight it seems as if the method is free from the necessity for any
                    accurate determination of the scale-value of the instrument, because, if
                    measures are made from opposite limbs of the sun, the sun’s diameter may be
                    taken as the standard for all observers, and the place of the planet may be
                    interpolated relatively to the opposite limbs. Unfortunately it happens that
                    there is à very marked difference in observing the sun’s diameter due both to
                    instrument and observer. Thus two observers with different instruments, who have
                    compared scale-value by a number of pairs of stars, or zones of stars, will
                    measure sun-diameters with a marked constant difference. If the sun’s diameter
                    is assumed to be constant, it, in fact, determines the scale-value; hence the
                    distance of centres measured by the two observers will differ by the
                    proportionate part <hi rend="italic">× ∆d,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">s</hi>
                    is the distance of centres, <hi rend="italic">d</hi> the true diameter, and <hi
                        rend="italic">∆d</hi> the difference of diameter as measured by the two
                    observers. Thus it is only when s = 0 (that is, when the planetis near the
                    centre of the sun) that this method can be used,—a condition that does not exist
                    in practice.</p>
                <p>In the case of the transit of Venus fully one-third of the whole of this
                    personality would enter into the result by this method of reduction. For rigid
                    reduction therefore it is absolutely necessary to have a rigid determination of
                    scale-value in seconds of arc. Unfortunately this value, when determined for any
                    uniform instrumental condition of temperature, is liable to change, because, in
                    observations of the sun, difference of temperature between the tube, the
                    object-glass, and the scale of the instrument is produced, and the focal
                    adjustment is also disturbed. The scalevalue depends on the relation of the
                    focal length of the objectglass to the length of a part of the scale, and is
                    besides affected by abnormal focal adjustment of the eyepiece.</p>
                <p>Drs Auwers and Winnecke adopted a very complete scheme for determining the
                    scale-value at any instant.</p>
                <p>1. The scale-value was determined for a uniform condition of the temperature of
                    the instrument by measuring zones of stars whose places were rigidly determined
                    by meridian observations; and by the same means the temperature coefficient of
                    the instrument was determined for different temperatures, the various parts of
                    the instrument being assumed of a uniform temperature in observations of stars
                    by night.</p>
                <p>2. The effect of a displacement of focus was determined by measuring the sun’s
                    diameter and distances of pairs of stars with different positions of the focal
                    adjustment.</p>
                <p>3. The focal point was determined during sun-observations by adjusting the focus
                    on a telescope fixed in a specially prepared chamber, where its temperature
                    would change very slowly, and the temperature of the scale (and hence its
                    length) were measured by a metallic thermometer; hence the change of the
                    proportion of the scale-length to the focal length became known.</p>
                <p>In Lord Lindsay’s expedition similar precautions were employed, excepting that in
                    the last case an attempt was made to determine the temperature of the tube by
                    thermometers and that of the objectglass by a thermo-pile, and the position of
                    the focal point was calculated from these data.</p>
                <p>The uncertainties of all these operations are considerable, and, though from the
                    extraordinary labour and care bestowed upon the determination of the necessary
                    corrections by the German astronomers a fairly reliable result may be arrived
                    at, it is certain that the method of determining the solar parallax from
                    heliometric observation of transits of Venus can now be surpassed by methods
                    more direct, more reliable, and at the same time less laborious and costly.</p>
                <p>If photographs can be obtained during a transit in which the limbs of the sun and
                    Venus are sufficiently well-defined, the distance of the centres of the sun and
                    planet can be determined (as in the heliometer method) provided only that the
                    pictures are affected by no systematic errors. That this latter condition may be
                    fulfilled the following are the essential conditions.</p>
                <p>1. The picture must be formed on the photographic plate without distortion, or,
                    if it is affected by distortion, that distortion must be ascertained and allowed
                    for.</p>
                <p>2. No change must take place in the process of developing and fixing the picture,
                    or, if such change is possible, means must be provided for its detection and
                    elimination.</p>
                <p>3. The angular value of one inch on the plate must be accurately known, so as to
                    convert measured distances into arc—for the same reasons as in the heliometer
                    method.</p>
                <p>It is necessary to employ an image of considerable size, because otherwise the
                    particles of collodion, if magnified so much as to permit measurement of the
                    requisite accuracy, give an irregularity to the limbs that is fatal to accurate
                    estimation. Thus it becomes necessary either to employ a lens of very
                    considerable focal length (40 feet was generally adopted), or to introduce a
                    secondary lens to magnify the image formed in the primary focus. The first of
                    these methods was employed by the Americans, by the French, and in Lord
                    Lindsay’s expedition at the transit of 1874, the second by the British, German,
                    Russian, and Dutch expeditions.</p>
                <p>The use of an object-glass of long focus renders mounting of the lens in the
                    usual manner, though not a practical impossibility, yet at least a matter of
                    extreme inconvenience. Accordingly, where lenses of long focus were employed,
                    the telescope was mounted in a horizontal position, and the sun’s rays were
                    reflected by a plane mirror in the direction of the tube’s length. It is not
                    easy to conceive that any sensible distortion in the image can be produced by a
                    lens of such long focus even if only of mediocre quality of figure; indeed the
                    method may be assumed free from any such error; but it is undoubtedly exposed to
                    all the errors of distortion which may be produced by the plane. From the
                    perfection now attained in the construction of optical planes, and the means
                    which exist for testing them, the errors due to this cause may also probably be
                    safely neglected, except in so far as the figure of the plane is distorted by
                    the heat of the sun, and it is not impossible that some sources of systematic
                    error may be thus created.</p>
                <p>To determine the angular value of one inch (or other unit of length) on the
                    photographic plate, it is only necessary to measure the distance of the plate
                    from the posterior surface of the objectglass, and then to determine the
                    distance of the optical centre of the lens from that surface; the sum of these
                    two distances is the radius of which lines on the surface of the plate (reckoned
                    from the centre of the plate) are tangents.</p>
                <p>The French adopted the daguerrotype method of photography, in which it is
                    impossible to imagine any errors due to contraction of the photographic film, as
                    in the collodion process, because the picture is virtually a portion of the
                    silver plate on which it is taken. But in adopting this process the advantage of
                    measuring the photographs by transmitted light was lost; and it is a practical
                    question, which experience has not yet decided, whether the loss or the gain is
                    the greater.</p>
                <p>The Americans, and Lord Lindsay in 1874, using the collodion process, took the
                    precaution to provide means for the detection of possible contraction of the
                    film during development of the picture or drying of the film. This was done by
                    placing the sensitive plate near to or in contact with a reticule ruled on glass
                    near the primary focus; this reticule was thus photographed simultaneously with
                    each photograph of the sun; hence any change produced during the development
                    would cause a similar change in the relative positions of the images of the
                    ruled lines on the developed plate. As a matter of fact the American astronomers
                    have found fairly reliable results from their photographic operations, but the
                    accuracy arrived at is by no means very considerable, the probable <pb

                    average plate amounting to ± 0"∙5.</p>
                <p>But the difficulties of dealing with systematic errors are enormously increased
                    when a secondary magnifier is employed, because it is theoretically impossible
                    with the present optical glass (employing spherical curves) to construct a
                    perfect secondary magnifier in which the scale value should be absolutely the
                    same in every part of the field; still less is it possible, when the attempt is
                    made, to combine the visual and photographic rays in the same focus; hence every
                    photoheliograph of this construction must be separately studied for distortion
                    of the image. The results of actual trial prove that the distortion is even
                    greater than was expected, and is besides not the same in each radius, and the
                    latter error may be produced by a very small error of centring in the lenses
                    which compose the secondary magnifier. The investigation of such errors with the
                    required accuracy would be a laborious and at best an unsatisfactory operation,
                    and is rendered practically impossible by the fact that, whenever the instrument
                    is turned upon the sun, the object-glass becomes heated, its focal length
                    changed, and the optical relation of the secondary magnifier to the image in the
                    principal focus of the object-glass changed also.</p>
                <p>For these reasons the photographic observations in which secondary magnifiers
                    were employed might be expected to prove a failure, and this expectation has
                    been confirmed by the result of experience.</p>
                <p>The observation of the transit of Venus on a large scale of national expenditure
                    was certainly justified in 1761 and 1769. In those days there were no refined
                    means of measuring angles with high accuracy, and the employment of the motion
                    of Venus and a time-scale of measurement was the best available method of
                    determining the solar parallax. But since 1820 the art of measurement has so
                    advanced, and such refined instruments and methods have been thus introduced,
                    that it may be a matter of some surprise and question to future generations of
                    astronomers why so much labour and money were expended upon so imperfect a
                    method in 1874 and 1882. The justification of these expeditions must be found,
                    not in the reliability of the value of the solar parallax determined by them,
                    but in the impulse given to the construction of instruments, the awakening of a
                    widespread interest in astronomy, the stimulus to invention of new methods of
                    research, and the accurate determination of the latitudes and longitudes of a
                    large number of important and previously undetermined stations on the earth’s
                    surface.</p>
                <p>If an opposition of Mars occurs when that planet is near perihelion and the earth
                    near aphelion the planet is then about one-third of the sun’s distance from the
                    earth. When these conditions are nearly realized the opportunity is a favourable
                    one for determining the solar parallax.</p>
                <p>On 1672, October 1, the star <hi rend="italic">ψ</hi> Aquarii was occulted by
                    Mars. Estimations of the distance of the planet from the star were made at
                    well-observed instants of time by Richer, Picard, and Romer, as already noticed,
                    and from these observations the first approximate determination of the solar
                    parallax was made by Cassini, viz., 9" ’ 5.</p>
                <p>The method of observing Mars that has been most largely employed consists in
                    observing the apparent declination of the planet by means of the transit
                    circle—at observatories both in the northern and in the southern hemisphere. To
                    increase the accuracy of the result, the same stars near the planet are observed
                    at the various observatories, so that the method is reduced to measuring the
                    difference of declination between the planet and neighbouring stars. The effects
                    of periodic error in the gradua tion of the circles, of flexure of the
                    instruments, and of abnormal refraction are thus nearly eliminated, and there
                    remain only the systematic errors which may be supposed to arise from the
                    difference of the habit of the observers in bisecting a star and a planet. To
                    some extent these errors could be eliminated by the use of a reversing prism
                    applied in the place of a sun-shade between the eyepiece and the observer’s eye.
                    By the use of such a prism the motion of the spider-web and the limbs of the
                    planet can be reversed with respect to the vertical, and such errors as depend
                    on a different habit of bisecting a similar apparent upper and lower limb would
                    be thus eliminated. But on account of the chromatic dispersion of the atmosphere
                    the lower limb of the planet is coloured red and the upper limb violet; and in
                    the illuminated field of the telescope it is probable that the observer has a
                    tendency to cut with his spider-web more deeply into the feeble violet limb than
                    into the more glaring red limb. The effect of his so doing would be to increase
                    the value of the resulting parallax, and it seems not improbable that from this
                    cause a larger value of the parallax has been obtained by this than by other
                    methods.</p>

                <p>In 1872 <hi rend="italic">(Ast. Nach.,</hi> No. 1897) Dr Galle of Breslau
                    proposed a method of determining the solar parallax which appears to be the
                    foundation of the method of the future, viz., to measure, by means of the
                    equatorial, the difference of declination between selected stars and a minor
                    planet, or rather to interpolate the declination of a minor planet relative to
                    two stars of comparison. A minor planet presents precisely the appearance of a
                    star, and it is impossible to conceive any personality which can affect the
                    observation of such a planet and a star. The interpolation of the planet’s
                    declination relative to two including stardeclinations <hi rend="italic"
                        >(i.e.,</hi> measurement from stars nearly equally north and south of the
                    planet) entirely eliminates errors due to error of the adopted arc-value of the
                    micrometer screw. It is true that in the case of minor planets the parallax
                    factor can hardly exceed 1∣, whilst in the case of Mars that factor may be 3;
                    but their disks present objects which are capable of being observed with quite
                    two and a half times the accuracy of Mars. Hence the conditions of accidental
                    accuracy are equalized for a single opposition, whilst the advantages of
                    systematic accuracy are entirely in favour of the minor planets. Moreover, the
                    opportunities offered by favourable oppositions of minor planets are much more
                    frequent than in the case of Mars. The opposition of the minor planet Flora in
                    1874 was observed, at the request of Dr Galle, by a considerable number of
                    observers in both northern and southern hemispheres, but unfortunately only in
                    very few cases with the precaution, care, and perfection of instrumental
                    equipment necessary. In 1882 the minor planets Victoria and Sappho were
                    similarly observed at the request of Gill. The work was taken up by a number of
                    astronomers in both hemispheres, in a much more complete and systematic manner,
                    with better instrumental means, and with the benefit of former experience. The
                    results have riot yet been reduced, but it is believed they will afford a
                    valuable contribution to the problem in question. The results of Dr Galle’s

                    minute detail, which is essential in the highest class of observation, and it
                    becomes impossible to alter the previously prepared programme in such a case,
                    should circumstances render it desirable to do so; nor does it always happen
                    that distant observatories can be supplied with the necessary instrumental
                    details in sufficient time. In the case of the Victoria and Sappho observations
                    of 1882 the requisite sympathy and care were accorded in a very remarkable
                    degree, but on account of the errors of the planetary tables (discoverable only
                    when the observations were begun) the selected stars of comparison were not by
                    any means the most favourable that could have been chosen, and were consequently
                    not the stars that a single observer would have selected at the time. Hence
                    arises the desirability of a method not requiring co-operation, in which success
                    depends upon a single observer, who may obtain independently by his own
                    observations a complete series of results.</p>
                <p>In 1857 Airy, in an address to the Royal Astronomical Society on the methods
                    available for determining the solar parallax during the next twenty-five years,
                    called attention to the favourable opposition of Mars in 1877, and declared his
                    opinion that the best method of finding the solar parallax was to determine at
                    an equatorial station the difference of right ascension of that planet and
                    neighbouring stars in the evening and early morning, by observing transits of
                    stars and planet across the webs of a well-adjusted rigidly mounted equatorial.
                    The motion of the earth’s rotation would transport the observer 6000 or 7000
                    miles between the evening and morning observations, and the requisite
                    displacement would thus be obtained. In other <hi rend="subscript"> w</hi>
                    words, the observer would avail himself of the diurnal displacement to determine
                    the parallax of the planet. Of course a very large number of observations would
                    be required, because tne observation of a transit over the webs of a telescope
                    is not so exact as the micrometric comparison of two points. Only one observer
                    availed himself of Airy’s suggestion, but a very good series of observations by
                    this method was obtained by Maxwell Hall at the island of Jamaica. The detailed
                    observations are printed in <hi rend="italic">Mem. R. A. S.,</hi> vol. xliv. p.
                    121; the resulting value of the solar parallax is</p>
                <p>8"∙79±0"∙06.</p>
                <p>In 1874 (in connexion with Lord Lindsay’s expedition to Mauritius) Gill,
                    combining the suggestion of Galle as to the employment of a minor planet and
                    Airy’s suggestion as to the employment of the diurnal displacement, observed the
                    minor planet Juno, which was at that time favourably situated for the purpose.
                    But instead of employing the method of transits of the planet and stars across
                    spiderwebs he used a heliometer, and measured with that instrument the distance
                    of the planet from the same star in the evening and morning. In order to
                    eliminate the effects of changes in the scale-value, Gill selected stars on
                    opposite sides of the planet, and so arranged his observations as to measure
                    simultaneously the angle between the planet and both comparison stars. That is
                    to say, if the two distances in question are called <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> the measures were arranged in the order «,6,6,α or
                        <hi rend="italic">b,a,a,b.</hi> Thus any abnormal scale-value of the
                    instrument applicable to the measurement <hi rend="italic">a</hi> would be
                    equally applicable to the measurement 6. If the places of the comparison stars
                    are thus determined by meridian observations, the scale-value may be derived
                    from the observations themselves with all desirable accuracy, and the effect of
                        <hi rend="italic">change</hi> in the scale-value (which alone is
                    all-important) be absolutely eliminated. The observations so made at Mauritius
                    showed that the position of the planet Juno relative to two stars of comparison
                    could be so interpolated with a probable error less than - <hi rend="subscript">

                <p>In 1877, instead of observing the favourable opposition of Mars of that year by
                    Airy’s method, Gill proposed to the Royal Astronomical Society to employ a
                    heliometer (kindly lent by Lord Lindsay) to observe the planet in a similar
                    manner to that in which he had observed the minor planet J uno at Mauritius in
                    1874. The offer was accepted. Gill selected the island of Ascension, and there
                    carried out the necessary observations. The stars of comparison, by the kind and
                    hearty co-operation of astronomers, were observed at thirteen of the principal
                    observatories with meridian instruments, a combination of their results
                    affording standard places of high accuracy. In general the angular distance of
                    the planet was measured both in the evening and morning from each of three
                    surrounding stars. The observed readings of the heliometer were corrected for
                    the effects of refraction and phase, for the errors of division of the scales
                    and of the micrometer screw, and were then converted into arc on an assumed
                    value of one revolution of the micrometer screw (or rather of half an interval
                    of the scale divisions).</p>
                <p>The tabular apparent distance of the centre of Mars from each star for the
                    instant of each observation was then computed with an assumed approximate value

                <p>Care, however, must be taken to confine the combination to such groups as depend
                    on measures from the same stars, if it is desired to eliminate the effects of
                    errors in the adopted star places. Also, since it is assumed that <hi
                        rend="italic">κ</hi> and <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> vary proportionally with
                    the time, it is necessary that only such observations should be combined. as
                    have been made at epochs sufficiently near together to render this a safe
                    assumption.</p>
                <p>Finally the absolute values of <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >κ'</hi> for the various combinations are deduced by developing the values
                    of ∆α and ∆δ from each combination in terms of the time, and thus the definitive
                    values of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> are obtained.</p>
                <p>The combination of these values of <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> having regard to the
                    weight of each, led to the result n= -0 ’ 209.</p>
                <p>Whence the value of the solar parallax was 8"∙78±O"O12.</p>
                <p>It should be remarked that in these observations a reversing prism was so
                    employed as to eliminate any systematic error on the part of the observer which
                    might be due to astigmatism of his eye, or a habit of placing the image of the
                    star otherwise than truly central on the image of Mars. The probable error of
                    one observation of distance having weight unity was found to be ± 0" <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 24. Twelve such observations were generally made
                    (and often more) on each night, and complete combinations of observations were
                    secured on twenty-five nights.</p>
                <p>This probable error does not exceed that of a single observation of contact on
                    the occasion of a transit of Venus, and yet <hi rend="italic">one hundred and
                        ninety-six</hi> such observations were secured, as compared with <hi
                        rend="italic">two</hi> which is the utmost that can be secured as the result
                    of any single observer’s expedition to observe a transit of Venus.</p>
                <p>It is impossible, however, to say with certainty that the above result is
                    entirely free from systematic error. There is one possible source of such error
                    to be suspected, viz., the possible effect of the chromatic dispersion of the
                    atmosphere which colours the limbs of Mars in the manner already described. In
                    the case of heliometer observations the effect is certainly πμnimized from the
                    fact that the star disk which is compared with the limb of Mars is coloured
                    precisely in the same way as the limb—but whether all error is so eliminated it
                    is impossible to say. A detailed account of these observations and their
                    reductions is given in <hi rend="italic">Mem. R. A. S.,</hi> vol. xlvi. pp.
                    1-172.</p>
                <p>If a minor planet, however, is observed in the above described manner, no
                    suspicion of the error in question can attach to the final result; and, so far
                    as is known, that method affords the only geometrical means of arriving at an
                    absolutely definitive value of the solar parallax.</p>

                <p>Todd, in calling attention to Glasenapp’s results <hi rend="italic">(Am. Journal
                        of Science,</hi> vol. xix. p. 62), remarks on these two values as follows
                    :—</p>
                <p>“The former determination rests on a much greater number of observations than the
                    latter; <hi rend="italic">but it is difficult to form a just estimate of the
                        work of an average last-century observation</hi> of an eclipse of a
                    satellite of Jupiter. And, moreover, <hi rend="italic">astronomers have no means
                        of knowing the process</hi> which led the distinguished French astronomer to
                    his result—which was adopted in his own tables of the satellites, and which was
                    adopted by Damoiseau in his <hi rend="italic">Tables</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Ecliptiques,</hi> published in 1836. <hi rend="italic">The latter
                        determination rests upon a mass of observations of definite excellence,
                        which have been discussed after the modern fashion.”</hi></p>
                <p>Astronomers, however, whilst generally endorsing these remarks, will not be
                    inclined to follow Todd in combining Dalambre’s value with Glasenapp’s by giving
                    double weight to the latter. Having regard to those portions of Todd’s remarks
                    which we have printed in italics, astronomers would generally be of opinion that
                    only Glasenapp’s value of <hi rend="italic">k</hi> can be seriously considered
                    at the present day. This value, combined with the above mean value of the

                <p>There still remain some little theoretical difficulties with regard to the theory
                    of aberration. That theory is perfectly obvious on the emission theory of light,
                    but is <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">priori</hi> by no means so
                    obvious on the undulatory theory. Is it certain that the velocity of light in

                    the velocity of light which, having travelled a certain space in air, undergoes
                    reflexion and returns? This is a question for the physicist, and a question that
                    probably demands a practical as well as a theoretical answer.<note

                <p>Also Villarceau <hi rend="italic">{Comptes Rendus,</hi> 1872, October 14) points
                    out that in the ordinary theory of aberration no account is taken of the sun’s
                    motion of translation through space, and shows that, if the normal constant of
                    aberration is A, the constant for any particular star is A + A × α, where a
                    depends on the angle which the star’s direction makes with the direction of the
                    sun’s translation in space. In the observations of Nyrén, above referred to,
                    there is a well-marked periodic variation in the values of the constant of
                    aberration derived for twenty-seven stars, which seems to be a function of the
                    right ascension of the stars. This variation may be due to some cause (such as
                    lateral refraction in the north-and-south direction) depending on the seasons,
                    or it may have a real physical significance on the theory of Villarceau. If
                    further observation (especially in the southern hemisphere, where the seasons
                    are reversed) should confirm the latter hypothesis, two important conclusions
                    result:—</p>
                <p>(a) We obtain some idea of the direction and amount of motion of the milky way,
                    combined with that of the solar system in space; and</p>
                <p>(δ) We may conclude that our theory of light is correct, which supposes that a
                    ray of light is transmitted through space with uniform velocity, independently
                    of the velocity of the source of light, and that ether is fixed and
                    infinite—that is, nowhere limited in extent.</p>
                <p>On the other hand a negative result would go far to show that our conception of
                    ether is not correct, at least would force us to adopt one of two
                    conclusions,—either that the milky way is stationary in space (within limits of
                    our power of measurement), or that the ether accom panies the milky way and is
                    not fixed in space and not infinite.</p>
                <p>It is, however, <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> improbable that from any of these
                    causes the deduced value of the solar parallax will be affected by <hi
                        rend="subscript"> τ</hi> √&lt; <hi rend="subscript"> nr</hi> of its deduced
                    amount.</p>
                <p>The tendency of the best modern determinations is to fix the solar parallax
                    at</p>
                <p>8"∙78 or 8"∙79, and hence the mean distance of the earth from the sun at 93
                    millions of miles, a result which is almost certainly exact within 200,000
                    miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lunar Parallax.</hi> —The constant of the lunar parallax may
                    be determined by a method precisely similar to that followed in the meridian
                    declination observations of Mars. Our knowledge of the parallax of the moon
                    depends at present entirely on such observations made nearly simultaneously at
                    the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and the Cape of Good Hope. The resulting
                    values of the parallax, found directly from these observations, are then
                    multiplied by a factor which expresses the relation between the constant of the
                    lunar parallax <hi rend="smallcaps">(Astronomy,</hi> vol. ii. p. 798) to the
                    moon’s tabular parallax at the time; thus each nearly simultaneous observation
                    at the two observatories gives an independent determination of the constant of
                    the lunar parallax.</p>
                <p>A better method, however, will be found when the results of numerous occultations

                    accurate lunar theory—a work about to be undertaken by Prof. Simon Newcomb.</p>

                <p>The distances of the fixed stars are so remote that till very recent times their
                    parallaxes have been found to be insensible; that is to say, the earth’s orbit

                    practice, however, generally throughout the whole year. The differences of
                    declination so observed, after allowing for the effects of refraction,
                    precession, aberration, nutation, and proper motion, afford the means of
                    deducing the parallax of the star. The most notable series of observations of
                    this character are those of Maclear at the Cape of Good Hope, by which he
                    confirmed the results of his predecessor Henderson and those of Peters at
                    Pulkowa in the second section of his work above mentioned. The latter is the
                    most classic work in existence on refined observations of absolute declination,
                    and it is by no means certain that, in more modern meridian observations, the
                    work and methods of that distinguished observer have been equalled—except
                    perhaps at Pulkowa. The minute precautions necessary in such work will be found
                    in Peters’s paper above mentioned (see also <hi rend="smallcaps">Transit
                        Circle).</hi> But not with all the skill of Peters, nor with every
                    refinement of equipment and observation, can the difficulties caused by
                    refraction and minute change of instrumental flexure, &lt;fcc,, be completely
                    overcome; the method of absolute altitudes does not, in fact, respond in
                    accuracy to the demands of the problem.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">differential method</hi> depends on measuring the
                    difference of declination, of distance, or of position angle between the star
                    whose parallax is to be determined and one or more stars of comparison. It is
                    assumed that the stars most likely to have sensible parallax are those which are
                    remarkable for brilliancy or proper motion, and that the parallaxes of the stars
                    of comparison (having little or no sensible proper motion and · faint magnitude)
                    are so small as to be insignificant. So far as our knowledge goes these
                    assumptions are justified.</p>
                <p>Researches on stellar parallax by these methods have been followed of late years
                    with considerable success. The instruments employed have been the heliometer and
                    the filar micrometer (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Micrometer,</hi> vol. xvi. pp.
                    243-248), the latter instrument being used in conjunction with an ordinary
                    equatorial (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Telescope).</hi> The precautions required
                    to determine and eliminate systematic error, and to secure the necessary
                    refinement of accuracy, demand more space for their description than the limits
                    of this article admit. The reader is referred for these particulars to the
                    undermentioned papers on the subject.</p>
                <p>The heliometer method seems to present the greatest facilities for extensive
                    researches on stellar parallax, not only because measures with this instrument
                    seem, on the whole, to possess the highest accuracy, but because (on account of
                    the large angles that can be measured) a much wider selection of suitable stars
                    of comparison is available. Gyldén of Stockholm has applied the method of
                    observing the differences of right ascension between the star whose parallax is
                    to be determined and each of two comparison stars, and the same method has also
                    been applied by Auwers <hi rend="italic">{Math. Abhand. Berliner Acad.,</hi>
                    1867); but the results obtained in this way do not compare at all favourably
                    with the accuracy of properly conducted heliometer measu</p>
                <p>The diagram (fig. 1) represents observations made by Gill to determine the
                    parallax of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> Centauri, with a heliometer at the Cape of
                    Good Hope. The ordinates of the curve are the time reckoned from 1882Ό, the
                    abscissae the changes in the place of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> Centauri due to
                    the parallax computed from the observations. Each dot represents the
                    observations of each single night, and the reader will be able to judge of the
                    accuracy of the observations from the agreement of the dots with the curve. Fig.
                    2 in like manner represents a series of observations of Sirius.</p>
                <p>These and many other results show that, with similar means, it is now possible to
                    detect any differential parallax amounting to 0"O5 with certainty, by a series
                    consisting of a reasonable number of like observations—thus opening up a wide
                    and important field for future research.</p>
                <p>The following table contains a list of those stars of which the parallax is known
                    with considerable accuracy,— Nos. 1 to 13 being in the northern and Nos. 14 to
                    22 in the southern hemisphere.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>A glance at the table is sufficient to show that neither apparent magnitude nor
                    apparent motion affords a criterion of the parallax of any fixed star. Similar
                    researches must, in fact, be carried out on a much more extended scale before
                    any definite conclusions can be drawn. At present we can only conclude that
                    different stars really differ· greatly in absolute brightness and absolute
                    motion.</p>
