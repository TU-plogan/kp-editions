                    central Greece, between Baeotia on the east and the land of the Ozolian Locrians
                    on the west. It adjoined the Gulf of Corinth on the south, while it was
                    separated on the north from the Malian gulf by the ridge of Mount Cnemis and the
                    narrow strip of territory occupied by the Epicnemidian and Opuntian Locrians. In
                    early times, indeed, a slip of Phocian territory extended between these two
                    Locrian tribes to the sea, and the port of Daphnus, opposite to the Cenaean
                    promontory in Eubaea, afforded the Phocians an opening in this direction; but in
                    the time of Strabo Daphnus had ceased to exist, and its territory was
                    incorporated with Locris (Strabo, ix. 3, § 1).</p>
                <p>Phocis was for the most part a rugged and mountainous country. In the centre of
                    it rose the great mountain mass of Parnassus, one of the most lofty in Greece,
                    attaining to the height of 8068 feet, and an underfall of this, Mount Cirphis
                    (4130 feet), sweeps round to the Gulf of Corinth on the south, separating the
                    Gulf of Crissa from that of Anticyra, both of which were included in the Phocian
                    territory. The range of Mount Cnemis on its northern frontier was of less
                    elevation (about 3000 feet), but rugged and difficult of access, while the upper
                    valley or plain of the Cephissus, which intervened between this and the northern
                    slopes of Mount Parnassus, constituted the only considerable tract of fertile
                    and level country comprised within the limits of Phocis. The little basin
                    adjoining the Crissaean gulf, though fertile, was of very limited extent, and
                    the broad valley leading into the interior from thence to Amphissa (now Salona)
                    belonged to the Ozolian Locrians. Besides the Cephissus, the only river in
                    Phocis was the Pleistus, a mere torrent, which rose in Mount Parnassus, and,
                    after flowing past Delphi, descended through a deep ravine to the Crissaean
                    gulf.</p>
                <p>Phocis possessed great importance in a military point of view, not only from its
                    central position with regard to the other states of northern Greece and its
                    possession of the great sanctuary of Delphi, but from its command of the pass
                    which led from the Malian gulf across Mount Cnemis to Elatea in the valley of
                    the Cephissus, and afforded the only access for an invader who had already
                    passed Thermopylae into Baeotia and Attica. Hence the alarm of the Athenians in
                    339 when it was suddenly announced that Philip had occupied Elatea. Again, the
                    only practicable communication from Baeotia with Delphi and the western Locrians
                    lay through a narrow pass known as the Schiste Hodos, between Mount Cirphis and
                    the underfalls of Mount Helicon. From this point another deep valley branches
                    off to the Gulf of Anticyra, and the Triodos or junction of the three ways was
                    the spot celebrated in Greek story as the place where Oedipus met and slew his
                    father.</p>
                <p>The most important city in Phocis after Delphi was Elatea, the position of which
                    has already been described; next to this came Abae, also in the valley of the
                    Cephissus, near the Boeotian frontier, celebrated for its oracle of Apollo. In
                    the same neighbourhood stood Daulis and Ambrysus; while farther south, towards
                    the Corinthian gulf, lay Anticyra, on the gulf of the same name. Crissa, which
                    had been in early times one of the chief cities of Phocis, and had given name to
                    the Crissaean gulf, was destroyed by order of the Amphictyonie council in 591,
                    and never rebuilt. The other towns of Phocis were places of no importance, and
                    their names scarcely appear in history.</p>
                <p>The whole extent of Phocis did not exceed half that of Baeotia, but it was broken
                    up into a number of small townships—twenty-two in all—forming a confederacy, the
                    deputies of which used to meet in a “synedrion” or council-chamber near Daulis.
                    But from an early period the predominance of Delphi, owing to the influence of
                    its celebrated oracle, threw all the others into the shade. At first (as has
                    been already stated in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Delphi)</hi> the
                    Phocians were masters of the oracle, and of the town that had grown up on its
                    site; but after the first Sacred War in 595 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and
                    the destruction of Crissa, Delphi became an independent city, and from this
                    period a strong feeling of hostility subsisted between the Delphians and the
                    Phocians. The latter, however, thus deprived of their chief city, sank into a
                    position of insignificance, and played but an unimportant part in the affairs of
                    Greece. During the Persian War of 480 their territory was ravaged by the
                    invader, and several of their small cities destroyed. In the Peloponnesian War
                    they were zealous allies of the Athenians, and for a short time recovered
                    possession of Delphi, which was, however, soon after wrested from them; and it
                    maintained its independence from the peace of Nicias in 421 till the outbreak of
                    the Sacred War in 357. On this occasion the Phocians, who had been sentenced by
                    the Amphictyons to the payment of a heavy fine, rose in arms against the decree,
                    which they attributed to the hostile influence of the Thebans, and, under the
                    command of Philomelas, made themselves masters of Delphi, and seized on the
                    sacred treasures of the temple. With the assistance of these resources they were
                    able to maintain the contest, under the command of Onomarchus, Phayllus, and
                    Phalaecus, for a period of ten years, not only against the Thebans and their
                    allies but even after the accession of Philip, king of Macedonia, to the side of
                    their adversaries. This was the only occasion on which the Phocians bore a
                    prominent part in Greek history. After their final defeat by Philip a decree was
                    passed by the Amphictyons, in 346, that all the Phocian towns except Abae should
                    be destroyed, and the inhabitants dispersed in villages. Notwithstanding the
                    ruin thus brought upon their country, many of their towns seem to have been
                    subsequently rebuilt, and the Phocians were able to take part with the Athenians
                    in the final struggle for Greek independence at Chaeronea, and in the Samian
                    War. Their last appearance in history was in defence of Delphi against the
                    attack of the Gauls in 279; but they still continued to subsist as a separate
                    though obscure people in the days of Strabo.</p>
                <p>Of the origin of the Phocians as a people we have no information. The earliest
                    traditions connect them with the pre-Hellenic Leleges, as was the case also with
                    the Locrians, and this statement was probably intended to convey the fact that
                    the two nations were tribes of the same race. They first appear under the name
                    of Phocians in the Homeric catalogue as having joined the Greek armament against
                    Troy under the command of the two sons of Iphitus <hi rend="italic">(Iliad,</hi>
                    ii. 517), and were restored amongst the Aeolic division of the northern
                    Greeks.</p>
                <p>For the ancient geography of Phocis, see Strabo (ix. 3) and Pausanias (x.). The
                    country and the existing remains of antiquity are described by Dod well (vol. i.
                    chaps. 6 and 7) and Leake <hi rend="italic">(Northern Greece,</hi> vol.
