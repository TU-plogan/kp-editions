                    >burg,</hi> is appropriate to the situation on a lofty isolated hill in the
                    broad and fertile valley of the Caicus, about 120 stadia, less than 15 miles,
                    from its mouth. According to the belief of its inhabitants, the town was founded
                    by Arcadian colonists, led by Telephus, son of Heracles. Auge, the mother of
                    Telephus, was priestess of Athena Aiea at Tegea, and daughter of Aleus; fleeing
                    from Tegea, she became the wife of Teuthras, the eponymous king of Teuthrania,
                    and her son Telephus succeeded him. Athena Polias was the patron-goddess of
                    Pergamum, and the legend combines the ethnological record of the connexion
                    claimed between Arcadia and Pergamum with the usual belief that the hero of the
                    city was son of its guardian deity, or at least of the priestess who represented
                    her. Nothing more is recorded of the city till the time of Xenophon, when it was
                    a small fortified town on the summit of the hill. Its importance began under</p>
                <p>Lysimachus, who deposited his treasures, 9000 talents, in this strong fortress
                    under the charge of a eunuch Plιil-etaerus of Tium. In 283 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> Philetaerus rebelled, Lysimachus died without being able to put down
                    the revolt, and Pergamum became the capital of a little principality. Partly by
                    clever diplomacy, partly through the troubles caused by the Gaulish invasion and
                    by the dissensions among the rival kings, Philetaerus contrived to keep on good
                    terms with his neighbours bn all sides (283-263 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi>
                    His nephew Eumenes (263-241) succeeded him, increased his power, and even
                    defeated Antiochus of Syria in a pitched battle near Sardis. His successor
                    Attalus I. (241 - 197) won a great battle over the Gauls, and assumed the title
                    of king. The other Greek kings who aimed at power in Asia Minor were his natural
                    enemies. On the other hand, the influence of the Romans was beginning to make
                    itself felt in the East. Attalus perceived the advantage of their alliance
                    against his Greek rivals, connected himself with them from the first, and shared
                    in their continuous success. Under the reign of Attalus Pergamum became the
                    capital of a considerable territory and a centre of art and regal magnificence.
                    Sculptors were attracted by the wealth of the state and the king’s desire to
                    celebrate his victories by monuments of art, and thus arose the so-called
                    “Pergamenian school” in sculpture. The Pergamenian kings appear to have been far
                    more truly Hellenic, and to have admitted far less of the “barbarian” Oriental
                    character to their court, than the other Hellenistic sovereigns, whose habits
                    and surroundings were those of Eastern sultans with a thin surface-gloss of
                    Greek manners. We hear more of the munificence of Attalus towards Athens, then
                    the educational centre of Greece, than to his own capital. The splendour of
                    Pergamum was at its height under Eumenes II. (197-159). He continued true to the
                    Romans during their wars with Antiochus and Perseus, and his kingdom spread over
                    the greater part of western Asia Minor, including Mysia, Lydia, great part of
                    Phrygia and Caria. To celebrate the great achievement of his race, the defeat of
                    the barbarian Gauls, he built in the agora a vast altar to Zeus Soter, adorned
                    with sculptures and especially with a gigantic frieze, in which the symbolic
                    theme of the defeat of the barbarian giants by the gods was treated on such a
                    scale, and with such wealth of detail and perfection of technical skill, as made
                    the monument one of the marvels of the ancient world. He devoted great care to
                    the improvement and embellishment of the city. It is not certain when the old
                    Doric temple of Athena Polias and Nicephorus on the Acropolis was replaced by a
                    more magnificent marble temple, but Eumenes planted a grove in the Nicephorion,
                    the sacred precinct of the goddess, and established libraries and other great
                    works in the city. He left an infant son, Attalus (∏L), and a brother, Attalus
                    II. (Philadelphus), who ruled 159-138, and was succeeded by his nephew, Attalus
                    III. (Philometor). The latter died in 133, and bequeathed his kingdom to the
                    Romans, who erected it into a province under the name of Asia. Pergamum
                    continued to rank, with Ephesus and Smyrna, as one of the three great cities of
                    the province, and the devotion of its former kings to the Roman cause was
                    continued by its citizens, who erected on the acropolis a magnificent temple to
                    Augustus. It was the seat of a <hi rend="italic">conventus,</hi> including the
                    cities of the Caicus valley and some of those in the northern part of the Hermus
                    valley. Under the Roman empire Pergamum was one of the chief seats of the
                    worship of Asclepius; invalids came from distant parts of the country to ask
                    advice from the god and his priests. The temple and the curative establishment
                    of the god were situated outside the city. Pergamum was one of the early seats
                    of Christianity, and one of the seven churches enumerated in the Revelation was
                    situated <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n553/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0553-0528"/> there. Two tributaries of the Caicus, named
                    Selinus and Cetius, flowed through or near the city. The ancient name is still
                    preserved under the form “Bergamo.”</p>
                <p>The excavations conducted by the Prussian Government at Pergamum under the
                    direction of Humann and Bohn have disclosed many of the buildings with which the
                    acropolis was adorned, the temples of Athena and Augustus, the Stoa, &amp;c.,
                    have recovered great part of the frieze on the altar of Zeus, and have given
                    materials of every kind for the elucidation of Pergamenian history and Greek
                    antiquities generally, which it will take years to classify and place before the
                    public (see the preliminary reports published by Conze, Bohn, and Humann).</p>
