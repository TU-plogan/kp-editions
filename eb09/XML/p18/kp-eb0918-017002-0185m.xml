                <p><label type="entry">PALESTINE</label>. As Palestine, geographically considered,
                    forms the southernmost third of <hi rend="smallcaps">Syria,</hi> its general
                    geographical relations, as well as its geological structure, its botany,
                    &lt;fcc., will be treated under that heading. In the matter of climate, on the
                    other hand, it holds a more or less independent position; and this is more
                    strikingly the case with its ethnographic characteristics, at least so far as
                    the pre-Christian period is concerned. Purely historical questions have already
                    been discussed in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Israel.</hi></p>
                <p>By Palestine is to be understood in general the country seized and mainly
                    occupied by the Hebrew people. That portion of territory is consequently
                    excluded which they held only for a time, or according to an ideal demarcation
                    (c∕. Numbers xxxiv., from the older source) by which the land of the Israelites
                    was made to extend from the “river of Egypt” to Hamath; but, on the other hand,
                    that other ancient tradition is accepted which fixes the extreme borders at Dan
                    (at the foot of Hermon) in the north and at Beersheba in the south, thus
                    excluding the Lebanon district and a portion of the southern desert. In like
                    manner, though with certain limitations to be afterwards mentioned, the country
                    east of Jordan stretched from the foot of Hermon to the neighbourhood of the
                    Arnon. Towards the west the natural boundary—a purely ideal one so far as
                    occupation by the Israelites was concerned— was the Mediterranean, but towards
                    the east it is difficult to fix on’ any physical feature more definite than the
                    beginning of the true steppe region. That the territory of Israel extended as
                    far as Salcah (east of Bosra at the foot of the Hauran Mountains) is the
                    statement of an ideal rather <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0188-0171"/> than an historical frontier (Josh, xiii. 11).
                    Palestine thus lies between 31° and 33° 20' N. lat.; its south-west point is
                    situated about 34° 20' E. long., some distance south of Gaza (Ghazza),its
                    north-west point about 35° 15' E. long., at the mouth of the Litâny (Kâsimiye).
                    As the country west of the Jordan stretches east as far as 35° 35' it has a
                    breadth in the north of about 23 miles and in the south of about 80 miles. Its
                    length may be put down as 150 miles; and, according to the English engineers,
                    whose survey included Beersheba, it has an area of 6040 square miles. For the
                    country east of the Jordan no such precise figures are available. The direct
                    distance from Hermon to Arnon is about 120 miles, and the area at the most may
                    be estimated at 3800. square miles. The whole territory of Palestine is thus of
                    very small extent, equal, in fact, to not more than a sixth of England. The
                    classical writers ridicule its insignificant size.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">General Geography.—</hi> Palestine, as thus defined, consists
                    of very dissimilar districts, and borders on regions of the most diverse
                    character. To the south lies a mountainous desert, to the east the elevated
                    plateau of the Syrian steppe, to the north Lebanon and Anti-Libanus, and to the
                    west the Mediterranean. In the general configuration of the country the most
                    striking feature is that it does not rise uninterruptedly from ⅛e sea-coast to
                    the eastern plateau, but is divided into two unequal portions by the deep Jordan
                    valley, which ends in an inland lake (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Jordan).</hi> Nor
                    does the Jordan, like the Nile in Egypt, simply flow through the heart of the
                    country and form its main artery; it is the line of separation between regions
                    that may almost be considered as quite distinct, and that too (as will
                    afterwards appear) in their ethnographic and political aspects. This is
                    especially the case in the southern sections of the country; for even at the
                    Lake of Tiberias the Jordan valley begins to cut so deep that crossing it from
                    either direction involves a considerable ascent.</p>
                <p>The country west of Jordan is thus a hilly and mountainous region which, forming
                    as it were a southward continuation of Lebanon, slopes unsymmetrically east and
                    west, and stretches south, partly as a plateau, beyond the limits of Palestine.
                    The mountain range consists of a great number of individual ridges and summits,
                    from which valleys, often rapidly growing deeper, run east and west. Towards the
                    Mediterranean the slope is very gradual, especially in the more southern parts,
                    where the plain along the coast is also at its broadest. About three-fourths of
                    the cis-Jordan country lies to the west of the watershed. Towards the Dead Sea,
                    on the other hand, the mountains end in steep cliffs; and, as the Jordan valley
                    deepens, the country draining towards it sinks more abruptly, and becomes more
                    and more inhospitable. The plateaus back from the coast-cliffs of the Dead Sea
                    have been desert from ancient times, and towards the east they form gullies of
                    appalling depth. On the other side of the Jordan the mountains have quite a
                    different character, rising from the river gorge almost everywhere as a steep
                    wall (steepest towards the south) which forms the edge of the great upland
                    stretching east to the Euphrates.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The mountains both east and west of the Jordan
                    consist in the main of Cretaceous limestone; nummulitic limestone appears but
                    rarely, as on Carmel, Ebal, and Gerizim. Towards the Dead Sea the rock is
                    traversed by hornblende and flint. Formations of recent origin, such as dunes of
                    sea-sand and the alluvium of rivers and lakes, cover the western margin of
                    Palestine (⅛.e., the whole of Philistia and the plain of Sharon) and the entire
                    valley of the Jordan. Plutonic or volcanic rocks occur occasionally in the
                    country east of Jordan; less frequently in the country to the west, as, for
                    example, in the mountains round the plain of Jezreel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Divisions.—</hi> The mountain system westof Jordan
                    must be broken up into a number of separate groups, which, it may be remarked,
                    are of political as well as physical significance. A first group, consisting of
                    the country north of the plain of Jezreel, may be subdivided into a large
                    northern portion with summits reaching a height of 4000 feet, and a smaller
                    southern portion not exceeding 2000 feet. The former, the Upper Galilee of
                    antiquity, is a mountainous region with a somewhat intricate system of valleys,
                    stretching from the Kâsimiye in the north to a line drawn from Acre ('Akka)
                    towards the Lake of Tiberias. Of the valleys (more than thirty in number) which
                    trend westwards to the Mediterranean, the Wâdi Hubeishiye, Wâdi Εzziye, and Wâdi
                    el-Kurn deserve to be mentioned. Not far west of the watershed is a plateau-like
                    upland draining northwards to the Kâsimiye. The slope to the Jordan is steep.
                    Jebel Jermak, a forest-clad eminence 3934 feet above the sea, is the highest <hi
                    rend="italic">massif.</hi> The whole territory is fruitful, and forms decidedly
                    one of the most beautiful as well as best-wooded districts of Palestine. The
                    plain along the Mediterranean is on the average hardly a mile broad; between
                    cliff and sea there is at times barely room for a narrow road, and at some
                    places indeed a passage has had to be cut out in the rock. South of Râs
                    en-Nakùra, on the other hand, this plain widens considerably; as far as Acre the
                    portion named after this town is about 4 miles broad.</p>
                <p>The mountain structure of the second subsection, or Lower Galilee, is of a
                    different character,—low chains running east and west in well-marked lines, and
                    enclosing a number of elevated plains. Of these plains the most important is
                    that of Buttauf (plain of Zebulun or Asochis), an extremely fertile (in its
                    eastern parts marshy) depression 9 miles long and 2 broad, lying 400 to 500 feet
                    above the sea, between hills 1700 feet high. To the south-west, about 700 feet
                    above the sea, is the smaller but equally fertile plain of J <hi
                    rend="superscript"> l</hi> or⅛n, 5 miles long and 1 mile broad. Among the
                    mountains the most conspicuous landmarks are Nebi Sa'in (1602) near Nazareth,
                    Jebel es-Sih (1838), and especially, to the east of this last, Jebel et-Tιir or
                    Tabor (1843), an isolated wooded cone which rises on all sides with considerable
                    regularity, and commands the plain of Esdraelon. Eastwards the country sinks by
                    a succession of steps: of these the lava-strewn plateau of Sahel el-Ahma, which
                    lies above the cliffs that look down on the Lake of Tiberias, but is 300 feet
                    below the level of the Mediterranean, deserves mention. The principal valleys of
                    the whole region are (1), towards the west, the great basin of Nahr Na'mân
                    (Belus of the ancients), whose main branch is Wâdi Khalzùn, known in its upper
                    course as Wâdi Sha'ib or Wâdi Khashab, and, farther south, the basin of the Wâdi
                    Melek (Wâdi Rummâni), which flows into the Nahr el-Mukatta' (Kishon); and (2)
                    towards the east the rapidflowing Wâdi Rubudiye, Wâdi el-Hamâm, and Wâdi
                    Fejjâs.</p>
                <p>A certain connexion exists between the plains already mentioned (those of
                    Buttauf, Acre, &amp;c.) and the great plain which, with an average height of 250
                    feet above the sea, stretches south from the mountains of Galilee and separates
                    them from the spurs of the mountains of Samaria (the central portion of the
                    cis-Jordan country). This great plain, which in ancient times was known as the
                    plain of Megiddo, and also as the valley of Jezreel or plain of Esdraelon, and
                    which now bears the name of Merj Ibn ‘Amir (pasture land of the son of ‘Amir),
                    is one of the main features of the whole cis-Jordan region (Josephus called it
                    the Great Plain <hi rend="italic">par excellence),</hi> and presents the only
                    easy passage from the coast districts to the Jordan valley and the country
                    beyond. The larger portion lies west of the watershed, which at El-'Afûle is 260
                    feet above <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n189/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0189-0172"/> the Mediterranean. In the narrower application of
                    the name, the whole plain forms a large triangle with its southern corner near
                    Jennin and its western near the mouth of the gorge of the Nahr el-Mu⅛atta' (for
                    here the hills of Nazareth shoot out towards Carmel); and connected with it are
                    various small plains partly running up into the hills. The plain to the south of
                    Acre, in which marshes are formed by the Kishon and Na'mân, and various other
                    recesses towards north and east really belong to it. To the north-east stretches
                    a valley bounded in one direction by Jebel Duhy (the Lesser Hermon, a range 15
                    miles long and 1690 feet high) and in the other direction by the hills of
                    Nazareth and Mount Tabor (where lie Iksal and Deburiye); then to the east of the
                    watershed lies the Bire valley, and the well-watered Wâdi Jâlüd from Zer'in
                    (Jezreel) falls away towards the Jordan between the slopes of Jelel Duhy and the
                    more southern range of Jebel Fukù'a (Mountains of Gilboa). And finally towards
                    Jennin in the south lies the secondary plain of ‘Arrâne. Quite recently it has
                    been proposed to construct in the Merj Ibn 'Ämir the beginning of a railway
                    system for Palestine, and to turn to account the wonderful fertility of its rich
                    basaltic loam which now lies almost completely waste, though in ancient times
                    the whole country was densely peopled and well-cultivated.</p>
                <p>To the south of the plain of Jezreel, which belongs to the northern system of
                    Palestine, it is much more difficult to discover natural divisions. In the
                    neighbourhood of the watershed, which here runs almost regularly in great
                    zigzags, lie a number of plains of very limited extent:—the plain of 'Arrâbe
                    (700 to 800 feet above the sea) connected south-east with the Merj el-Ghuruk,
                    which having no outlet becomes a lake in the rainy season; the plain of
                    Fendekιimiye (1200 feet); and the plain of Rüjib, east of Shechem, connected
                    with the plain of Mukhna (1600 to 1800 feet) to the south-west. The highest
                    mountains too are generally near the watershed. In the ea⅛t lies the
                    south-westward continuation of Gilboa. In the west Mount Carmel (highest point
                    1810 feet, monastery 470) meets the projection of the hills of Nazareth, and
                    sends its wooded ridge far to the north-west so as to form the southern boundary
                    of the Bay of Acre, and render the harbour of Haifa, the little town at its
                    foot, the best on all the coast of Palestine. The belt of land along the shore,
                    barely 200 yards wide, is the northern end of the lowland plain, which,
                    gradually widening, stretches south towards Egypt. At Athlit (9 miles south) it
                    is already 2 miles broad, and it continues much the same for 21 miles to the
                    Nahr ez-Zerka (named by the ancients after the crocodile which is still to be
                    found in its marshes), where a small ridge El Khashm projects from the
                    highlands. South of Nahr ez Zerka begins the marvellously fertile plain of
                    Sharon, which with a breadth of 8 miles near Caesareaand 11 to 12 miles near
                    Yâfâ (Jaffa), stretches 44 miles farther to the Nahr Rùbin, and slopes upwards
                    towards the mountains to a height of about 200 feet above the sea. Its surface
                    is broken by lesser eminences, and traversed by a few coast streams, notably the
                    Nahr el-Falik.</p>
                <p>Between the maritime plain and the mountains proper lies a multiform system of
                    terraces, with a great number of small ridges and valleys. In this the only
                    divisions are those formed by the basins of the larger wadis, which, though
                    draining extensive districts, are here too for the most part dry. They all have
                    a general east and west direction. First comes the basin of the Nahr Mefjir,
                    bounded south by the Bayazid range, and debouching a little to the south of
                    Caesarea; and about 5 miles farther south is the mouth of the Iskanderιine,
                    which is distinguished in its upper portion as the Wâdi Sha <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> ir, running east as far up as Nâbulus (Shechem),
                    hardly a mile west of the λvatershed. It is in this neighbourhood that we find
                    the highest portions of the mountains of Samaria—Jebel Eslândye or Ebal, 3077
                    feet high, to the north of Shechem, and Jebel eυ-Tfir or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >lîerizim</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> 2849 feet high. Both are bare and
                    rugged, and consist, like all the loftier eminences in the district, of hard
                    limestone capped with chalk. It was generally possible, however, to carry
                    cultivation up to the top of all these mountains, and in ancient times the
                    highlands of Samaria are said to have been clothed with abundant forest. From
                    the watershed eastward the important Wâdi Fâr'a (also known as Wâdi Kerâwa in
                    its lower course) descends to the Jordan. Returning to the western slope, we
                    find to the south of Nahr el-Falik the basin of the 'Aujâ, which after it leaves
                    the hills is fed by perennial (partly palustrine) sources, and falls into the
                    sea 5 miles north of Jaffa. As at this place the watershed bends eastward, this
                    extensive basin stretches proportionally far in that direction; and, the right
                    side of the Jordan valley being also very broad, the mountains of the eastern
                    slope soon begin to sink rapidly. On the watershed, not far from Jifna, lies
                    Tell Asûr (3378 feet), and with this summit of hard grey limestone begin the
                    hills of ancient Judah. South of the'Aujâ comes the Nahr Rιibin (near Jabne),
                    perennial up to the Wâdi Surâr (Sorek of Scripture ?), and reaching, as Wâdi Bét
                    Hanina, as far as the country north of Jerusalem; the Wâdi el-Werd is one of its
                    tributaries. Farther south begins the maritime plain of Philistia, which
                    stretches 40 miles along the coast, and, though now but partially under
                    cultivation, consists of a light brown loamy soil of extraordinary fertility. It
                    is crossed by numerous ridges of hills; and to the south of Ashdod (Ezdùd) the
                    highlands advance westwards, and form a hilly district composed of horizontal
                    strata of limestone, sometimes considered part of the lowlands (Shephela), and
                    separated from the more elevated region in the interior by a ridge more or less
                    parallel with the line of the watershed. The basins to the south of the Rûbin
                    are those of Wâdi Sukereir, which runs up towards Tell-es-Sâfi in one direction
                    and to Bét Jibrin in another, of Wâdi el-Hesy, and finally of Wâdi Ghazza, which
                    forms the proper boundary of Palestine towards the south, runs past Beersheba as
                    Wâdi es-Seba, and receives the Wâdi el-Khalil (Hebron) from the north-east.</p>
                <p>As regards the central parts of the country, the mountainous district north of
                    Jerusalem is now known as Jebel el-Kuds, of which the loftiest point is the
                    summit of the Nebi Samwil (2935), rising above the plateau of El-Jib. Near
                    Jerusalem the watershed lies at a height of about 2600 feet. Wild deep-sunk
                    valleys descend eastwards to the Jordan; the Wâdi Kelt, Wâdi en-Nâr (Kedron
                    valley), Wâdi ed Dereje, and southernmost Wâdi Seyâl deserve to be mentioned.
                    The country sloping to the Dead Sea falls in a triple succession of terraces,—a
                    waterless treeless waste (in ancient times known as the desert of Judah), which
                    has never been brought under cultivation, but in the first Christian centuries
                    was the chosen abode of monasticism. To the north of Hebron, in the
                    neighbourhood of Hulhül, lie the highest elevations of this part of the central
                    highlands (up to 3500 feet), which may be distinguished as the mountains of
                    Hebron. Towards Yutta (Juttah) in the south is a sudden step; there begins a
                    plateau at a height of about 2600 feet, but 500 feet below the Hebron watershed.
                    It consists of open wolds and arable land, the soil being a white soft chalk;
                    but there are no wells. Southward another step leads to the white marl desert of
                    Beersheba, abounding in caves. In ancient times this southern district was
                    called the Negeb; it extends far to the south, but is properly a part of
                    Palestine. The country was in former times a steppe region without <pb

                    of nomadic herdsmen.</p>
                <p>The Jordan valley having already been described in a separate article (vol. xiii.
                    p. 746), we may pass at once to a brief sketch of the physical character of the
                    ' country east of Jordan (compare also the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Gilead,</hi> vol. x. p. 594). This is a more difficult task for several
                    reasons: first, no connected series of investigations and measurements has been
                    made in this region; and, secondly, as the ideal demarcation of the book of
                    Joshua is a hardly sufficient basis on which to build, and the information about
                    the actual state of matters supplied by other ancient sources is insufficient,
                    it is impossible to determine the limits of the country as far as it was
                    occupied by the Israelites.</p>
                <p>In the opinion of the present writer, the plain of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Bashan</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> can hardly be assigned to Palestine.
                    To the south of the Yarmuk (Hieromax of the Greeks and Romans, Hebrew name
                    unknown), which falls into the Jordan below the Lake of Tiberias, begins the
                    Cretaceous formation; only in the east of the country the basalt of the Hauran
                    territory stretches farther south. Ascending from the Yarmuk, we first of all
                    reach a mountainous district of moderate elevation (about 2000 feet) rising
                    towards the south; this is JebeΓAjluιψwhich abounds in caves, and, according to
                    recent explorers, is extremely well watered and of great fertility—the whole
                    surface being covered with pasture such as not even Galilee can show. Eastwards
                    are massive ridges as much as 4000 feet in height —Jebel Kafkafa and especially
                    Marâd—separating this territory from the waterless desert lying at no great
                    depth below. The plateau stretches away to the south of the deep gorge of the
                    perennial Zerka (Jabbok), and reaches a considerable height in Jebel Jil'âd
                    (Gilead in the stricter sense). The landmark of the region is Jebel'Osha, to the
                    north of Es-Salt, so-called from the traditional tomb of Hosea. From the
                    deep-sunk Jordan valley the mountains rise grandly in terraces, partly abrupt
                    and rocky; and, while fig trees and vines flourish down in the lower levels,
                    valonia oaks, <hi rend="italic">Laurus</hi><hi rend="italic">Pinus,</hi> cedars,
                    and arbutus grow on the declivities. Owing to its perennial springs, the
                    interior terrace of the country, Mish6r, is a splendid pasture land, famous as
                    such in ancient times; and abundance of wood and water renders this whole middle
                    region of the transJordan country one of the most luxuriant and beautiful in
                    Palestine. Only a few individual summits, such as Jebel Nebâ (Mount Nebo), are
                    noticeable in the ridges that descend to the Jordan valley. The country from the
                    Zerka southward to the Môjib (Arnon) is now known as El Belka; and beyond that
                    begins the land of Moab proper, which also consists of a steep mountain-wall
                    through which deep gorges cut their way to the plain, and behind this of a
                    plateau poorly watered but dotted over with ancient ruins. In this district,
                    too, there are a few individual summits. And here also a mountain-wall separates
                    the plain from the eastern desert; and the mountain district continues farther
                    south along the Araba (c∕. <hi rend="smallcaps">Idumea,</hi> vol. xii. p.
                    699).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Water.—</hi> Palestine is not exceptionally deficient in water.
                    Perennial streams, indeed, are scarce, and were so in antiquity; but except in
                    certain districts, as the desert of Judah, the country is not badly supplied
                    with springs. Tn keeping with the structure of the rocks, these usually break
                    out .at the junction of the hard and soft strata. Thus abundant springs of good
                    water occur on the very summit of the cis-Jordan country, as, for example, near
                    Hebron, at Näbulus, and in Galilee; and, though few are found in the immediate
                    neighbourhood of Jerusalem, more than forty may be counted within a radius of 15
                    to 20 miles round the city. There is no water in the low hilly country behind
                    the coast region; and, though in its northern portion some fairly large streams
                    take their rise, the same is true of the coast-region itself. Rising as they do
                    at the foot of a great mountain range, the most abundant springs in Palestine
                    are those of the Jordan, especially those near Bànias and Tell-el-Kâdi. The
                    mountains of Gilead are rich in excellent water. A considerable number of hot
                    springs occur throughout the country, especially in and near the Jordan valley;
                    they were used in ancient times for curative purposes, and might still be so
                    used. The water of the bath of El-Hammäm, about 2 miles south of Tiberias, has a
                    temperature of 137° Fahr., and the spring near the Zerka Ma'in, formerly known
                    as Callirrhoe, as much as 142° Fahr. Hot sulphur springs also occur on the west
                    coast of the Dead Sea. Many of the springs in Palestine are slightly brackish.
                    From the earliest times cisterns have naturally played a great part in the
                    country; they are found everywhere in great numbers. Generally they consist of
                    reservoirs of masonry widening out downwards, with a narrow opening above often
                    covered with heavy stones. Open reservoirs were also constructed to collect rain
                    and spring water. Such reservoirs (pools; Arab., <hi rend="italic">birka</hi>;
                    Hebrew, <hi rend="italic">berekha)</hi> are especially numerous near Jerusalem
                    and Hebron; the largest still extant are the three so-called Pools of Solomon,
                    in Wâdi Urtâs (Artas), arranged in steps at a little distance from each other.
                    Besides the conduits connected with this gigantic work, fine remains of
                    aqueducts of Roman date are found near Jericho, in the ruins of many towns in
                    the trans-Jordan country, at Sefûriye (Sepphoris) in Galilee, in ancient
                    Caesarea, &amp;c. Many of these aqueducts, as well as many now ruined cisterns,
                    could be restored without much trouble, and would give a great stimulus to the
                    fertility and cultivation of the country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Vegetation.—</hi> Palestine may be considered part
                    of the subtropical zone. At the summer solstice the sun stands 10 degrees south
                    of the zenith; the shortest day is thus one of ten hours, the longest of only
                    fourteen. In a few points, as already remarked^ there is a difference between
                    Palestine and the rest of Syria. The extensive maritime plain and the valley of
                    the Jordan give rise to important climatic contrasts. From its vicinity to the
                    sea the former region is naturally warmer than the highlands. The mean annual
                    temperature is 70° Fahr., the extremes being 50° and 85°. The harvest ripens two
                    weeks earlier than among the mountains. Citrons and oranges flourish; the palm
                    also grows, but without fruiting; melons are largely cultivated; and pomegranate
                    bushes are to be seen. Less rain falls than in the mountains. Another climatic
                    zone consists of the highlands (from 500 to 3000 feet above the sea), which were
                    the real home of the Israelites. The average temperature of Jerusalem, which may
                    be taken as pretty much that of the upland as a whole, is 62°, but the extremes
                    are considerable, as the thermometer may sink several degrees below the freezing
                    point, though frost and snow never last long. The rainfall of 20 inches is
                    distributed over about fifty days. In this climate the vine, the fig, and the
                    olive succeed admirably. Even in the southernmost districts (of the Negeb), as
                    well as throughout the whole country, there are traces of» ancient wine-growing.
                    A large share of the oil is consumed at home, partly in the manufacture of soap.
                    The mountain ridges in this zone are for the most part bare, but the slopes and
                    the valleys are green, and beauty and fertility increase as we advance
                    northwards. In regard to the climate of the third zone, see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Jordan</hi> (vol. xiii. <hi rend="italic">ut sup.).</hi> The barley harvest
                    here ends with the middle of April. The thermometer rarely sinks below 77°, and
                    goes as high as 130°. The fourth zone, the elevated plateau of the trans-Jordan
                    region, has an extreme climate.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n191/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0191-0174"/>
                <p>The thermometer may frequently fall during the night below the freezing point,
                    and rise next day to 80°. The mountains are often covered with snow in winter.
                    Whilst the rainfall in the Jordan valley is very slight, the precipitation in
                    the eastern mountains is again considerable; as in western Palestine the dewfall
                    is heavy. From this short survey it appears that Palestine is a country of
                    strong contrasts. Of course it was the same in antiquity; climate, rainfall,
                    fertility, and productiveness cannot have seriously altered. Even if we suppose
                    that there was a somewhat richer clothing of wood and trees in the central
                    districts of the country, yet on the whole the general appearance must have been
                    much the same as at present. To the stranger from the steppes arriving at a
                    favourable season of the year Palestine may still give the impression of a land
                    flowing with milk and honey. The number of cisterns and reservoirs is proof
                    enough that it was not better supplied with water in ancient times; but, on the
                    other hand, the numerous ruins of places which were still flourishing during the
                    Roman period show that at one time (more especially in the southern districts,
                    which now possess but few inhabited localities) cultivation must have been
                    carried on more extensively and thoroughly. In general the country enjoyed the
                    greatest security, and consequently the greatest prosperity, under Western rule,
                    which even protected the country east of Jordan (at present partly beyond the
                    control of the Government) from the inroads of the Bedouins. The Romans also did
                    excellent service by the construction of roads, portions of which (as well as
                    Roman milestones and bridges) still exist in good preservation in many places.
                    Thus it cannot be denied that the resources of the country were formerly better
                    developed than at present. Like all the lands of the nearer East, Palestine
                    suffers from the decay of the branches of industry which still flourished there
                    in the Middle Ages. The harbours are not of sufficient size for large vessels;
                    that of Hâifa alone is capable of any development. The road from Yâfà to
                    Jerusalem is the only one in the country fit for carriages. The proposal to
                    construct a railway along this route (for which a firman was granted in 1875) is
                    renewed from time to time; but it will be hard to carry it out, as, in spite of
                    the pilgrims (who, besides, are restricted to one period of the year), the
                    passenger traffic is not large enough to .be remunerative, and commercial
                    traffic there is almost none. At the same time the formation of means of
                    communication would increase the productiveness of the country. The culture of
                    olives and export of oil are especially capable of expansion. As regards the
                    industrial arts, souvenirs for the pilgrims, rosaries, carved work in olive wood
                    and mother-of-pearl, &amp;c., are produced at Jerusalem and Bethlehem, and to
                    some extent are exported. Wheat from the Hauran is also shipped at Acre and
                    elsewhere, but neither exports nor imports are commercially important. The salt
                    farming, which could easily be carried on at the Dead Sea and the deposit of
                    salt to the south of it, is hampered by the difficulty of bringing the produce
                    up the steep paths to the top of the mountains. In the valley of the Jordan all
                    the products of the tropics could with little trouble be cultivated^ Bee-keeping
                    still receives attention, but might also be extended.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Political Geography.—</hi> Evidence of an early occupation of
                    Palestine is afforded by the stone monuments (cromlechs and circles of stones),
                    which are found more especially in the country east of Jordan, but also in the
                    country to the west. To what period they belong in this part of the world is as
                    doubtful as it is elsewhere; but it may be remarked that stories of a gigantic
                    primeval population once prevailed in Palestine. To what race these people may
                    have belonged is, however, unknown. For thousands of years Palestine was an
                    object of conflict between the vast monarchies of western Asia. As Egypt,
                    whenever she sought to extend her power, was from the very position of the
                    country naturally led to make herself mistress of the east coast of the
                    Mediterranean, so, on the other hand, there were no physical boundaries to
                    prevent the westward advance into Palestine of the Asiatic empires. For both
                    Egypt and the East indeed the country formed a natural thoroughfare, in time of
                    war for the forces of the contending powers, in time of peace for the trading
                    caravans which carried on the interchange of African and Asiatic
                    merchandise.</p>
                <p>One of the oldest of the still extant historical documents in regard to the
                    geography of Palestine is the inscription on the pylônes of the temple of
                    Karnak, on which Thothmes III. (in the beginning of the 16th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) has handed down an account of his military
                    expedition to western Asia. Many of the topographical names of Palestine there
                    mentioned are certainly hard to identify; a number, however, such as Iphu for
                    Yâfà, Luden for Lydda, Magedi for Megiddo, &lt;fcc., are beyond dispute. The
                    lists show that these names are of extreme antiquity, dating from before the
                    Hebrew immigration. There is also a hieratic papyrus of the 14th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> which contains a description of a carriage journey
                    through Syria made by an Egyptian officer, possibly for the collection of
                    tribute. Bethshean and the Jordan, among other localities, appear to be
                    mentioned in this narrative, but the identification of most of the names is very
                    dubious. Another foreign source of information as to the geography of Palestine
                    can only be alluded to—the records contained in the cuneiform inscriptions,
                    which mention a number of the most important towns:—Akku (Akko, Acre), Du’ru
                    (Dor), Magidu (Megiddo), Yappu (Jaffa), Asdudu (Ashdod), Iskaluna (Askalon),
                    Hazzatu (Ghazza, Gaza), Altaku (Eltheke), Ursalimmu (Jerusalem), and Samarina
                    (Samaria), and— of course only from the 8th century, when they came into hostile
                    contact with Assyria—the countries of Judah, Moab, Ammon, and Edom.</p>
                <p>The information supplied by the Old Testament enables us to form only an
                    extremely imperfect conception of the earliest ethnographic condition of the
                    country. The population to the east of the Jordan was already, it is clear,
                    sharply marked off from that to the west. In the latter region dwelt an
                    agricultural people which had already reached no inconsiderable degree of
                    civilization. Closely related to the Phoenicians, they were distinguished as
                    Canaanites from the name of their country, which originally applied to the
                    maritime belt and afterwards to the whole cis-Jordan territory (vol. iv. p. 62).
                    Though for particular reasons they are placed among the Hamitic races in Gen.
                    x., many modern investigators are of opinion that, according to our principles
                    of ethnographic classification, they were Semitic; their language, at any rate,
                    was very similar to Hebrew. The separation of Canaanites from Semites may have
                    been due, in part at least, to the fact that a deep contrast made itself felt
                    between them and the Hebrews, though they were only, perhaps, an older result of
                    Arabic emigration. The enumeration of the names of the various branches of the
                    Canaanites leaves it an extremely difficult task to form a clear idea of their
                    tribal distribution; names of separate sections, too, like that of the Amorites,
                    are sometimes applied to the Canaanites as a whole. The Amorites were at any
                    rate the most powerful tribe; they dwelt in the southern portion of Canaan, as
                    well as more especially in the northern parts of the country east of Jordan.
                    About the others nothing more can be said save that the Perizzites, Hivites, and
                    Girgashites dwelt in the heart of Canaan and the Jebusites near Jerusalem. The
                    Philistines occupied <pb break="no"

                    population was settled in the south and south-west. Amalekites and Midianites,
                    and the Kenites, a branch of the latter, early entered into close relationship
                    with the Israelites, and along with them took possession of the extreme south,
                    where, however, they remained nomadic. Of peoples closely akin to the Israelites
                    may be mentioned the Moabites, the Ammonites, and the Edomites. Before the
                    arrival of the Israelites the Moabites had developed a certain degree of power.
                    The district, bordering on Edom, which they occupied in the south of the country
                    east of Jordan, was bounded on the south by WAdi el-Ahsa (called in Is. xv. 7
                    the brook of the willows), an affluent of the southern part of the Dead Sea, and
                    on the north stretched far beyond the Arnon (originally, indeed, to the north
                    end of the sea, as in later times the country near Jericho was known as the
                    steppes of Moab). Its eastern frontier must always have been matter of dispute,
                    the relations of the nomadic tribes of the Syrian desert being the same as they
                    are now, and contests with the Ammonites taking place from time to time. The
                    Ammonites, a closely related people, lay to the north-east of Moab, east of the
                    later possessions of Israel; but, as they were in the main nomadic, their
                    frontiers were of a shifting character (see vol. i. p. 742). TheEdomitfbs (also
                    nomadic) were situated in the south of the country east of Jordan; how far, at
                    an earlier period, they extended their encampments to the west of Jordan and
                    into the Negeb district cannot be with certainty decided.</p>
                <p>It depends on the conception we form as io the general tribal relations of Israel
                    how we represent to ourselves the method in which the settlement of the country
                    by the tribes was accomplished as they passed from the nomadic to the fixed mode
                    of life <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Israel, Joseph, Judah).
                    To</hi> explain this tribal relationship is not the task of a geographical
                    sketch; it is enough for the present purpose to call attention to the fact that
                    the account of the rise of the Israelitic tribes as it has come down to us is in
                    great measure mythical or the product of later reflexion; even the number twelve
                    is made out only with difficulty. Further, the settlements of the several tribes
                    must be by no means conceived as administrative districts after the fashion of
                    the modern canton; and, thirdly, the view that the several tribes had, after a
                    general invasion of the country, their tribal territories allotted by Joshua (as
                    we now read in the book of Joshua) is taken from the most modern, post-exilic,
                    source of the Hexate αch, and stands in glaring opposition to the accounts in
                    other books, according to which the conquest was in the main a peaceful one, and
                    the assimilation with the native Canaanites gradually effected. The tribes which
                    settled to the north of the great plain, especially those on the sea-coast,
                    appear to have been much less successful in keeping free from Canaanitish
                    influence; gradually, however, as the state and religion of Israel grew
                    stronger, Israelitish influence made its way more and more even there. The heart
                    of the country was the central portion later known as Samaria. The opposition
                    between this district and the southern part of the country took shape at an
                    early date. In the extreme south the Simeonites retained their nomadic way of
                    life, and were by degrees mixed up with other wandering tribes. Down into the
                    time of the early kings the dominion of the powerful Philistines stretched far
                    into the centre of the country, and gave the first impulse to a firmer
                    concentration of the energies of Israel. But the Israelites did not succeed in
                    forcing their way in the southern regions down to the sea; in culture and
                    well-established political institutions they were far surpassed by the
                    Philistines. As regards the geography of the Philistine territory, the position
                    of four of their chief towns, Gaza, Askelon, Ashdod, and Ekron, is known; but it
                    has not been ascertained where the fifth, Gath, was situated, though it must
                    have lain not far from the present Bét Jibrin.—No definite boundaries can be
                    assigned to the Israelitic country to north, south, or west.</p>
                <p>Up to the conquest of Jebus the most important city of the southern region was
                    undoubtedly Hebron (see vol. xi. p. 608). Clans belonging to Judah had there
                    combined with others of alien origin; and the portions of this tribe which dwelt
                    in the farthest south had become mingled with elements from the tribe of Simeon,
                    while on the other hand the Simeonites acquired certain places in the territory
                    of Judah. In regard to the south country in general, we obtain in the Old
                    Testament the most detailed description of the frontiers, but the reason that we
                    are able to follow it with so much accuracy is that the statements refer
                    exclusively to post-exilic times, though it must be assumed that a certain
                    recollection was still preserved of the original boundary between Judah and
                    Benjamin. The line of the marches of the northern tribes, as indeed this whole
                    system of demarcation, frequently follows the configuration of the ground, but
                    occasionally becomes vague and doubtful. Especially striking is the omission of
                    the districts of Samaria; it seems that at the time of the codification of the
                    system this district was little known to the Judaeans. A great deal of trouble
                    has been expended—more especially since the rise of a more scientific
                    exploration of the country—in verifying the old place-names which are known from
                    the Bible, the writings of Eusebius, and the Talmud. The task is rendered much
                    easier by the fact that in Palestine, as in every country where the ethnographic
                    conditions have not been too violently revolutionized, a large number of ancient
                    names of places have been preserved in use for thousands of years, often with
                    only insignificant changes of form—a state of matters to which the continuous
                    existence in the country of Semitic-speaking people has powerfully contributed.
                    The identification of the ancient with the modern names demands none the less
                    thorough historical and philological investigation. Through the labours of
                    Robinson and Guérin we now possess a list of the names in use at least in the
                    country west of Jordan. The list of six thousand names collected during the
                    English survey by Lieuts. Conder and Kitchener is particularly rich,—though it
                    must be borne in mind that the orthography in many cases has not been determined
                    with sufficient accuracy, and that a revision of the collection on the spot by a
                    trained Arabic scholar would be desirable. By the help of this abundant material
                    many of the ancient place-names can undoubtedly be assigned to their localities,
                    and in part at least the direction of the tribal boundaries as they were
                    conceived by the author of the lists preserved in the book of Joshua can be
                    followed. In regard to a large number of places, Joshua leaves us to mere
                    conjecture; and the investigations and combinations hitherto effected are (in
                    the opinion of the present writer) far from sufficient for the construction of
                    such a map of ancient Palestine as the Palestine Exploration Fund has published.
                    The difficulties of the case are further increased by the fact that the ancient
                    localities were at an early date fixed by tradition. An undoubted example of
                    this is furnished by the grave of Rachel between Jerusalem and Bethlehem, the
                    localizing of which goes back to an ancient gloss on Gen. xxxv. 19. Even in the
                    case of apparently well-established identifications such as Bei tin = Bethel,
                    the question may be raised whether in reality artificial tradition may not have
                    been at work, and ancient Bethel have to be sought elsewhere. Too much care,
                    therefore, cannot be brought to bear on the reconstruction of the ancient
                    geography of Palestine.</p>

                <p>It lies beyond the purpose of the present article to enter into the details of
                    the ancient tribal demarcation of Palestine, especially as the tradition, as has
                    been explained, is relatively late and artificial. As an illustration of our
                    view of the subject we may select the boundaries of Judah itself (Josh. xv.).
                    Here the first thing that strikes the reader is that the western frontier as
                    there described for the earliest times is purely ideal, inasmuch as it includes
                    the land of the Philistines. Inconsistencies of view are apparent in the
                    ascription of certain places in Judah to Simeon and of others to Dan. A further
                    difficulty arises from the discrepancies between the Massoretic text and that of
                    the Septuagint in regard to the number of towns belonging to Judah. As regards
                    the southern boundaries described in Josh. xv. 2 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> the
                    course of the line, in our opinion, cannot be determined with certainty even if
                    it were generally admitted that Kadesh-Barnea is to be fixed at 'Ain Kadis. The
                    determination of the northern boundary is more explicit: it ran from the mouth
                    of the Jordan to Beth-hogla (which is found in 'Ain el-Hajla). The position of
                    Beth-arabah (Beth ha-Araba) is doubtful; and at least it has not been absolutely
                    settled whether Eben Bohan ben Reuben really corresponds to Hajar el-Asbah. The
                    identification of Debir with Thughrat-ed-Debr may be correct. Gilgal, which
                    follows, is unknown. The ascent from Adummim may correspond with Talat-ed-Dem,
                    which preserves at least an echo of the older name. It is a mere conjecture
                    which places the water of En (Ain) Shemesh in 'Ain Haudh. The Fuller’s Spring,
                    En Rogel, has in recent times been sought in St Mary’s Well; but, with others,
                    we consider Bit Eiyùb a more probable identification. The position of the valley
                    of Hinnom and the plain of Rephaim has been determined; Nephtoah corresponds
                    perhaps to the modern Lifta. The places situated on Mount Ephron—Baalah and
                    Kirjath-Jearim—cannot be made out any more than the mountains Seir and Jearim.
                    It may be admitted that Chesalon is Kesla and Bethshemesh is 'Ain Shems, since
                    the direction towards Timnah (Tibna) is imperative. The position of Ekron is
                    ascertained; but it is hazardous to find Shicron in Khirbet Sukereir; and where
                    Mount Baalah was situated we do not know. Finally, Jabniel corresponds to Yebna.
                    From this example it is clear how difficult it is with the existing material to
                    determine the ancient tribal limits, and how necessary it is in such an
                    undertaking to distinguish provisional conjectures from well-established
                    identification. To carry out this task lies beyond the scope of this article; to
                    prove individual points whole treatises require to be written. Compare the
                    articles on the several tribes and the maps.</p>
                <p>It has already been remarked that the extension given to the tribal territories
                    in the book of Joshua is frequently the mere reflexion of pious wishes. This
                    holds true in general of the territories of Zebulun, Naphtali, and especially
                    Asher; it is to be particularly remembered that down to a very late date (the
                    time of the Maccabees) the Israelites were almost entirely shut out from the
                    sea-coast. To the north of the land of the Philistines the maritime plain was in
                    the hands of the Phoenicians; the plain to the south of Dor (the modem Tantura)
                    was called Naphoth Dor (hill range of Dor). Even in the New Testament mention is
                    made of a district of Tyre and Sidon to which we must not assign too narrow an
                    extension inland. How matters stood in the country east of Jordon it is hard to
                    decide. The stretch from the north of the Dead Sea to the Yarmuk (practically to
                    the south end of the Lake of Tiberias) was the only portion securely held by the
                    tribes of Israel; here, on the Jabbok, in the centre of the trans-Jordan region,
                    the Gadites had settled; here there was an ancient Israelitic district in the
                    neighbourhood of Mahanaim, Jabesh (on the present Wadi Yabιs), Succoth,
                    Penuel—places whose position for the most part cannot be determined. From some
                    passages it is evident that the warlike tribe of Gad found it difficult to
                    protect itself against its enemies. Numbers xxxii., a chapter belonging to the
                    older class of sources, throws much light on the conditions under which the
                    country east of Jordan was occupied, and it represents Reuben and Gad as having
                    seized the Moabite territory to the north of the Arnon. We have in this a
                    picture of a temporary extension of the territory of Israel, probably from the
                    time of Omri (compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Moab).</hi></p>
                <p>According to the inscription of King Mesha, the Gadites were still in Ataroth;
                    Dibon, on the contrary, was Moabitic; other towns, such as Kirjathaim, Nebo,
                    Jahaz, had been conquered by Mesha from the Israelites. It is remarkable that
                    the Reubenites are not once mentioned in the inscription. At the date, too, when
                    Isaiah xv.-xvi. were written (before the time of Isaiah himself ?), the Moabite
                    dominion was widely extended. From all this it may be concluded that the
                    Reubenites had to carry on a protracted struggle with Moab for the possession of
                    the country,—the walled towns being now subject to the one belligerent and now
                    to the other, and the Amon consequently forming only an ideal boundary. No
                    accurate knowledge of the condition of the settlements of Manasseh in the
                    country east of Jordan has come down to us. The clan Machir had its seat in
                    Gilead; and there, too, were the tentvillages of Jair, a clan which also
                    possessed the district of Argob in Bashan, situated somewhere to the east of the
                    Lake of Tiberias. The Nobah clan was settled in Kenath (the modem Kanawât) on
                    the western slope of the Hauran Mountains. From these facts it is evident that
                    in the trans-Jordan region north of the Yarmuk and east of the Lake of Tiberias,
                    there were at least a few Israelite colonies; but they occupied merely scattered
                    points, and thus in this district also the allotment of the country in the book
                    of Joshua must be regarded as a mere pious wish. Other peoples settled in the
                    Hauran, and the ever-advancing Aramaeans soon diminished and absorbed these
                    Israelitic possessions.</p>
                <p>The tribes of Israel made a great step in the conquest of the country when, under
                    the early kings, they became subject to a single central government. They were
                    now strong enough to seize many of the walled towns which the Canaanites had
                    hitherto occupied; and their dominion, indeed, extended far beyond the limits of
                    Palestine. Our information in regard to the divisions of the country during the
                    regal period is very defective. The list of Solomon’s twelve “officers” (1 Kings
                    iv.) at least is derived from ancient sources; but it must be observed that,
                    while the boundaries of some of the districts appear to coincide with the tribal
                    boundaries, the political division was not based on the tribal. Nor at a later
                    date was the line of separation between the kingdoms determined simply by the
                    tribal division; the most that is meant is that Judah and Benjamin stood on the
                    one side; of Simeon there is no longer any word. In the account given in 1 Kings
                    χi. mention is only made of one tribe that remained true to David, by which must
                    naturally be understood that of Judah. The limits, in fact, so far as they
                    related to the tribal territory of Benjamin, seem to have varied from time to
                    time; the northern portion as far as Ramah (1 Kings xv. ), or as far as the
                    ravine of Michmash (Mukhmas), usually belonged to the northern kingdom, and the
                    same was the case with Jericho. It was to this kingdom of Israel, also, with its
                    general superiority in strength and influence, that all the Israelitic districts
                    beyond Jordan were attached. That it consisted, however, of ten tribes (1 Kings
                    xii.) is a highly artificial computation. The small extent of the southern
                    kingdom is evident from a list (if indeed it be trustworthy) given in 2 Chron.
                    xi. of the towns fortified by Rehoboam. As regards the capitals of the northern
                    kingdom, the royal court was originally at Shechem (Nâbulus), from the time of
                    Jeroboam I. at Tirzah (not yet identified), and from the time of Omri at Samaria
                    (Sebastiye); the house of Ahab had its seat for a season at Jezreel (Zer'in)
                    (see vol. xiii. p. 689).</p>
                <p>It is rather an historical than a geographical task to describe in detail the
                    boundaries or divisions of Palestine in later times. From the lists for the
                    post-exilic period, found in the books of Ezra and Nehemiah, and containing a
                    series of new topographical names, it is evident that a considerable portion of
                    the old tribal territory of Benjamin as well as of Judah was again peopled by
                    Jews,—on the one hand the places from Jericho to Lydda, on the other a strip to
                    the north of Bethel down to Beersheba in the south. Gradually, however, Edomites
                    (perhaps pressed upon by Nabataeans) forced their way into the southern portion
                    of the country, with the capital Hebron, so that it obtained the name of
                    Idumea.</p>
                <p>Before proceeding to the Graeco-Roman period it will be well to consider the
                    names by which the country in general was called at different times. Gilead was
                    the centre of the power of the Israelites on the east side of Jordan, and the
                    whole country which they possessed there bore this name. Gilead consequently is
                    opposed to Canaan, the “Promised Land.” For the later Hebrews distinguished this
                    western territory as more especially the country which had been promised them,
                    and regarded it as the possession of their national God, and therefore as a holy
                    land. After the separation the more important northern and eastern portion
                    naturally became the land of Israel <hi rend="italic">par excellence,</hi> while
                    the southern portion ultimately received the name of the individual tribe of
                    Judah (as indeed the northern kingdom was frequently called after the most
                    powerful tribe of Ephraim). The name of the southern kingdom appears in
                    Cuneiform inscriptions as mât (ir) Ya-u-du (di); and it is said that mât Sir'lai
                    occurs once for the land of Israel, though more frequently it is called mât
                    Humri (Land of Omri). Though it has not been absolutely proved that even the
                    Assyrians occasionally included Judah under the designation Palastav or Pilista
                    (Philistia), still there is nothing improbable about the supposition. But it
                    cannot be taken for granted that the cis-Jordan country bore the name of land of
                    the Philistines at a time when it was the scene of a great development of the
                    Philistian power; the name was rather, as so often happens, extended by their
                    neighbours from Philistia proper to the country beyond, and from the Egyptians
                    it passed to the Greeks. In the Old Testament Peleshet is still always
                    restricted to the Philistine coast-plain; the same is the case in Josephus; and
                    in Herodotus, though the usage is not very explicit, Palaestina appears usually
                    to have no wider application. Gradually, however, the designation Palaestina
                    Syria, or simply Palaestina, got into vogue, and was made to include even the
                    country east of Jordan, and consequently the whole territory between Lebanon and
                    Sinai.</p>
                <p>We now return to the divisions of Palestine. Already in the book of Kings (that
                    is, by the time of the exile) the name Shomeron (Samaria) is applied to the
                    territory of the northern kingdom, for mention is made of the “towns of
                    Samaria.” In the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n194/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0194-0177"/> apocryphal books of the Old Testament, Judaea and
                    Samaria <hi rend="italic">(¾aμaρeiτιs, 2aμapιs, 2aμaρeιa)</hi> are opposed to
                    each other; but the limits of the two divisions at the time of Christ, and for
                    centuries previously, can hardly be laid down. Thus in Josephus the
                    Mediterranean coast as far as Acre is assigned to Judaea; towards the south this
                    country was bounded by Idumea; in the north it extended to about 8 miles to the
                    south of Nâbulus (Shechem). Whether Samaria extended from the Jordan to the sea
                    is uncertain; in the north it reached the southern edge of the plain of
                    Esdraelon, the frontier town being 'En Gannim (Jennin). Galilee (in regard to
                    which see vol. X. p. 27) was originally the district in the neighbourhood of
                    Kedes, afterwards distinguished as Upper Galilee. The Jewish population was
                    there largely mixed with Phoenicians, Syrians, Greeks, and even Arabs. The whole
                    maritime region to the north of Dor was still called Phoenicia in the time of
                    the Romans, and thus does not strictly belong to Palestine in our sense of the
                    word. Along the coast, as well as more especially in the north of the country,
                    numerous Greek colonies were established; how strong the foreign influence must
                    have been in Samaria and Galilee is evident from the preservation of so many
                    Graeco-Roman names like Neapolis (Nâbulus), Sebaste (Sebastiye), Tiberias
                    (Tabariye). Elsewhere too, in the south for example, the old nomenclature was
                    altered: Aelia was substituted for Jerusalem, Azotus formed from Ashdod, and so
                    on; but the old names were always retained in the mouth of the people. The north
                    of the country and the trans-Jordan region were much more thoroughly brought
                    under the influence of the Greeks and Romans than the south. The Greek towns in
                    some cases date from the time of Alexander the Great, and others were founded by
                    the Ptolemies; but most of them owe their origin to the Seleucids. One district
                    of the trans-Jordan region retained at that period its old**ame in the Greek
                    form of Peraea. Josephus says that this district extended from the Jordan to
                    Philadelphia (Rabbath Ammon, 'Amman) and Gerasa (Jerasb), went southward as far
                    as Machaerus (Mkaur on the Zerka Ma'in), and north as far as Pella (Fâhil
                    opposite Beisan). Adjoining Peraea, and mainly to the east of .Jordan, lay the
                    Decapolis, which was not, however, a continuous territory, but a political group
                    of cities occupied by Greek republics distinguished from the tetrarchies with
                    tlιeir Jewish-Syrian-Arabic population in the midst of which they were
                    scattered. The largest of these cities was Scythopolis (Beisan); others were
                    Hippos, Gadara (Mkés), Philadelphia, Dion, Gerasa, &amp;c.; but ancient
                    authorities do not agree about the names. Little requires to be said about the
                    division of the country in later Roman times. In the 5th century a threefold
                    partition began to prevail:— Palaestina Prima (roughly equal to Judaea and
                    Samaria), Palaestina Secunda (the countries about the upper Jordan and the Lake
                    of Gennesaret), and Palaestina Tertia or Salutaris (Idumea and Moab). In the
                    time of the crusades the same names were applied to three divisions (at once
                    political and ecclesiastical) of the country w.est of Jordan,—Palaestina Prima
                    or Maritima being the coast region as far as Carmel (with Caesarea as its
                    archbishop’s see), Palaestina Secunda comprising the mountains of Judah and
                    Ephraim (with the patriarchal see of Jerusalem), and Palaestina Tertia
                    corresponding roughly to Galilee (with its bishop’s see at Nazareth). The
                    country east of Jordan was called Arabia, and was in like manner divided into
                    three parts lying north and south of each other.</p>
                <p>The Arabians retained the name Filistin, and they divided the country into two
                    principal portions,—the Jordan district (chiefly the northern parts) and
                    Filistin proper, which extended from the Lake of Gennesaret to Aila and from
                    Lejjun to Refah. Under the Turks Palestine was till quite recently subject to
                    the governor of Syria; the greater part of it now forms an independent vilayet.
                    The chief districts are (each with its town) Gaza, Hebron, Yàfa, Ludd (with
                    Ramla), Nâbulus, Sha'rawiye, Jennin (with Beisan), Haifa, Acre, Tabariye,
                    Nâsira, Safed; and in the country east of Jordan 'Ajlιin, Belka es-Salt, Kerak,
                    and Ma'ân.</p>
                <p>Palestine is by no means so strikingly a country apart as is usually supposed. It
                    lay, as already mentioned, near the great military highway from western Asia to
                    Egypt and Africa. The traffic by sea was also formerly of importance; and even
                    in the Middle Ages something was done for the protection of the harbours. At no
                    time, however, was the country in the proper sense of the word a rich one; it
                    hardly ever produced more than was necessary for home consumption. The great
                    trading caravans which passed through were glad for the most part to avoid the
                    highlands, and that region at least was thus more or less isolated. The
                    following is a brief survey of the principal routes, partly as they formerly
                    existed, and partly as they are still used. From Egypt a road runs by El-'Arish
                    (Rhinocolura) or “the river of Egypt” by Rafah (Raphia) to <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Gaza</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.υ.).</hi> From Gaza another runs by Umm Lakis
                    (Lachish?) and Bét Jibrin (Eleutheropolis) across the mountains to Jerusalem.
                    Northwards from Gaza the main route continues along the plain at some distance
                    from the sea (which in this part has piled up great sand dunes) to El-Mejdel
                    (Migdal Gad) near Askelon, and so on to Ashdod (Ezdud, Azotus). From Ashdod a
                    road runs by ’ Akir (Ekron) to Ramie, an important town in the mediaeval Arabian
                    period, and Ludd (Lod, Lydda). From these towns, which are connected with the
                    port of Yâfâ (Japho, Joppa), three routes run to Jerusalem, of .which the one
                    most used in antiquity was evidently the northern one passing by Jimzu (Gimzo)
                    and the two Bét Urs (Beth-horon), and not the one now followed by 'Amwâs
                    (Nicopolis) and Wadi 'Ali. From Yâfâ a road continues along the coast by Arsùf
                    (Apollonia) to the ruins of Kaisariye (Caesarea), then past Tantura (ruins of
                    Dor) and 'Athlit (Castellum Peregrinorum of the crusaders) and round the foot of
                    the promontory of Carmel, to Haifa and Acre (a town of great importance from
                    early times). Another route starting from Ludd runs north close to the mountains
                    by Antipatris (now Kefr Saba or Râs el- ’ Ain ?) and Kakxrn, and ends at Khân
                    Lejjun. The Great Plain offered the easiest passage from the coast inland.
                    El-Lejjùn (a corruption of the Latin <hi rend="italic">Legio)</hi> was certainly
                    an important point; it is still conjecturally identified, according to
                    Robinson’s suggestion, with the ancient Megiddo, which Conder would rather place
                    at Mejedde'a. In the vicinity lie the rains of Ta ’ anuk (Taanach), and farther
                    south-west the great centre of Jennin ('En Gannim, Ginnaea). From Acre there
                    also runs a road directly east over the mountains to Khân Jubb Yùsuf.</p>
                <p>The coast road from Acre northwards passes through Zib (Akhzib, Ecdippa)and the
                    two promontories of Râs en-Nâkûraand Ras-el-Abyad (Scala Tyriorum), and so
                    continues to the maritime plain of Tyre.—To return to the south, from Egypt
                    (Suez, Arsinoe) the desert was crossed to Ruheibe (Rechoboth), Khulasa (Elusa),
                    and Bir-es-seba (Beersheba), and from this place the route went northward to
                    Ed-Dhoheriye and El-Khalil (Hebron). In like manner a road from Aila up the
                    Araba valley crossed the Es-Sufâh pass to Hebron. —One of the most frequented
                    highways traverses the central mountain chain northwards, and, though somewhat
                    difficult in various parts, connects a number of the most important places of
                    central Palestine. Starting from Hebron, it runs past Rama and Hulhιil through
                    the Wâdi el-Biyâr, and leaving Bethlehem on the right holds on to Jerusalem,
                    where a branch strikes east by Khân Hadrar (probably there was once another
                    route) to Jericho. From Jerusalem northwards it naturally continues by Sha'fât
                    past Er-R⅛m (Rama) to El-Bire (Beeroth), and then onwards by 'Ain el-Haramiye,
                    Sinjil, and Khân Lubbân through the Mukhna plain to Nâbulus (Shechem). From this
                    point a route runs down to the Jordan and Es-Salt (Ramoth Gilead?); another
                    passes by Tubâs (Thebez) northeastward in the line of the Jordan valley to
                    Beisan (Bethshean, Scythopolis). The road across the highlands passes a little
                    to the east of Sebastiye (Samaria, Sebaste), running along the west side of the
                    Merj el-Ghuruk and past Tell Dothan (Dothan) to Jennin. Thence the road
                    northward to Nazareth skirts the east side of the plain of Esdraelon, and from
                    Nazareth a path strikes to Acre. The caravan route proper passes from 'Afιile
                    north-eastwards past Jebel et-Tιir (Tabor) to Khan et-Tujjâr (where several
                    roads cross), and reaches the Lake of Tiberias near Mejdel (Magdala). It keeps
                    by the shore only for a short distance. Having traversed the small plain of
                    Gennesar, it begins again to climb the mountains where they approach the lake at
                    Khân Minye (which, however, for many reasons cannot be Capernaum), and then it
                    goes on to Khân Jubb Yusuf, strikes down again into the valley of the Jordan,
                    and crossing the river at Jisr Benât Ya'kxχb holds on across Jebel Hish to
                    Damascus. The mountain district of Samaria is crossed by a great number of small
                    roads, but none of them are true caravan routes or worth particular mention. An
                    old caravan route once ran northwards up the Jordan valley from Jericho to
                    Beisan; and from Beisan an important, now less frequented, road crossing the
                    river at the bridge El-Mejâm'a Strack north-east to Fik Tseil and Nawa in the
                    Hauran, and finally to Damascus.—In the country east of Jordan a great highway
                    of traffic ran from Petra (or really from the Elanitic Gulf) by Kerak (Kir Moab)
                    to Rabba (Rabbath Moab, Areopolis); in front of Aroer ('Ara'ir) it crosses the
                    Mojib (Arnon) and runs northwards through the highlands to Hesban (Heshbon) and
                    thence to 'Amman (Rabbath Ammon, Philadelphia). A route also led from Jericho to
                    Es-Salt (which could also be reached from Hesbân) and thence northwards to the
                    Jabbok and Jerash <hi rend="smallcaps">(Gerasa,</hi> see vol. x. p. 441); and
                    then from Jerash one stretched north-west by Tibne to Mkés (Gadara) and the
                    valley of the Jordan, and another north-east to the Zumle and the Hauran or more
                    precisely to Bosra (Bostra), and so on to Damascus. It must also be mentioned
                    that the great pilgrim’s track direct from Damascus to Medina and Mecca skirts
                    the eastern frontier of the country. A great many roads await more detailed
                    investigation; what has been said may suffice to show what lines of
                    communication existed and still exist between the more important places of
                    Palestine.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> There are no trustworthy estimates of the
                    number of inhabitants in the country at any period of its history. Certain
                    districts, such as Galilee, have, there is no doubt, from early times been much
                    more populous than certain other districts; the desert of Judah and some
                    portions of the country east of Jordan must all along have been very sparsely
                    peopled. The figures given in the book of Numbers indicate that the whole
                    country contained about 2⅜ million souls,—it being assumed that the statistics
                    do not refer to the time of the wandering in the wilderness, and that the
                    details <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n195/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0195-0178"/> may be suspected of being artificially adjusted.
                    The number 2⅛ to 3 millions may indeed be taken as a maximum; the population can
                    hardly ever have been more than four times its present strength, which is
                    estimated at 650,000 souls. Thus, in the most flourishing period, about 250 to
                    300 inhabitants would go to the square mile, while at present there may be about
                    65, a number which is rather above than below the mark. Lists based on
                    information collected by the Turkish Government give much lower figures, viz.,
                    for the sanjak of Jerusalem (with the districts Jerusalem, Yâfa, Hebron), 276
                    places with about 24,000 houses (families); for the sanjak Belka (with the
                    districts of Nàbulus, Jennin, Ajlùn, and Es-Salt), 317 places and 18,984 houses;
                    for the sanjak 'Akka (Acre) (with the districts 'Akka, Haifa, and Sated), 160
                    places with 11,023 houses, —making a total of 753 places with 54,237 houses.
                    Reckoning five persons per house, this gives a population of 271,185, exclusive
                    of the small number of Bedouins. Detailed statistics there are none as regards
                    the relative strength of the Bedouin element and the peasantry, the numerical
                    representation of the different religions, or any matter of this sort.</p>
                <p>The ethnographico-geographical sketch given above has shown how the population of
                    Palestine even at an early date was a very mingled one; for even when they
                    arrived in the country foreign elements were present among the Israelites, and
                    later on they absorbed or were absorbed by the Canaanites. The Philistines,
                    Moabites, and others in course of time were merged in the new nationality. From
                    the period of the exile colonies from the east settled in the country, and so
                    powerful did the Aramaean contingent gradually grow that Aramaean became the
                    popular tongue. Next were added Greek and Roman colonies. The Arabic element
                    exerted considerable influence even before the days of Islam; with the
                    Mohammedan conquest it became the dominant power, though it was only by slow
                    degrees that it obtained numerical superiority. The Arab tribes transplanted to
                    Palestine their old distinctions, especially that between Northern and Southern
                    Arabs (Kais and Yemen; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Arabia).</hi> The Arab peasantry is still divided into clans; for example, the
                    districts of the Beni Hasan and Beni Malik to the west of Jerusalem, those of
                    the Beni Hârith, Beni Zeid, and Beni Murra to the north, and that of Beni Salim
                    to the east. Till recently the relations of the separate clans of fellahin was
                    one of mutual hostility, and, unhindered by the Turkish Government, they engaged
                    in sanguinary conflicts. In manners and in language (though Arabic is
                    universally in vogue) the Palestine peasants retain much that is ancient. It is
                    extravagant, however, to maintain from the traditions they preserve that
                    primeval Canaanite elements still exist among them. The prevalent type, in fact,
                    is Syro-Arabic, or in many districts pure Arabic; and their superstitious
                    customs are partly remains of Syrian beliefs, partly modern Arabic
                    reproductions, under similar external conditions, of ancient superstitions.
                    These remarks are applicable to the saint worship at present spread through the
                    whole Oriental world. The fellahin are on the whole a diligent frugal race, not
                    destitute of intelligence. If well treated by a just Government which would
                    Erotect them from the extortions of the nomadic tribes, they would e the means,
                    with the assistance of the capitalist, of greatly improving the cultivation of
                    the country, especially in the various lowland districts. They choose their own
                    village sheiks, who derive most of their authority from the reputation of their
                    virtues, their bravery, and their liberality. The Bedouins, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> wandering tribes of pure Arab origin, also play an important part in
                    the country. Till quite recently they used to visit certain settled districts
                    and exact black mail from the peasants; and they find their undisputed domain in
                    those districts which are incapable of cultivation, and fit only for cattle
                    rearing, and in other fertile portions which for various reasons are not
                    occupied by the husbandman. To the first class belong the belt of desert to the
                    west of the Dead Sea, the southernmost parts of the country west of Jordan and
                    the south country beyond the river (Moab); to the second belong the greater
                    portion of the maritime plain, the depression of the Jordan valley, and part of
                    the country to the east. The divisions of the Arab tribes will be discussed in
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Syria.</hi> In Palestine east of Jordan the
                    Beni Sakhr (Moab) are of most importance; Jebel 'Ajlιin is the seat of the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Adwan. The Ghawârine (the inhabitants of the Ghor or
                    Jordan depression) form a peculiar race which, as they are partly agricultural,
                    have Been a long time settled in the district. In type, as well as by their
                    degeneracy, they are distinguished from the other Bedouins. The true Bedouin
                    style of life can be studied only beyond the Jordan or to the south of
                    Palestine,—the tribes west of the river, such as the Ta ’ amire and Jehalin in
                    the south being all more or less deteriorated. As the Turkish race does not fall
                    to be treated in connexion with Palestine, it simply remains to mention the
                    Frankish (European) elements. During the Middle Ages these were not unimportant,
                    especially along the coast; numerous ruined churches are still to be seen as the
                    last and only memorials of crusaders’ colonies (see Vogüé, <hi rend="italic">Les
                    églises</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Terre</hi><hi rend="italic">Sainte,</hi>
                    Paris, 1860, and the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Syria).</hi> Nor must the
                    missionary efforts be forgotten which in our own times have been again specially
                    directed to Palestine. As regards the Roman Catholic Church, the Franciscans
                    have maintained their position in the Holy Land even in troublous times, and
                    have not only established schools and printing presses but protected the
                    Christian sanctuaries and taken care of pilgrims and travellers. On the whole it
                    may be said that, in comparison with that of the Roman and Greek Churches, the
                    influence of Protestants is outwardly small. A German sect called the Templars
                    settled in Palestine some years a∞, and has now colonies at Yäfa, Sarona,
                    Jerusalem, and Haifa. The colonists, about 1000 in number, have to contend with
                    many and grievous difficulties, and are deficient in capital. Wine-growing is
                    the most lucrative branch of their activity. As long as the Turks hold rule over
                    the country successful colonization is hardly possible.</p>

                    the survey of that region, has relinquished the undertaking (compare also Selah

                    <hi rend="italic">Palestine and Syria</hi> (written by Socin, 1876), Murray’s
