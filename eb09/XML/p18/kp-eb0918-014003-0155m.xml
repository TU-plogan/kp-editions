                    Renfrewshire, Scotland, is situated on both sides of the White Cart, 3 miles
                    from its junction with the Clyde, and on the Caledonian and the Glasgow and
                    South-Western Railways, 7 miles west-south-west of Glasgow and 17
                    east-south-east of Greenock. In 1791 the river was at great expense made
                    navigable to the town for sloops of about 50 tons burden. The old town, situated
                    on rising ground on the west bank of the river, consists chiefly of long regular
                    streets, and contains the principal warehouses and factories. The new town was
                    begun towards the close of last century, and is built on level ground to the
                    east, at one time forming the domains of the abbey. Surrounding the town there
                    are extensive suburbs, occupied chiefly by villa residences. The river is
                    crossed by a railway viaduct, and three bridges for carriage traffic, two of
                    these being of iron and an old one of stone. The abbey of Paisley was founded in
                    1164, originally as a priory, by Walter, great steward of Scotland. Its lands
                    were erected by James II. into a regality of which the abbot was lord, and the
                    abbey formed the mausoleum of the Stuarts until their accession to the throne.
                    The abbey was burned in 1307 by the English, and in 1561 by Lord Glencairn. In
                    1484 the grounds were surrounded by a lofty wall of hewn stone about one mile in
                    circumference. In 1553 Claude Hamilton, a boy of ten, fourth son of the duke of
                    Chatellerault, was made abbot <hi rend="italic">in commendam,</hi> and in 1587
                    the lands <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n156/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0156-0141"/> and abbey were made a temporal barony in his
                    favour. His son was created earl of Abercorn. The abbey lands, after passing
                    from the earl of Abercorn to the earl of Angus and thence to Lord Dundonald,
                    were purchased in 1764 by the earl of Abercorn, with the view of making the
                    abbey his residence, but changing his intention he let the grounds for building
                    sites. The buildings inhabited by the monks have been totally demolished, but
                    the nave of the abbey church is entire, and has been fitted up as a place of
                    worship. It is one of the finest extant specimens of old ecclesiastical
                    architecture in Scotland, and also contains several fine sculptures and
                    monuments. The unroofed transept and the foundations of the choir enclose a
                    burying ground. The chapel of St Mirin, forming part of the transept, and now
                    used as the place of sepulture of the Abercorn family, contains a monument to
                    Mary Bruce, mother of Robert II., which has been recently reconstructed. The
                    principal secular buildings of the town are the county buildings and prison,
                    erected in 1818 at a cost of &lt;£40,000, and afterwards extended; the John
                    Neilson institution, opened in 1852, a handsome structure occupying a commanding
                    position on the site of the old Roman camp; the George A. Clark town-hall, in
                    the Gothic style, erected in 1882 at a cost of &lt;£50,000, and presented to the
                    town; the news-room, 1808; the grammar school, in the Gothic style, 1864; the
                    Government school of art, 1847; and the theatre. The benevolent institutions
                    include the infirmary, the town hospital or poorhouse, the philosophical
                    institution and humane society, the workhouse, the lunatic asylum, and
                    Hutcheson’s charity school. The Duncan Wright educational endowment provides for
                    natives of the town several school bursaries of the value of from <hi
                    rend="italic">£5 to £10,</hi> and several college bursaries of the value of £25.
                    The town possesses three public recreation grounds :—the Fountain Gardens of 6
                    acres, presented by Mr Thomas Coats in 1868, and containing an elegant structure
                    for a museum and library erected by Sir Peter Coats in 1870; the Brodie Park, 26
                    acres, laid out in 1877, and presented by the late Robert Brodie of
                    Craigie-hall; and St James’s Park, formed out of the racecourse, which has
                    lately been acquired by the corporation. There are statues of Wilson the
                    ornithologist and Tannahill the poet.</p>
                <p>Linen was manufactured at Paisley before the Union, shortly after which coarse
                    linen cloths were succeeded by plain and figured lawns. About the beginning of
                    the 18th century an important manufacturing industry is said to have been
                    originated by Christian Shaw, daughter of the laird of Bargarren. She acquired
                    great skill in the spinning of yarn, and, with the co-operation of a friend in
                    Holland, originated the manufacture of fine linen thread. From 1760 till 1785
                    silk gauze was the principal manufacture. Muslin, cambric, and cotton thread
                    next came into prominence. The shawl manufacture, introduced about the beginning
                    of the present century, the specialty of which was imitation cashmere
                    shawls—“Paisley filled plaids"—is now of minor importance. A wide range of
                    worsted goods, mixed figured fabrics, and light figured muslins at present
                    employ the looms. The spinning of thread and cotton is perhaps the industry for
                    which the town is best known, although it is almost equally celebrated for its
                    patent manufactures, including soap, starch, cornflour, and preparations of
                    coffee. There are also extensive bleachfields, large dye and print works,
                    engineering works, and some shipbuilding. Since the beginning of the present
                    century the population of the burgh (area 3520 acres) has more than trebled. In
                    1781 it was 11,000, which in 1791 had increased to 13,800, in 1801 to 17,026, in
                    1821 to 26,428, in 1831 to 31,460, in 1851 to 48,026, in 1871 to 48,257, and in
                    1881 to 55,642, of whom 25,832 were males and 29,810 females.</p>
                <p>There is no doubt that on the ridge of high ground above the Cart there was a
                    Roman fort and camp, and the supposition that Paisley was the Vanduara of the
                    Romans is supported by the derivation of that name, which means white water. The
                    modern village grew up round the abbey, but the origin of the name Paisley,
                    which was first written <hi rend="italic">Paslet,</hi> has been disputed. About
                    the end of the 15th century its growth had excited the jealousy of the
                    neighbouring burgh of Renfrew, to protect it from the molestations of which
                    Abbot Schaw in 1488 obtained its erection into a free burgh of barony. According
                    to this charter, granted by James IV., it obtained the privilege of returning a
                    member to the Scottish parliament. By the Reform Act of 1833 it was created a
                    parliamentary burgh with one representative. The burgh is governed by a provost,
                    four bailies, a treasurer, and ten councillors. Among the eminent persons
                    connected with Paisley are Patrick Adamson, archbishop of St Andrews; Tannahill
                    the poet; Alexander Wilson the ornithologist; Watt, author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliotheca Britannica</hi>; Motherwell the poet; and Professor John Wilson,
                    “Christopher North.”</p>
