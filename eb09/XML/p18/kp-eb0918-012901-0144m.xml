                    tragic poets who wrote for the Roman stage in the 2d century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> His life was so long that he might be described as a
                    contemporary of all the writers who flourished during the first period of Roman
                    literature. He was born in 219 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when Livius
                    Andronicus and Naevius were introducing their imitations of the Greek tragic and
                    comic drama to Roman audiences; he was recognized as the chief tragic poet about
                    the time when Caecilius, and after him Terence, were the flourishing authors of
                    Latin comedy; he continued to produce his tragedies till the advent of the
                    younger poet Accius, who lived on till the youth of Cicero; and he died in the
                    year (129 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) when Lucilius first appeared as an
                    author. He stood in the relation of nephew as well as pupil to Ennius, by whom
                    Roman tragedy was first raised to a position of influence and dignity. In the
                    interval between the death of Ennius (169) and the advent of Accius, the
                    youngest and most productive of the tragic poets, he alone maintained the
                    continuity of the serious drama, and perpetuated the character first imparted to
                    it by Ennius. Like Ennius he probably belonged to the Oscan stock, and was born
                    at Brundisium, which had become a Roman colony in 244 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> To this origin may be attributed the fact that he never attained to
                    that perfect idiomatic purity of style which was the special glory of the early
                    writers of comedy, Naevius and Plautus.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Aetatis illius ista fuit laus tanquam innocentiae sic Latine

                    aliqua barbaries domestica infuscaverat, recte loquebantur (Cicero, <hi

                    probably have drawn him to Rome, and may have induced him to devote himself to
                    the composition of tragedy. But he obtained distinction also as a painter; and
                    the elder Pliny mentions a work of his which in his time was still to be seen in
                    the temple of Hercules in the <hi rend="italic">forum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >boarium.</hi> His relationship to the friend of the great Scipio would
                    naturally recommend him to the consideration of the eminent men of the next
                    generation, who fostered the new literature in his spirit; and thus Cicero, in
                    the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Amicitia,</hi> represents C.
                    Laelius as speaking of him as “hospitis et amici mei.” He was less productive as
                    a poet than either Ennius or Accius; and we hear of only about twelve of his
                    plays, founded on Greek subjects (among them the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antiope,</hi><hi rend="italic">Teucer, Armorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Judicium,

                    &amp;c., most of them on subjects connected with the Trojan cycle), and one
                    “Praetexta,” <hi rend="italic">Paulus,</hi> written in connexion with the
                    triumph of L. √Emilius Paulus, for his victory at Pydna, celebrated in the year
                    167 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> as the <hi rend="italic">Clastidium</hi> of
                    Naevius and the <hi rend="italic">Ambracia</hi> of Ennius were written in
                    commemoration of great military successes in their time. He continued to write
                    tragedies till the age of eighty, when he exhibited a play in the same year as
                    Accius, who was then thirty years of age. He retired to Tarentum for the last
                    years of his life, and a story is told by Gellius of his being visited there by
                    Accius on his way to Asia, who read to him one of his plays, which was famous in
                    after times, the <hi rend="italic">Atreus.</hi> The story is probably, like that
                    of the visit of the young Terence to the veteran Caecilius, due to the invention
                    of later grammarians; but it is invented in accordance with the traditionary
                    criticism of the distinction between the two poets, the older being
                    characterized rather by cultivated accomplishment, the younger by vigour and
                    animation.</p>

                    revolutionary forces, in the tribunate of Tib. Gracchus, which led ultimately to
                    the overthrow of the republic. His epitaph, said to have been composed by
                    himself, is quoted by Aulus Gellius, with a tribute of admiration to its
                    “modesty, simplicity, and fine serious spirit.”</p>
                <p>“Adulescens, tam etsi properas, te hoc saxum rogat Uti se aspicias, deinde quod
                    scriptum ’st legas. Hic sunt poetae Pacuvi Marci sita</p>

                    type="authorial"><p>“Young man, though thou art in haste, this stone entreats
                    thee to look at it, and then to read what is written. Here are laid the bones of
                    the poet Μ. Pacuvius. This I desired to be not unknown to thee.
                    Farewell.”</p></note></p>
                <p>Cicero, who frequently quotes passages from him, with great admiration, appears
                    to rank him first among the Roman tragic poets, as Ennius among the epic, and
                    Caecilius among the comic poets (Cic., <hi rend="italic">De Opt. Gen. Or.,</hi>
                    1). If a rough parallel might be drawn between the three great original Greek
                    tragic poets and their three Roman imitators, we might perhaps recognize in the
                    imaginative mysticism and soldierly spirit of Ennius an affinity to Aeschylus,
                    in the mellow wisdom of Pacuvius to Sophocles, and in the oratorical talent and
                    power of moving the passions attributed to Accius a nearer approach to the
                    genius of Euripides. The office performed by the Roman tragic poets to Roman
                    culture was not only to familiarize their countrymen with the creations of Greek
                    genius, and the heroes and heroines of Greek legend, but to be the moral
                    teachers and moral philosophers of a time before the introduction of definite
                    ethical speculation. The fragments of Pacuvius quoted by Cicero in illustration
                    or enforcement of his own ethical teaching appeal, by the fortitude, dignity,
                    and magnanimity of the sentiment expressed in them, to what was noblest in the
                    Boman temperament. They are inspired also by that fervid and steadfast glow of
                    spirit which underlay the strong self-control of the Roman character, and which
                    was the most powerful element in Roman oratory. They reveal also a gentleness
                    and humanity of sentiment which it was the highest office of the new drama to
                    blend with the severe gravity of the original Roman character. So far too as the
                    Romans were capable of taking interest in speculative questions, the tragic
                    poets contributed to stimulate curiosity on such subjects, and they anticipated
                    Lucretius in using the conclusions of speculative philosophy as well as of
                    common sense to assail some of the prevailing forms of superstition. Among the
                    passages quoted from Pacuvius are several which indicate a taste both for
                    physical and ethical speculation, and others which expose the pretensions of
                    religious imposture, <hi rend="italic">e.g.—</hi></p>
                <p>“Nam isti qui linguam avium intelligunt, Plusque ex alieno jecore sapiunt quam ex
                    suo, Magis audiendum quam auscultandum censeo.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">‘ ‘ For</hi> they who
                    understand the notes of birds, and derive their wisdom more from examining the
                    livers of other beings than from their own (wit), I think should be rather heard
                    than listened to.”</p></note></p>
                <p>These poets aided also in developing that capacity which the Roman language
                    subsequently displayed of being an organ of oratory, history, and moral
                    disquisition. The literary language of Rome was in process of formation during
                    the 2d century B.C., and it was in the latter part of this century that the
                    series of great Roman orators, with whose spirit Roman tragedy has a strong
                    affinity, begins. But the new creative effort in language was accompanied by
                    considerable crudeness of execution, and the novel word-formations and varieties
                    of inflexion introduced by Pacuvius exposed him to the ridicule of the satirist
                    Lucilius, and, long afterwards, to that of his imitator Persius. But,
                    notwithstanding the attempt to introduce an alien element into the Roman
                    language, which proved incompatible with its natural genius, and his own failure
                    to attain the idiomatic purity of Naevius, Plautus, or Terence, the fragments of
                    his dramas are. sufficient to prove the service λvhich he rendered to the
                    formation of the literary language of Rome, as well as to the culture and
                    character of his contemporaries.</p>
