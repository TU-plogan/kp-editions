                    borne by several sovereigns of Aragon, Castile, and Portugal. Three of them were
                    contemporaries, and, to add to the confusion to which this has given rise, each

                    subj ect to the crown of Aragon. In 1346 jealousy of his brother Jayme led him
                    to alter the succession in favour of his daughters, but two powerful unions or
                    leagues in Aragon and Valencia compelled him in the following year anew to
                    recognize the legitimate heir-presumptive. The victory of Epila, however, in
                    1348 enabled him to triumph over his factious nobles and to cancel the
                    privileges they had extorted from him. In 1351 Pedro, desiring to strengthen his
                    precarious hold upon the island of Sardinia, entered into an alliance with
                    Venice, and began hostilities against Genoa, which, carried on at intervals for
                    many years, were definitively terminated only by his successor. In 1356 a breach
                    of neutrality by some Catalan ships at San Lucar led to a war with the king of
                    Castile, which was carried on with occasional suspensions until 1375, when the
                    infanta Leonora of Aragon was married to Don Juan (afterwards John I.) of
                    Castile. In 1377 Pedro succeeded in reconquering Sicily after the death of
                    Frederick III., but, to avoid the threatened interdict of Urban VI., he ceded
                    the island to Martin, his grandson, retaining the suzerainty only. In 1382 he
                    sent troops to Greece to seize, on his behalf, the duchy of Athens. Pedro died
                    at Barcelona on 5th January 1387, and was succeeded by his son John I. He left a
                    curious history of his reign, written in Catalan, which has been printed by
                    Carbonell in his <hi rend="italic">Chroniques</hi><hi rend="italic">de

                    succeeded his father Sancho Ramirez on the throne of Aragon and Navarre in 1094,
                    and died in 1104. The leading event of his reign was the conquest of Huesca
                    (1096). <hi rend="smallcaps">Pedro</hi> II. (1174-1213) succeeded his father
                    Alphonso II. in 1196. In November 1204 he was crowned in St Peter’s, Rome, by
                    Innocent III., in return for which honour he declared his kingdom feudatory of
                    the Roman see and promised an annual tribute, not, however, without a strong
                    protest on the part of his subjects, whose hostile demonstrations in the
                    following year he had difficulty in repressing. In 1209 he purchased peace with
                    Sancho VII. of Navarre, and in 1212 he, along with that sovereign, gave valuable
                    help to Alphonso of Castile in securing the splendid victory over the Arabs at
                    Navas de Tolosa. In the following year, having taken up arms on behalf of his
                    brother-in-law, Count Raymond of Toulouse, he was slain in the disastrous battle
                    of Muret (12th September 1213). He was succeeded by his only son, Jayme I., “el
                    Conquistador.” <hi rend="smallcaps">Pedro</hi> III. (1236-1285), son of Jayme I.
                    and grandson of Pedro II., succeeded to the crowns of Aragon, Catalonia, and
                    Valencia in 1276. In 1262 he had married Constance, daughter of Manfred, king of
                    the Sicilies, and on the strength-of this alliance he took advantage of the
                    Sicilian Vespers to lay claim to the kingdom of Sicily. This involved him in a
                    ruinous war, in the course of which his dissatisfied subjects united to assert
                    their ancient “fueros” or privileges, exacting from him at Saragossa in 1283 the
                    “Privilegio General ”, which in spirit and import may be compared to the English
                    Great Charter. Charles of Valois, invested by the pope with the crown of Aragon,
                    sought to invade the kingdom, but was repulsed both by land and sea. Charles’s
                    death in 1285, which terminated the war, was followed by that of Pedro in the
                    same year.</p>

                        rend="smallcaps">Pedro</hi> I. (1333-1369), commonly surnamed “the Cruel,”
                    but sometimes referred to as “the Justiciary,” was the only legitimate son of
                    Alphonso XI., and was born at Burgos on 30th August 1333. When raised to the
                    throne at Seville by his father’s premature death before Gibraltar (29th March
                    1350), Pedro was a mere lad, with exceptionally small experience of courts and
                    camps, having lived in comparative retirement along with his mother, Doña Maria
                    of Portugal, in the Andalucian capital, while his illegitimate brothers, the
                    children of Leonora de Guzman, the . eldest of whom were Don Enrique (Henry),
                    count of Trastamara, and Don Fadrique (Frederick), grandmaster of Santiago, had
                    remained beside Alphonso, and had accompanied him on his warlike expeditions. At
                    the beginning of his reign he was thus, almost of necessity, compelled to
                    abandon the conduct of affairs to more experienced hands; by the skilful policy,
                    accordingly, of the powerful and ambitious Juan Alonso de Alburquerque, who had
                    been his father’s chancellor and prime minister, his many enemies and rivals
                    were, for a time at least, successfully kept at bay. The king, however, soon
                    began to assert his independence; whereupon the minister, remembering how
                    helpful a royal mistress had been for the furtherance of his own ends during the
                    preceding reign, did not scruple to encourage Pedro’s passion for the yöung,
                    well-born, and beautiful Maria de Padilla, even after his marriage with Blanche
                    de Bourbon had been arranged. His experiment proved a disastrous one, and not
                    least so to himself. The influence of Maria and of her relations, which rapidly
                    became great, was soon turned against the too politic Alburquerque; and, as a
                    first step towards his dismissal from power, they succeeded in making him seem
                    less indispensable by effecting a superficial reconciliation between the king
                    and his brothers. Then, on the minister’s remonstrating against the conduct of
                    Pedro in deserting Blanche for his mistress almost immediately after his
                    marriage at Valladolid in June 1354, a complete change of administration took
                    place, and Alburquerque retired to his estates. Shortly afterwards he was joined
                    by the king’s brothers Enrique and Fadrique in raising the standard of revolt in
                    Castile; in this formidable movement they were speedily joined by Pedro’s
                    cousins, the infantes of Aragon, as well as by increasing numbers of the ricos
                    hombres and caballeros of the kingdom, and by several of the towns, their
                    grievances being his repudiation of Blanche, his deposition of Alburquerque, and
                    the murder of Juan Nuñez de Prado, the master of Calatrava, for which he was
                    believed to be responsible. The cortes of Toro accordingly asked him to take
                    back his queen and dismiss the Padillas; and so general was the national feeling
                    in this matter that even his own mother deserted his cause, and on his giving
                    evasive replies he found himself before the end of the year practically stripped
                    of all his real authority, surrounded by officials of his enemies’ choosing, and
                    virtually a prisoner in their hands. He succeeded, however, in making his escape
                    from Toro to Segovia with a handful of followers in the following year, and the
                    divergence of interest that soon arose to separate the Aragonese princes from
                    the bastard sons of Alphonso XI. so wrought in his favour that he was soon able
                    (1356) to recover all the authority he had ever had, and to secure at least a
                    transitory peace by the policy of reckless assassination which years previously
                    he had inaugurated while Alburquerque was still his minister, and which he
                    brought to a climax in the cold-blooded murder of his brother Don Fadrique at
                    Seville in 1358, the tragedy to which he is said to have been specially indebted
                    for his unenviable surname. In 1356 he already found himself strong enough to
                    enter upon a war with his namesake Pedro IV. of Aragon, and, with inconsiderable
                    intervals of truce brought about through the intervention of the papal legate,
                    he continued to carry it on for several years. In 1365 he was still campaigning
                    beyond the borders of his kingdom when Castile was invaded by the “free
                    companies” of French and English troops under Du Guesclin and <pb break="no"

                    cause had now been espoused by France. He returned only to find himself
                    practically unthroned, and towards the close of 1366 he sailed from Coruña for
                    Guienne almost unaccompanied, save by his three daughters, but taking with him a
                    considerable quantity of money and jewels. He was befriended in his exile by the
                    Black Prince, and by liberal promises obtained his alliance and assurances of
                    material help; the English troops accordingly crossed the Pyrenees in the
                    following spring, and, by the bloody victory of Najera or Navarrete near Logroño
                    (13th April 1367), once more restored him to his kingdom. Pedro, however, was
                    unwilling or unable to implement the bargain he had made, and by his arrogant
                    demeanour soon alienated his chivalrous ally; before the close of the year Don
                    Enrique had again begun to collect his forces, while the Black Prince, injured
                    and indignant, turned his face homewards. A final battle between Pedro and his
                    brother took place at Montiel (13th March 1369), with the result that the former
                    was driven for shelter into the fortress. Ten days afterwards he was induced to
                    visit the camp of Enrique by illusory hopes of a favourable treaty through Du
                    Guesclin; the brothers, who had not seen each other for fifteen years, met for
                    the last time; angry words passed between them, soon they came to blows, and in
                    the desperate struggle that ensued Don Pedro met his death. Pedro was in no way
                    remarkable either as a soldier or as a ruler of men, and his character, so
                    odious in the one feature expressed by his only too well deserved surname,
                    presents singularly few redeeming traits; it is not even picturesque. The best
                    that can be alleged by way of apology for him and excuse for his barren reign is
                    the untowardness of the circumstances of his birth, education, and accession. To
                    a narrow and uncultivated mind like his “the tyrant’s plea” could hardly ever
                    have appealed with greater plausibility. It is significant, however, that in
                    Spain itself there are two nearly opposite points of view from which Pedro
                    appears not as “el Cruel” but as “el Justiciero.” On the one hand, the common
                    people of Andalucia among whom he lived, the Jews whose com· merce he
                    encouraged, the Moors whom his very want of religion enabled him to tolerate,
                    have helped to keep alive the tradition of the substantial if occasionally
                    capricious and whimsical justice he often delighted personally to administer.
                    The other point of view is that of such monarchs as Isabella “la Catolica” and
                    Philip II., who could not but be grateful to him for all he had done to weaken
                    the power of the nobles of Castile.</p>
