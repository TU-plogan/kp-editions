                    springs of Zacynthus (Zante), and the fountains of Hit have been celebrated by
                    the Arabs and Persians. Pliny and Dioscorides describe the oil of Agrigentum,
                    which was used in lamps under the name of “Sicilian oil,” and mention is made of
                    petroleum springs in China in the earliest records of that ancient people. The
                    abundance of petroleum and the firetemple at Baku on the Caspian have been
                    frequently described by travellers who have gone overland from Europe to India,
                    from the time of Marco Polo to recent years. Petroleum in North America was
                    first mentioned by a Franciscan missionary, Joseph de la Roche d’Allion, in a
                    letter written in 1629 and published in Sagard’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">du Canada</hi> in 1636. Peter Kalm described the
                    springs on Oil Creek in his book of travels in North America, published in
                    London in 1772. In 1750 the French commander at Fort Duquesne described them in
                    a letter to General Montcalm, and later, towards the close of the last century,
                    frequent mention is made of oil-springs in correspondence relating to what is
                    now western Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Kentucky. In 1765 and 1826
                    the British Government sent embassies to the court of Ava, in the reports of
                    which mention .'- made of the petroleum springs and wells near Rangoon on the
                    Irawadi. During the early years of the present century the occurrence of
                    bitumen, and particularly of its liquid forms, was noticed by scientific men and
                    travellers in various localities. In Europe, Boussingault’s researches upon the
                    petroleum of Bechelbronn (Lower Alsace) and the discovery of paraffin by
                    Reichenbach attracted much attention. Petroleum was observed and described as
                    early as 1814 in Washington county, Ohio, in wells at that time being bored for
                    brine. In 1819 a well bored for brine in Wayne county, Kentucky, yielded so much
                    black petroleum that it was abandoned. It has continued to yield small
                    quantities until the present time. In 1829 a well drilled for brine near
                    Burkesville, Cumberland county, Kentucky, yielded such a flow of petroleum that
                    it was regarded as a wonderful natural phenomenon. This well is estimated to
                    have yielded, up to 1860, 50,000 barrels of oil, the larger part of which was
                    wasted. Of the rest a few barrels were bottled and sold as a liniment in the
                    United States and Europe under the name of “American oil.”</p>
                <p>About the year 1847 E. W. Binney of Manchester, England, called attention to the
                    petroleum discovered at Biddings, near Alfreton in Derbyshire, and a few years
                    later he, together with James Young and others, commenced the manufacture of
                    illuminating and other oils from it. The supply of crude material from this
                    source soon became inadequate, and they then commenced distilling the Boghead
                    mineral that had been found near Bathgate in Scotland. The success attending
                    this enterprise soon attracted attention in the United States of America, and a
                    number of establishments were in operation in the course of a few years, some of
                    them being licensed under Young’s patents. In 1851, when petroleum on Oil Creek
                    was worth 7 5 cents a gallon in the crude state, it was tested as a crude
                    material for the manufacture of illuminating oil by Messrs William and Luther
                    Attwood, and Joshua Merrill, at the United States Chemical Manufacturing
                    Company’s works at Waltham, near Boston, Massachusetts, and its merits for that
                    purpose fully established. But its scarcity at that time prevented its use in
                    commercial quantities, and the establishments at Boston and Portland, Maine,
                    under the charge of Messrs Merrill and William Attwood, continued to use Boghead
                    mineral and albertite for a number of years after petroleum was produced in
                    sufficient quantity. Petroleum was refined and offered for sale in Pittsburgh,
                    Pennsylvania, as early as 1855, but the quantity was too small to influence even
                    the local trade; it, however, created a small demand for the crude oil. The
                    well-known fact that brine-wells often produced petroleum led those who sold the
                    “American oil” to embellish the label on the bottles with a derrick and other
                    accompaniments of a brine-well; and the story is told that the projector of the
                    first well drilled exclusively for petroleum was led to undertake it through
                    reflecting upon this picture. Some oil from one of the natural springs near
                    Titusville, Pennsylvania, was sent to Professor B. Silliman, junior, of Yale
                    College, and he made a report upon it which has become a classic in the
                    literature of petroleum. This report was so satisfactory that a company was
                    organized in New Haven, and E. L. Drake was sent to drill a well upon land that
                    was leased in the valley of Oil Creek, a short distance below the spot where the
                    city of Titusville now stands. The region was then almost a wilderness, and many
                    delays were experienced before he succeeded in getting his men and machinery in
                    operation. He was at first thwarted by quicksands and water, but he finally
                    drove an iron pipe 36 feet down to the rock. This device, said to have been
                    original with Drake, has been of great value in artesian boring ever since he
                    used it. After drilling 33 feet on the 28th of August 1859, the drill fell
                    suddenly 6 inches into a crevice, and was left until the next day, when the
                    drill-hole was found to be nearly filled with petroleum. No spot in the entire
                    territory where petroleum has since been obtained could have been selected where
                    the oil was to be obtained nearer the surface. The success of this enterprise
                    led to the immediate drilling of other wells, first in the valley of Oil Creek
                    and its tributaries, and later over the higher land between Oil Creek and the
                    Alleghany river below Tidioute. As this territory began to be exhausted, the
                    region of the lower Alleghany, in Butler and Clarion counties, yielded wells of
                    great richness, and finally the Bradford field in M <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi> Kean county became the centre of production. A careful comparison of the
                    situations of some of the most productive wells led to the discovery that the
                    areas yielding oil were not irregular in outline, but extended across the
                    country in narrow belts, without regard to the present configuration of the
                    surface. The areas of these belts were in general parallel, and extended in a
                    north-east and south-west direction, 15° to 20° from the meridian. As the
                    exhaustion of the oil-fields of Butler and Clarion counties led producers to
                    seek a more productive locality, lines were run by compass on the supposed axis
                    of the oil-belt over forest-covered hills for many miles, until they reached the
                    town of Bradford, near which wells had previously been drilled without success.
                    Deeper wells were drilled, and oil was obtained, resulting in the development
                    since 1875 of about 68,000 acres of the most uniformly productive and extensive
                    oil-territory yet discovered.</p>
                <p>In the province of Ontario, Canada, principally in the vicinity of Enniskillen, a
                    territory of limited extent but great productiveness has been under development
                    for the last twenty years. In the region about Baku and in the valley of the
                    Kuban, at the eastern and western extremities of the Caucasus, petroleum has
                    been obtained for an unknown period, and is now being produced from artesian
                    borings in large quantities. In Galicia and Roumania it is also obtained in
                    commercial quantities. These regions with the United States furnish the
                    petroleum of commerce. Japan, China, Burmah, and Italy have yielded petroleum in
                    quantities sufficient to supply a local demand, but the vast quantity of the
                    American oil and low price at which it is furnished have rendered the production
                    in these countries unprofitable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geographical Distribution.—</hi> Petroleum “was found about one

                    other coalfields; also in a peat-bog at Down Holland, near Ormskirk, in
                    Lancashire, but never in commercial quantities. The greatest supply has not been
                    more than fifty gallons a day, and even that soon diminished.” A tar-spring was
                    known at Coalport, in Shropshire, early in the present century. Although there
                    are extensive deposits of solid bitumen in eastern France and Switzerland, the
                    petroleum springs that occur at Saint Boès, Basses Pyrénées, are unimportant. In
                    Alsace, at Lobsann and Bechelbronn, petroleum has been obtained for many years
                    for local uses. Although reported from many localities in Germany, the only
                    point that has promised to be of any importance is the Lüneburg heath, south of
                    Hamburg. Petroleum is also reported near Hölle, in Dithmarschen,
                    Schlesλvig-Holstein. On the eastern shores of the Adriatic—in Dalmatia and
                    Albania—and in the Ionian Islands, petroleum springs have been mentioned by the
                    writers of classical antiquity. In Armenia and Persia petroleum has been used
                    for unknown centuries, and it appears to be widely distributed in the mountains
                    that surround the tableland of Iran. In Algeria, Egypt, Kashmir, the Punjab,
                    Assam, Java, and other East Indian islands petroleum is reported. In North
                    America the successful development of the petroleum-fields of north-west
                    Pennsylvania following the completion of Drake’s well led in a few years to the
                    drilling of wells in a great many localities λvhere petroleum-springs had been
                    observed. The following so-called “petroleum-fields” have produced oil in
                    commercial quantities more or less valuable.</p>

                <p>Besides these localities petroleum has been observed over an area 1500 miles long
                    by an unknown breadth in the valley of the Mackenzie and its tributaries, and in
                    New Brunswick, Newfoundland, and other portions of eastern Canada. It also
                    occurs at many different points along the Appalachian system of mountains from
                    Point Gaspé on the St Lawrence to northern Alabama. It has been noticed in
                    Kansas, Missouri, Wyoming, Colorado, and Texas in the United States, in southern
                    Mexico, in the West India Islands, and in the northern states of South America.
                    Petroleum is one of the most widely distributed substances occurring in nature,
                    but an examination of the geographical localities in which it chiefly occurs
                    will show them to be intimately connected with the principal mountain-chains of
                    the world.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geological Relations.—</hi> It has been frequently remarked
                    that petroleum occurs in all geological formations, from the Silurian up to the
                    Tertiary. While this is true as a general statement, it is misleading, for
                    petroleum is not uniformly distributed through all formations, but occurs
                    principally in two epochs of geological history; these are the Silurian and the
                    lower half of the Tertiary. The vast accumulations along the principal axis of
                    occurrence in the western hemisphere are found in Silurian and Devonian rocks;
                    the most productive axis of occurrence in the eastern hemisphere lies in the
                    Eocene and Miocene of the Carpathians, Trausy1vania, and the Caucasus. In
                    England the small quantity of petroleum that has been observed has sprung from
                    the Coal-measures. In the valley of the Rhone and in Savoy it is in Jurassic
                    limestones. The bitumen of the Apennines, of Dalmatia and Albania, of Roumania,
                    Galicia, and the Caucasus, issues for the most part from rocks that are Eocene.
                    But little is known respecting the geology of the bitumen of Asia Minor and
                    Persia; the Punjab is also Eocene, and the little that is known of the deposits
                    in Burmah and the East Indian Islands indicates that they are of the same age.
                    East of the Mississippi river petroleum has been reported from localities that
                    describe an ellipse upon the border of the Cincinnati anticlinal, which consists
                    of an elevation of Silurian rocks extending from central Kentucky to Lake Erie,
                    with the city of Cincinnati nearly in its centre, sloping beneath the newer
                    formations in all directions. Starting at Great Manitoulin Island, in the
                    northern part of Lake Huron, it is next reported at Port Huron, Michigan;
                    Chicago, Illinois; Terre Haute, and in Crawford county, Indiana; Henderson,
                    Cloverport, Bowling Green, and Glasgow, Kentucky; and around Nashville, and
                    south-eastwards to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where the Silurian rocks again reach
                    the surface. Turning north, the line extends almost unbroken through the eastern
                    counties of Kentucky into Ohio and West Virginia, into Pennsylvania and New
                    York, the ellipse being completed by the petroleum-fields of Canada. At Great
                    Manitoulin Island petroleum was obtained in the Trenton limestone, at Chicago
                    and Terre Haute in the Niagara limestone, both of which are Silurian. The
                    Kentucky geologists regard the great Devonian black slate as the source of the
                    oil in that State. There it is found saturating sandstones at Glasgow, and in
                    crevices at Burkesville and other points on the Cumberland river. In the
                    neighbourhood of Nashville, where the Lower Silurian rocks reach the surface,
                    petroleum occurs within geodes, which are enclosed in the solid mass of the blue
                    limestone. North-east of Nashville the present location of the oil is found to
                    be in rocks that lie in an ascending series. Around Burkesville it is found in
                    the Upper Silurian, immediately beneath the Devonian black slate. Farther north
                    it lies in the Devonian and Subcarboniferous sandstones, which, in Johnson
                    county, Kentucky, are now partly above the drainage-level of the country. The
                    so-called “oil-break” of West Virginia and Ohio yields petroleum from sandstones
                    that lie within the Coal-measures. Still farther to the north-east, in
                    Pennsylvania and New York, the oil-sands are all found beneath the Coal-measures
                    in the Upper Devonian, while in Canada they again descend to the Lower Devonian.
                    “Petroleum exists in the Cretaceous rocks which extend along the eastern slope
                    of the Rocky Mountains from British Columbia to Mexico, and in many of the
                    interior valleys.” The bitumen of the Pacific slope, of Mexico, the West Indies,
                    and South America, is Miocene in California and Eocene in Trinidad and Peru.
                    From these statements it will be seen that there is a vast area in the
                    Mississippi valley, estimated at 200,000 square miles, beneath which petroleum
                    has been obtained, the formations of λvhich are nowhere more recent than the
                    Coal-measures. Another vast area, extending from California through Mexico to
                    Peru, and including the West India Islands, yields petroleum from Tertiary
                    rocks; while on the eastern continent a belt of country extends from the North
                    Sea to Java, the bitumen-bearing rocks of which are Tertiary so far as is known.

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0746-0715"/> the bulk of petroleum produced issues from rocks
                    older than the Carboniferous, while the formations yielding bitumen, in by far
                    the greater number of localities, are of Eocene age. In the great “oil-region”
                    of the United States petroleum occurs in crevices to a very limited extent. In
                    Canada and West Virginia it occurs beneath the crowns of anticlinals, and in
                    Pennsylvania it saturates the porous portions of formations that lie far beneath
                    the influence of superficial erosion, like sand-bars in a flowing stream or
                    detritus on a beach. These strata are not of any particular geological age, but
                    run through a vast accumulation of sediments embraced in all the formations
                    between the Lower Devonian and Upper Carboniferous. They lie conformably with
                    the enclosing rocks, and slope gently to the south-west. The Bradford field in
                    particular resembles a sheet of coarse-grained sandstone 100 square miles in
                    extent, by from 20 to 80 feet in thickness, lying with its south-western edge
                    lowest and submerged in salt water, and its north-eastern edge highest and
                    filled with gas under an extremely high pressure. In Galicia the sandstones
                    holding the oil are very much disturbed, while in the Caucasus the deposits of
                    sand are erratic both in regard to position and extent, and lenticular in
                    outline, being enclosed in a formation consisting of stiff blue clay.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chemistry.-—</hi> The first chemical research upon petroleum
                    was conducted by Vauquelin in 1817 upon the naphtha of Amiano. Prior to the
                    discovery of petroleum in commercial quantities, a number of European chemists
                    had made determination of the atomic constitution of several different
                    varieties, and it had become generally understood that the oil consisted of an
                    equal number of atoms of carbon and hydrogen. It has since been determined that
                    some varieties of petroleum contain nitrogen and others contain sulphur and
                    oxygen. These last-named elements are, however, to be properly considered as
                    components of impurities. The proximate principles of petroleum have been
                    determined and examined chiefly by Schorlemmer in England, Pelouze and Cahours
                    in France, and C. Μ. Warren and S. P. Sadtler in the United States. Many other
                    chemists have contributed valuable assistance to the work. These researches have
                    established the fact that Pennsylvania petroleum consists chiefly of two
                    homologous series of isomeric compounds having the general formula C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> π</hi> H2n+2, at one extremity of which marsh gas is found and
                    solid paraffin at the other (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Paraffin).</hi> This oil
                    also contains a smaller proportion of the olefine series, having the formula C
                    <hi rend="subscript"> m</hi> Ho <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> ι, with traces in
                    the Bradford oil of the benzole series. Rangoon petroleum contains a larger
                    proportion of both the olefine and the benzole series than Pennsylvania oil. It
                    has been shown that Caucasian petroleum contains the additive compounds of the
                    benzole group which have the same percentage composition as the olefines and
                    furnish an illuminating oil containing more carbon than Pennsylvania oils of the
                    same specific gravity. The residues from the manufacture of petroleum have been
                    shown to contain very dense solids and liquids of high specific gravity, having
                    a large proportion of carbon and possessed of remarkable fluorescent properties.
                    Some petroleums are easily oxidized into asphaltum and kindred products.
                    Colourless illuminating oils under the action of light absorb oxygen, which is
                    converted into ozone, and they become yellow and viscid and of greatly impaired
                    quality when the action is prolonged.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Origin.—</hi> The origin of petroleum has been a subject of
                    speculation among scientific men during the last half century. It is a subject
                    involved in much greater obscurity than the origin of coal, for, unlike coal, it
                    has no organic structure; hence it can only be inferred upon circumstantial
                    evidence that it is of organic origin; yet such evidence is so strong that few
                    competent judges have ventured to decide otherwise. The arguments in favour of a
                    chemical origin have been advanced almost wholly by a school of French chemists
                    during the last twenty years. They are based upon the results of a class of
                    experiments first inaugurated by Berthelot, in which powerful deoxidizing agents
                    like the alkali metals or iron at a white heat are caused to react with steam
                    and carbonic acid. The hydrogen of the water and the carbon of the carbonic
                    acid, having been deprived of their oxygen, unite in the nascent state to form a
                    mixture of oily fluids closely resembling petroleum. Sufficient quantities of
                    these oils have been prepared to prove their identity with each other and with
                    crude petroleum. Before concluding from this circumstance that petroleum is the
                    product of similar reactions, it is necessary to assume a condition of the
                    earth’s interior concerning which we know nothing; and, while the theoretical
                    chemistry of the earth, based upon the nebular hypothesis, does not forbid such
                    possibilities, there are other considerations relating to the origin of
                    petroleum based upon the known rather than the possible that render the
                    assumption that petroleum is of mineral origin forced and unnecessary. It is
                    found that, when shale, coal, peat, wood, or animal matter, in fact any recent
                    or fossil organic matter, is subjected to destructive distillation at low
                    temperatures, there is obtained among other products an oily fluid which
                    chemistry shows to consist chiefly of the same compounds of carbon and hydrogen
                    as are found in Pennsylvania petroleum. There are other petroleums, however,
                    occurring in Canada, Tennessee, and other localities somewhat different in
                    composition, which are often found under conditions that make it extremely
                    difficult to account for their origin upon any hypothesis that does not regard
                    them as a product of the decomposition of animal remains. They fill the cavities
                    of fossil corals and orthoceratites in Canada and of geodes in Tennessee, in all
                    of which the oil appears to be hermetically sealed until the rock-mass is
                    broken. The formation in which these oils occur consists of thickly-bedded
                    Silurian limestones that were probably deposited in a deep sea at a somewhat
                    high temperature, in which vast quantities of sea-animals perished and became
                    buried. It is therefore most strictly in accordance with observed facts to
                    assume that these oils, in whatever manner they may have been produced from the
                    original animal remains, are indigenous to the rocks in which they are found.
                    These indigenous oils do not occur locally in considerable quantity, although
                    the aggregate amount scattered through any formation in which they occur can
                    easily be shown to be large.</p>
                <p>In those localities, notably north-western Pennsylvania and eastern Ohio, where
                    petroleum occurs in large quantity, it occurs quite uniformly, saturating heavy
                    beds of uncemented sandstone. This sandstone is overlaid with an impervious
                    shell of slate, containing much silica, that holds down both the oil and gas
                    within the sandstone under great pressure, not locally in cavities but over
                    w-ide areas. The sandstone is also, so far as can be ascertained, underlaid with
                    a vast formation of shale more than 1000 feet in thickness, containing large
                    numbers of fossil animals and such a quantity of fossil sea-weeds that Dr J. S.
                    Newberry has suggested that the Silurian ocean here contained a veritable
                    sargasso sea. This shale, so filled with the remains of fucoids, has been
                    several times submitted to destructive distillation, and has yielded as high as
                    50 gallons to the ton of distillate oil that was in many respects scarcely to be
                    distinguished from crude petroleum. During the present century the French
                    chemical geologists have held that all forms of bitumen are the product of
                    metamorphism. Prominent among these may be mentioned Daubrée, who in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Observations</hi><hi rend="italic">sur le Métamorphisme</hi> has
                    shown the strict correspondence between his laboratory experiments, in which all
                    forms of bitumen were produced, and the opera <pb break="no"

                    lacking to show that those operations of nature in which heat, pressure, and
                    steam have joined, usually denominated by physicists “metamorphism,” when acting
                    upon strata containing organic remains, are an adequate origin for petroleum as
                    it occurs in the oil-regions of Pennsylvania and in Galicia. Petroleum occurs on
                    the western slope of the Appalachian system from Point Gaspé on the Gulf of St
                    Lawrence to northern Alabama, and there it is most abundant in the neighbourhood
                    of strata in which there is the greatest accumulation of organic remains. The
                    accumulations of sediment from which this mountain-system was constructed were
                    deposited in a current whose course was parallel with the axis of the system,
                    and, as has been so fully shown by Professor James Hall <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Paleontology of</hi><hi rend="italic">New</hi><hi rend="italic">York,</hi>
                    vol. iii., Introduction), these sediments were deposited in great thickness and
                    of very coarse materials in the north-east, gradually thinning and increasing in
                    fineness as they reached the Mississippi valley in the southwest. From the
                    latest conclusions of American geologists it may be inferred that originally the
                    eastern border of these deposits lay over a region now covered by the Atlantic
                    Ocean. When the elevation took place that brought the metamorphic rocks of New
                    England, New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia to the surface, the eastern border
                    remained submerged, while the western border was brought above the sea-level.
                    The facts that concern petroleum are found in the comparatively undisturbed and
                    nearly level position of this western border, in which the rocks holding the
                    petroleum lie at present, like sand-bars in a current, and the further evidence
                    that they afford that the metamorphic action which has altered nearly all the
                    formations of the eastern border became extinct along a plane that descended
                    deeper and deeper from the surface as the western slope of the system is
                    traversed. This evidence further shows that along the western borders of the
                    system, although the rocks and the coal that they enclose are unaltered near the
                    surface, at the same time vast areas of the fucoidal shale and even limestones
                    containing indigenous petroleum may have been invaded by the heat-action and
                    their volatile contents distilled at great depths. This distillate, being forced
                    up by heat and hydrostatic pressure, would naturally accumulate in any overlying
                    bed of rock porous enough to receive it. In Galicia, Roumania, and Transylvania
                    the metamorphic core of the Carpathians is flanked by beds of fucoidal shale
                    rich in the remains of marine animals, which are intercalated with the beds of
                    sandstone that contain the oil. This hypothesis, which regards petroleum as a
                    distillate, includes the facts as thus far observed, is in harmony with
                    scientific possibilities, and is reasonable, as it does not require any
                    extraordinary assumption of either chemical or geological conditions. While the
                    maintenance of any particular theory concerning the origin of petroleum is
                    primarily of very little practical value, it is indirectly of value to conclude
                    whether by some deep-seated chemical action the oil is at present being prepared
                    in the laboratories of nature, or whether its generation has been long since
                    completed. If a correct interpretation of the phenomena observed in relation to
                    petroleum leads to the hypothesis that the fluid is in most instances a
                    distillate, and especially in those localities where it is most abundant, then
                    the conclusion is inevitable that the generation of petroleum is practically
                    completed, and the deposits are vast natural storehouses which when once emptied
                    are as completely removed from future production as a worked-out bed of
                    coal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Methods of Production.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> While
                    petroleum has been produced for an immemorial period in Persia, China, Japan,
                    Burmah, Baku, and Galicia, and while the primitive methods employed in each
                    country in its production furnish interesting subjects for study, it is scarcely
                    possible in this article to do more than indicate in a general manner how the
                    vast quantities produced at the present time in the United States and Canada are
                    brought to the surface, stored, and transported. In both Galicia and the
                    Caucasus, which, with Canada and the United States, now furnish the petroleum of
                    commerce, the ancient methods of production are being rapidly superseded by
                    those employed in America. In the United States the development of oil-territory
                    has acquired a habit that has become well defined, and has been repeatedly
                    exemplified during the last twenty years. The first step is the sinking of a
                    test or “wild-cat” well outside the limits of any proved productive territory,
                    the progress of such well being eagerly watched not only by those who pay for it
                    but also by many others who hope to profit by the experiment. The striking of
                    oil in such a well is the signal for a grand rush, and a speculative floating
                    population invades the place. After a time the speculative phase is succeeded by
                    that of settled development. The oil-territory has become outlined. The
                    sagacious ones have secured control of the most profitable tracts, while the
                    floating element has moved on to a new field. Between the period of active
                    development and absolute exhaustion comes that of decay, when the derricks are
                    rotting and falling to wreck, and when property that has ceased to be productive
                    has been sold at an extravagant price, and after accumulating debts has been
                    abandoned. Finally the wave passes over and nature restores as she restores
                    after the ruin of battlefields. A visit to Pithole city, which in 1865 was, next
                    to Philadelphia, the largest post-office in Pennsylvania, showed in 1881 fields
                    of maize and timothy where some of the most famous wells had been, and of the
                    city a score of houses tumbling to decay and not an inhabitant. It is not to be
                    inferred, however, that any of the sections into which the oil-regions have been
                    divided entirely cease to produce oil. There are wells now producing within
                    sight of the spot where Drake drilled the first well; but large tracts cease to
                    be centres of speculative investment, the old wells cease to be remunerative,
                    and the new wells no longer hold out the possibilities of a grand lottery.</p>
                <p>Wells are sometimes drilled by the owners of the land, but the larger part are
                    drilled under leases. These leases are drawn with a great variety of conditions,
                    but they usually stipulate that the lessor shall pay to the lessee a certain
                    portion of the oil produced, the amount varying from one-tenth to one-fourth in
                    proportion to the supposed richness of the territory. One well to five acres is
                    considered as many as a judicious arrangement will allow, but many wells have
                    been drilled much closer, and in some instances several wells have been drilled
                    on one acre. The oil-sand of different localities varies as it occupies
                    different geological horizons. The Venango oil-sand extends from Tidioute in
                    Warren county to Herman Station in Butler county, Pennsylvania, a distance of 62
                    miles. It is uniformly a conglomerate of smooth white quartz pebbles, from a
                    quarter to three-quarters of an inch in thickness. In other districts of the
                    United States, Canada, and Galicia the oil-sand is a true sandstone of varying
                    colour and texture. In the Caucasus the sand is fine, and resembles a quicksand,
                    as it rises with the oil and accumulates around the wells.</p>
                <p>When the location of a well has been determined, a derrick or “rig” is built,
                    which consists of the derrick itself and a small house for an engine, with the
                    necessary foundation for both. This foundation is made of heavy timbers
                    dovetailed and keyed together. The derrick consists of a framework firmly braced
                    in the form of a truncated pyramid, and about 70 feet high. At its base are two
                    large reels, upon one of which the drilling cable is coiled and upon the other
                    the sand-pump rope. At one side of the derrick a heavy post, called the Samson
                    post, is framed into the main sill, upon the top of which rests the
                    walking-beam, one end of it being connected with the engine of from 12 to 15
                    horse-power, whilst the other supports the drill. When the engine is in motion
                    the walkingbeam alternately raises and drops the drill. The boiler is made like
                    the tubular boilers usually employed on locomotives, and is placed at a distance
                    from the well to prevent the ignition of the gas that often accompanies the oil.
                    The engine should be reversible, and so <pb break="no"

                    control its motion by the use of cords and pulleys. A string of drilling tools
                    is represented in fig. 1. First we have the id temper - screw <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> which is attached directly to the end of ® the walking-</p>
                <p>beam, into the jaws of which the cable is ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> ÿ</hi> clamped

                    rend="subscript"> α</hi> The free end of the cable is fastened to the
                    rope-socket 5 <hi rend="italic">cl,</hi> which is screwed into the sinker-bar
                    <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> that is, a solid ∣ bar of iron about 20 feet in length
                    which serves to give firmness to the tools. The sinker-bar is screwed into the
                    g∣ upper link of the jars. The jars, ∕, consist of two links of J≡⅛f) steel, the
                    slots of which are 21 inches long, with cross-heads 8 inches deep, in
                    consequence of which the links have 13 inches of play. The lower link of the
                    jars is screwed into another long iron bar called the auger-stem, <hi
                    rend="italic">g,</hi> which is in turn screwed to the bit or drill <hi
                    rend="italic">h.</hi> The jars are the centre of action, and the manner in which
                    they perform their work may be best explained, perhaps, in this way. Suppose the
                    tools to have been just run to the bottom of the well, the jars closed, and the
                    cable slacked, the men now reel up the slack until the sinker-bar rises, the
                    “play” of the jars allowing it to come up 13 inches without lifting the
                    auger-stem; when the links come together they slack back about 4 inches and
                    clamp the cable into the temper-screw. If now the vertical movement of the
                    walking-beam is 24 inches, the sinker-bar rises 4 inches, when the cross-heads
                    of the links come together with a smart blow; then the augerstem is picked up
                    and lifted 20 inches. On the downstroke the auger-stem falls 20 inches, while
                    the links slide 4 inches carrying the sinker-bar down 24 inches.</p>
                <p>The links are never allowed to strike on the down-stroke, while the blow of the
                    upstroke prevents the drill from becoming wedged into any seam or crevice into
                    which its weight might drive it. When the tools are all ready for operation,
                    either a wooden conductor is placed perpendicularly in a sort of shaft sunk to
                    the bed-rock, or an iron tube called a “drive-pipe” is driven upon it through
                    the soil. In either case great care is taken to start the well perpendicularly
                    to the derrick - floor·. The tools are swung into position from the top of the
                    derrick, and the free end of the cable is coiled around the shaft of the reel in
                    such a manner that when the free end is tightened the tools are lifted, and when
                    it is loose the reelshaft revolves within the coils. By holding the cable firmly
                    the tools rise, and as it is loosened they fall. The well is started in this
                    manner and carried down until the string of tools can be suspended beneath the
                    walking-beam, when a cable as long as the supposed depth of the completed well
                    is wound upon the reel, the end carried over a pulley at the top of the derrick
                    and then fastened into the rope-socket, the temperscrew attached, and the
                    drilling continued to the bottom of the well. Day and night the machinery is
                    kept in motion, one driller and one engineer and tool-dresser work from noon
                    until midnight, and another pair work from midnight until noon. The driller,
                    with a short lever inserted in the temper-screw, walks round and round to rotate
                    the drill. He watches the jars, and at intervals lets down the temper - screw.
                    When the screw is run out or the drill needs sharpening, he arranges the slack
                    cable so that it will run freely oyer the pulley and proceeds to “draw out.” The
                    cable is unclamped from the temper-screw and the engine disconnected from the
                    walking-beam and attached to the cable-reel. When all is ready the long cable is
                    reeled up and the tools drawn out. The bit is replaced by one newly sharpened,
                    and after the well has been sand-pumped the tools are again lowered and drilling
                    resumed. When the drilling proceeds without accident the work is exceedingly
                    monotonous.</p>
                <p>From the top of the bedrock to a point below the surface-water of the region, the
                    well is drilled of the same diameter as the interior of the drive-pipe. This
                    point is usually from 300 to 400 feet below the surface. At this point the
                    drill-hole is tapered, and a pipe armed with a steel shoe is ground into the
                    tapered hole to a water-tight joint. The inside diameter of this casing-pipe is
                    5 j inches, and below it the well is carried down 5⅜ inches in diameter to the
                    bottom. The casing pipe excludes the fresh surface-water, and only water enough
                    is put into the well to wash out the drillings, unless salt water is
                    encountered. The casing-pipe becomes a permanent fixture, into which is
                    introduced the 2-inch pipe, through which the oil flows or is pumped. This
                    2-inch pipe may be introduced or removed at pleasure, without disturbing the
                    casing-pipe or drive-pipe, or letting water into the well upon the oil.</p>
                <p>When drilling has been completed the well is torpedoed. From one to twenty-five
                    gallons of nitro-glycerin are lowered into the well in tin cylinders and
                    exploded, usually by percussion. The effect of firing such a large amount of
                    this powerful explosive is not apparent at the surface, but soon a gurgling
                    sound is heard approaching from beneath; the oil rises from the well and falls
                    first like a fountain and then like a geyser, forming a torrent of yellow fluid,
                    accompanied by a rattle of small stones and fragments of the canister in a
                    shower of spray 100 feet in height. <hi rend="italic superscript"> r 1</hi><hi

                    air, must be followed by an expansion into the porous rock that drives both oil
                    and gas before it, until a point of maximum tension is reached. The resistance
                    then becomes greatest within the rock, and, reaction following, oil and gas are
                    driven out of the rock and out of the well until the expansive force û
                    expended.</p>
                <p>Figs. 2 and 3 show the general arrangement ol pumping and flowing wells. After
                    the well is torpedoed it is prepared for flowing. <hi rend="italic">A</hi>
                    section of 2-inch pipe, per· forated with holes, which serves as a strainer, is
                    lowered into the well and otheι sections coupled to it, until a sufficient
                    length is introduced to reach from the bottom to a point above the oilsand. An
                    indiarubber packeι is then attached in such a manner that within it the pipe
                    that is above it slides in that which is below it, and the rubber is forced
                    against the sides of the drillhole with the weight of 1200 to 1800 feet of
                    2-inch pipe, thus making a gas-tight joint. The pressure of the gas within the
                    oil-sand and below the packer forces the oil to the surface. As the flow
                    diminishes, a pumpbarrel is introduced to the bottom of the well and the oil is
                    lifted to the surface. Gas-pumps are also used to remove the pressure of the
                    atmosphere from the well and rock. In some of the older districts from twelve to
                    forty wells are attached to one engine, and pumped by what is called a
                    “sucker-rod” connexion. · In West Virginia five different horizons of sandstone
                    have yielded oil. A well w⅛s put down there in 1865 to the “first white oak
                    sand,” 255 feet in depth, and pumped at intervals for fifteen years; it was then
                    reamed out to 8 inches in diameter, and from the bottom of the old well was
                    carried down 4⅜ inches in diameter to the third sand. A tube was inserted with a
                    packer at the bottom of the 8-inch hole to stop off the heavy oil of the first
                    sand. Through this oil of a specific gravity ’ 79 (45° B.) was pumped from the
                    third sand, and through a second tube, introduced beside the first to the bottom
                    of the old well, oil of a specific gravity '88 (27° B.) was pumped from the
                    first sand, both pumps being simultaneously worked by the same walking-beaan.
                    The first-sand oil was worth seven dollars a barrel, while the third-sand oil
                    was worth only one dollar a barrel.</p>
                <p>The average duration of the profitable production of an oil-well is estimated at
                    five years. This period is subject to great fluctuations, as there are wells in
                    the Cole Creek district of the Bradford field that were abandoned in two years,
                    while wells on Triumph Hill, Venango county, where the sand is 125 feet thick,
                    have been pumped fifteen years. The yield of some single wells has been
                    enormous. A well in Donegal township, Butler county, Pennsylvania, produced more
                    than 110,000 barrels in ten years, and twelve wells, of which this was one, on
                    the same farm produced over 750,000 barrels.</p>
                <p>In Burmah and other Eastern countries petroleum was stored and transported in
                    flasks and jars. In the United States it was for many years transported in
                    barrels made tight for oil by-being coated on the inside with a stiff solution
                    of glue. Later, it was transported on the rivers in bulk barges, and on the
                    railroads in tanks upon cars. These tanks were at first made of wood, but they
                    have lately been made of iron. The usual form is a plain cylinder, 24 feet 6
                    inches long and 66 inches in diameter, having a capacity of from 4000 to 5000
                    gallons. These cars are also used in the Caucasus. At the present time, in all
                    the regions producing petroleum in commercial quantities, the bulk of the crude
                    oil is transported through pipe-lines, which consist of lines of pipe carried
                    across the country, often for hundreds of miles, through which the oil is forced
                    by powerful pumps under a pressure of from 1000 to 1600 lb to the square inch.
                    Each well has a tank into which the oil flows from the well, and from which it
                    is carried in a 2-inch pipe by gravity to a pumping station, where it is pumped
                    into the “main line.” Main lines run out of the oil-regions of 'Pennsylvania to
                    Cleveland (Ohio), Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania), Buffalo (New York), and New York,
                    Philadelphia, and Baltimore on the Atlantic coast. They are constructed of
                    6-inch pipe, the joints of which are screwed into couplings like sections of
                    gas-pipe. During recent years the production of petroleum in excess of any
                    demand for it has led to the storage of vast quantities (30,000,000 barrels in
                    1882) in iron tanks of enormous size. Many of these tanks are owned by private
                    individuals, but the majority belong to the pipe-lines. There are 1375 iron
                    tanks connected with the united pipe-lines, ranging in capacity from 1000 to
                    38,000 barrels, and representing a total storage capacity of 38,000,000 barrels.
                    These tanks are frequently fired by lightning or other accidents, and when
                    burning present a spectacle of unsurpassed grandeur.</p>
                <p>The bulk of the trade in crude petroleum in the United States is conducted
                    through the pipe-lines and their certificates. When oil is received into the
                    line from a well, the amount is ascertained and passed to the credit of the
                    well-owner on the books of the company, less 3 per cent, to cover loss in
                    handling. This oil is held like a bank-deposit, subject to transfer on a written
                    order. When such an order has been “accepted” by an officer of the company it
                    becomes an “acceptance” or “certificate,” and is then negotiable like a
                    certified cheque. As the exchanges deal only in certificates of 1000 barrels
                    they are made of that amount so far as is possible. When oil is delivered by the
                    pipe-lines a pipage charge of 20 cents per barrel is paid and a storage fee of
                    $12’50 per 1000 barrels per month must be paid at least once in six months. The
                    issuing of certificates by the pipe-lines has made speculation in oil,
                    brokerage, and exchanges possible to an extent vastly beyond the requirements of
                    any actual trade in the oil itself.</p>
                <p>About 250,000,000 barrels of petroleum have been produced in the United States
                    and Canada from 1859 to 1884. No reliable statistics are to be had of the
                    production in other regions, but of late years the Caucasian fieldshave yielded
                    about 5,000,000 barrels per annum. The total annual production for 1883 cannot
                    be far from 35,000,000 barrels.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Technology.—</hi> The technology of petroleum is quite simple.
                    In the crude state it enters largely into mixtures with other oils, tallow,
                    lead, soap, graphite, &amp;c., that are chiefly used for lubrication. Crude
                    petroleum is also filtered through charcoal. Crude oils that are too fluid for
                    lubrication are reduced to the required consistence by partial evaporation, both
                    by exposure to the sun in shallow tanks and also by distillation of the more
                    volatile portion in stills. Such oils are called “reduced oils.” In the
                    technology of petroleum by distillation a great variety of details are employed
                    by different manufacturers, but in general they may be treated under the three
                    heads of destructive distillation or “cracking,” distillation with superheated
                    steam, and distillation <hi rend="italic">in vacuo.</hi> The stills used vary
                    greatly in respect of form and capacity. Formerly stills holding 80,000 gallons
                    were used, but recently they have been constructed of a capacity of from 40,000
                    to 48,000 gallons. They are ordinarily made either in the form of plain
                    cylinders 30 feet in length and 12 feet 6 inches in diameter, and set
                    horizontally in banks of three or more, or there may be an upright eylindeι∙ 30
                    feet in diameter and 9 feet in height, set vertically with numerous fireboxes
                    arranged around the circumference. Another form of still is an upright cylinder
                    holding about 1000 gallons, heated from beneath and furnished with a steam-coil
                    immersed in the body of the oil. In this coil the steam is superheated to the
                    temperature of the oil, and is then allowed to escape into it, by which means
                    the overheating of the oil is prevented and the distillation assisted by the
                    mechanical action of the steam in lifting the oilvapour out of the still.
                    Another form of still is a vacuum still, in which a partial vacuum is maintained
                    by a pump. The top of the still is usually constructed with a high dome, into
                    which the vapours rise and from which they escape into the condensers. The
                    condensers usually consist of a large number of 2-inch pipes immersed in water
                    contained in a long trough. The distillation <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n750/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0750-0719"/> commences at a very low temperature and proceeds
                    at a constantly rising temperature, the distillate steadily increasing in
                    specific gravity. The last portions distil at nearly a red heat, and are nearly
                    solid at ordinary temperatures, with a specific gravity above 900°.</p>
                <p>The oil is first allowed to settle in large tanks, when about 1 per cent, of
                    water and sediment is removed. It is then pumped to stills into which “live”
                    steam is introduced. Distillation commences at once and is allowed to proceed
                    until the specific gravity of the distillate reaches 74 (60° B). The oil in this
                    condition is called “gas-oil,” and is used to a limited extent in the
                    manufacture of illuminating gas. The distillate is crude naphtha, and is
                    redistilled and divided into (1) rhigolene or cymogene, having a specific
                    gravity of '62 and boiling at 65° Fahr.; (2) gasolene, specific gravity <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 66 (90° to 80° B.); (3) C naphtha, specific gravity
                    70 (80° to 68° B.); (4) B naphtha, specific gravity 72 (68° to 64° B.); and (5)
                    A naphtha, specific gravity 74 (64° to 60° B.). Below 60° goes to illuminating
                    oil. The crude oil from which the naphtha has been removed is then put into a
                    suitable still and distilled until the distillate has a specific gravity of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 81 (40° B.). This distillate is crude illuminating
                    oil. The oil remaining in the still may then be “cracked” by destructive
                    distillation, or may be distilled for lubricating oil. If it is to be “cracked”
                    the fires are slacked and the distillation allowed to proceed slowly, in
                    consequence of which the vapours of the heavy oil are repeatedly condensed upon
                    the dome of the still and made to fall back upon the hot oil beneath. The result
                    is the production of a large volume of permanent gas, chiefly marsh gas and
                    hydrogen, a distillate of suitable specific gravity for illuminating oil, and a
                    heavy tarry residue, called “residuum,” that remains in the still. By this
                    method of manipulation the crude oil is converted into crude naphtha, crude
                    illuminating oil, and residuum, while the gas is burned as a waste product. The
                    residuum is run out of the still and sold to manufacturers of lubricating oil.
                    If the oil is not to be cracked, the heavy oil, from which the illuminating oil
                    and naphtha have been removed, is often distilled with superheated steam and
                    treated for lubricating oil. If simply distilled and treated with chemicals
                    after removal of the paraffin, the oil is called in the United States “paraffin
                    oil.” The crude paraffin oil is placed in barrels in an ice-house, and, after it
                    has been several days at rest, paraffin crystallizes from it. The paraffin is
                    removed by pressure, and may be purified by any of the methods described under
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Paraffin</hi> (p. 242 above). The oil from which the
                    paraffin has been pressed may be subjected to a further distillation in a
                    steam-coil or other suitable still, and deprived of certain oils that boil at a
                    high temperature but have a pungent and offensive odour. When drawn off, the oil
                    remaining in the still is found to be light-coloured and nearly tasteless and
                    odourless. It is called “deodorized neutral heavy hydrocarbon oil,” and is found
                    to be a very valuable lubricating oil. The distillate above mentioned after
                    treatment is called “mineral sperm,” and is used as an illuminating oil on cars
                    and steamboats, where a more volatile oil would be objectionable. Any of these
                    distillates, from gasolene to the most dense lubricating oil, may be purified by
                    filtration or by treatment with acids and alkalis. Filtration is usually applied
                    to the different grades of naphtha to deprive them of disagreeable odour, for
                    which purpose gravel and both wood and animal charcoal are used, either
                    separately or together. Lubricating oils are often filtered through animal
                    charcoal to deprive them of both colour and odour. The dense vacuum residues
                    recently prepared under the name of Cosmoline, vaseline, &amp;c., are filtered
                    through animal charcoal while hot and perfectly fluid. Oils are treated with
                    chemicals in high cylindrical tanks of small diameter, where they are thoroughly
                    mingled by means of air forced into the bottom of the tank under pressure. These
                    agitators often hold 50,000 gallons. The illuminating oils are usually treated
                    with 5 per cent, of oil of vitriol at a temperature of about 60° Fahr. The acid
                    “sludge,” consisting of the oil of vitriol combined with the impurities of the
                    oil and forming a black tarry liquid, settles to the bottom of the tank and is
                    drawn off. The oil is then agitated with water, then treated with a solution of
                    caustic soda, and finally washed with water containing caustic ammonia.
                    Hydrochloric acid is used to a limited extent, and nitric and chromic acids are
                    used to destroy fluorescence in dense oils. Those illuminating oils especially
                    that are prepared by cracking are thrown after treatment, and while warm, in a
                    thin spray into a large tank. This causes a small amount of very volatile oil
                    produced by cracking to be evaporated, and brings the oil up to test. Finally
                    the oil is exposed under a skylight in large shallow tanks until it has become
                    perfectly clear from settling of all impurities. The acid “sludge” is for the
                    most part sold to manufacturers of commercial fertilizers or restored by
                    evaporation and used over again. More than 45,000 tons of oil of vitriol were
                    used in 1880 by the manufacturers of petroleum in the United States. The alkali
                    sludge is thrown away. The following table shows the average percentage of
                    commercial products obtained from crude petroleum of 79 (45° B.) from
                    Pennsylvania, Ohio, &amp;c.—</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Lubricating Oils.—</hi> Crude petroleum and the heavy
                    distillates from petroleum, finished either by treatment or by filtration, have
                    been slowly winning their way with consumers of lubricating oils for the last
                    twenty years, and may now be said to have a recognized value. This result has
                    been due as much to improved processes of manufacture, and consequently to
                    improved quality of the products, as to a recognition of their merits. When
                    properly prepared, and exempt from volatile matter and offensive odour, they are
                    found to be possessed of great endurance, to be free from a tendency to gum, and
                    to be incapable of spontaneous combustion. When mixed with animal and vegetable
                    oils liable to spontaneous combustion, these oils prevent it. They are therefore
                    now in large demand, a demand which is likely to increase as new applications
                    are found for them and their quality is improved.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Illτιminating Oils.—</hi> Oils of this class manufactured from
                    petroleum have nearly superseded the use of other illuminating fluids throughout
                    the world. They are largely sold in Great Britain under the name of “paraffin
                    oils”; in the United States they are called “kerosene,” and on the European
                    continent “refined petroleum.” The different qualities are known as “water
                    white,” “standard,” and “prime,” and are further distinguished as “low test” and
                    “high test” oils. The characters chiefly relied on in the trade are “colour” and
                    “test.” The colour should be as light and free from opalescence as possible.
                    Colour is, however, a matter of little importance except as it indicates
                    unskilful manufacture of the oil. The “test” is of paramount importance, and
                    indicates the temperature Fahr, at which the oil will give off a sufficient
                    amount of vapour to ignite explosively when the oil is properly tested. While
                    the methods of testing petroleum vary greatly, the apparatuses used for that
                    purpose may be divided into three classes. The first class is designed to
                    ascertain the tension of the vapour given off by a given sample at a certain
                    fixed temperature; these are chiefly used in France. The others are designed to
                    show at what temperature a given amount of oil, usually half a pint, will give
                    off a sufficient amount of vapour to form an explosive mixture with the air
                    above the oil. These are divided into “open testers,” in which the oil is heated
                    in an open vessel, and “closed testers,” in which the oil is heated in a closed
                    vessel. The tester invented by Sir F. A. Abel (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Paraffin,</hi> p. 239) has been adopted in Great Britain and her colonies,
                    while in the United States and on the Continent a great variety are in use. The
                    numerous accidents, many of a frightful nature, and involving great loss of
                    property and often of human life, that have followed the use of illuminating
                    oils which had not been properly freed from the volatile products of the
                    petroleum, have led in most European countries and many of the American States
                    to the enactment of stringent laws forbidding the sale or use of oils the test
                    of which does not come within the prescribed legal limits. Very valuable
                    researches on the flashing of oils have been made by Dr C. F. Chandler of New
                    York, and by other American chemists. Dr Chandler showed that oils burning in
                    lamps of ordinary construction in a room the temperature of which was below 90°
                    Fahr, failed to reach an average temperature of 100° Fahr. In metal lamps,
                    particularly “student lamps,” the average temperature was several degrees higher
                    than in glass lamps, a fact which shows glass lamps to be safest in this
                    respect. Dr C. B. White of New Orleans has examined illuminating oils with
                    respect to the amount of volatile material that, when added to good oil, will
                    render it dangerous. He found that from 1 to 5 per cent, of the ordinary
                    naphthas of commerce would render illuminating oil of the best quality extremely
                    dangerous. Five per cent, of crude naphtha reduced the flashing point from 118°
                    to 70° Fahr. These researches have all demonstrated the wisdom of English
                    legislation on this subject, but unfortunately have not been productive of
                    equally good results in the United States. Petroleum legislation is there in a
                    very unsatisfactory condition. The very worthless law passed by Congress in 1867
                    has long been repealed, and no other has been substituted for it. A number of
                    the States (seventeen in 1880) are without legislation in reference to this
                    subject, while legislation in other States is based upon local influence rather
                    than fixed principles, and ranges in its <pb break="no"

                    exaction, in consequence of the lack of intelligent national Governmental
                    action. Nearly all the nations of continental Europe have petroleum laws in the
                    main based upon an intelligent appreciation of the subject, and but little
                    inferior to English legislation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Uses of Naphtha.—</hi> The lightest products obtained from
                    petroleum are rhigolene, which is used in surgery, and cymogene, which is used
                    as the volatile fluid in ice-machines. Gasolene is the lightest fluid obtained
                    in considerable quantity, and is used in automatic gas-machines for the
                    carburation of gas or air. The question of increasing the illuminating power of
                    gas (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Gas,</hi> vol. x. p. 101), by causing it to absorb
                    fluid hydrocarbons, was discussed as early as 1832, but it was only after
                    petroleum furnished a cheap and suitable fluid that inventors succeeded in
                    securing results of any value. While hundreds of machines have been patented in
                    England, America, and continental Europe for accomplishing this purpose, it is
                    only quite recently that an American inventor, Dr Walter Μ. Jackson, has
                    succeeded in constructing a machine that satisfactorily meets all the
                    requirements of the problem. His metrical carburetter measures both the fluid
                    and the gas or air in such a manner that the least amount of the hydrocarbon
                    fluid required to produce the effect sought is furnished to the gas, and the
                    whole is immediately absorbed. By this means a uniform carburation is secured,
                    furnishing a gas of uniform quality, that never contains a sufficient amount of
                    fluid to admit of condensation in any part of the apparatus. Both crude
                    petroleum and the products of its manufacture have been used as a material for
                    the manufacture of gas by distillation. The different qualities of naphtha are
                    used in mixing paint, in the manufacture of oil-cloths for floors and of
                    varnishes, as a solvent for gums and resins, inthe preparation of alkaloids, in
                    the manufacture of india-rubber, in washing wool, and in removing oils and
                    grease from seeds and textile fabrics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Petroleum as Fιιel.—</hi> In the region of the Caucasus and on
                    the Caspian Sea, where other fuel is scarce and dear and petroleum is plentiful
                    and cheap, the latter is used with complete success on both steamships and
                    locomotives. Petroleum and its products have been used with practical success in
                    the manufacture of iron in the United States. Both illuminating oil and naphtha
                    are now very widely usedin stoves; but naphtha-stoves are extremely dangerous,
                    and their use should be prohibited by law. In the valley of the Euphrates, near
                    Mosul, petroleum is used as a fuel in burning lime.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Petroleum in Medicine. —</hi> Although petroleum has been used
                    as a remedial agent for an unknown period in the countries where it is a natural
                    product, its physiological effects have never been very fully investigated.
                    Barbados tar, Haarlem oil, Seneca oil, and American oil, all consisting wholly
                    or in large part of crude petroleum, were sold by apothecaries for years before
                    petroleum was obtained by boring. They were mainly used as liniments for
                    external application, particularly in rheumatism. The oil of the Alleghany
                    valley early had a local reputation as an internal remedy for consumption, and
                    it has lately been prescribed for bronchitis. The most volatile product of
                    petroleum obtained by distillation, called rhigolene, has been used to produce
                    local insensibility, by means of the intense cold resulting from its rapid
                    evaporation; and the same fluid when inhaled as vapour or the gas escaping from
                    fresh oil will produce an intoxication or insensibility resembling the effects
                    of laughing-gas, resulting in death if its action is prolonged. The products of
                    petroleum that have proved most valuable in medicine are the filtered paraffin
                    residues sold under the names of cosmoline, vaseline, &amp;c., that are now so
                    widely used as ointments, either plain or medicated. They are of about the
                    consistence of butter, with very little taste or odour, and will keep
                    indefinitely without becoming rancid. These valuable properties have caused them
                    to almost entirely supersede all other preparations containing animal or
                    vegetable fats.</p>
                <p>Looking towards the past, it may be said that petroleum has attained universal
                    diffusion as a lighting agent; it is fast displacing animal and vegetable oils
                    as a lubricator on all classes of bearings, from railroad - axles to mule -
                    spindles, and also where other oils are liable to spontaneous combustion; it is
                    very largely used as fuel for stoves, both for heating and cooking; it is very
                    successfully used for steam purposes when other fuel is scarce and petroleum
                    plentiful; it is likely to be used for the production of pure iron for special
                    purposes and it has become a necessity to the apothecary as petroleum ointment.
                    Looking towards the future, what assurance have we that these varied wants, the
                    creation of a quarter of a century, will be satisfied? While it is not probable
                    that the deposits of petroleum in the crust of the earth are being practically
                    increased at the present time, there is reason to believe that the supply is
                    ample for an indefinite period. Yet the fact is worthy of serious consideration
                    that the production of petroleum as at present conducted is everywhere wasteful
                    in the extreme.</p>
