                    devoted servant of Napoleon III., who with the due de Morny and Marshal
                    Saint-Arnaud formed the triumvirate which established the second empire, was
                    born at Saint-Germain Lespinasse (Loire) on 11th January 1808. He came of a rood
                    family, but not a noble one, and, as his father had been killed at the battle of
                    Salamanca in 1812, he was brought up by an uncle, who sent him to be educated at
                    the college of Limoges. He entered the 3d Hussars in 1825, the cavalry school at
                    Saumur in 1826, and became maréchal des logis in the 4th Hussars in 1828. He was
                    at this time a Legitimist, but was soon made a Republican by his captain, and he
                    helped to persuade his regiment to assist in the insurrection of 1830. For this
                    service he expected great rewards, but got none, and was eventually dismissed
                    from the army for insubordination in 1831. Finding himself without resources, he
                    took to journalism, and assisted in editing the <hi rend="italic">Temps,</hi>
                    and in 1833, by which time he had become a profound Bonapartist, he issued a
                    solitary number of a new journal, the <hi rend="italic">Occident</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">français,</hi> in which he proclaimed his political creed. This
                    number was sent to Queen Hortense at Arenenberg, and when Μ. Fialin followed it
                    in person, calling himself the vicomte de Persigny, he met with a warm
                    reception, and soon became indispensable to Louis Napoleon. He had two qualities
                    which gave him ascendency over the young prince, fidelity and audacity. He it
                    was who planned the attempt on Strasburg in 1836, and that on Boulogne in 1840.
                    For his share in the last escapade he was sentenced to imprisonment in a
                    fortress for twenty years, which was commuted into detention at Versailles,
                    where he wrote a curious book to prove that the Pyramids were built to keep the
                    Nile from silting up. When the Revolution of 1848 broke out he laboured
                    indefatigably for the Bonapartist cause, securing the election of Louis Napoleon
                    to the Constituent Assembly in June and in September 1848, and to the presidency
                    in December 1848. His own prosperity was now secured; he was made aide-de-camp
                    to the prince president, and elected to the Legislative Assembly in May 1849 for
                    the department of the Loire. He then became one of the secret plotters of the
                    coup d’état, and was at first designed for the office of minister of the
                    interior, but a man of more capacity, De Morny, was chosen for this post, and
                    Persigny only accompanied Colonel Espinasse to take possession of the hall of
                    the assembly. On securing the throne Napoleon III. hastened to reward his most
                    faithful personal adherent. Persigny became minister of the interior in the
                    place of De Morny in January 1852, and a senator in December 1852. He resigned
                    office in 1854 and became ambassador in London, with but one short interval
                    (1858-59), from May 1855 to November 1860, when he again became minister of the
                    interior. His second tenure of office lasted till June 1863, when he resigned in
                    disgust at the influence which Μ. Rouher was attaining over the mind of the
                    emperor, and was made duc de Persigny in September 1863. As a minister he showed
                    very little capacity, and throughout the years of his political influence he
                    never seemed to understand, like De Morny, the real bases of the existence of
                    the second empire. He, however, from dislike of Rouher, supported Ollivier in
                    1869, and defended the plébiscite, and when the empire fell in 1870 escaped to
                    England. He did not long survive the overthrow of the idea which he had so
                    strenuously supported, and died at Nice on 11th January 1872. Fialin de Persigny
                    was certainly only an adventurer, but he had one merit, which the other founders
                    of the second empire did not possess, fidelity to his master.</p>
