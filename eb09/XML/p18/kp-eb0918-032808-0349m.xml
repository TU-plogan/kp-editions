                    of lands, tenements, and hereditaments, or of chattels real between coparceners,
                    joint tenants, or tenants in common. It is to be noticed that not all
                    hereditaments are capable of partition. There can be no partition of homage,
                    fealty, or common of turbary, or of an inheritance of dignity, such as a
                    peerage. Partition is either voluntary or compulsory. Voluntary partition is
                    effected by mutual conveyances, and can only be made where all parties are <hi
                    rend="italic">sui juris.</hi> Since 8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. 106, § 3, it must be made
                    by deed, except in the case of copyholds. Compulsory partition is effected by
                    private Act of Parliament, by judicial process, or through the inclosure
                    commissioners. At common law none but coparceners were entitled to partition
                    against the will of the rest of the proprietors, but the Acts of 31 Henry VIII.
                    c. 1 and 32 Henry VIII. c. 32 gave a compulsory process to joint tenants and
                    tenants in common of freeholds, whether in possession or in reversion, by means
                    of the writ of partition. In the reign of Elizabeth the Court of Chancery began
                    to assume jurisdiction in partition, and the writ of partition, after gradually
                    becoming obsolete, was finally abolished by 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 27. The Court
                    of Chancery could not decree partition of copyholds until 4&lt;fc 5 Vict. c. 35,
                    § 85. By the Judicature Act, 1873, § 34, partition is one of the matters
                    specially assigned to the Chancery Division. An order for partition is a matter
                    of right, subject to the discretion vested in the court by the Partition Act,
                    1868 (31 &amp; 32 Vict. c. 40, amended by 39 &amp; 40 Vict. c. 17). By § 3 of
                    the Act of 1868 the court may, on the request of a party interested, direct a
                    sale instead of a partition, if a sale would be more beneficial than a
                    partition. By § 12 a county court has jurisdiction in partition where the
                    property does not exceed £500 in value. Under the powers of the Inclosure Act,
                    1845, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n350/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0350-0329"/> 8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. 118, and the Acts amending it,
                    the inclosure commissioners have power of enforcing compulsory partition among
                    the joint owners of any inclosed lands. An order of the inclosure commissioners
                    or a private Act vests the legal estate, as did also the old writ of partition.
                    But an order of the Chancery Division only declares the rights, and requires to
                    be perfected by mutual conveyances so as to pass the legal estate. Where,
                    however, all the parties are not <hi rend="italic">sui juris,</hi> the court may
                    make a vesting order under the powers of the Trustee Act, 1850,13 &amp; 14 Vict,
                    c. 60, § 30.</p>
                <p>Partition is not a technical term of Scots law. In Scotland division of common
                    property is effected either extra-judicially, or by action of declarator and
                    division or division and sale in the Court of Session, or (to a limited extent)
                    in the sheriff courts. Rights of common are not divisible in English law without
                    an Act of Parliament or a decree of the inclosure commissioners, but in Scotland
                    the Act of 1695, c. 38, made all common ties, except those belonging to the king
                    or royal burghs, divisible, on the application of any having interest, by action
                    in the Court of Session. By 40 &amp; 41 Vict. c. 50, § 8, the action for
                    division of common property or commonty is competent in the sheriff court, when
                    the subject in dispute does not exceed in value £50 by the year, or £1000 value.
                    Runrig lands, except when belonging to corporations, were made divisible by the
                    Act of 1695, c. 23. A decree of division of commonty, common property, or runrig
                    lands has the effect of a conveyance by the joint proprietors to the several
                    participants (37 &amp; 38 Vict. c. 94, § 35).</p>
                <p>In the United States, “it is presumed,” says Chancellor Kent, (4 <hi
                    rend="italic">Comm.,</hi> lect. lxiv.), “that the English statutes of 31 &amp;
                    32 Henry VIII. have been generally re-enacted and adopted, and probably with
                    increased facilities for partition.” In a large majority of the States,
                    partition may be made by a summary method of petition to the courts of common
                    law. In the other States the courts of equity have exclusive jurisdiction. As
                    between heirs and devisees the probate courts may in some States award
                    partition. The various State laws with regard to partition will be found in
