                    Firdausi (second half of the 10th Christian century) repeatedly speaks of
                    Pahlavi books as the sources of his narratives, and he tells us among other
                    things that in the time of the first Khosrau (Chosroes I., 531-579 <hi

                    It is most suitable to confine the word, as is now generally done, to designate
                    a kind of writing—not only that of the Pahlavi books, but of all inscriptions on
                    stone and metal which use similar characters and are written on essentially the
                    same principles as these books.</p>
                <p>At first sight the Pahlavi books present the strangest spectacle of mixture of
                    speech. Purely Semitic (Aramaic) words—and these not only nouns and verbs, but
                    numerals, particles, demonstrative and even personal pronouns—stand side by side
                    with Persian vocables. Often, however, the Semitic words are compounded in a way
                    quite unsemitic, or have Persian terminations. As read by the modern
                    Zoroastrians, there are also many words which are neither Semitic nor Persian;
                    but it is soon seen that this traditional pronunciation is untrustworthy. The
                    character is cursive and very ambiguous, so that, for example, there is but one
                    sign for <hi rend="italic">n, u,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and one for
                    <hi rend="italic">y, d,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g</hi>; this has led to
                    mistakes in the received pronunciation, which for many words can be shewn to
                    have been at one time more correct than it is now. But apart from such blunders
                    there remain phenomena which could never have appeared in a real language; and
                    the hot strife which raged till recently as to whether Pahlavi is Semitic or
                    Persian has been closed by the discovery that it is merely a way of writing
                    Persian in which the Persian words are partly represented —to the eye, not to
                    the ear—by their Semitic equivalents. This view, the development of which began
                    with Westergaard <hi rend="italic">(Zendavesta,</hi> p. 20, <hi rend="italic"
                    >note},</hi> is in full accordance with the true and ancient tradition. Thus Ibn
                    Mokaffa', who translated many Pahlavi books into Arabic, tells us that the
                    Persians had about one thousand words which they wrote otherwise than they were
                    pronounced in Persian.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    was pronounced as the Persian <hi rend="italic">gbsht.</hi> We still possess a
                    glossary which actually gives the Pahlavi writing with its Persian
                    pronunciation. This glossary, which besides Aramaic words contains also a
                    variety of Persian words disguised in antique forms, or by errors due to the
                    contracted style of writing, exists in various shapes, all of which, in spite of
                    their corruptions, go back to the work which the statement of Ibn Mokaffa' had
                    in view.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Editions by

                    and pronounce “and.” No system was followed in the choice of Semitic forms.

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0150-0135"/> a noun was written in its <hi rend="italic"
                    >status</hi><hi rend="italic">absolutus,</hi> sometimes the emphatic <hi
                    rend="italic">â</hi> was added, and this was sometimes written as S sometimes as
                    ∏. One verb was written in the perfect, another in the imperfect. Even various
                    dialects were laid under contribution. The Semitic signs by which Persian
                    synonyms were distinguished are sometimes quite arbitrary. Thus in Persian <hi
                    rend="italic">khwésh</hi> and <hi rend="italic">khwat</hi> both mean “self”; the
                    former is written <hi rend="smallcaps">nfsL·h</hi><hi rend="italic">(nafshâ</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">nσfsheh),</hi> the latter BNFshκ with the preposition <hi
                    rend="italic">be</hi> prefixed. Personal pronouns are. expressed in the dative
                    <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> with prepositional <hi rend="italic">I</hi>
                    prefixed), thus <hi rend="smallcaps">lk</hi><hi rend="italic">(lakh)</hi> for
                    <hi rend="italic">tu,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> thou,” <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >lnh</hi><hi rend="italic">(land)</hi> for <hi rend="italic">amd, “</hi> we.”
                    Sometimes the same Semitic sign stands for two distinct Persian words that
                    happen to agree in sound; thus because <hi rend="italic">hdnd</hi> is Aramaic
                    for “this,” <hi rend="smallcaps">hna</hi> represents not only Persian é, “this,”
                    but also the interjection <hi rend="italic">é,</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e.,
                    “O”</hi> as prefixed to a vocative. Sometimes for clearness a Persian
                    termination is added to a Semitic word; thus, to distinguish between the two
                    words for father, <hi rend="italic">pit</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pitar,</hi>
                    the former is written <hi rend="smallcaps">ab</hi> and the latter <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">abitr.</hi> The Persian form is, however, not seldom used, even
                    where there is a quite well-known Semitic ideogram.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For examples of various peculiarities see the
                    notes to Noldeke’s translation of the story of <hi rend="italic">Artachshir
                    i</hi><hi rend="italic">Pâpakân,</hi> Göttingen, 1879.</p></note></p>
                <p>These difficulties of reading mostly disappear when the ideographic nature of the
                    writing is recognized. We do not always know what Semitic word supplied some
                    ambiguous group of letters <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >pun</hi> for <hi rend="italic">pa,</hi> “to,” or <hi rend="smallcaps">ht</hi>
                    for <hi rend="italic">agar,</hi> “if ”); but wealways can tell the Persian word—
                    which is the one important thing—though not always the exact pronunciation, of
                    it in that older stage of the language which the extant Pahlavi works belong to.
                    In Pahlavi, for example, the word for “female” is written <hi rend="italic"
                    >mdtak,</hi> an ancient form which afterwards passed through <hi rend="italic"
                    >mddhak</hi> into <hi rend="italic">mddha.</hi> But it was a mistake of later
                    ages to fancy that because this was so the sign T also meant D, and so to write
                    T for D in many cases, especially in foreign proper names. That a word is
                    written in an older form than that which is pronounced is a phenomenon common to
                    many languages whose literature covers a long period. So in English we still
                    write though we do not pronounce the gutteral in <hi rend="italic">through,</hi>
                    and write <hi rend="italic">laugh</hi> when we pronounce Zα∕.</p>
                <p>Much graver difficulties arise from the cursive nature of the characters already
                    alluded to. There are some groups which may theoretically be read in hundreds of
                    ways; the same little sign may be t?, χ∖ ∏*, fc∏, m, χj, ∏J, and the ∏ too may
                    be either <hi rend="italic">h</hi> or <hi rend="italic">kh.</hi></p>
                <p>In older times there was still some little distinction between letters that are
                    now quite identical in form, but even the fragments of Pahlavi writing of the
                    7th century recently found in Egypt show on the whole the same type as our MSS.
                    The practical inconveniences to those who knew the language were not so great as
                    they may seem; the Arabs also long used an equally ambiguous character without
                    availing themselves of the diacritical points which had been devised long
                    before.</p>
                <p>Modern MSS., following Arabic models, introduce diacritical points from time to
                    time, and often incorrectly. These give little help, however, in comparison with
                    the so-called Pâzand or transcription of Pahlavi texts, as they are to be
                    spoken, in the character in which the <hi rend="italic">Avestd</hi> itself is
                    written, and which is quite clear and has all vowels as well as consonants. The
                    transcription is not philologically accurate; the language is often modernized,
                    but not uniformly so. Pâzand MSS. present dialectical variations according to
                    the taste or intelligence of authors and copyists, and all have many false
                    readings. For us, however, they are of the greatest use. To get a conception of
                    Pahlavi one cannot do better than read the <hi rend="italic">Minoi-Khiradh</hi>
                    in the Pahlavi with constant reference to the</p>
                <p>Pâzand.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    author’s own pronunciation of what he wrote.</p>
                <p>The coins of the later Sâsânian kings, of the princes of Tabaristân, and of some
                    governors in the earlier Arab period exhibit an alphabet very similar to Pahlavi
                    MSS. On the older coins the several letters are more clearly distinguished, and
                    in good specimens of well-struck coins of the oldest Sâsânians almost every
                    letter can be recognized with certainty. The same holds good for the
                    inscriptions on gems and other small monuments of the early Sâsânian period; but
                    the clearest of all are the rock inscriptions of the Sâsânians in the 3d and 4th
                    centuries, though in the 4th century a tendency to cursive forms begins to
                    appear. Only <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v</hi> are always
                    quite alike. The character of the language and the system of writing is
                    essentially the same on coins, gems, and rocks as in MSS.—pure Persian, in part
                    strangely disguised in a Semitic garb. In details there are many differences
                    between the Pahlavi of inscriptions and the books. Persian endings added to
                    words written in Semitic form are much less common in the former, so that the
                    person and number of a verb are often not to be made out. There are also
                    orthographic variations; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> long <hi rend="italic"
                    >â</hi> in Persian forms is always expressed in book-Pahlavi, but not always in
                    inscriptions. The unfamiliar contents of some of these inscriptions, their
                    limited number, their bad preservation, and the imperfect way in which some of

                    Chaldaeo-Pahlavi, &amp;c. Olshausen tries to make it probable that this was the
                    writing of Media and the other that of Persia. The Persian dialect in both sets
                    of inscriptions is identical or nearly so.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    writing was developed in Parthian times, when the great nobles, the Pahlavâns,
                    ruled, and Media was their main seat, “the Pahlav country.” Other linguistic,
                    graphical, and historical indications point the same way; but it is still far
                    from clear how the system was developed. We know indeed that even under the
                    Achaemenians Aramaic writing and speech were employed far beyond the Aramaic
                    lands even in official documents and on coins. The Eranians had no convenient
                    character, and might borrow <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n151/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0151-0136"/> the Aramaic letters as naturally as they
                    subsequently borrowed those of the Arabs. But this does not explain the strange
                    practice of writing Semitic words in place of so many Persian words which were
                    to be read as Persian. It cannot be the invention of an individual, for in that
                    case the system would have been more consistently worked out, and the appearance
                    of two or more kinds of Pahlavi side by side at the beginning of the Sâsânian
                    period would be inexplicable. But we may remember that the Aramaic character
                    first came to the Eranians from the region of the lower Euphrates and Tigris,
                    where the complicated cuneiform character arose, and where it held its ground
                    long after better ways of writing were known. In later antiquity probably very
                    few Persians could read and write. All kinds of strange things are conceivable
                    in an Eastern character confined to a narrow circle. Of the facts at least there
                    is no doubt.</p>
                <p>The Pahlavi literature embraces the translations of the holy books of the
                    Zoroastrians, dating probably from the 6th century, and certain other religious
                    books, especially the <hi rend="italic">Minôi-Khiradh</hi> (see above) and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Bundehish.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The translations edited by Spiegel, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bundehish</hi> by Westergaard and Justi, other Pahlavi books by Spiegel and
                    Haug, by Hoshangji, and other Indian Pârsees.</p></note> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bundehish</hi> dates from the Arab period. Zoroastrian priests continued to
                    write the old language as a dead tongue and to use the old character long after
                    the victory of a ne&gt;v empire, a new religion, a new form of the language (New
                    Persian), and a new character. There was once a not quite inconsiderable profane
                    literature of which a good deal is preserved in Arabic or New Persian versions
                    or reproductions, ι&gt;articularly in historical books about the time before
                    Islam.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We have also one
                    book, the stories of <hi rend="italic">Kalilag and Damnag,</hi> in a Syriac
                    version from the Pahlavi, the latter iu this case being itself taken from the
                    Sanskrit.</p></note> Very ittle profane literature still exists in Pahlavi; the
                    romance of Ardashir has been mentioned above (p. 135, note 1). The difficult
                    study of Pahlavi is made more difficult by the corrupt state of our copies, due
                    to ignorant and careless scribes. A Pahlavi grammar is of course an
                    impossibility. The necessary preparation for the study is a sound knowledge of
                    New Persian, with which one easily finds the clue to the inconsiderable
                    grammatical variations of the older language. The lexical peculiarities of the
                    texts are more considerable, and partly due to the peculiarities of priestly
                    thought and speech. Of glossaries, that of West (Bombay and London, 1874) is to
                    be recommended; the large Pahlavi, Gujarati, and English lexicon of Jamaspji
                    Dastur Minocheherji (incomplete, 3 vols., Bombay and London, 1877-82) is very
                    full, but has numerous false or uncertain forms, and must be used with much
                    caution. (TH. N.)</p>
