                    40' to 20’ N. lat., and from 116° 40' to 126° 30' E. long. On the west and
                    north-west it is separated by the China Sea from China and the Indo-Chineso
                    peninsula; towards the east lies the Pacific; on the north a number of smaller
                    islands stretch out towards Formosa; and on the south, while a double connexion
                    with Borneo is formed by the lines of the Palawan and Balabac and tho Sulu
                    Islands, the basin of the Celebes Sea, with a central depth of from 1000 to 2600
                    fathoms, extends, for a distance of 300 miles, between its southernmost island
                    (Mindanao) and Celebes. As the number of the Philippines is believed to exceed
                    1400, and the larger islands are in several cases only beginning to be properly
                    explored, it is impossible to give a definitive statement of their aggregate
                    land-area. A measurement on Domann’s map (1882) resulted in 114,356 square
                    miles. Nor is it in regard to the area alone that our knowledge is defective.
                    Though for three centuries the greater part of the territory has been nominally
                    in Spanish possession, the interior of some of the larger islands has never been
                    surveyed; several of the native tribes, especially in Mindanao, are altogether
                    independent; the geology of Luzon, the best known of all the archipelago, is to
                    a large extent matter of conjecture; and the visit of a passing botanist or
                    naturalist is enough to add facts of primary importance to the register of flora
                    and fauna. While none of the summits, with the exception perhaps of Apo<note

                    Halcon in Mindoro (8865 feet), Malindang in Mindanao (8685 feet), Mayou in Luzon
                    (8275 feet), and Malaspina in Negros (8190 feet)—all the islands may be
                    described in general as mountainous and hilly. The principal ranges have a
                    tendency to run north and south, with a certain amount of deflexion east or
                    west, as the case may be, so that the orographic diagram of the archipelago as a
                    whole would have a certain similarity to a fan with northern Luzon as its centre
                    of radiation. The geologist finds his task in the Philippines exceptionally
                    difficult, owing to so much of the surface being covered with a dense
                    vegetation, which often obliges him to be contented with no better indication
                    than the pebbles of the alluvium. Nowhere, almost, are there cuttings or
                    excavations to open up the records of the rocks. It seems certain, from the
                    frequency not only of large tracts of coral reef along the coasts but of raised
                    beaches at a considerable distance and elevation inland, containing shells
                    similar to those of the adjacent seas, that much of the archipelago has been
                    heaved from below the sea-level within comparatively recent times. As the neck
                    of land between the Bay of Sogod and the Bay of Ragay or Guinayangan and that
                    between this latter bay and the Bay of San Miguel consist of alluvium, tuffs,
                    and marls, with modern shells, it appears probable that the southern parts of
                    Luzon were at no very distant date separate islands. According to Dräsche,
                    southern and central Luzon comprises (1) a group of chloritic slates and gneiss;
                    (2) diabases and gabbros; (3) Eocene limestones; (4) volcanic minerals and
                    tuffs; (5) recent formations with marine fossils—tuffs, limestones, clays, and
                    marine and fluvial alluviums. In his travels through the more northern parts of
                    the island the same geologist verified the existence of (1) diorite, gneiss,
                    protogenic and chloritic slates; (2) an extensive system of strati tied
                    conglomerates and sandstones; (3) modern volcanic rocks (quartzose trachyte,
                    amρhiboliferous and sanidinic <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n784/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0784-0749"/> trachyte, amphiboliferous andesite and dolerite);
                    (4) tuffs and tufaceous sandstones, with banks of limestone and marl; (5) banks
                    of coral and breccia of coraliferous limestone, and recent volcanic products.
                    The late origin of the coralliferous limestone is shown by the corals belonging
                    to genera still existing in the Indian Ocean— <hi rend="italic">Galaxea, Favia,
                    Meandnna, Porites,Αnd Astracopora—anà</hi> being specifically similar, though
                    not identical. A remarkable feature is the stratification of the limestone.</p>
                <p>Volcanic forces, as has been already implied, have had a great share in shaping
                    the archipelago, and a large number of the mountains bear the stamp of their
                    former activity. But those that still have the credit of being working volcanoes
                    are comparatively few.</p>
                <p>Monte Cagua (3910 feet), discovered by Claudio Montero on the north-eastern
                    promontory of Luzon, appears to discharge smoke continually, and the Babuyanes
                    group (to the north of Luzon) contains several orifices belonging to the same
                    centre of eruption,—a regular volcano in Babuyan Claro, a solfatara in the
                    Didica rocks, and a volcanic island thrown up in 1856. Of greater importance are
                    the three burning mountains of southern Luzon—Taal, Albay, and Bulusan. Taal
                    lies 45 miles almost due south of Manila. Being only 850 feet high, it is
                    remarkable as one of the lowest volcanoes in the world. The present craters are
                    situated in a small triangular island in the middle of Lake Bombon or Bongbong.
                    A tradition exists (and has been accepted without question by many writers) that
                    this lake, covering an area of 100 square miles, and having in the south and
                    east a depth of 109 fathoms, was formed in 1700 on occasion of a terrible
                    eruption, which undermined the whole mass of a gigantic mountain, 8000 or 9000
                    feet high; and, whether (for this is extremely doubtful) the event took place
                    within historic times or not, the vast deposits of porous tuff in all the
                    surrounding country appear to show that such a volcano must have existed. The
                    water in the lake is now sweet, but tradition again asserts that it was at one
                    time salt, possibly through direct communication with the sea. As it is exposed
                    to strong evaporation and discharges into the sea by the Pansipit without being
                    recruited by any considerable affluent, it is probably fed by subterranean
                    sources. To the east of Lake Bombon stands the extinct volcano of Maquiling, at
                    whose foot are the hot springs of Los Banos; and about 15 miles farther east is
                    Majaijai (7020 feet), of which the last eruption was in 1730. Away in the
                    south-east of Luzon there is quite a series of high volcanic cones,—Isarog,
                    Iriga, Mazaraga, and Albay or Mayon. The last, one of the most active volcanoes
                    in the archipelago, is extremely regular in form, rising gradually from a base
                    about 50 miles in circuit. The first partial ascent was made by Esteban Solis in
                    1592, and the first complete ascent by Paton and Stewart, two young Scotchmen,
                    in 1858. A terrible eruption on 1st February 1814 partially destroyed Camalig,
                    Budiao, Albay, Guinobatan, and Daraga, and proved fatal to 12,000 persons, the
                    matter thrown out forming vast deposits deep enough in some places near the
                    mountain to bury the loftiest trees. A similar fate befell the same district
                    during the eruptions that occurred between 20th July and 24th October 1867. On
                    31st October 1876 one of the terrible storms for which the Philippines are
                    notorious burst on the mountain; the floods, pouring down the sides of Mayon and
                    sweeping along with them the loose volcanic débris, brought destruction on
                    Manilao, Camalig, Guinobatan, Ligao, Oas, Polangin, Libon, and other places,
                    filling up the roads, breaking down the bridges, and completely ruining upwards
                    of 6000 houses. During 1881 and 1882 the eruptive forces were again exceedingly
                    active. Still farther to the south, in the very extremity of Luzon, stands the
                    volcano of Bulusan, which, after being for a long time apparently extinct, began
                    again to smoke in 1852. According to Jagor <hi rend="italic">{Reisen,</hi> p.
                    66), it repeats in striking fashion the forms of Vesuvius, having two peaks,—in
                    the west a bell-shaped dome, the eruption cone, and in the east a high ridge
                    similar to Monte Somma, probably the remains of a great circular crater. As in
                    Vesuvius, the present crater is in the centre of the extinct one. In the island
                    of Negros, 150 miles south-south-west of Bulusan, there is the volcano of
                    Malaspina or Canlaon (8190 feet); the island of Fuego probably takes its name
                    from its volcanic phenomenon; and about 90 miles farther to the south-east a new
                    volcano burst out in 1876 in the island of Camiguin (not to be confounded, as it
                    sometimes is, with Camiguin off the north coast of Luzon), near the village of
                    Catarman. In the great island of Mindanao we have the three volcanoes of
                    Macaturing<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It was
                    supposed till quite recently that there were two mountains in this district,—one
                    being Macaturing, the other Sugut, Polloc, or Cottabató.</p></note> (Sugut,
                    Polloc, or Cottabató), inland from Iliana Bay, and Apo and Sanguil (Sarangani or
                    Butulan), both in the central cordillera and the latter almost at its southern
                    terminus. Though the last great eruption of Cottabató was in 1856, it is still
                    active at intervals, and in 1871 the town of the same name was partially
                    destroyed by earthquakes. Apo, according to Schadenberg and Koch, has three
                    summits, in the midst of which lies the great crater, now extinct and filled
                    with water. Considerable energy is still displayed by the solfataras and boiling
                    springs lower down.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to say how these various volcanoes are related to each other;
                    José Centeno suggests with considerable probability that they form two lines of
                    activity, an eastern comprising Isarog, Albay, Bulusan, Camiguin, Apo, and
                    Butulan, and a western Buguias (extinct), Arayat (extinct), Taal, Canlaon,
                    Macaturing. Three only of the larger islands, it will be observed, contain
                    actual centres of eruption, and some of the larger volcanoes appear to be in the
                    later stages of their activity,—Albay generally discharging an incoherent form
                    of lava, whilst Taal and others discharge nothing but ashes. Other phenomena
                    usually associated with volcanic activity are common enough throughout the
                    archipelago: there is a great deposit of sulphur in the middle of the island of
                    Leyte; inflammable gas bursts out in the south of Panay; and there are hot
                    springs at Buguias, at Los Baños or Maynit, already mentioned, at Pagsanghan, at
                    San Luis or Maynit in Batangas, in the Taysan Mountains, at Tibi or Tivi,
                    &amp;c. At Los Baños there was a regular bathing establishment erected by the
                    Franciscans in 1671; but it was burned down in 1727, and, though rebuilt by
                    public subscription in 1880, may be said to be in a chronic state of decay. The
                    Tibi springs, described in detail by Jagor <hi rend="italic">(fieisen,</hi> pp.
                    114, 115), are remarkable for beautiful cones produced by the deposit of
                    siliceous material. The water in some cases is hot enough to cook food. They are
                    situated on the east coast of Luzon on Lagonoy Bay.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Earthquakes.—</hi> Earthquakes are sufficiently frequent and
                    violent in the Philippines to affect the style adopted in the erection of
                    buildings; in 1874, for instance, they were very numerous throughout the
                    archipelago, and in Manila ancl the adjacent provinces shocks were felt daily
                    for several weeks. The most violent earthquakes on record in the Philippines
                    occurred in July 1880, when the destruction of property was immense, both in the
                    capital and in other important towns of central Luzon.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> Though hitherto little advantage has been taken
                    of its existence, there appears to be in several of the islands a fair amount of
                    mineral wealth. Two coal-fields are known to exist, one beginning in Caransan in
                    the south of Luzon, and probably extending southwards across the Strait of San
                    Bernardino to Catbalongan in Samar, and another occupying the western slopes of
                    Cebu and the eastern slopes of Negros, and thus probably passing under the
                    Strait of Tañon. In the first basin there is a bed from 10 to 20 feet thick
                    cropping out at Gatbo, which has given good results as a fuel for steamboats; in
                    the second Centeno reports at least five beds of varying thickness and quality.
                    The first discovery of the mineral was made in Cebu in 1827. Hitherto little
                    success has attended the schemes of e⅜ploitation. Iron-ore of excellent purity
                    occurs in various parts of Luzon, in Laguna, Bulacan, Pampanga, Camarines Norte,
                    and notably in the Camachin Mountains between the Bulaon and the Garlan; but,
                    with the exception of a few small foundries in Bulacan province, there are no
                    iron-works in the country. In this department there was actually more activity a
                    century ago. Copper-mines are worked at Mancayan, Suyuc, Bumucum, and Agbao in
                    the province of Lepanto, by the Cantabro-Philippine Company, founded in 1862;
                    and the heathen natives of that region (perhaps having learned the art from
                    Chinese or Japanese strangers) appear to have long been accustomed to
                    manufacture copper utensils for their own use and for sale in the Christian
                    settlements. The ore at Mancayan contains upwards of 16 per cent, of copper, 24
                    of sulphur, 5 of antimony, and 5 of arsenic. For a short time after 1847
                    copper-mines were worked <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0785-0750"/> at Assit in the island of Masbate; and it is
                    known that copper ores exist in the provinces of Tayabas and Camarines Sur
                    (Luzon), Antique (Panay), and the island of Capu1. Gold is very generally
                    distributed throughout the archipelago, but mostly in insignificant quantities.
                    From the deposits in Camarines Norte (in Paracale, Mambulao, Labo), where it
                    occurs in placers and in quartz and other rocks, about 30 oz. per month are
                    obtained. Much more important are the gold-washings of Misamis and Surigao in
                    Mindanao, the former of which yield about 150 oz. per month. Neither the mercury
                    nor lead veins discovered at different times have proved of economic value.<note

                    north part of Luzon is as far from the south of the Sulu Islands as the north of
                    England from the south of Italy, and as the archipelago is divided by the line
                    of the ecliptic, the climate of one region differs considerably from that of
                    another, though the general characteristics are everywhere tropical. The
                    northern islands lie in the region of the typhoons. Three seasons are usually
                    recognized,—a cold, a hot, and a wet. The first extends from November to
                    February or March; the winds are northerly, and, though there is no need for
                    fire, woollen garments can be worn with comfort in the mornings; the sky is for
                    the most part clear and the atmosphere bracing; and Europeans look forward to
                    this period as the most enjoyable of the year. The hot season lasts from March
                    to June, and the heat becomes very oppressive before the beginning of the
                    southerly monsoon. Thunderstorms, often of terrific violence, are of frequent
                    occurrence in May and June. The wet season is usually ushered in by the heavy
                    rains locally known as “collas.” During July, August, September, and October the
                    rain comes down in torrents and large tracts of the lower country are flooded.
                    According to the observations of the Jesuits at Manila during the eight years
                    1870 to 1877 the total rainfall (distributed over 113 days! amounted to 66'6

                <p><hi rend="italic">Fauna.—</hi> The mammals of the Philippines are strikingly few,
                    especially when contrasted with those of such an island as Java; but their
                    number may yet be slightly increased, and nine-tenths of them are peculiar
                    species. Since <hi rend="italic">Cynopithecus niger</hi> was struck out of the
                    list, the only monkey known to science is <hi rend="italic">Macacus
                    cynomolgus</hi> (chongo of the Tagals), found in all the islands; but there are
                    also pure white monkeys (not albinos) in Mindanao, and specimens are
                    occasionally sold at Manila. The lemuroids are represented by the strange little
                    <hi rend="italic">Tarsius spectrum,</hi> the insectivore proper by <hi
                    rend="italic">Galeopithecus philippeηsis</hi> and a “tupaia,” or squirrel-shrew.
                    Of carnivora there are three species, two civets and a wild cat, as well as the
                    ordinary domestic animal. The rodents comprise only a few squirrels, <hi
                    rend="italic">Sciurus Philippensis,</hi> &lt;fcc., a porcupine, and two or three
                    rats. Of bats there are between twenty and thirty species. The wild boar is
                    regularly hunted in all the islands; the natives throughout the archipelago keep
                    large numbers of black pigs; and the Babuyanes group take their name from <hi
                    rend="italic">babuy,</hi> “a pig.” Of deer there are three species, <hi
                    rend="italic">Cervus</hi><hi rend="italic">mariannus, C. philippensis,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">C. Alfredi∙,</hi> and a chevrotain or mousedeer <hi
                    rend="italic">(Tragulus)</hi> is found, more especially in Bataan. Tapa, or
                    sun-dried deer’s flesh, is a favourite food with the natives. The statement that
                    the horse has become wild in the interior of several islands is founded on a
                    mistake. The ordinary domestic variety, probably of Spanish, Chinese, and
                    Japanese origin, is “generally small, but well-shaped and hardy, the largest and
                    best breeds coming from Batangas, Albay, and Camarines, the smallest and
                    probably the hardiest from Ilocos” (D. Μ. Forbes). For all kinds of field work
                    the buffalo (“carabao ”) is employed; ordinary cattle and goats are common
                    enough, and some of the former are of great excellence. As there is a Tagalog
                    name for it, it has been supposed that the elephant was at one time to be met
                    with in the Philippines; and in the Sulu Islands, at least, it is said to have
                    existed in the 17 th century.</p>
                <p>The birds of the Philippines proper show the isolated character of the group by
                    the absence of a large number of ordinary Malayan forms, and at the same time
                    there is a considerable proportion of genera from Australia, India, and China.

                    the known species numbered 219, and R. B. Sharpe, by the assistance of Professor
                    Steere’s collections, brought the total up to 287 species, of which 151 were
                    peculiar to the Philippines. To these must be added several species hitherto
                    only found in the Sulu Islands. Palawan has a strong Bornean element. It is
                    enough here to mention a number of peculiar woodpeckers, beautiful little

                    known from its note as “calao” to the natives, who frequently tame it. The

                    various kinds of lizards are familiar enough forms; one of the last, the
                    “chacon,” is believed by the natives to be a defence against earthquakes. The
                    beauty and variety of the butterflies and the destructiveness of the termites
                    are obtrusive features of the insect life; the land-shells are peculiar,
                    numerous, and remarkable for delicacy of form and colour. Some of the molluscs
                    attain gigantic dimensions; the “taclobo” shell sometimes weighs 200 tt&gt;, and
                    is used for baptismal fonts. One of the most valuable kinds of fish is the

                    medlars, and in general most of the Malayan fruits are to be met with; the
                    lanzon occurs in the north, and the durian in the south, more especially in the
                    Sulu Islands. Rice is the staple food of the natives, but, though it is
                    extensively cultivated, the supply is not always equal to the demand. Sweet
                    potatoes (camote), a kind of yam (palawan), the ground-nut, and gourds are
                    pretty generally grown, as well as occasionally peas, potatoes, and in the
                    higher regions even wheat. The plants which are of primary commercial importance
                    are tobacco, Manila-hemp, sugar-cane, coffee, and cocoa.</p>
                <p>Tobacco was made a Government monopoly by Captain General José Basco y Vargas in
                    1781, and remained so till 1st July 1882. Though it was free to any one to grow
                    the plant to any extent he pleased, the Government was the only purchaser, fixed
                    its own price, and, paying its debts according to its own convenience, was
                    sometimes three or four years in arrear. Besides, certain districts were bound
                    to furnish a certain quantity of the leaf, and the peasant was thus often forced
                    under severe penalties to devote himself to the tobacco crop when he would have
                    obtained better results from something else. The best tobacco comes from the
                    provinces of Isabela and Cagayan, and it is there that the cultivation is most
                    systematically carried on; but the plant is also grown in other provinces of
                    Luzon (Union, Ilocos, Lepanto, &amp;c.) as well as in the Visayas Islands. The
                    average production in the ten years 1872-81 was 214,400 quintals (each 101 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 43 English ft), of which 114,400 were from Isabela
                    and Cagayan. About 25,000 quintals were sent to Spain as tribute, and another
                    portion was sold by public auction for foreign export. For tobacco of the first
                    class from Cagayan and Isabela the Government paid in recent years between 13
                    and 14 dollars per quintal, for the second class between 10 and 11, for the
                    third between 7 and 8, and for the fourth between 6 and 7. About 280 million
                    cigars were manufactured annually in six factories employing 20,000 hands, 95
                    millions for foreign export and the rest for home consumption. Of the foreign
                    cigars 50 millions went to Singapore, Java, the Moluccas, and India, 30 millions
                    to China and Japan, 4 millions to Australia, and 11 millions to Europe. Hitherto
                    tobacco-planting has been carried on (with few exceptions) only by people of
                    small means; but since the abolition of the monopoly several companies have been
                    started, and the whole condition of the industry will probably soon be greatly
                    modified. Abacá or <hi rend="smallcaps">Manila-hemp</hi> ⅛. r.) is best grown in
                    the south-east of Luzon, in Samar, Leyte, and Bohol. Its cultivation requires
                    little trouble, and the plantations, usually small, are each the property of a
                    native family. Hand-labour and a few simple machines of native construction are
                    all that is required in the preparation of the fibre. The abacá districts are
                    generally very poor. Coffee was introduced, probably from Brazil, in the latter
                    part of the 18th century, but the first plantation on a large scale was formed
                    only in 1826. The cultivation is now pretty extensive. Philippine coffee appears
                    in the European markets as Manila or Zamboanga coffee. The former, which comes
                    from Batangas, Cavite, and Laguna to the amount of 70,000 piculs (a Spanish
                    picul = 140 lb) per annum, is a small but well-flavoured berry; the latter,
                    principally grown in Mindanao and Sulu, which send a good deal of their produce
                    direct to Singapore, is in less repute, because, while the berry is larger, less
                    care is bestowed on the gathering and sorting. France was at one time the only
                    great purchaser of Philippine coffee, but about two-thirds of the crop now finds
                    its way to Spain, England, the Netherlands, and Austria. In general far too
                    little care is given to the plantations. Sugar is extensively cultivated, and
                    the export has increased from 1,399,434 piculs in 1871 to 3,382,664 in 1881.
                    About a third of the whole is produced by Pampanga; and Cavite, Laguna,
                    Pangasinan, Bulucan, and Bataan also contribute. About 1,200,000 piculs are
                    exported from Iloilo, which collects from Panay and Negros, &amp;c. The finest
                    is probably that from Capiz in Panay, where, as in this southern district
                    generally, the violet-coloured cane is grown. Most of the larger plantations
                    (some exceeding 1000 acres) are monastic property, and are leased out to Chinese
                    half-breeds, who are said to succeed better than Europeans. The smaller are
                    cultivated by the proprietors with the assistance of their families and
                    relatives, and less frequently of bond or hired labourers. A tendency has shown
                    itself since 1870 to create larger estates, and to import better machinery; but
                    it will be some time before the Philippine sugar-crop is generally treated
                    according to scientific methods. The finest Manila quality is sent to Spain, and
                    the secondary qualities to England; for the Iloilo sugars the United States are
                    the principal destination.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trade.—</hi> Before the conquest there was considerable
                    commercial intercourse between the Philippines and China and Japan, but this,
                    which would naturally have developed enormously if the Spanish trade between
                    Manila and America (Navidad and Acapulco) had been left free, was interrupted,
                    and at times almost completely stopped, by a series of absurd restrictions,
                    devised in the supposed interest of the trade between Spain and America. For a
                    long period only a single galleon, under Government supervision, was allowed to
                    proceed yearly from Manila to Acapulco, the value of the cargo each way being
                    bound not to exceed a certain sum. Direct trade with Europe <hi rend="italic"
                    >via</hi> the Cape was commenced in 1764; but, as if the exclusion of all except
                    Spanish ships was not sufficient, a practical monopoly of this field of
                    enterprise was in 1785 bestowed on the Royal Company of the Philippines. With
                    the close of the 18th century a certain amount of liberty began to be conceded
                    to foreign vessels; the first English commercial house was established at Manila
                    in 1809; and in 1834 the monopoly of the Royal Company expired. Manila remained
                    the only port for foreign trade till 1842, when Cebu was also opened; Zamboanga
                    (Mindanao), Iloilo (Panay), Sual (Luzon), Legazpi or Albay (Luzon), and Tacloban
                    (Leyte) are now in the same category, but only Manila, Iloilo, and Cebu have
                    proved of real importance, as they are the only ports where foreign-bound
                    vessels have hitherto loaded. The following table shows how rapidly the trade of
                    the country has recently developed.</p>

                    is San José de Ibana in the island of Batan. Camiguin, the southernmost of the
                    Babuyanes, is about 30 miles from the coast of Luzon.</p>

                    40,885 square miles, is the largest island in the whole archipelago, and as the
                    seat of the Government at Manila it is the most important. The northern trunk,
                    so to speak, extends north and south for 340 miles. From the mountains known as
                    Caraballos of Balar or Nueva Ecija two ranges bifurcate and stretch
                    northward—the Sierra Oriental, skirting the eastern coast till it ends at Cape
                    Engaño, and the Sierra Occidental, keeping all the way at a distance of 25 or 30
                    miles from the western. Between these ranges lies the basin of the Rio Grande de
                    Cagayan, which with its numerous affluents (Bangag, Nayon, Mayat, Pongul,
                    Ibulao, &amp;c., from the east; Calao, Cabagan, Pinacananauang, and Tulay from
                    the west) forms the largest riversystem in the whole archipelago. On the western
                    slopes of the Sierra Occidental rise two other large τivers—the Abra, which
                    reaches the sea at Vigan or Villa Fernandina, and the Agno, which after a
                    winding course falls into the Gulf of Lingayan. To the south-west of the
                    mountains extends a comparatively flat region, which continues southwards to the
                    Bay of Manila and forms one of the richest agricultural districts in the island.
                    It is watered by the lower part of the Agno and its lower tributaries, and the
                    Rio Grande de Pampanga with its affluents, which ultimately discharges into
                    Manila Bay, and thus forms a convenient water-way for conveying produce to the
                    capital. There are also in these lowlands a number of extensive lagoons, such as
                    that of Candava. To the west of the flat region the country rises into the
                    considerable Cordillera de Zambales, which contains a number of peaks 5000 or
                    6000 feet high, and terminates northwards in a great peninsula forming the Gulf
                    of Lingayan and southwards in a similar promontory (Sierra de Mariveles) which
                    helps to form the Bay of Manila. To the east and south of this bay the general
                    configuration is again hilly and even mountainous; but the large area of 350
                    square miles is occupied by the Laguna de Bay, connected with Manila by the
                    Pasig, on which small steamers ply. The depth of this basin, though the southern
                    side is bordered by a semicircular range of extinct volcanoes 6000 or 7000 feet
                    high, seldom exceeds 4 fathoms. Two long capes project from the northern side,
                    the western one being continued by the island of Talim. From the south-east
                    corner of the trunk of Luzon there extends for 180 miles a very irregular
                    peninsula formed by a series of cordilleras running in a northwesterly and
                    south-easterly direction. The following are the provinces and districts into

                    The narrow but extremely beautiful Strait of S. Juanico separates Samar from the
                    island of Leyte. The lesser islands of Buat, Parasan, &amp;c., are included in
                    the province of Samar (178,890 inhabitants). <hi rend="italic">Leyte</hi> (2716
                    square miles) is 100 miles long and 30 miles wide. The chief town and port,
                    Tacloban, lies at the eastern entrance of the Strait of S. Juanico. Sulphur for
                    the Manila powder-factory is obtained from the solfatara at Monte Manacagan.
                    According to Jagor, the east coast is rising and the west is suffering from the
                    encroachments of the sea at Ormoc to the extent of fifty yards in six years.
                    South-west of Leyte is <hi rend="italic">Bohol</hi> (area, 1496 square miles);
                    the chief town is Tagbilaran, at the south-west corner. The province (226,546
                    inhabitants) comprises Siquijor and other islands. The important island of <hi
                    rend="italic">Cebu</hi> (2413 square miles; provincial population, 403,405) is
                    135 miles long from north to south, but only 30 miles broad at the most. The
                    chief town, Cebu, is the capital of the Visayas group and is next to Iloilo in
                    the matter of commerce. It is only along the coast that cultivation is easy, and
                    none of the villages lie far inland. Parallel with Cebu and separated from it by
                    a strait 15 miles wide, is <hi rend="italic">Negros</hi> (4670 square miles;
                    population, 204,669), with large sugar plantations, but only one large town,
                    Jimamaylan, and no good ports. Bacolod is the administrative centre. North-west
                    of Negros lies <hi rend="italic">Paìiay</hi> (4633 square miles), which is
                    divided into the three provinces of Antique (124,103), Iloilo (410,430), and
                    Capiz (243,244), in accordance with its physical conformation. Iloilo is the
                    chief town and the seat of the see of Jaro. Off the south-east coast of Panay
                    lies the island of Guimaras (215 square miles).</p>
                <p>In a line with the peninsula of Tayabas (Luzon) and the island of Leyte is <hi

                    and thinly peopled (17,170), are united together. West of these islands is a
                    considerable cluster, I. de Tablas (327 square miles), Sibuyan (159 square
                    miles), Romblon, &amp;c., constituting the province of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bornblon</hi> (28,154). <hi rend="italic">Mindoro</hi> (3934 square miles), one
                    of the largest of the Philippines, lies only 10 miles south of Luzon, but its
                    interior, peopled by about 30,000 Manguianes, a race of doubtful affinity, is
                    practically unexplored, and its eighteen “Spanish” villages are scattered along
                    the coast at great distances from each other and with no proper means of
                    communication. The principal settlement is Calapan, on the north-east coast.
                    Marinduque (348 square miles), included in the province of Mindoro (58,128), is
                    a flourishing island with 48,000 inhabitants exporting various staples.
                    South-west of Mindoro are the <hi rend="italic">Calamianes</hi> (17,041
                    inhabitants), a great cluster of very small islands, the two largest being
                    Busuanga (416 square miles) and Calamian; and beyond these extends for 230 miles
                    in a southwesterly direction the island <hi rend="italic">Palawan</hi> or
                    Paragua (4576 square miles), which nowhere exceeds a width of 30 miles and
                    sometimes narrows to 10. It is little visited, and apart from Puerto Princesa,
                    the chief town (578 inhabitants), there are few Spanish posts. The <hi

                    Tawi-Tawi, Tagbabas, and Pangutarang groups. Many of the smaller islands are
                    uninhabited, but the larger are occupied by an industrious Mohammedan
                    population. They formerly constituted, along with a portion of northern Borneo,
                    an independent state with an ]∣ereditary sultan and a regular nobility of great
                    political influence. The highest hill in the principal island, Buat Timantangis,
                    or Hill of Tears, is so called because it is the last point visible to the
                    natives as they sail away from their native land. Sulu, the present capital,

                    It is remarkably mountainous, and appears to be divided by the Rangaya or Sugut
                    Cordillera, which runs northwest and south-east, and is continued throughout the
                    great western peninsula of Zamboanga, and, at the other extremity, bends south
                    to form the peninsula of Butulan. Between the Rangaya range and that of the
                    Tiruray lies the valley of the Rio Grande, a river navigable as far as
                    Matingcahuan (70 or 80 miles) and connected with two great lakes, Lingauasan and
                    Buluan, which during the rainy season merge, or nearly merge, into one. On the
                    north side of the Rangaya range and connected with the sea by the river Iligan
                    is the great crater-lake of Lanao, which with its little group of secondary
                    crater-lakes probably gave rise to the name of the island, Maguindanao, “Land of
                    Lakes.” Towards the east and sloping northwards extend the valleys of the
                    Cagayan, the Tagoloan, and the Agusan. This last is the largest river in the
                    whole island. Rising in the Kinabuhan Mountains in the south-east, it pursues a
                    very sinuous course for more than 200 miles and falls into Butuan Bay; in the
                    lower regions it is navigable for craft of considerable burden. Mindanao is
                    throughout well peopled, much of it being occupied by independent Mohammedan
                    sultanates.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration, Ac.—</hi> The Philippines are subject to a
                    governorgeneral with supreme powers, assisted by (1) a “junta of authorities”
                    instituted in 1850, and consisting of the archbishop, the commander of the
                    forces, the admiral, the president of the supreme court, &amp;c.; (2) a central
                    junta of agriculture, industry, and commerce (dating from 1866); and (3) a
                    council of administration. In the provinces and districts the chief power is in
                    the hands of alcaldes mayores and civico-military governors. The chief
                    magistrate of a commune is known as the gobernadorcillo or capitan; the native
                    who is responsible for the collection of the tribute of a certain group of
                    families is the cabeça de barangay. Every Indian between the ages of 16 and 60
                    subject to Spain has to pay tribute to the amount of $1-17—descendants of the
                    first Christians of Cebu, new converts, gobernadorcillos, &amp;c., being
                    exempted. Chinese are subject to special taxes; and by a law of 1883 Europeans
                    and Spanish half-castes are required to pay a poll-tax of $2'50.</p>
                <p>Ecclesiastically the Philippines comprise the archbishopric of Manila and the
                    suffragan bishoprics of Nueva-Caceres, Nueva-Segovia, Cebu, and Santa Isabel de
                    Jaro, which were all constituted by the bull of Clement VIII., 14th August 1595,
                    with the exception of the last, whose separation from Cebu dates only from the
                    bull of Pius IX., 27th May 1865. The Agustinos Calzados were established in the
                    Philippines in the year 1565, the first prelate being Andres Urdaneta, and they
                    have convents in Manila, Cebu, and Guadalupe. The Franciscans date from 1577,
                    and have convents at Manila and San Francisco del Monte; the Dominicans (1587)
                    at Manila and San Juan del Monte; the Recollects or Strict Franciscans (1606) at
                    Manila, Cavite, and Cebu. The Jesuits, restored in 1852, maintain the missions
                    of Mindanao and Sulu; and they have charge in Manila of the municipal athenaeum,
                    the normal school for primary teachers, and an excellent meteorological
                    observatory. There are also sisters of charity, and nuns of the royal monastery
                    of Santa Clara, founded in 1621.</p>

                    ecclesiastical control, and all discussion of Spanish or general European

                    sporadically, though in limited numbers (perhaps 25,000), throughout most of the
                    archipelago, the Batancs, Babuyanes, Samar, Leyte, Bohol, and Sulu excepted.
                    Their headquarters are the northern part of Nueva Ecija, the provinces of
                    Principe, Isabela, and Cagayan. To their presence in Isla de Negros the island
                    owed its name. They are dwarfish (4 feet 8 inches being the average stature of
                    the full-grown man), thin and spindle-legged, have a head like a Negro’s, with
                    flattish nose, full lips, and thick frizzled black hair, and possess an
                    extraordinary ρrehensible power in their toes. They tattoo themselves, and wear
                    very little clothing. Cigars they often smoke with the burning end between the
                    teeth — a practice occasionally observed among the civilized Indians. They have
                    no fixed abodes. Honey, game, fish, wild fruits, palm-cabbages, and roots of
                    arums, &amp;c., constitute their food; they sell wax to Christians and Chinese
                    in exchange for betel and tobacco. The dog is their only domestic animal.</p>

                    considerable variety of physical appearance now form the parti-coloured but
                    fairly homogeneous population of the islands.</p>
                <p>First among these rank the Tagals. They are by preference inhabitants of the
                    lowlands, and generally fix their pile-built dwellings near water. In Manila,
                    Cavite, Batangas, Bulacan, Morong, Infanta, Tayabas, and Bataan they form the
                    bulk of the population, and they also appear in Zambales, Principe, Isabela,
                    Nueva Ecija, Mindoro, Marinduque, Polillo, &amp;c. Their language (Tagalog)
                    especially has made extensive encroachments on the other Philippine tongues
                    since the conquest. The Tagal is physically well developed, has a round head,
                    high cheek bones, flatfish nose, low brow, thickish lips, and large dark eyes.
                    The lines from the nose to the mouth are usually strongly marked. The power of
                    smell is of extraordinary acuteness. A pair of trousers and a shirt worn outside
                    constitute the dress of the men; that of the women differs by the substitution
                    of the saya or gown for the trousers. Agriculture, and especially the
                    cultivation of rice, is the TagaΓs staple means of living; they are also great
                    fishers and keep swine, cattle, and vast numbers of ducks and fowls. Externally
                    they are mostly Roman Catholics; but abundant traces of their old superstitions
                    may still be observed. Cock-fighting and theatrical entertainments are in great
                    favour with the Tagals; they have quite a passion for playing on musical
                    instruments, and learn to execute European pieces with great success. Before the
                    arrival of the Spaniards they had an alphabet of their own (see Stanley’s
                    translation of Morga), and they still possess a body of lyrical poetry and
                    native melodies. On the death of an adult a feast is sometimes held among the
                    better families, but the funeral itself is conducted after the ordinary Roman
                    Catholic fashion.</p>
                <p>The Visayas inhabit all the islands to the south of Luzon, Masbate, Burias,
                    Ticao, and Mindoro, and to the north of Borneo, Sulu, and Mindanao. In the 15th
                    and 16th centuries they were called “Pintados” (ι.e., painted people) by the
                    Spaniards. Though they had attained a considerable degree of civilization before
                    the conquest, they readily accepted Christianity and assisted in the subjugation
                    of the Tagals. The mountains in the interior of some of the Visaya Islands are
                    occupied by savage Visayas, generally styled Infieles, Montesinos, or
                    Cimarrones. The Calamianes, who inhabit the islands of that name, and the
                    Caragus, who inhabit the east coast of Mindanao from Cape Surigao to Cape St
                    Augustin, are usually classed with the Visayas.</p>
                <p>The Igorrotes or Igolotes proper (for the name is by many writers very loosely
                    applied to all the pagan mountain tribes of Luzon) inhabit the districts of
                    Bangued, Lepanto, Tiagan, Bontoc. From their cranial characteristics they seem
                    to be distinct from the Tagals and other “Malay” tribes, and they are said to
                    show traces of Chinese and even Japanese intermixture. Dirty and savage-like in
                    <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> person, they are none the less industrious
                    agriculturists—laying out their fields on artificial terraces on the mountain
                    sides, ami constructing irrigation canals with remarkable skill; and they also
                    excel as miners and workers in metal. In the matter of sexual morality they form
                    a striking contrast to the licentious Malays; they are monogamists, allow no
                    divorce, and inflict severe punishment for infidelity. Though an attempt to
                    subdue the Igorrotes was made as early as 1660, it was not till 1829 that
                    Spanish supremacy was acknowledged.</p>
                <p>For details in regard to the other tribes of the Philippines—the Ilocanes,
                    Pampangos, Pangasinanes, Ibanags or Cagayans, Tingû-ianes (Itanegas or Tingues),
                    Apayaos, Catalanganes, Vicols, &amp;c.— the reader is referred to Professor
                    Ferd. Blumentritt’s monograph, <hi rend="italic">Versuch einer Ethnographie der
                    Philippinen,</hi> Gotha, 1882. No fewer than thirty languages are officially
                    recognized. In 1865 it was estimated that Visaya was spoken by upwards of
                    2,000,000 persons, Tagalog by 1,300,000, Cebuano by 386,000, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Chinese immigrants, in spite of massacres and administrative restrictions, form a
                    powerful element in the Philippines; in Manila alone they numbered 30,000 in
                    1880, and there is hardly a pueblo of any size in which one or more of them is
                    not to be found. The petty trade and banking are nearly all in their hands.
                    Chinese mestizos or half-breeds (Mestizos de Sanglay, or Mestizos Chinos) are
                    numerous enough to form separate communities; in 1867 they were said to be
                    211,000 strong. The European element has never been numerically important—some
                    8000 or 9000 at the most; but there has grown up a considerable body of European
                    mestizos. Traces of Indian sepoys are still seen in the neighbourhood of Manila,
                    where sepoy regiments were quartered for about eighteen months after the
                    conquest of Manila by the English. Owing partly to Philip II.’s prohibition of
                    slavery the Negro is conspicuous by his absence.</p>
                <p>There are no accurate statistics of the whole population of the Philippines; and
                    even the number of the Spanish subjects was up till 1877 only estimated
                    according to the number of those who paid tribute. Diaz Arenas in 1833 stated
                    the total at 3,153,290, the ecclesiastical census of 1876 at 6,173,632, and the
                    civil census of 1877 at 5,561,232; Moya y Jimenez, founding on certain
                    calculations by Del Pan, and admitting an annual increase of 2 per cent., brings
                    the number up to 10,426,000 in 1882.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The Philippine, or, as he called them, the St
                    Lazarus Islands were discovered by Magellan on 12th March 1521, the first place
                    at which he touched being Jomonjol, now Malhou, an islet in the Strait of
                    Surigao between Samar and Dinagat. By 27th April he had lost his life on the
                    island of Mactan off the coast of Cebu. The surrender of the Moluccas by Charles
                    V. in 1529 tended to lessen the interest of the Spaniards in the Islas de
                    Poniente, as they generally called their new discovery, and the Portuguese were
                    too busy in the southern parts of the Indian Archipelago to trouble about the
                    Islas de Oriente, as they preferred to call them. Villalobos, who sailed from
                    Navidad in Mexico with five ships and 370 men in February 1543, accomplished
                    little (though it was he who suggested the present name of the archipelago by
                    calling Samar Filipina); but in 1565 Legazpi founded the Spanish settlement of
                    San Miguel at the town of Cebu, which afterwards became the Villa de Santisimo
                    Nombre de Jesus, and in 1571 determined in large measure the future lines of
                    conquest by fixing the capital at Manila. It is in a letter of Legazpi’s in 1567
                    that the name Islas Filipinas appears for the first time. The subjugation of the
                    islands, thanks to the exertions of the Roman Catholic missionaries and to the
                    large powers which were placed in their hands by Philip, was effected, not of
                    course without fighting and bloodshed, but without those appalling massacres and
                    depopulations which characterized the conquest of South America. Contests with
                    frontier rebellious tribes, attacks by pirates and reprisals on the part of the
                    Spaniards, combine with volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tornadoes to break
                    the comparative monotony of the subsequent history. Manila was captured by the
                    English under Draper and Cornish in 1762, and ransomed for £1,000,000; but it
                    was restored in 1764.</p>
