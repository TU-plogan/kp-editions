                    province of Perugia (formerly Umbria), lies 1550 feet above the sea on a
                    beautiful and green-clad hill, which affords a magnificent view over a wide
                    sweep of the Apennines and the great Umbrian plain through which the Tiber
                    flows. The railway station at the foot of the ascent, more than a mile from the
                    city-gate, is 48^ miles south-east of Arezzo and 152 miles north of Rome. The
                    walls, which follow a very irregular ground-plan, have a circuit of 8300 yards,
                    and the length from Sant’ Angelo in the north-west to Porta San Costanzo in the
                    south-east is 2500 yards. Of the forty-two towers which could be counted in the
                    14th •century only three or four—the Torre degli Scalzi, &amp;c.— remain; but
                    away from the line of the present enceinte there are several relics of the
                    ancient Etruscan and Roman fortifications, notably the so-called arch of
                    Augustus, a magnificent gateway in the Piazza Grimana, with the ancient
                    inscription <hi rend="smallcaps">Avgvsta Pervsia</hi> on the archivolt and a
                    beautiful Renaissance loggia boldly crowning one of its towers. The Cittadella
                    Paolina—a great fortress erected by Paul III. on a site previously occupied by
                    ten churches, two monasteries, the palaces of the Baglioni, and a number of
                    private houses—was destroyed by the citizens in 1848, and its place has been
                    partly taken by a substantial block of public offices (the museum, &lt;fcc.). In
                    modern Perugia the great centre of interest is the Piazza del Duomo at the north
                    end of the Corso. On one side stands the cathedral of San Lorenzo, a Gothic
                    structure of the 14th and 15th centuries, in the plan of a Latin cross; on the
                    other side is the Palazzo Pubblico, presenting a fine Gothic façade of the first
                    half of the 14th century with the figures of the Perugian griffin and the Guelf
                    lion above the outside stair; and in the centre rises the great marble fountain
                    constructed about 1277 by Bevignate, Frate Alberto (both Perugians), and
                    Boninsegna (a Venetian), and adorned by statues and statuettes sculptured by
                    Niccolò and Giovanni Pisano. The cathedral contains the burialplace of the three
                    popes, Innocent III., Urban IV., and Martin 1V., and a reputed relic of great
                    celebrity in Italy— the Virgin’s wedding-ring; and at the north-west corner, in
                    the Piazza del Papa, is a sitting statue<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    by the people of Perugia in gratitude for the restoration of their civic
                    privileges. On the decoration of the Sala del Cambio or old exchange, contiguous
                    to the Palazzo Pubblico, <hi rend="smallcaps">Perugino</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.vf)</hi> put forth the full force of his genius. Most of the movable
                    paintings for which Perugia is famous have since 1863 been collected in the
                    Pinacoteca Vannucci, established in the same Monte Morcino monastery of the
                    Olivetans which now accommodates the university; besides a considerable number
                    of pieces by Perugino, there are specimens of Pinturicchio, Niccolò Alunno,
                    Bonfigli, &lt;fcc. This centralization has somewhat impaired the interest of
                    several of the churches; but others remain with undiminished -wealth. San
                    Domenico, a Gothic edifice originally designed by Giovanni Pisano, but rebuilt
                    in 1632, contains that artist’s magnificent monument of Pope Benedict XI., and
                    in its east front a beautiful stained-glass window by Bartolommeo da Perugia.
                    San Pietro de’ Casinensi (outside the Porta Romana) is a basilica with a triple
                    nave, founded in the beginning of the 11th century by Vincioli, and remarkable
                    for its conspicuous spire, its granite and marble columns, its walnut stall-work
                    designed by Raphael, and its numerous pictures (by Perugino, Parmigiano,
                    Raphael, &lt;fcc.). The Chiesa Nuova (formerly San Giovanni</p>
                <p>Rotondo) possesses the tombs of Baldassare Ferri, the Perugian musician, and
                    Vermiglioli, the leading Perugian antiquary. The university, which is not one of
                    the “royal universities,” though it dates from 1307 and has faculties of law,
                    science, and medicine, numbers only seventy-nine students (1881-82). Other
                    educational and benevolent institutions are a botanical garden, a meteorological
                    observatory, a commercial library founded in 1582 by Prospero Podiani,<note

                    >Colonia</hi><hi rend="italic">Vibia.</hi> Its recovery from the Goths by
                    Belisarius in 537, its protracted siege and sack by Totila (549), its
                    restoration to the Eastern empire by Narses in 552, and its long occupation by
                    the Lombards are the main points in the history of Perugia previous to the 9th
                    century. At that time, with the consent of Charles the Great and Louis the
                    Pious, it passed under the supremacy of the popes; but for many centuries the
                    papal authority existed rather in name than in reality, and the city continued
                    to maintain an independent and enterprising life, warring against its enemies
                    and subduing many of the neighbouring lands and cities,—Foligno, Assisi,
                    Spoleto, Montepulciano, &amp;c. It remained true for the most part to the
                    Guelfs. On various occasions the popes found a personal asylum within its walls,
                    and it was the meeting - place of the conclaves which elected Honorius II.
                    (1124), Honorius IV. (1285.), Celestine V. (1294), and Clement V. (1305). But
                    Perugia had no mind simply to subserve the papal interests. At the time of
                    Rienzi’s unfortunate enterprise it sent ten ambassadors to pay him honour; and,
                    when papal legates sought to coerce it by foreign soldiery, or to exact
                    contributions, they met with vigorous resistance. In the 15th century the real
                    power, after passing from despot to despot, was at last concentrated in the
                    Baglioni family, who, though they had no legal position as rulers or
                    magistrates, defied all other authority, and filled the streets of the city with
                    their broils and butcheries. Gian Paolo Baglioni was lured to Rome in 1520, and
                    beheaded by Leo X.; and in 1534 Rodolfo, who had slain a papal legate, was
                    defeated by Pier Luigi Farnese, and the city, captured and plundered by his
                    soldiery, was deprived of its privileges and given over to the “worse tyranny of
                    priests and bastards.” In 1797 Perugia was occupied by the French; in 1832,
                    1838, and 1854 it was visited by earthquakes; in May 1849 it was seized by the
                    Austrians; and, after a futile insurrection in 1859, it was finally united,
                    along with the delegation, to Piedmont in 1860.</p>
