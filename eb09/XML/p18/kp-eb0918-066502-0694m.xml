                    almost in the centre of the country between 56° 4' and 56° 57' N. lat., and
                    between 3° 4' and 4° 50' W. long. The larger part of its border-line is formed
                    of natural boundaries, the Grampians separating it on the west and north from
                    Argyll, Inverness, and Aberdeen, while the Ochils and the Firth of Tay in the
                    south-east divide it from Kinross, Clackmannan, and Fife. In the south the river
                    Forth forms a large portion of the boundary with Stirling, but the boundary with
                    Forfar in the north-east is almost at no point defined either by rivers or
                    mountains. The county is of an irregular circular form, the diameter being about
                    70 miles. A small portion in the south-east is separated from the main portion
                    at the junction of Clackmannan and Fife, and another small portion is surrounded
                    by Stirlingshire. Perthshire is the fourth largest county in Scotland, the total
                    area being 1,617,808 acres, or 2528 square miles. Situated on the Highland
                    border, Perthshire embraces characteristics scarcely combined in any other
                    county of Scotland, and it excels them all in the picturesqueness and multiform
                    variety of its scenery. The finest passes into the Highlands are Killiecrankie,
                    Leny, and the Trosachs. With hardly any exception the rivers and streams flow
                    east and south and reach the ocean either by the Forth or the Tay. They
                    generally issue from large elongated lochs formed by depressions at the foot of
                    the mountains. The Ericht in the extreme north-west unites Loch Ericht and Loch
                    Rannoch; and from the latter flows the Tummel, which, after passing through Loch
                    Tummel and forming a series of rapids and falls, joins the Tay. The Tay, which
                    rises on the borders of Argyllshire, passes through Loch Dochart and Loch Tay,
                    and in its course <pb break="no"

                    whole drainage of the county, discharging a larger volume of water to the sea
                    than any other river in Great Britain; its principal tributaries are the Tummel
                    at Logierait, the Bran near Dunkeld, the Isla near Kinclaven (after its junction
                    with the Ericht), the Almond near Perth, and the Earn from Loch Earn, at the
                    borders of Fifeshire. The Forth from Loch Ard skirts the southern boundary of
                    the county, and receives the Tei th from Lochs Katrine, Achray, Vennacher, Voil,
                    and L∏bnaig, the Goodie Water from Loch Menteith, and the Allan, which rises in
                    the Ochil Hills. Loch Ericht, partly in Inverness-shire, and Loch Tay are each
                    more than 14 miles in length, Loch Rannoch is 9 miles long, Lochs Earn and
                    Katrine are 7 each, and Lochs Vennacher, Lubnaig, and Voil each between 5 and 3.
                    There are an immense number of small lochs varying in length from 1 to 3 miles,
                    among which may be mentioned Garry, Tummel, Lows, Lyon, Dochart, Freuchie, Ard,
                    and Menteith. The lochs and rivers abound in salmon and varieties of trout; and
                    scarcely any of the streams have been perceptibly injured by the pollution of
                    manufactures. About four-fifths of the surface of the county, chiefly in the
                    west and north-west, is occupied by the Grampians, or encroached on by their
                    ridges or by isolated summits, among the highest of the chain in Perthshire
                    being Ben Lawers (3984 feet), north of Loch Tay; Ben More (3843) and Stobinnain
                    (3821), south of Loch Dochart; Ben-y-Gloe (3690), and other peaks, near Glen
                    Tilt; Schiehallion (3547), south of Loch Rannoch; and Ben Voirlich (3180), south
                    of Loch Earn. The Ochils, occupying a considerable area in the south-east,
                    attain in many cases a height of over 2000 feet, and the Sidlaws, practically a
                    continuation of the Ochils running into Forfarshire, reach a height of about
                    1500 feet. The lowland districts consist chiefly of the straths and
                    river-valleys, as Strathtay; Strathmore, extending into Forfarshire; St rath
                    earn, stretching across the county from west to east, and bounded on the south
                    by the Ochils; the district of Menteith between the Teith and the Forth; and the
                    Carse of Gowrie between the Sidlaws and the Firth of Tay.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology and Minerals.—</hi> As regards its geology Perthshire
                    consists of two distinct areas, that differ from each other entirely in the
                    rocks of which they are composed and consequently in their scenery. The larger
                    of these regions comprises the mountainous ground and occupies the northern and
                    by much the larger part of the county. The rocks in this region belong to the
                    series of crystalline schists, and include varieties of gneiss, mica-schist,
                    clay-slate, hornblende-rock, &amp;c., with important bands of quartzite,
                    quartz-schist, and limestone. These rocks are arranged in approximately parallel
                    folds, the axes of which range in a general sense from south-west to northeast,
                    the same groups of strata being repeated again and again by successive
                    plications. The quartzites from their durability and whiteness form specially
                    marked zones across the county, as in the ranges of Schiehallion and Ben-y-Gloe.
                    The limestones also from their persistence afford excellent horizons for
                    interpreting the geological structure. A notable band of them runs along the
                    valley of Loch Tay, plunging under Ben Lawers and rising up again in Glen Lyon,
                    whence it continues across Strath Tummel into Glen Tilt. These various
                    crystalline rocks are believed to be prolongations of the schistose series that
                    overlies the Lower Silurian rocks of Sutherland; but they have not yet yielded
                    fossils. They are here and there pierced by masses of granite, porphyry, or
                    other eruptive rocks.</p>
                <p>The southern (or more correctly south-eastern) limit of the mountain ground is
                    defined by a line drawn from the foot of Loch Lomond by Aberfoyle, Pass of Leny,
                    Comrie, a little belθλv Dunkeld, and Bridge of Cally, to Lintrathen. On the
                    southern side of this line the ground presents distinctively lowland scenery. It
                    is occupied by the Lower Old Sandstone with its included conglomerates,
                    flagstones, and volcanic rocks. A remarkable dislocation, which nearly coincides
                    with the line just traced, separates the younger series of formations from the
                    older rocks of the mountains. But here and there on the north side of the
                    fracture, in bay-like hollows of the hills, the massive conglomerates of the Old
                    Red Sandstone can be seen resting upon the upturned edges of the schists. These
                    conglomerates with their associated strata appear to have been laid down in a
                    large lake or inland sea which lay across central Scotland and northern Ireland,
                    and was tenanted by the peculiar Old Red Sandstone fishes <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cephalaspis,</hi> àc.). A long line of active volcanoes extended through this
                    lake. Their sites are still traceable in the Ochil and Sidlaw Hills. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Geology,</hi> vol. x. p. 343 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> Much of
                    the lower ground is covered with the clays, gravels, and sands left by the
                    icesheets and glaciers that once occupied the surface. Raised beaches marking
                    recent upheaval of the land are seen in the Firth of Tay. The larger rivers
                    present a succession of three or more alluvial terraces. Copper ore is found in
                    the southern Ochils and coal at their base. Ironstone is wrought at Culross.
                    Lead and other metals are found sparingly in the neighbourhood of Tyndrum, Ben
                    Ledi, and Glen Lyon. Roofing slates are quarried at Birnam. In many valleys
                    there are large deposits of peat.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> The climate and soil of Perthshire present
                    greater varieties than in any other county of Scotland. In the higher western
                    regions it is very moist; and long stretches of exposed uplands alternate with
                    finely-sheltered valleys. The arable land is chiefly in the drier eastern
                    districts. For the most part the soil is sharp and fertile. The county,
                    agriculturally, may be classed in four divisions: deer-forests, chiefly the
                    wilder mountain districts; grazing and pasture lands on the hills, embracing
                    about four-fifths of the total area; light soils in the lower undulating
                    districts, including the north portion of Menteith and the upper portion of the
                    principal river-valleys, specially suited for oats, barley, turnips, and
                    potatoes; clay and carse land, chiefly in the Carse of Gowrie, which extends to
                    about 100,000 acres, in the Carse of Stirling north of the Forth and in the
                    lower part of Strathearn below and above Bridge of Earn. The Carse of Gowrie has
                    as its basis the boulder clay, above which rests the blue clay proper, or peat,
                    or the carse clay,—a mixture of sand and clay, ranging from the finest clay soil
                    to poor whitish “end clay.” The best heavy carse land is very rich and
                    productive, but requires to be thoroughly wrought, limed, and manured. The
                    district is well adapted for wheat, although the area sown is decreasing. A
                    considerable area is occupied by orchards, the light quick soil on Tayside and
                    in the upper districts of Menteith being admirably adapted for apples.</p>
                <p>Between 1875 and 1880 the number of holdings decreased from 5296 to 5123,
                    although their area increased from 331,890 to 344,728 acres. Of the holdings 179
                    in 1880 were above 300 acres in extent, 1033 between 100 and 300 acres, 786
                    between 50 and 100 acres, and 3125 did not exceed 50 acres each. There are a
                    large number of small holdings in the Highland valleys and in the neighbourhood
                    of the villages and small towns. According to the agricultural returns for 1883
                    there were 344,240 acres, or only a little less than a fifth of the total area,
                    under cultivation, 103,050 acres being under corn crops, 50,799 acres green
                    crops, 100,631 rotation grasses, 87,064 permanent pasture, and 2696 fallow. Of
                    the corn crops, 70,424 acres were under oats, 22,770 acres barley and here, 6238
                    wheat, and 3087 beans; and of the green crops, 31,059 acres were under turnips
                    and swedes and 18,611 under potatoes. The number of horses was 13,651, of which
                    10,524, chiefly Clydesdales, were used solely for agricultural purposes. Cattle
                    numbered 73,097, of which 18,755 were cows and heifers in milk or in calf.
                    Although dairy-farming is not in itself an important industry, a large number of
                    cows are generally kept on the lowland fanns. The cows are principally
                    Ayrshires, but the West <pb break="no"

                    the straths and lower grounds adjoining the Highlands. Sheep in 1883 numbered
                    696,640. All the pasturage in the Grampians, not in deer-forests, is occupied by
                    sheep, and there are also large sheep-runs on the Ochils. The blackfaced are
                    principally kept in the Grampians, but there are also a large number of
                    Cheviots, and in the lower grounds South Downs and Leicesters are common. In
                    1812 there were 203,880 acres under wood, of which 61,164 were planted and
                    142,716 natural. The area under woods in 1884 was 94,563 acres, in addition to
                    which 424 acres were under orchards, 535 acres market-gardens, and 113 acres
                    nurseries. In Breadalbane and Menteith there are still extensive remains of the
                    old forest.</p>
                <p>According to the latest return (187 2-73) the land was divided among 5737
                    proprietors, possessing 1,612,001 acres at an annual value of £959,365, or about
                    Ils. 10d. an acre. Of the proprietors 4680, or nearly four-fifths, possessed
                    less than one acre each. The following possessed upwards of 20,000 acres each,
                    viz., duke of Athole, 194,640; earl of Breadalbane, 193,504; Baroness Willoughby

                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> Anciently the county was
                    divided into the hereditary jurisdictions of Athole in the north, Balquhidder in
                    the south-west, Breadalbane in the west, Gowrie in the east, Menteith in the
                    south, Perth in the south-east, Bannoch in the north-west, and Stormont and
                    Strathearn in the middle. These jurisdictions were abolished by the Act of 1748,
                    and in 1795 an Act was passed dividing the county for administrative purposes
                    into the ten districts of Auchterarder, Blairgowrie, Carse of Gowrie, Crieff,
                    Culross, Coupar-Angus, Dunblane, Dunkeld, Perth, and Weem. The sheriffdom is
                    divided into an eastern and a western district, the seat of the one being Perth
                    and of the other Dunblane. The county is represented in parliament by one
                    member, the city of Perth by one member, and Culross is included in the Stirling
                    district of burghs. Perthshire embraces eighty-one parishes, and contains three
                    ancient cities, Perth, formerly the capital of Scotland, and Dunkeld and
                    Dunblane, formerly the seats of bishoprics, as was also Abernethy. The royal
                    burghs are Perth (27,207) and Culross (380); and Auchterarder, Abernethy, and
                    Dunblane formerly held this rank. The police burghs are Abernethy (906), Alyth
                    (2377), Blairgowrie (4537), Callander (1522), Coupar-Angus (partly in
                    Forfarshire), Crieff (4469), Dunblane (2186), Perth (26,951), and Rattray
                    (2533). The population of the county in 1831 was 142,166, which by 1851 had
                    diminished to 138,660, and by 1871 to 127,768; but in 1881 it had increased to
                    129,007, of whom 61,552 were males and 67,455 females. The increase has been
                    wholly in the town population, from 44,250 (in 1871) to 49,642 (in 1881), there
                    being a decrease in the village population from 23,321 to 22,349, and in the
                    rural from 60,197 to 57,016. The number of persons speaking Gaelic was 14,505,
                    or more than one-ninth of the total population.</p>

                    had three principal oppida—Alauna, at the junction of the Allan and Forth,
                    guarding the entrance to the Highlands from the south; Lindum, at Ardoch; and
                    Victoria, at Loch Orr in Fife. The Venicones inhabited part of Fife and the
                    adjoining district of Perthshire, with the town of Orrea, probably Abernethy, at
                    the junction of the Earn and Tay, the nearest Roman station to which was at
                    Ardargie. The Vacomagi skirted the Highland region, and had the tθλvns of Tamea
                    in Inchtuthil (an island in the Tay), where remains still exist, and Banatia, at
                    Buchanty on the Almond, where there was a strong Roman station. In 83 A. r&gt;.
                    Agricola explored the country beyond the Forth, and in the following year
                    probably carried his legions to the foot of the Grampians. At Mons Graupius or
                    Granpius, whose site is not ascertained, but which is, according to the most
                    probable conjecture (Mr Skene’s), in the district of Stormont in Perthshire,
                    amongst the outliers of the Grampians near Meikleour, where the Cleavers Dyke
                    and Buzzard Dykes perhaps mark the camps of Agricola and Galgacus, and the Hill
                    of Blair the scene of battle, the Romans (according to their own accounts)
                    defeated the tribes of Caledonia with great slaughter; but they deemed it
                    imprudent to pursue the victory. Perthshire was accordingly left in the
                    possession of its native tribes till its invasion by Severus in 207. The Roman
                    road of Severus passed by Alanna to Lindum at Ardoch, where there are extensive
                    remains of a Roman station, and thence by Strageath near Auchterarder, Dalgin
                    Ross near Comrie, where there were prominent remains a century ago, and
                    Buchanty, where one branch passed eastwards to the coast, and the other turned
                    northwards over the Grampians.</p>
                <p>As Severas renewed the wall of Antoninus, he does not appear to have retained
                    possession of the county north of the Forth and the Clyde. Perthshire was
                    included in the kingdom of the Southern Picts, who had their capital first at
                    Abernethy and afterwards at Forteviot. On the burning of Forteviot by the
                    Northmen in the 8th century the seat of the Government was changed to Scone,
                    which continued to be the capital of Albany, the chief royal residence in
                    Scotland, and the place where its kings were crowned, though circumstances led
                    to James II., James III., and Mary being crowned elsewhere. But, as Perth
                    increased in population, it became the seat of the parliament, and the favourite
                    residence of the kings, until it was succeeded by Edinburgh in the reign of
                    James II. In the early history of the county fall the defeat of the Danes at
                    Luncarty in the 10th century and of Macbeth by Earl Siward at Dunsinane in 1054.
                    To its later history, apart from incidents connected with the city of Perth,
                    belong the removal of the coronation stone from Scone to Westminster by Edward
                    I.; the battle of Dupplin, where Edward Baliol defeated the earl of Mar; the
                    rout of the troops of General Mackay at Killiecrankie by the Highlanders under
                    Dundee, 17th July 1689; and the indecisive battle at Sheriffmuir, 13th November
                    1715, between the adherents of the Pretender under the earl of Mar and the
                    forces of the Government under Argyll. Apart from the camp at Ardoch Roman
                    remains are not important. Of hill-forts the most remarkable is that on
                    Dunsinane Hill. Among other relics of an early period are a ship-barrow of the
                    vikings on the Hill of Rattray; weems in the parishes of Monzie, Alyth, and
                    Bendochy; the witchstone near Cairn beddie, where Macbeth is said to have met
                    the witches,—probably a sepulchral memorial of some old battlefield; another
                    stone in Meigle parish called Macbeth’s Stone; a group of standing stones near
                    Pitlochrie; and a number of sculptured stones at Meigle.</p>
                <p>Abernethy, originally founded by the Pictish king Nertan in the 5th century, and
                    refounded by St Columba in the 6th, succeeded Iona as the seat of the primacy of
                    Scotland, afterwards transferred to St Andrews. The round tower in the
                    churchyard, resembling those in Ireland, is supposed to have been built in the
                    time of Kenneth Macalpine. The Culdees had monastic churches at Dunblane,
                    Dunkeld, Abernethy, and Muthill. <hi rend="smallcaps">Dunblane</hi> (g <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>.v.) and <hi rend="smallcaps">Dunkeld</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">{q.v.)</hi> were subsequently erected into bishoprics. The Canons
                    Regular had an abbey at Scone, founded in 1124 and burned in 1559, its site
                    being now occupied by a modern mansion; a priory at Loch Tay, 1114; a priory at
                    Inchafray, 1200; a priory at Strathfillan, 1314; and a priory at Abernethy,
                    1273. The Dominicans had a convent at Perth, 1231, where there was also a
                    Carthusian monastery, 1429, and a Greyfriars monastery, 1460. Culross abbey, of
                    which the tower and the Gothic choir still remain, was founded by the
                    Cistercians in 1217, and there was also an abbey of Cistercian nuns at St
                    Leonards, Perth, founded in 1296. A Carmelite convent was founded at Tulliallan
                    in 1267. There were collegiate churches at Meth ven and Tullibardine. Of the old
                    castles of the chiefs mention may be made of Elcho Castle on the Tay, 4 miles
                    south of Perth; Blair Castle, garrisoned by Montrose in 1644, stormed by
                    Cromwell in 1653, occupied by Claverhouse in 1689, dismantled in 1690, and
                    restored in 1870; Castle Huntly, built in 1452 by Lord Grey, master of the
                    household to James II.; the ruins of Castle Dhu, near Moulin, once a stronghold
                    of the Campbell family; the ruins of Finlarig Castle, Killin, the cradle of the
                    Breadalbane family; Cluny Castle, on the island in the loch of the same name
                    between Dunkeld and Blairgowrie; and Donne Castle, on the Teith, a picturesque
                    ruin of very old date, rebuilt by Murdoch, duke of Albany. Among modern mansions
                    the principal are Keir House, the seat of the late Sir W. Stirling-Maxwell;
                    Blair Drummond House, the seat of the Drummonds; Blair Castle, duke of Athole;
                    Taymouth Castle, earl of Breadalbane; Donne Lodge, earl of Moray; Dupplin
                    Castle, earl of Kinnoul; Scone Palace, earl of Mansfield; Gleneagles, earl of
                    Camperdown; Strathallan Castle, Viscount Strathallan; and Drummond Castle,
                    Baroness Willoughby d’Eresby.</p>
