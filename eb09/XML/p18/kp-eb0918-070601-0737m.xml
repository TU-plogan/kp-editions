                    the <hi rend="italic">Divine Comedy</hi> to lifelong exile. With his wife he
                    took refuge in the Ghibelline township of Arezzo; and it was here, on the very
                    night when his father, in company with other members of the White party, made an
                    unsuccessful attempt to enter Florence by force, that SWFrancesco first saw the
                    light. He did not remain long in his birthplace. His mother, having obtained
                    permission to return from banishment, settled at Incisa, a little village on the
                    Arno above Florence, in February 1305. Here Petrarch spent seven years of
                    boyhood, acquiring that pure Tuscan idiom which afterwards he used with such
                    consummate mastery in ode and sonnet. Here too, in 1307, his brother Gherardo
                    was born. In 1312 Petracco set up a house for his family at Pisa; but soon
                    afterwards, finding no scope there for the exercise of his profession as jurist,
                    he removed them all in 1313 to Avignon. This was a step of no small importance
                    for the future poet-scholar. Avignon at that period still belonged to Provence,
                    and owned King Robert of Naples as sovereign. But the popes had made it their
                    residence after the insults offered to Boniface VIII. at Anagni in 1303. Avignon
                    was therefore the centre of that varied society which the high pontiffs of
                    Christendom have ever gathered round them. Nowhere else could the youth of
                    genius who was destined to impress a cosmopolitan stamp on mediaeval culture and
                    to begin the modern era have grown up under conditions more favourable to his
                    task. At Incisa and at Pisa he had learned his mother-tongue. At Carpentras,
                    under the direction of Convennole of Prato, he studied the humanities between
                    the years 1315 and 1319. Avignon, at a distance from the party strife and
                    somewhat parochial politics of the Italian commonwealths, impressed his mind
                    with an ideal of civility raised far above provincial prejudices. What Petrarch
                    lost in depth and intensity he gained in breadth and serenity by this exile’s
                    education. That disengagement from local circumstance which marks his patriotic
                    theories, that conception of self-culture as an end in itself which
                    distinguishes the humanism he inaugurated, were natural to a man who had no
                    country, and who found the spiritual city of his studies and his aspirations in
                    all quarters of the habitable globe.</p>
                <p>Petrarch’s real name, according to Tuscan usage, was Francesco di Petracco. But
                    he altered this patronymic, for the sake of euphony, to Petrarca, proving by
                    this slight change his emancipation from usages which, had he dwelt at Florence,
                    would most probably have been imposed on him. It does not appear that lie was
                    attached to either his father or his mother; and, though he loved his brother
                    Gherardo dearly, we recognize in him that type of character for which the
                    self-chosen ties of friendship are more enthralling than the piety of domestic
                    affection. Petracco, who was very anxious that his eldest son should become an
                    eminent jurist, sent him at the age of fifteen to study law at Montpellier. Like
                    Ovid and many other poets, Petrarch felt no inclination for his father’s
                    profession. His intellect, indeed, was not incapable of understanding and
                    admiring the majestic edifice of Roman law; but he shrank with disgust from the
                    illiberal technicalities of practice. There is an authentic story of Petracco’s
                    flinging <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n738/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0738-0707"/> the young student’s books of poetry and rhetoric
                    upon the fire, but saving Virgil and Cicero half-burned from the flames at his
                    son’s passionate entreaties. Notwithstanding Petrarch’s firm determination to
                    make himself a scholar and a man of letters rather than a lawyer, he so far
                    submitted to his father’s wishes as to remove about the year 1323 to Bologna,
                    which was then the headquarters of juristic learning. There he stayed with his
                    brother Gherardo until 1326, when his father died, and he returned to Avignon.
                    Banishment and change of place had already diminished Petracco’s fortune, which
                    was never large; and a fraudulent administration of his estate after his death
                    left the two heirs in almost complete destitution. The most precious remnant of
                    Petrarch’s inheritance was a MS. of Cicero. There remained no course open for
                    him but to take orders. This he did at once on his arrival in Provence; and we
                    have good reason to believe that he advanced in due time to the rank of priest.
                    A great Roman noble and ecclesiastic, Giacomo Colonna, afterwards bishop of
                    Lombez, now befriended him, and Petrarch lived for some years in partial
                    dependence on this patron.</p>
                <p>On the 6th of April 1327 happened the most famous event of Petrarch’s history. He
                    saw Laura for the first time in the church of St Clara at Avignon. Who Laura was
                    remains uncertain still. That she was the daughter of Audibert de Noves and the
                    wife of Hugh de Sade rests partly on tradition and partly on documents which the
                    abbé de Sade professed to have copied from originals in the last century.
                    Nothing is now extant to prove that, if this lady really existed, she was the
                    Laura of the <hi rend="italic">Canzoniere,</hi> while there are reasons for
                    suspecting that the abbé was either the fabricator of a romance flattering to
                    his own family, or the dupe of some previous impostor. We may, however, reject
                    the sceptical hypothesis that Laura was a mere figment of Petrarch’s fancy; and,
                    if we accept her personal reality, the poems of her lover demonstrate that she
                    was a married woman with whom he enjoyed a respectful and not very intimate
                    friendship.</p>
                <p>Petrarch’s inner life after this date is mainly occupied with the passion which
                    he celebrated in his Italian poems, and with the friendships which his Latin
                    epistles dimly reveal to us. Besides the bishop of Lombez he was now on terms of
                    intimacy with another member of the great Colonna family, the Cardinal Giovanni.
                    A German, Ludwig, whom he called Socrates, and a Roman, Lelio, who received from
                    him the classic name of Laelius, were among his best-loved associates. He
                    probably owed his livelihood to the generosity of prelates, with whom he played
                    the courtier or the secretary; for we do not hear of his having occupied any
                    benefice at this period. Avignon was the chief seat of his residence up to the
                    year 1333, when he became restless, and undertook his first long journey. On
                    this occasion he visited Paris, Ghent, Liège, Cologne, making the acquaintance
                    of learned men and copying the manuscripts of classical authors. On his return
                    to Avignon he engaged in public affairs, pleaded the cause of the Scaligers in
                    their lawsuit with the Rossi for the lordship of Parma, and addressed two
                    poetical epistles to Pope Benedict XII. upon the restoration of the papal see to
                    Rome. His eloquence on behalf of the tyrants of Verona was successful. It won
                    him the friendship of their ambassador, Azzo di Correggio,—a fact which
                    subsequently influenced his life in no small measure. At the same time his
                    treatment of the papal question made him pose as an Italian patriot clinging to
                    the ideal of Rome as the sovereign city of civilization. Not very long after
                    these events Petrarch made his first journey to Rome, a journey memorable from
                    the account which he has left us of the impression he received from its
                    ruins.</p>
                <p>It was some time in the year 1337 that he established himself at Vaucluse and
                    began that life of solitary study, heightened by communion with nature in her
                    loneliest and wildest moods, which distinguished him in so remarkable a degree
                    from the common herd of mediaeval scholars. Here he spent his time partly among
                    books, meditating on Roman history, and preparing himself for the Latin epic of
                    <hi rend="italic">Africa.</hi> In his hours of recreation he climbed the hills
                    or traced the Sorgues from its fountain under those tall limestone cliffs, while
                    odes and sonnets to Madonna Laura were committed from his memory to paper. We
                    may also refer many of his most important treatises in prose, as well as a large
                    portion of his Latin correspondence, to the leisure he enjoyed in this retreat.
                    Some woman, unknown to us by name, made him the father of a son, Giovanni, in
                    the year 1337; and she was probably the same who brought him a daughter,
                    Francesca, in 1343. Both children were afterwards legitimized by papal bulls.
                    Meanwhile his fame as a poet in the Latin and the vulgar tongues steadily
                    increased, until, when the first draughts of the <hi rend="italic">Africa</hi>
                    began to circulate about the year 1339, it became manifest that no one had a
                    better right to the laurel crown than Petrarch. A desire for glory was one of
                    the most deeply-rooted passions of his nature, and one of the points in which he
                    most strikingly anticipated the humanistic scholars who succeeded him. It is
                    not, therefore, surprising to find that he exerted his influence in several
                    quarters with the view to obtaining the honours of a public coronation. The
                    result of his intrigues was that on a single day in 1340, the 1st of September,
                    he received two invitations, from the university of Paris and from King Robert
                    of Naples respectively. He chose to accept the latter, journeyed in February
                    1341 to Naples, was honourably entertained by the king, and, after some formal
                    disputations on matters touching the poet’s art, was sent with magnificent
                    credentials to Rome. There, in the month of April, Petrarch assumed the poet’s
                    crown upon the Capitol from the hand of the Roman senator amid the plaudits of
                    the people and the patricians. The oration which he delivered on this occasion
                    was composed upon these words of Virgil: “Sect me Parnassi deserta per ardua
                    dulcis</p>
                <p>Raptat amor.”</p>
                <p>The theme was well chosen; and the ceremony, though we cannot but regard it with
                    a somewhat pitying smile, was symbolical of much. According to mediaeval
                    conceptions, Rome, though abandoned by her emperor and pope, was still the
                    mistress of the world; and the poet, who upon that April day uttered the passion
                    for Parnassus which drew him through steep and desert regions, was destined to
                    revive the arts and sciences in the midst of a barren age. The ancient and the
                    modern eras met together on the Capitol at Petrarch’s coronation, and a new
                    stadium for the human spirit, that which we are wont to style Renaissance, was
                    opened.</p>
                <p>With the coronation in Rome a fresh chapter in the biography of Petrarch may be
                    said to have begun. Henceforth he ranked as a rhetorician and a poet of European
                    celebrity, the guest of princes, and the ambassador to royal courts. During the
                    spring months of 1341 his friend Azzo di Correggio had succeeded in freeing
                    Parma from subjugation to the Scaligers, and was laying the foundations of his
                    own tyranny in that city. He invited Petrarch to attend him when he made his
                    triumphal entry at the end of May; and from this time forward for a considerable
                    period Parma and Vaucluse were the two headquarters of the poet. The one he
                    called his transalpine, the other his cisalpine Parnassus. The events of the
                    next six years of his life, from May 1341 to May 1347, may be briefly
                    recapitulated. He lost his old friend the bishop of Lombez by death and his
                    brother Gherardo by the entrance of the latter into a Carthusian monastery.
                    Various <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n739/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0739-0708"/> small benefices were conferred upon him; and
                    repeated offers of a papal secretaryship, which would have raised him to the
                    highest dignities, were made and rejected. Petrarch remained true to the
                    instinct of his own vocation, and had no intention of sacrificing his studies
                    and his glory to ecclesiastical ambition. In January 1343 his old friend and
                    patron Robert, king of Naples, died, and Petrarch was sent on an embassy from
                    the papal court to his successor Joan. The notices which he has left us of
                    Neapolitan society at this epoch are interesting, and it was now, perhaps, that
                    he met Boccaccio for the first time. The beginning of the year 1345 was marked
                    by an event more interestingin the scholar’s eyes than any change in dynasties.
                    This was no less than a discovery at Verona of Cicero’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Familiar Letters.</hi> It is much to be regretted that Petrarch found the
                    precious MS. so late in life, when the style of his own epistles had been
                    already modelled upon that of Seneca and St Augustine. No one, not even Erasmus,
                    would have profited more by the study of those epistolary masterpieces, or would
                    have been better able to imitate their point and ease of diction, had he become
                    acquainted with them at an earlier period.</p>
                <p>In the month of May 1347 Cola di Rienzi accomplished that extraordinary
                    revolution which for a short space revived the republic in Rome, and raised this
                    enthusiast to titular equality with kings. Petrarch, who in politics was no less
                    visionary than Rienzi, hailed the advent of a founder and deliverer in the
                    self-styled tribune. Without considering the impossibility of restoring the
                    majesty of ancient Rome, or the absurdity of dignifying the mediaeval Roman
                    rabble by the name of Populus Romanus, he threw himself with passion into the
                    republican movement, and sacrificed his old friends of the Colonna family to
                    what he judged a patriotic duty. To follow the meteoric course of Rienzi through
                    those months of mock supremacy, exile, and imprisonment at Avignon does not
                    concern Petrarch’s biographer. It will be enough to say that the poet contented
                    himself with writing a rhetorical exhortation to the Roman people on the
                    occasion of the tribune’s downfall, giving vent, as usual, through eloquence to
                    emotions which men of more practical character strove to express in act.</p>
                <p>Petrarch built himself a house at Parma in the autumn of 1347. Here he hoped to
                    pursue the tranquil avocations of a poet honoured by men of the world and men of
                    letters throughout Europe, and of an idealistic politician, whose effusions on
                    the questions of the day were read with pleasure for their style. But in the
                    course of the next two years this agreeable prospect was overclouded by a series
                    of calamities. Laura died of the plague on the 6th April 1348. Francesco degli
                    Albizzi, Mainardo Accursio, Roberto de’ Bardi, Sennuccio del Bene, Luchino
                    Visconti, the cardinal Giovanni Colonna, and several other friends followed to
                    the grave in rapid succession. All of these had been intimate acquaintances and
                    correspondents of the poet. Friendship with him was a passion; or, what is more
                    true perhaps, he needed friends for the maintenance of his intellectual activity
                    at the highest point of its effectiveness. Therefore he felt the loss of these
                    men acutely. We may say with certainty that Laura’s death, accompanied by that
                    of so many distinguished associates, was the turning-point in Petrarch’s inner
                    life. He began to think of quitting the world, and pondered a plan for
                    establishing a kind of humanistic convent, where he might dedicate himself, in
                    the company of kindred spirits, to still severer studies and a closer communion
                    with God. Though nothing came of this scheme, a marked change was henceforth
                    perceptible in Petrarch’s literary compositions. The poems written <hi
                    rend="italic">In</hi><hi rend="italic">Morte</hi><hi rend="italic">di Madonna
                    Laura</hi> are graver and of more religious tone. The prose works touch on
                    retrospective topics or deal with subjects of deep meditation. At the same time
                    his renown, continually spreading, opened to him ever fresh relations with
                    Italian despots. The noble houses of Gonzaga at Mantua, of Carrara at Padua, of
                    Este at Ferrara, of Malatesta at Rimini, of Visconti at Milan, vied with Azzo di
                    Correggio in entertaining the illustrious man of letters. It was in vain that
                    his correspondents pointed out the discrepancy between his professed zeal for
                    Italian liberties, his recent enthusiasm for the Roman republic, and this
                    alliance with tyrants who were destroying the freedom of the Lombard cities.
                    Petrarch remained an incurable rhetorician; and, while he stigmatized the
                    despots in his ode to Italy and in his epistles to the emperor, he accepted
                    their hospitality. They, on their part, seem to have understood his temperament,
                    and to have agreed to recognize his political theories as of no practical
                    importance. The tendency to honour men of letters and to patronize the arts
                    which distinguished Italian princes throughout the Renaissance period first
                    manifested itself in the attitude assumed by Visconti and Carraresi to
                    Petrarch.</p>
                <p>When the jubilee of 1350 was proclaimed, Petrarch made a pilgrimage to Rome,
                    passing and returning through Florence, where he established a firm friendship
                    with Boccaccio. It has been well remarked that, while all his other friendships
                    are shadowy and dim, this one alone stands out with clearness. Each of the two
                    friends had a distinguished personality. Each played a foremost part in the
                    revival of learning. Boccaccio carried his admiration for Petrarch to the point
                    of worship. Petrarch repaid him with sympathy, counsel in literary studies, and
                    moral support which helped to elevate and purify the younger poet’s
                    over-sensuous nature. It was Boccaccio who in the spring of 1351 brought to
                    Petrarch, then resident with the Carrara family at Padua, an invitation from the
                    seigniory of Florence to accept the rectorship of their recently-founded
                    university. This was accompanied by a diploma of restoration to his rights as
                    citizen and restitution of his patrimony. But, flattering as was the offer,
                    Petrarch declined it. He preferred his literary leisure at Vaucluse, at Parma,
                    in the courts of princes, to a post which would have brought him into contact
                    with jealous priors and have reduced him to the position of the servant of a
                    commonwealth. Accordingly, we find him journeying again in 1351 to Vaucluse,
                    again refusing the office of papal secretary, again planning visionary reforms
                    for the Roman people, and beginning that curious fragment of an autobiography
                    which is known as the <hi rend="italic">Epistle to Posterity.</hi> Early in 1353
                    he left Avignon for the last time, and entered Lombardy by the pass of Mont
                    Genèvre, making his way immediately to Milan. The archbishop Giovanni Visconti
                    was at this period virtually despot of Milan. He induced Petrarch, who had long
                    been a friend of the Visconti family, to establish himself at his court, where
                    he found employment for him as ambassador and orator. The most memorable of his
                    diplomatic missions was to Venice in the autumn of 1353. Towards the close of
                    the long struggle between Genoa and the republic of St Mark the Genoese
                    entreated Giovanni Visconti to mediate on their behalf with the Venetians.
                    Petrarch was entrusted with the office; and on 8th November he delivered a
                    studied oration before the doge Andrea Dandolo and the great council. His
                    eloquence had no effect; but the orator entered into relations with the Venetian
                    aristocracy which were afterwards extended and confirmed. Meanwhile, Milan
                    continued to be his place of residence. After Giovanni’s death he remained in
                    the court of Bernabò and Galeazzo Visconti, closing his eyes to their cruelties
                    and exactions, serving them as a diplomatist, making speeches for them on
                    ceremonial occasions, and partaking of the splendid hospitality they offered to
                    emperors and princes. It was in this capacity of an independent man of letters,
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n740/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0740-0709"/> highly placed and favoured at one of the most
                    wealthy courts of Europe, that he addressed epistles to the emperor Charles IV.
                    upon the distracted state of Italy, and entreated him to resume the old
                    Ghibelline policy of imperial interference. Charles IV. passed through Mantua in
                    the autumn of 1354. There Petrarch made his acquaintance, and, finding him a man
                    unfit for any noble enterprise, declined attending him to Rome. When Charles
                    returned to Germany, after assuming the crowns in Rome and Milan, Petrarch
                    addressed a letter of vehement invective and reproach to the emperor who was so
                    negligent of the duties imposed on him by his high office. This did not prevent
                    the Visconti sending him on an embassy to Charles in 1356. Petrarch found him at
                    Prague, and, after pleading the cause of his masters, was despatched with honour
                    and the diploma of count palatine. His student’s life at Milan was again
                    interrupted in 1360 by a mission on which Galeazzo Visconti sent him to King
                    John of France. The tyrants of Milan were aspiring to royal alliances; Gian
                    Galeazzo Visconti had been married to Isabella of France; Violante Visconti, a
                    few years later, was wedded to the English duke of Clarence. Petrarch was now
                    commissioned to congratulate King John upon his liberation from captivity in
                    England. This duty performed, he returned to Milan, where in 1361 he received
                    news of the deaths of his son Giovanni and his old friend Socrates. Both had
                    been carried off by plague.</p>
                <p>The remaining years of Petrarch’s life, important as they were for the
                    furtherance of humanistic studies, may be briefly condensed. On 11th May 1362 he
                    settled at Padua, from the neighbourhood of which he never moved again to any
                    great distance. The same year saw him at Venice, making a donation of his
                    library to the republic of St Mark. Here his friend Boccaccio introduced to him
                    the Greek teacher Leontius Pilatus. Petrarch, who possessed a MS. of Homer and a
                    portion of Plato, never acquired the Greek language, although he attempted to
                    gain some little knowledge of it in his later years. Homer, he said, was dumb to
                    him, while he was deaf to Homer; and he could only approach the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> in Boccaccio’s rude Latin version. About this period he
                    saw his daughter Francesca happily married, and undertook the education of a
                    young scholar from Ravenna, whose sudden disappearance from his household caused
                    him the deepest grief. This youth has been identified, but on insufficient
                    grounds, with that Giovanni Malpaghini of Ravenna who was destined to form a
                    most important link between Petrarch and the humanists of the next age of
                    culture. The public affairs of Italy and Europe continued to interest him; nor
                    was he ever idle in composing letters and orations, some of which were not
                    without political importance, while all of them contributed to form a style that
                    had the greatest influence over successive generations of Italian chancellors
                    and secretaries. Gradually his oldest friends dropped off. Azzo di Correggio
                    died in 1362, and Laelius, Simonides, Barbato, in the following year. His own
                    death was reported in 1365; but he survived another decade. Much of this last
                    stage of his life was occupied at Padua in a controversy with the Averroists,
                    whom he regarded as dangerous antagonists both to sound religion and to sound
                    culture. A curious treatise, which grew in part out of this dispute and out of a
                    previous duel with physicians, was the book <hi rend="italic">Upon his own
                    Ignorance and that of many others.</hi> At last, in 1369, tired with the bustle
                    of a town so big as Padua, he retired to Arquà, a village in the Euganean hills,
                    where he continued his usual train of literary occupations, employing several
                    secretaries, and studying unremittingly. All through these declining years his
                    friendship with Boccaccio was maintained and strengthened. It rested on a solid
                    basis of mutual affection and of common studies, the different temperaments of
                    the two scholars securing them against the disagreements of rivalry or jealousy.
                    One of Petrarch’s last compositions was a Latin version of Boccaccio’s story of
                    Griselda. On 18th July 1374 his people found the old poet and scholar dead among
                    his books in the library of that little house which looks across the hills and
                    lowlands toward the Adriatic.</p>
                <p>When we attempt to estimate Petrarch’s position in the history of modern culture,
                    the first thing which strikes us is that he was even less eminent as an Italian
                    poet than as the founder of Humanism, the inaugurator of the Renaissance in
                    Italy. What he achieved for the modern world was not merely to bequeath to his
                    Italian imitators masterpieces of lyrical art unrivalled for perfection of
                    workmanship, but also, and far more, to open out for Europe a new sphere of
                    mental activity. Standing within the threshold of the Middle Ages, he surveyed
                    the kingdom of the modern spirit, and, by his own inexhaustible industry in the
                    field of scholarship and study, he determined what we call the revival of
                    learning. By bringing the men of his own generation into sympathetic contact
                    with antiquity, he gave a decisive impulse to that European movement which
                    restored freedom, self-consciousness, and the faculty of progress to the human
                    intellect. The warm recognition which he met with in his lifetime and the
                    extraordinary activity of his immediate successors prove indeed that the age
                    itself was ripe for this momentous change. Yet it is none the less certain that
                    Petrarch stamped his genius on the spirit of the time, that he was the hero of
                    the humanistic effort. He was the first man to collect libraries, to accumulate
                    coins, to advocate the preservation of antique monuments, and to collate MSS.
                    Though he knew no Greek, he was the first to appreciate its vast importance; and
                    through his influence Boccaccio laid the earliest foundations of its study. More
                    than this, he was the first to approach the great authors of antiquity with
                    intelligence. It was not the extent but the lucidity of his erudition, not the
                    matter but the spirit of his scholarship, that placed him at an immeasurable
                    distance of superiority above his predecessors. When we compare the use which
                    even Dante made of classical knowledge in his <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Monarchia</hi> with Petrarch’s touch upon the ancients in his
                    numerous prose works, we perceive that we have passed from the mediaeval to the
                    modern conception of literature. For him the authors of the Greek and Latin
                    world were living men,—more real, in fact, than those with whom he corresponded;
                    and the rhetorical epistles he addressed to Cicero, Seneca, and Varro prove that
                    he dwelt with them on terms of sympathetic intimacy. So far-reaching were the
                    interests controlled by him in this capacity of humanist that his achievement as
                    an Italian lyrist seems by comparison insignificant.</p>
                <p>Petrarch’s ideal of humanism was essentially a noble one. He regarded the orator
                    and the poet as teachers, bound to complete themselves by education, and to
                    exhibit to the world an image of perfected personality in prose and verse of
                    studied beauty. Self-culture and self-effectuation seemed to him the highest
                    aims of man. Everything which contributed to the formation of a free,
                    impassioned, liberal individuality he regarded as praiseworthy. Everything which
                    retarded the attainment of that end was contemptible in his eyes. The authors of
                    antiquity, the Holy Scriptures, and the fathers of the church were valued by him
                    as one common source of intellectual enlightenment. Eminently religious, and
                    orthodox in his convictions, he did not seek to substitute a pagan for the
                    Christian ideal. This was left for the scholars of the 15th and 16th centuries
                    in Italy. At the same time, the Latin orators, historians, and poets were
                    venerated by him as depositaries of a tradition only second in importance to
                    revelation. For <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n741/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0741-0710"/> him there was no schism between Rome and Galilee,
                    between classical genius and sacred inspiration. Though the latter took the
                    first rank in relation to man’s eternal welfare, the former was necessary for
                    the perfection of his intellect and the civilization of his manners. With this
                    double ideal in view, Petrarch poured scorn upon the French physicians and the
                    Italian Averroists for their illiberal philistinism, no less than for their
                    materialistic impiety. True to his conception of independent intellectual
                    activity, he abstained from a legal career, refused important ecclesiastical
                    office, and contented himself with paltry benefices which implied no spiritual
                    or administrative duties, because he was resolved to follow the one purpose of
                    his life,—self-culture. Whatever in literature revealed the hearts of men was
                    infinitely precious to him; and for this reason he professed almost a cult for
                    St Augustine. It was to Augustine, as to a friend or a confessor, that he poured
                    forth the secrets of his own soul in the book <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Contemptu</hi><hi rend="italic">Mundi.</hi></p>
                <p>In this effort to realize his truest self Petrarch was eminently successful. Much
                    as he effected by restoring to the world a sound conception of learning, and by
                    rousing that genuine love and curiosity which led to the revival, he did even
                    more by impressing on the age his own full-formed and striking personality. In
                    all things he was original. Whether we regard him as a priest who published poem
                    after poem in praise of an adored mistress, as a plebeian man of letters who
                    conversed on equal terms with kings and princes, as a solitary dedicated to the
                    love of nature, as an amateur diplomatist treating affairs of state with pompous
                    eloquence in missives sent to popes and emperors, or again as a traveller eager
                    for change of scene, ready to climb mountains for the enjoyment of broad
                    prospects over spreading champaigns; in all these divers manifestations of his
                    peculiar genius we trace some contrast with the manners of the 14th century,
                    some emphatic anticipation of the 16th. The defects of Petrarch’s character were
                    no less striking than its qualities, and were indeed their complement and
                    counterpart. That vivid conception of intellectual and moral self-culture which
                    determined his ideal took the form in actual life of allabsorbing egotism. He
                    was not content with knowing himself to be the leader of the age. He claimed
                    autocracy, suffered no rival near his throne, brooked no contradiction, demanded
                    unconditional submission to his will and judgment. His friends were treated by
                    him as subordinates and vassals with exacting magnanimity. The preoccupation
                    with himself, which makes his letters and prose treatises a mine of
                    autobiographical information, rouses a certain contempt when we watch it
                    degenerating into vanity, appetite for flattery, intrigues for the poet’s crown,
                    restless change from place to place in search of new admirers, desire for
                    ceremonial pomp, and half-concealed detraction of superior genius. Petrarch was
                    made up of contradictions. Praising solitude, playing the hermit at Vaucluse, he
                    only loved seclusion as a contrast to the society of courts; while he penned
                    dissertations on the futility of fame and the burden of celebrity, he was
                    trimming his sails to catch the breeze of popular applause. No one professed a
                    more austere morality, and few mediaeval writers indulged in cruder satire on
                    the female sex; yet he passed some years in the society of a concubine, and his
                    living masterpiece of art is the apotheosis of chivalrous passion for a woman.
                    These discords of an undecided nature displayed themselves in his political
                    theories and in his philosophy of conduct. In one mood he was fain to ape the
                    antique patriot; in another he affected the monastic saint. He was clamorous for
                    the freedom of the Roman people; yet at one time he called upon the popes to
                    re-establish themselves in the Eternal City; at another he besought the emperor
                    to make it his headquarters; at a third he hailed in Rienzi the founder of a new
                    republic. He did not perceive that all these plans were incompatible. His
                    relations to the Lombard nobles were equally at variance with his professed
                    patriotism; and, while still a housemate of Visconti and Correggi, he kept on
                    issuing invectives against the tyrants who divided Italy. It would not be
                    difficult to multiply these antitheses in the character and the opinions of this
                    singular man. But it is more to the purpose to remark that they were harmonized
                    in a personality of potent and enduring force. Petrarch was essentially the
                    first of the moderns, the ancestor of Hamlet and Faust, Rousseau and Childe
                    Harold. That strange spirit of unrest and melancholy, of malady and isolation,
                    which drove him from time to time into the desert, where he sought companionship
                    with the great writers of the past, was the inner witness to an irresoluble
                    contradiction between himself and the age in which he lived.</p>
                <p>The point to notice in this complex personality is that Petrarch’s ideal remained
                    always literary. As philosopher, politician, historian, essayist, orator, he
                    aimed at lucid and harmonious expression,—not, indeed, neglecting the importance
                    of the material he undertook to treat, but approaching his task in the spirit of
                    an artist rather than a thinker or a man of action. This accounts for his
                    bewildering versatility, and for his apparent want of grasp on conditions of
                    fact. Viewed in this light Petrarch anticipated the Italian Renaissance in its
                    weakness,—that philosophical superficiality, that tendency to ornate rhetoric,
                    that preoccupation with stylistic trifles, that want of profound conviction and
                    stern sincerity, which stamp its minor literary products with the note of
                    mediocrity. Had Petrarch been possessed with a passion for some commanding
                    principle in politics, morality, or science, instead of with the thirst for
                    self-glorification and the ideal of artistic culture, it is not wholly
                    impossible that Italian humanism might have assumed a manlier and more
                    conscientious tone. But this is not a question which admits of discussion; for
                    the conditions which made Petrarch what he was were already potent in Italian
                    society. He did but express the spirit of the period he opened; and it may also
                    be added that his own ideal was higher and severer than that of the illustrious
                    humanists who followed him.</p>
                <p>As an author Petrarch must be considered from two points of view,—first as a
                    writer of Latin verse and prose, secondly as an Italian lyrist. In the former
                    capacity he was speedily outstripped by more fortunate scholars. His eclogues
                    and epistles and the epic of <hi rend="italic">Africa,</hi> on which he set such
                    store, exhibit a comparatively limited command of Latin metre. His treatises,
                    orations, and familiar letters, though remarkable for a prose style which is
                    eminently characteristic of the man, are not distinguished by purity of diction.
                    Much as he admired Cicero, it is clear that he had not freed himself from
                    current mediaeval Latinity. Seneca and Augustine had been too much used by him
                    as models of composition. At the same time it will be conceded that he possessed
                    a copious vocabulary, a fine ear for cadence, and the faculty of expressing
                    every shade of thought or feeling. What he lacked was that insight into the best
                    classical masterpieces, that command of the best classical diction, which is the
                    product of successive generations of scholarship. To attain to this, Giovanni da
                    Ravenna, Colluccio Salutato, Poggio, and Filelfo had to labour, before a
                    Poliziano and a Bembo finally prepared the path for an Erasmus. Had Petrarch
                    been born at the close of the 15th instead of at the opening of the 14th century
                    there is no doubt that his Latinity would have been as pure, as versatile, and
                    as pointed as that of the witty stylist of Rotterdam.</p>
                <p>With regard to his Italian poetry Petrarch occupies a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n742/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0742-0711"/> very different position. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rirne in Vita e</hi><hi rend="italic">Morte</hi><hi rend="italic">di Madonna
                    Laura</hi> cannot become obsolete, for perfect metrical form has here been
                    married to language of the choicest and the purest. It is true that even in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Canzoniere,</hi> as Italians prefer to call that collection of
                    lyrics, Petrarch is not devoid of faults belonging to his age, and affectations
                    which have imposed themselves with disastrous effect through his authority upon
                    the literature of Europe. He appealed in his odes and sonnets to a restricted
                    audience already educated by the chivalrous love-poetry of Provence and by
                    Italian imitations of that style. He was not careful to exclude the commonplaces
                    of the school, nor anxious to finish a work of art wholly free from fashionable
                    graces and from contemporary conceits. There is therefore a certain element of
                    artificiality in his treatment; and this, since it is easier to copy defects
                    than excellencies, has been perpetuated with wearisome monotony by versifiers
                    who chose him for their model. But, after making due allowance for
                    peculiarities, the abuse of which has brought the name of Petrarchist into
                    contempt, we can agree with Shelley that the lyrics of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canzoniere</hi> “are as spells which unseal the inmost enchanted fountains of
                    the delight which is the grief of love.” That is to say, Petrarch in this
                    monumental series of odes and sonnets depicted all the moods of a real passion,
                    and presented them in a style of such lucidity, with so exquisite a command of
                    rhythmical resources, and with humanity of emotion so simple and so true, as to
                    render his portrait of a lover’s soul applicable to all who have loved and will
                    love for ages. If space sufficed much might be written about the peculiar
                    position held by Petrarch between the metaphysical lyrists of Tuscany and the
                    more realistic amorists of succeeding generations. True in this respect also to
                    his anticipation of the coming age, he was the first Italian poet of love to
                    free himself from allegory and mysticism. Yet he was far from approaching the
                    analysis of emotion with the directness of a Heine or De Musset. Though we
                    believe in the reality of Laura, we derive no clear conception either of her
                    person or her character. She is not so much a woman as woman in the abstract;
                    and perhaps on this very account the poems written for her by her lover have
                    been taken to the heart by countless lovers who came after him. The method of
                    his art is so generalizing, while his feeling is so natural, that every man can
                    see himself reflected in the singer and his mistress shadowed forth in Laura.
                    The same criticism might be passed on Petrarch’s descriptions of nature. That he
                    felt the beauties of nature keenly is certain, and he frequently touches them
                    with obvious appreciation. Yet he has written nothing so characteristic of
                    Vaucluse as to be inapplicable to any solitude where there are woods and water.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Canzoniere</hi> is therefore one long melodious monody
                    poured from the poet’s soul, with the indefinite form of a beautiful woman
                    seated in a lovely landscape, a perpetual object of delightful contemplation.
                    This disengagement from local circumstance without the sacrifice of emotional
                    sincerity is a merit in Petrarch, but it became a fault in his imitators.
                    Lacking his intensity of passion and his admirable faculty for seizing the most
                    evanescent shades of difference in feeling, they degenerated into colourless and
                    lifeless insipidities made insupportable by the frigid repetition of tropes and
                    conceits which we are fain to pardon in the master.</p>
                <p>Petrarch did not distinguish himself by love-poetry alone in the Italian
                    language. His odes to Giacomo Colonna, to Cola di Rienzi, and to the princes of
                    Italy display him in another light. They exhibit the oratorical fervour, the
                    pleader’s eloquence in its most perfect lustre, which Petrarch possessed in no
                    less measure than subjective passion. Modern literature has nothing nobler,
                    nothing more harmonious in the declamatory style than these three patriotic
                    effusions. Their spirit itself is epoch-making in the history of Europe. Up to
                    this point Italy had scarcely begun to exist. There were Florentines and
                    Lombards, Guelfs and Ghibellines; but even Dante had scarcely conceived of Italy
                    as a nation, independent of the empire, inclusive of her several component
                    commonwealths. To the high conception of Italian nationality, to the belief in
                    that spiritual unity which underlay her many discords and divisions, Petrarch
                    attained partly through his disengagement from civic and local partisanship,
                    partly through his large and liberal ideal of culture. It was the function of
                    the Renaissance to bring all parts of the Italian peninsula into an intellectual
                    harmony by means of common enthusiasm for arts and letters. But it remained for
                    the present century to witness the political consolidation of the Italian people
                    under a single government.</p>
                <p>The materials for a life of Petrarch are afforded in abundance by his letters,
                    collected and prepared for publication under his own eyes. These are divided
                    into <hi rend="italic">Familiar Correspondence, Correspondence in Old Age,
                    Divers Letters,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Letters without a Title</hi>; to
                    which may be added the curious autobiographical fragment entitled the <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistle to Posterity.</hi> Next in importance rank the epistles
                    and eclogues in Latin verse, the Italian poems, and the rhetorical addresses to
                    popes, emperors, Cola di Rienzi, and some great men of antiquity. For the
                    comprehension of his character the treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Contemptu</hi><hi rend="italic">Mundi,</hi> addressed to St
                    Augustine and styled his Secret, is invaluable. Without attempting a complete
                    list of Petrarch’s works, it may be well to illustrate the extent of his
                    erudition and his activity as a writer by a brief enumeration of the most
                    important. In the section belonging to moral philosophy we find <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Remediis</hi><hi rend="italic">Utriusque
                    Fortunae,</hi> a treatise on human happiness and unhappiness; <hi rend="italic"
                    >De Vita</hi><hi rend="italic">Solitaria,</hi> a panegyric of solitude; <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Otio Religiosorum,</hi> a similar essay
                    on monastic life, inspired by a visit to his brother Gherardo in his convent
                    near Marseilles. On historical subjects the most considerable are <hi
                    rend="italic">Rerum Memorandarum Libri,</hi> a miscellany from a student’s
                    commonplace-book, and <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Viris
                    illustribus,</hi> an epitome of the biographies of Roman worthies. Three
                    polemical works require mention: <hi rend="italic">Contra cujusdam anonymi
                    Galli</hi><hi rend="italic">calumnias</hi><hi rend="italic">Apologia,
                    Contra</hi><hi rend="italic">Medicum</hi><hi rend="italic">quendam</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Invectivarum Libri,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sui ipsius et multorum Ignorantia,—</hi> controversial and
                    sarcastic compositions, which grew out of Petrarch’s quarrels with the
                    physicians of Avignon and the Averroists of Padua. In this connexion it might
                    also be well to mention the remarkable satires on the papal court, included in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Epistolae sine</hi><hi rend="italic">Titulo.</hi> Five
                    public orations have been preserved, the most weighty of which, in explanation
                    of Petrarch’s conception of literature, is the speech delivered on the Capitol
                    upon the occasion of his coronation. Among his Latin poems <hi rend="italic"
                    >Africa,</hi> an epic on Scipio Africanus, takes the first place. Twelve <hi
                    rend="italic">Eclogues</hi> and three books of <hi rend="italic">Epistles</hi>
                    in verse close the list. In Italian we possess the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canzoniere,</hi> which includes odes and sonnets written for Laura during her
                    lifetime, those written for her after her death, and a miscellaneous section
                    containing the three patriotic odes and three famous poetical invectives against
                    the papal court. Besides these lyrical compositions are the semi-epical or
                    allegorical <hi rend="italic">Trionfi,—</hi> Triumphs of Love, Chastity, Death,
                    Fame, Time, and Divinity, written in terza rima of smooth and limpid quality.
                    Though these Triumphs, as a λvhole, are deficient in poetic inspiration, the
                    second canto of the <hi rend="italic">Trionfo della</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Morte,</hi> in which Petrarch describes a vision of his dead love Laura, is
                    justly famous for reserved passion and pathos tempered to a tranquil
                    harmony.</p>
                <p>The complete bibliography of Petrarch forms a considerable volume. Such a work
                    was attempted by Domenico Rossetti (Trieste, 1828). It will be enough here to
                    mention the Basel edition of 1581, in folio, as the basis for all subsequent
                    editions of his collected works. Two editions of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canzoniere</hi> deserve especial notice,—that of Marsand (Padua, 1820) and that
                    of Leopardi in Le Monnier’s collection. Nor must Fracassetti’s Italian version
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> (published in 5 vols, by Le Monnier) be
                    neglected. De Sade’s <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of the poet (Amsterdam,
                    1764-67) marks an epoch in the history of his numerous biographies; but this is
                    in many important points untrustworthy, and it has been superseded by Gustav
                    Koerting’s exhaustive volume on <hi rend="italic">Ρetrarca's</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Leben und Werke</hi> (Leipsic, 1878). Georg Voigt’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Wiederbelebung</hi><hi rend="italic">des classisclιen
                    Altertlιuιns</hi> (Berlin, 1859) contains a well-digested estimate of Petrarch’s
                    relation to the revival of learning. Mezière’s <hi rend="italic">Pétrarque</hi>
                    (1868) is a monograph of merit. English readers may be referred to a little book
                    on Petrarch by Henry Reeve, and to vols. ii. and iv. of Symonds’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Renaissance in Italy.</hi> (J. A. S.)</p>
