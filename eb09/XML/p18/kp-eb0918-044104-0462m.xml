                    “papilionaceous,” with a “standard” or large petal above, two side petals or
                    wings, and two front petals below forming the keel. The stamens are ten,—nine
                    united, the tenth usually free or only slightly joined to the others. The ovary
                    is prolonged into a long, thick, bent style, compressed from side to side at the
                    tip and fringed with hairs. The fruit is a characteristic “legume” or pod,
                    bursting when ripe into two valves, which bear the large globular seeds (peas)
                    on their edges. These seeds are on short stalks, the upper extremity of which is
                    dilated into a shallow cup or aril; the two cotyledons are thick and fleshy,
                    with a radicle bent along their edges on one side. The genus is exceedingly
                    close to <hi rend="italic">Lathyrus,</hi> being only distinguished technically
                    by the style, which in the latter genus is compressed from above downwards and
                    not thick. It is not surprising, therefore, that under the general name “pea”
                    species both of <hi rend="italic">Pisum</hi> and of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lathyrus</hi> are included. The common field or grey pea with compressed
                    mottled seeds and two to four leaflets is <hi rend="italic">Pisum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">arvense,</hi> which is cultivated in all temperate parts of the
                    globe, but which, according to the Italian botanists, is truly a native of
                    central and southern Italy. The garden pea, <hi rend="italic">P. sativum,</hi>
                    is more tender than the preceding, and its origin is not known. It has not been
                    found in a wild state anywhere, and it is considered that it may be a form of
                    <hi rend="italic">P. arvense,</hi> having, however, from four to six leaflets to
                    each leaf and globular seeds of uniform colour.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">P. sativum</hi> was known to Theophrastus; and De Candol1e
                    points out that the word ‘ ‘ pison” or its equivalent occurs in the Albanian
                    tongue as well as in Latin, whence he concludes that the pea was known to the
                    Aryans, and was perhaps brought by them into Greece and Italy. Peas have been
                    found in the Swiss lake-dwellings of the bronze period. The garden peas differ
                    considerably in size, shape of pod, degree of productiveness, form and colour of
                    seed, &amp;c. The sugar peas are those in which the inner lining of the pod is
                    very thin instead of being somewhat horny, so that the whole pod can be eaten.
                    Unlike most papilionaceous plants, peaflowers are perfectly fertile without the
                    aid of insects, and thus do not intercross so freely as most similar plants do.
                    On the other hand, a case is known wherein the pollen from a purple-podded pea
                    applied to the stigma of one of the green-podded sugar peas produced a purple
                    pod, showing that not only the ovule but even the ovary was affected by the
                    cross. The numerous varieties of peas in cultivation have been obtained by
                    cross-fertilization, but chiefly by selection. Peas constitute a highly
                    nutritious article of diet from the large quantity of nitrogenous materials they
                    contain in addition to starchy and saccharine matters.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Sweet Pea,</hi> cultivated for the beauty and fragrance of
                    its flθλvers, is not a true <hi rend="italic">Pisum,</hi> but a species of <hi
