                    brother of Washington Irving. In connexion with the latter Paulding began in
                    1807 a series of brief lightly humorous articles, which, under the title of “The
                    Salmagundi Papers,” soon became popular, and continued to appear until 25th June
                    1808, when they terminated with the twentieth number. Six years later he
                    published a political pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">The United States and
                    England,</hi> which attracted the notice of President Madison, who in 1814
                    appointed the author secretary to the Board of Navy Commissioners. Subsequently
                    Paulding was for twelve years navy agent in New York city, and from 1837 to 1841
                    secretary of the navy, under President Van Buren. Although much of his literary
                    work consisted of political contributions to the press, he yet found time to
                    write a large number of essays, poems, and tales. His marriage in 1818, the
                    death of his wife, and his own withdrawal from public life in 1841, with his
                    death on 5th April 1860, comprise the chief remaining facts of his useful,
                    honourable, and uneventful career.</p>
                <p>From his father, who was an active revolutionary patriot, Paulding inherited
                    strong anti-British sentiments, which colour much of his satire, but otherwise
                    he was a just and genial critic, and a delicate and kindly humorist. Of a
                    reserved disposition and hasty temper, with many prejudices, and of extreme
                    political views, he was yet an eminently upright man; of an affectionate nature
                    and a forgiving disposition; a hater of debt, lies, and shams; and an absolutely
                    incorruptible official, who, in every relation of life, was inspired by a lofty,
                    if sometimes mistaken, sense of honesty and honour. In literature he merits
                    notice chiefly as a pioneer, and, though his place was never high, and will
                    certainly not be permanent, he was among the first distinctively American as
                    opposed to English writers, and protested more vigorously than any of his
                    contemporaries against intellectual thraldom to the mother-country. As a prose
                    writer he is chaste and elegant, with a fine negligence, which is sometimes the
                    result of art, more frequently of haste; and, while not so elaborate as Irving,
                    so diffuse as Cooper, or so frank as Neal, he is generally just, neat, fanciful,
                    and realistically descriptive. Among his short stories perhaps the best are <hi
                    rend="italic">Dyspepsy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Politician,</hi> among the
                    long <hi rend="italic">The Dutchman’s Fireside.</hi> As a poet he is gracefully
                    commonplace,—a weak reflexion of Thomson, with a dash of the prairie and the
                    backwoods. His longest and most ambitious poem is—or was, for it is now
                    forgotten— <hi rend="italic">The Baek-woodsman,</hi> which is ill-constructed
                    and tedious, and the only lines of Paulding’s which survive in popular memory
                    are the familiar—</p>
                <p>“Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers; where is the peck of pickled
                    peppers Peter Piper picked ?” which may be found in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Koningsmarke.</hi></p>
                <p>The following is a list of his writings :— <hi rend="italic">The Diverting
