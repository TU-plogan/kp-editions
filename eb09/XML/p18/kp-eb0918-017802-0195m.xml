                    composer, ancient or modern; for it is to his transcendent genius that music is
                    indebted for its emancipation from pedantic trammels, which, ignoring beauty as
                    its most necessary element, were fast tending to reduce it to the level of an
                    arithmetical problem.</p>
                <p>The exact date of Palestrina’s birth is unrecorded. It most probably took place
                    in 1524, and certainly at Palestrina (the Praeneste of Roman geographers,—whence
                    the style accorded to him in Latin<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Joannes Petrus Aloysius (or Petraloysius)
                    Praenestinus.</p></note>). Some early writers call him Gianetto da Palestina, or
                    simply Gianetto; and this early custom—which has led some modern critics to
                    mistake his identity—combined with the general use of his Christian names only,
                    has induced the belief that he was of peasant origin; but Signor Cicerchia is
                    said to have discovered at Palestrina documents proving that his father bore the
                    family name of Sante, and his mother that of Gismondi,-in which case he must
                    have been of gentle birth. The statement, however, needs confirmation.</p>

                <p>In early youth Palestrina studied at Rome in company with Animuccia, and, perhaps
                    also, Giovanni Maria Nanini, in a music-school founded by <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    when, by favour of Pope Julius III., he was elected Magister Cappellae and
                    Magister Puerorum at the Cappella Giulia, S. Pietro in Vaticano, with a salary
                    of six scudi per month, and a house. Three years later he published his <hi

                    beginning with the Missa “Ecce Sacerdos magnus,” concerning which we shall have
                    to speak more particularly hereafter.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The first edition of this was printed in 1554; the

                    Pope Julius III., among the singers of the Cappella Sistina. This honour
                    involved the resignation of his office at the Cappella Giulia, which was
                    accordingly bestowed upon his friend Animuccia. But the legality of the new
                    appointment was disputed on the ground that Palestrina was married, and the
                    father of four children, his wife, Lucrezia, being still alive; and, though, for
                    the moment, the pope’s will was law, the case assumed a different complexion
                    after his death, which took place only five weeks afterwards. The next pope,
                    Marcellus II., was succeeded, after a reign of twenty-three days, by Paul IV.;
                    and within less than a year <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> that stern reformer
                    dismissed Palestrina, together with two other married singers, Ferrabosco and
                    Bari, with a consolatory pension of six scudi per month to each. This cruel
                    disappointment caused Palestrina a dangerous illness; but better fortune was in
                    store. In October 1555 he was appointed Maestro di Cappella at the Lateran,
                    without forfeiting his pension; and in February 1561 he exchanged this
                    preferment for a similar one, with an allowance of sixteen scudi per month, at
                    Santa Maria Maggiore.</p>
                <p>Palestrina remained in office at this celebrated basilica for ten years; and it
                    was during this period that the most critical event in his life took place—an
                    event of such grave importance that its results have never ceased to furnish
                    matter for discussion to the musical historian from the time of its occurrence
                    to the present day.</p>
                <p>In 1562 the council of Trent censured the prevalent style of ecclesiastical music
                    with extreme severity. In 1564 Pope Pius IV. commissioned eight cardinals to
                    investigate the causes of complaint; and these proved to be so well founded that
                    it was seriously proposed to forbid the use of all music in the services of the
                    church, except unisonous and unaccompanied plain-chant—a proceeding which, so
                    far as the church was concerned, would have rendered the “art of music,”
                    properly so called, a dead letter, not only for the time being, but in
                    perpetuity, for the decree, once promulgated, could only have been repealed by
                    another general council.</p>
                <p>It is evident that very gross abuses must have been needed to justify so
                    stringent a measure as this in the eyes of men accustomed to regard art as the
                    obedient handmaid of religion; yet, strange to say, the nature of these abuses
                    has never yet been clearly established by any musical historian, either English
                    or foreign. Baini devotes several chapters of his great work<note

                    arriving at any definite conclusion. Burney and Hawkins seem to have regarded
                    the question as one involving no deeper significance than a more or less exalted
                    standard of artistic pπrity. Ambros, generally so reasonable a critic, denies
                    the existence of any just ground of complaint at all, even in the limited sense
                    claimed by Burney and Hawkins, and condemns the severer censures of Baini and
                    his followers as attempts to substantiate a groundless myth. Bernsdorf speaks
                    little less strongly, simply because a certain tradition, which represented the
                    circumstances as having taken place in 1555, during the short reign of Pope
                    Marcellus it., has been proved to be certainly false. That more than one
                    groundless myth have been substituted for the real account of the occurrence is
                    true enough—one, at least, involving an anachronism of no less than twelve
                    centuries. But no sober historian has ever credited these absurd stories; and it
                    is not to them that Baini gives currency or that Ambros objects. The misfortune
                    is that each successive narrator has perpetuated the vague statements of his
                    predecessors, instead of seeking for information at original sources; and this
                    mistaken course lias resulted in an infinity of oracular utterances, no two of
                    which agree. To conflicting opinions like these, one only form of answer is
                    possible— that furnished by contemporary documents. Fortunately, an immense
                    amount of church music, written in the style universally cultivated at the
                    period of which we are treating, has been preserved to us both in MS. and in
                    print; and, though the forms of notation employed by its transcribers are no
                    longer in common use, students of mediaeval music are able to decipher them with
                    absolute certainty. Objections like those raised by Ambros can therefore be met
                    by reference to examples of the music actually sung at the time the council of
                    Trent condemned the then prevailing style.</p>
                <p>The first impression derived from the study of these venerable records tends to
                    confirm a statement already made, to the effect that the art of music was
                    rapidly degenerating into a mere system of figures. There is evidence enough to
                    prove the existence, from the 14th century downwards, of a growing tendency to
                    cultivate, at the expense of ideal beauty, certain forms of technical ingenuity
                    worthy only of association with a clever conundrum. A canon which could be sung
                    upside down, as well as backwards and forwards, was more highly esteemed than
                    one that could be sung backwards and forwards only. The amount of skjll and
                    learning wasted on the construction of such canons was almost incredible; and
                    equally so was the puerility of the conceits with which men known to have been
                    profound scholars endeavoured to give an additional zest to their strange
                    inventions. When the construction of a canon, often written in the form of a
                    cross or a rainbow, was so complicated that it was almost impossible to find out
                    how to sing it, they hinted at the secret by means of a motto as obscure as the
                    music itself. In one instance, <hi rend="italic">Respice</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >me,</hi><hi rend="italic">ostende mihi faciem tuam,</hi> indicates that two
                    singers are to hold the music between them, each reading it upside down from the
                    other’s point of view. In another, <hi rend="italic">Justitia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et Poux, osculatae</hi><hi rend="italic">sunt</hi> intimates that
                    two singers are to begin simultaneously at opposite ends of the music, singing
                    all the notes in correct time until they meet in the middle. In a third case,
                    Bdτραχos <hi rend="italic">lκ 2eρi&lt;f&gt;oυ</hi> means that a certain voice is
                    to be silent—in allusion to Aelian’s assertion that the frogs on the island of
                    Seriphus do not croak. We do not say that all the music of the period was of
                    this character; but a multitude of such examples, written by the most celebrated
                    musicians of the Middle Ages, have been preserved to us, and most of them are
                    adapted to the words of the Mass. Surely the council had just right to complain
                    of this.</p>
                <p>Another still more serious abuse consisted in the introduction, among the words
                    of the Mass, of foreign passages having no connexion whatever with the original
                    text,—one voice being made to sing “Alleluia” or “Ave Maria,” while others were
                    singing the words of the “Credo” or the “Sanctus.”</p>
                <p>In order to justly appreciate the true bearing of this very prevalent abuse, it
                    will be necessary for the English Church composer to divest himself of certain
                    not very unnatural prejudices, —and, first of all, of the idea that the custom
                    implied intentional irreverence on the part of those who introduced it, which,
                    in spite of appearances, it certainly did not. In England the music sung forms
                    an essential part of the service. This is not the case with the Mass. In
                    reciting the prescribed form of words with the prescribed ceremonies, the
                    officiating priest fulfils unaided all the necessary conditions of the service,
                    while the congregation looks on and worships, and the choir endeavours to excite
                    its devotion by singing appropriate music. As a matter of fact, the words to
                    which this music is set are identical with a portion of those recited by the
                    priest; but they represent no essential element of the service, nor are they for
                    the most part sung at the same time that the priest recites them. Except in the
                    delivery of a few responses, the action of the choir is entirely independent of
                    that of the priest; and the action of the congregation is independent of both.
                    Each member of it may use any book of devotions he pleases, and he will
                    generally be careful to use prayers and meditations suitable to the festival in
                    which he is taking part. For instance, at Christmas he will meditate on the
                    nativity of our Lord, at Easter on His resurrection, —continuing his meditations
                    on these subjects, without reference, during the greater part of the mass, to
                    the words the priest is reciting. It is only by bearing these facts carefully in
                    mind that we can rightly understand what is to follow.</p>
                <p>The mediaeval composer very rarely constructed his Mass upon an original subject.
                    His favourite plan was to select as his principal theme a fragment of some
                    well-known plain-chant hymn or antiphon, and from the words proper to this
                    melody— technically called the <hi rend="italic">canto fermo—</hi> the Mass was
                    named. We <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n197/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0197-0180"/> still possess countless examples of the Missa
                    “Aeterna Christi munera,” the Missa “Vidi turbam magnam,” “Repleatur os meum,”
                    “Dum complerentur,” “Iste Confessor,” and others of like character, all named
                    after the <hi rend="italic">canti</hi><hi rend="italic">fcrmi</hi> on which they
                    are based, though, except in a few comparatively rare cases to be presently
                    mentioned, the words proper to the <hi rend="italic">canti</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fcrmi</hi> do not appear in the work, the selected melody being adapted to the
                    actual words of the Mass. And thus far the custom was not only an
                    unobjectionable but a thoroughly commendable one; for the melodies employed were
                    familiar to every educated member of the congregation, and to these the sound of
                    the well-known tune must necessarily have suggested the sacred words belonging
                    to it, and that so powerfully that the performance on Christmas Day of a Mass
                    founded on the melody of “Hodie Christus natus est,” or on Whitsunday of one
                    based on that of “Veui, Creator Spiritus,” could scarcely have failed to induce
                    in the minds of the assembled worshippers the exact train of meditation most
                    desirable on these great festivals.</p>
                <p>Had composers been contented with this, all would have been well. But unhappily
                    they were tempted to add the extraneous words; and their intention, in doing so,
                    has been grossly misrepresented. They have been accused of wilfully sacrificing
                    sense to sound, with the unworthy object of displaying their technical skill to
                    greater advantage. At the first blush there may seem some truth in this; but
                    here again the strictures will not bear examination in presence of the actual
                    records.</p>
                <p>Nearly a century before the birth of Palestrina, Joannes de Tinctoris—the
                    compiler of the earliest known <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Musical
                    Terms—</hi> wrote a Mass in which one voice interpolated the words here printed
                    in italics, while the others sang the authorized text, exactly as it appears in
                    the Missal :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cherubim ac seraphim</hi><hi rend="italic">exterique spiritus
                    angelici</hi><hi rend="italic">Deo in allissimis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >incessabili</hi><hi rend="italic">voce</hi><hi rend="italic">proclamant,</hi>
                    “Sanctus, Sanctus, Sanctus, Dominus Dens Sabaoth.” <hi rend="italic">“Pueri
                    Hebrxorum sternentes vestimenta ramos palmarum Jesu filio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >David</hi><hi rend="italic">clamabant</hi> Osanna in excelsis." “Benedictus <hi
                    rend="italic">semper</hi><hi rend="italic">sit filius Altissimi,</hi> qui <hi
                    rend="italic">de coelis huc</hi> venit in nomine Domini.”</p>
                <p>Clearly this is nothing more than an amplification of the received version—a
                    reverent commentary upon the words actually recited by the priest. In what way
                    can the addition of these extraneous sentences conduce to the display of the
                    composer’s musical learning? He might just as easily have set the same notes to
                    the unaltered text.</p>
                <p>Again, Palestrina himself begins his <hi rend="italic">Liber primus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Missarum,</hi> already mentioned, with a Mass for which he has
                    chosen, as a <hi rend="italic">canto fermo,</hi> the entire melody of the
                    gradual, “Ecce Sacerdos magnus,” sung on the festivals of certain great doctors
                    of the church, such as Ambrose and Athanasius, —one voice being constantly
                    employed in the reiteration of this in long, slow notes, sung to its own proper
                    words, while three others sing the authorized text in the usual way. What object
                    could possibly have tempted the composer to arrange his music thus, other than
                    that of using the familiar words and tune as a means of reminding his hearers of
                    the great work wrought by the saints whose festival they are commemorating?
                    Palestrina was the last man in the world to have paraded his learning; and, had
                    he wished to call attention to it, he might have done so in a hundred easier
                    ways. Indeed, if the Mass were to be sung to-morrow, nothing would be easier
                    than to fit the words of the Mass to the notes of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >canto</hi><hi rend="italic">ferma</hi> throughout. Still, notwithstanding the
                    innocence of the composer’s intention, there can be no doubt that the custom was
                    a highly reprehensible one; and it led to something very much worse.</p>
                <p>The troubadours and minnesingers of the Middle Ages produced a host of beautiful
                    secular melodies, many of which still live among us in the guise of “national
                    airs,” though the names of their authors have been forgotten for ages. The
                    beauty of many of these melodies tempted composers to select them as <hi
                    rend="italic">canti</hi><hi rend="italic">fermi</hi> for their Masses; and not a
                    few such works were actually named after them, as the Missa “L’Homme armé” (a
                    very common example), the Missa “Mon cueur se recommande à vous,” and many
                    others. And in this the mediaeval musician had no more thought of intentional
                    irreverence than had the Flemish painter when he represented the Nativity as
                    taking place in a little roadside hostelry like that to which he was accustomed
                    to resoι ’ t for his evening meal. But he committed a grave error of judgment.
                    For, just as the sound of the sacred <hi rend="italic">canto fermo</hi>-brought
                    to remembrance the words with which it was connected, so, we may be sure, did
                    that of the secular one; and the greater its beauty the more surely would it do
                    its evil work. It was by its beauty alone that it attracted the composer; yet
                    his treatment of it proves beyond all doubt that he meant no evil. This,
                    however, is the last stage of our history at which we can acquit him of it; and
                    perhaps even here we may have strained the point a little too far.</p>
                <p>As might naturally have been expected, the introduction of the secular <hi
                    rend="italic">canto fermo</hi> was followed by exactly the same results as that
                    of the sacred one. It took a longer time to bring about the evil, but it came at
                    last. The familiar words were sung to the familiar notes, not by the will of the
                    composer, who would never have dared to insert them, even had he wished to do
                    so, but by that of profane singers, who surreptitiously trolled them forth for
                    the gratification of a prurient taste, while the great body of the choir adhered
                    to the sacred text. And, in the face of these undeniable facts, Hawkins calmly
                    speaks of the reform as one of style only, while Ambros, intoxicated by the
                    beauty of so much of the music preserved to us, and especially by the
                    compositions of Claude Goudimel, for whom he entertained a well-founded
                    admiration, tells us, in so many words, that no reform of church music was ever
                    needed or demanded, and that no such reform as that popularly attributed to the
                    influence of Palestrina ever took place.</p>
                <p>Two of the commissioners, however,—Cardinals Borromeo and Vitellozzi,—while
                    admitting the urgent need of reform, pleaded for a compromise, and happily the
                    commission agreed to postpone its final decision until Palestrina—· already
                    recognized as the greatest composer then living— had been permitted to prove, if
                    be could, the possibility of producing a Mass which should not only be free from
                    the abuses complained of, but should also conduce to the excitation of true
                    devotional feeling by bringing the plain sense of the words into the strongest
                    possible relief, and that so manifestly that it might be presented to all future
                    composers as the pattern of what true ecclesiastical music ought evermore to
                    be.</p>
                <p>A careful comparison of Palestrina’s works with those of the best of his
                    contemporaries conclusively proves that in him alone were united all the
                    qualifications necessary for the success of this difficult attempt, which
                    demanded the earnestness of a deeply religious mind, the science of a profoundly
                    learned musician, and the refined taste of an artist whose sense of beauty was
                    strong enough to overcome all desire for the display of technical power at the
                    expense of that delicacy of expression without which the required solemnity of
                    style would have been unattainable. Animuccia lived as holy a life as
                    Palestrina. The elder Nanini, if not so learned a musician as he, was at any
                    rate more learned than by far the greater number of his contemporaries. But the
                    world had yet to learn how far refinement of taste could be carried in the
                    composition of sacred music; and upon Palestrina devolved the duty of teaching
                    it its lesson. Ockenheim had already astonished it by the ingenuity with which
                    he evolved from the contrapuntal materials at his command a form so
                    symmetrically proportioned that it seemed as if no future artificer could add to
                    its perfection<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For
                    examples, consult the <hi rend="italic">Dodecachordon of</hi> Glareanus, and
                    Petrucci’s <hi rend="italic">Odhecaton</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Canti</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">C. No. cento cinquanta.</hi></p></note>; but the materials were
                    dry bones, and the resulting form no more than a wonderfully articulated
                    sk,eleton. To the erudition of Ockenheim Josquin Deprès united the fire of true
                    genius. To him we are indebted for many, if not most, of the finest works
                    produced before the age of Palestrina.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See two extremely rare volumes of his Masses in the library
                    of the British Museum.</p></note> Yet even he could do no more than clothe
                    Ockenheim’s bare skeleton with flesh. It remained for Palestrina to breathe into
                    the perfect body the breath of that artistic life which alone could enable it to
                    give thanks to the Creator of all things in tones which betokened the presence
                    of the soul within it. He first taught the world that music was not a mere
                    lifeless collection of notes,—that, as the gift of speech enabled man to express
                    his thoughts to his fellow-man, so the gift of harmony enabled him to express
                    his feelings, whether of devotion, or praise, or prayer, and this so
                    intelligibly that he might “sing praises with understanding” in the truest sense
                    of the words. And it was to the decree of the council of Trent that he was
                    indebted for the opportunity of showing how great a work it was possible to
                    accomplish in this direction, as well as for the means of accomplishing it with
                    such good effect that to this day the results are apparent in every church in
                    which true ecclesiastical music is sung.</p>
                <p>Dreading to trust the issue of so severe a trial to a single work, Palestrina,
                    with characteristic modesty, submitted <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n198/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0198-0181"/> three Masses to Cardinal Carlo Borromeo for
                    approval. These were privately rehearsed, in presence of the commissioners, at
                    the palace of Cardinal Vitellozzi; and, while warmly admiring them all, the
                    judges were unanimous in deciding that the third mass fulfilled, in the highest
                    possible degree, all the conditions demanded. The private trial took place in
                    June 1565; and, on the 19th of that month, the Mass was publicly sung at the
                    Sistine Chapel, in presence of Pope Pius IV., who compared its music to that
                    heard by St John in his vision of the New Jerusalem. Thenceforth it was formally
                    accepted as the type of all true ecclesiastical music. Parvi transcribed it, for
                    the library of the choir, in characters of extraordinary size and beauty; and,
                    in acknowledgment of his services to art, Palestrina was appointed by the pope
                    composer to the Sistine Chapel, an office created expressly in his honour, and
                    confirmed to him by seven later pontiffs, though with the very insufficient
                    honorarium of three scudi per month, in addition to the six which formed his
                    pension.</p>
                <p>In 1567 this Mass was printed in Palestrina’s <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">secundus Missarum.</hi> The volume was dedicated to Philip II. of
                    Spain, but the Mass was called the “Missa Papae Marcelli.” This title, clearly
                    given in honour of the shortlived pope Marcellus II., has given rise to an
                    absurd story, told by Pellegrini and others, to the effect that the Mass was
                    composed by Pope Marcellus I., martyred early in the 4th century, and was only
                    discovered by Palestrina. Of course, in the 4th century the composition of such
                    music was impossible; but this is only a specimen of the innumerable fables
                    which have brought the true history into disrepute. The Missa Papae Marcelli is
                    undoubtedly Palestrina’s greatest work. Its ineffable beauty has often been
                    described in glowing terms by those who have heard it in the Sistine Chapel, but
                    it was never heard in England until 1882, when the Bach choir, consisting of two
                    hundred unaccompanied voices, sang it at St James’s Hall, under the direction of
                    Mr Otto Goldschmidt; and the effect produced on that occasion more than
                    justified all that had ever been said of the music, which is certainly the most
                    beautiful, the most solemn, and the most truly devotional that has ever been
                    dedicated to the service of the church.</p>
                <p>We have dwelt at some length on these circumstances, because they left a more
                    indelible impression upon the history of art than any other events in
                    Palestrina’s life, which was not what the world would call a prosperous one,
                    though he himself was quite satisfied with his condition.</p>
                <p>Upon the death of Animuccia in 1571 Palestrina was re-elected to his appointment
                    at the Cappella Giulia. He also succeeded Animuccia as Maestro di Cappella at
                    the Oratory of Philip Neri; but these appointments were far from lucrative, and
                    he still remained a very poor man. In 1580 he was much distressed by the death
                    of his wife; and the loss of three promising sons, Angelo, Rιdolfo, and Silla,
                    left him with one child only—Igino—a very unworthy descendant. In 1586 a new
                    trouble befel him: Pope Sixtus V. wished to appoint him maestro to the
                    pontifical choir, as successor to Antonio Boccapadule, then about to resign, and
                    commissioned Boccapadule to prepare the choir for the change. Boccapadule,
                    however, managed so clumsily that Palestrina was accused of having meanly
                    plotted for his own advancement. The pope was very angry, and punished the
                    calumniators very severely; but Palestrina lost the appointment. These troubles,
                    however, did not hinder his work, which he continued, without intermission,
                    until February 2, 1594, when he breathed his last in the arms of his friend,
                    Filippo Neri.</p>
                <p>The printed works of Palestrina include twelve volumes of Masses; seven .volumes
                    of Motets for from four to twelve voices; two volumes of Offertoria, and one of
                    Hymns, for the whole year; one volume of Lamentations, three of Litanies, and
                    one of Magnificats; two of Madrigals, the loveliest in existence; and two of
                    Madrigali spirituali; besides an immense number of compositions still remaining
                    in MS. The whole of these are now in course of publication by Breitkopf and
                    Härtel, of Leipsic. ( W. S. R. )</p>
