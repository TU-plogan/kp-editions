                    (1628-1703), the most prominent author of France in a specially French kind of
                    literature—the fairy tale—and one of the chief actors in the famous literary
                    quarrel of ancients and moderns, was born at Paris on 12th January 1628. His
                    father, Pierre Perrault, was a barrister, all whose four sons were men of some
                    distinction,—Claude, the second, who was first a physician and then an
                    architect, being the best known next to Charles the youngest. The latter was
                    brought up at the Collège de Beauvais, until he chose to quarrel with his
                    masters, after which (an incident rather rare at the time when patriarchal
                    government of families was in full fashion) he was allowed to follow his own
                    bent in the way of study. He took his degree of “licencié en droit” at Orleans
                    in 1651, and was almost immediately called to the Paris bar, where, however, he
                    practised for a very short time. In 1654 his father bought himself the post of
                    receiver-general at Paris, and made Charles his clerk. After nearly ten years of
                    this employment he was, in 1663, chosen by Colbert as his secretary in a curious
                    and not easily describable office. Put shortly, Perrault’s duties were to assist
                    and advise the minister in matters relating to the arts and sciences, not
                    forgetting literature. The protection of Colbert procured a place in the
                    Académie Française for his protégé in 1671, and Perrault justified his election
                    in several ways. One was the orderly arrangement of the business affairs of the
                    Academy, another was the suggestion of the custom (which more than anything else
                    has given the institution a hold on the French public) of holding public <hi
                    rend="italic">seances</hi> for the reception of candidates. Colbert’s death in
                    1683 put an end to Perrault’s official career, but even before that event he had
                    experienced the morose and ungenerous temper which was the great drawback of
                    that very capable statesman. He now gave himself up to literature, in which,
                    like most men of his time, he had made some experiments already. The famous
                    dispute of ancients and moderns is said to have arisen in consequence of some
                    words used by Perrault in one of the regular academic discourses, on which
                    Boileau, with his usual rudeness, commented in violent terms. Perrault, though a
                    very good-natured man, had ideas and a will of his own, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Parallèle des Anciens et des Modernes,</hi> which appeared between
                    1688 and 1696, was the result. The well-known controversy that followed in its
                    train raged hotly in France, passed thence to England, and in the days of La
                    Motte and Fénelon broke out again in the country of its origin. As far as
                    Perrault is concerned, he was inferior to his adversaries in learning, but
                    decidedly superior to them in wit. It is not known what, except the general
                    popularity of the fairy tale in the last decade of the century, drew Perrault to
                    the composition of the only works of his which are still read. The first of
                    them, <hi rend="italic">Criselidis,</hi> which is in verse, appeared in 1691,
                    <hi rend="italic">Peau P Ane</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Les Souhaits</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ridicules,</hi> also in verse, in 1694. But Perrault was no poet,
                    and the merit of these pieces is entirely obscured by that of the prose tales,

                    criticism of these famous productions is necessary, and it is scarcely less
                    superfluous to observe that Perrault has no claim to the invention of the
                    subjects. His merit is that he has treated them with a literary skill in
                    adapting style to matter which cannot possibly be exceeded. Of his other work
                    some <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> and academic <hi rend="italic">Éloges</hi>
                    need alone be mentioned. He died on 16 th May 17Ó3.</p>
                <p>Except the tales, Perrault’s works have not recently been reprinted. Of the tales
                    the best recent editions are those of Giraud (Lyons, 1865) and Lefévre (Paris,
                    1875).</p>
