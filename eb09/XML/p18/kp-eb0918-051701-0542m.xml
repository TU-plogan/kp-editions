                    and oblong-obtuse spike-like heads of flowers. It is met with, near streams and
                    in wet places, in several parts of England and on the Continent, and is also
                    extensively cultivated for the sake of its essential oil in England,<note

                    continental Europe, and in the United States. Yet it was only recognized as a
                    distinct species late in the 17th century, when Dr Eales discovered it in
                    Hertfordshire and pointed it out to Ray, who published it in the second edition
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Synopsis</hi><hi rend="italic">Stirpium
                    Britannicarum</hi> (1696). The medicinal properties of the plant were speedily
                    recognized, and it was admitted into the <hi rend="italic">London
                    Pharmacopoeia</hi> in 1721, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Mentha</hi><hi

                <p>Two varieties are recognized by growers, the one being known as white and the
                    other as black mint. The former has purplish and the latter green stems; the
                    leaves are more coarsely serrated in the white. The black is the variety more
                    generally cultivated, probably because it is found to yield more oil, but that
                    of the green variety is considered to have a more delicate odour, and obtains a
                    higher price. The green is the kind chiefly dried for herbalists; it is said to
                    be of less vigorous growth than the black. The annual yield of peppermint oil
                    from all parts of the world has been estimated at 90,000 B⅛, but this is
                    probably much below the mark, without taking into consideration the Chinese and
                    Japanese oils of peppermint, which, however, are obtained from a different
                    species of mint.</p>
                <p>Peppermint oil varies considerably in commercial value, that of Mitcham
                    commanding nearly three times the price of the finest American. The flavour
                    varies to a slight extent even with particular plots of land, badly drained
                    ground being known to give unfavourable results both as to the quantity and
                    quality of the oil. That of the Japanese and Chinese oil also differs slightly
                    from the English, and is thus distinguishable by experts. In America the oil is
                    liable to be injured in flavour by aromatic weeds which grow freely among the
                    crop, the most troublesome of these being <hi rend="italic">Erigeron
                    canadense,</hi> L., and <hi rend="italic">Erechthites hieracifolia,</hi> Raf.
                    When pure the oil is nearly colourless and has an agreeable odour and powerful
                    aromatic taste, followed by a sensation of cold when air is drawn into the
                    mouth. It has a specific gravity of 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 84 to 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 92, and boils at 365° Fahr. Mitcham oil, when
                    examined by polarized light in a column 50 mm. long, deviates from 14°‘2 to
                    10°'7 <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n543/mode/1up"

                    peppermint is cooled to 4° C. it sometimes deposits colourless hexagonal prisms
                    of menthol, C <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 20</hi> O,
                    which are soluble in alcohol and ether, almost insoluble in water, and fusible
                    at 92 Fahr. The liquid portion of the oil appears to consist chiefly of the
                    compound C <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> ιs</hi> O, but
                    it has not been thoroughly investigated. Oil of peppermint is often adulterated
                    with a third part of rectified spirit, which may be detected by the milkiness
                    produced when the oil is agitated with water. Oil of rosemary and rectified oil
                    of turpentine are sometimes used for the same purpose. If the oil contains
                    turpentine it will explode with iodine. If quite pure it dissolves in its own
                    weight of rectified spirits of wine. Peppermint oil is largely distilled at
                    Canton, a considerable quantity (about 300 catties annually) being sent to
                    Bombay, also about 600 catties of menthol. The exports from Canton in 1883
                    amounted to about 1200 ft).</p>
                <p>The species cultivated in the neighbourhood of Canton, and probably at Shanghai
                    also, is <hi rend="italic">Mentlιa arvensis,</hi> var. <hi rend="italic"
                    >glabrata.</hi> Peppermint is. chiefly cultivated in the province of Keang-se;
                    and according to native statements as much as 40 piculs of oil of peppermint are
                    sent annually to ports on the coast. In Japan also the distillation of oil of
                    peppermint forms a considerable industry, the plant cultivated being <hi
                    rend="italic">M. arvensis,</hi> var. <hi rend="italic">puerascens</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Ph. Joum.</hi> [3] vol. ii. p. 324), of which both a purplish and
                    a white form appear to be grown. The oil, under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >hαkka no abura,</hi> is exported from Hiogo and Ozaka, but is said to be
                    frequently adulterated. Since 1872 the peppermint camphor or menthol has been
                    largely exported in the separate state from Japan to Germany and Great Britain.
                    The menthol is obtained by subjecting the oil to a low temperature, when it
                    crystallizes out and is separated. The two varieties of <hi rend="italic">M.
                    arvensis</hi> just named yield much more menthol than <hi rend="italic">M.
                    Piperita.</hi> It is remarkable, however, that the <hi rend="italic">M.
                    arvensis,</hi> var. <hi rend="italic">javanica,</hi> Blume, growing in Ceylon,
                    has not the flavour of peppermint but that of garden mint, while the typical
                    form of <hi rend="italic">M. arvensis</hi> grown in Great Britain has an odour
                    so different from peppermint that it has to be carefully removed from the field
                    lest it should spoil the flavour of the peppermint oil when the herb is
                    distilled. <hi rend="italic">M. incana,</hi> Willd., cultivated near Bombay as a
                    herb, also possesses the flavour of peppermint. In the form in which menthol is
                    imported it bears some resemblance to Epsom salts, with which it is said to be
                    sometimes adulterated. It is usually not entirely free from the essential oil,
                    and consequently undergoes purification and recrystallization in England and on
                    the Continent. The amount of menthol imported by a large firm at Leipsic between
                    September 1883 and April 1884 is stated by them to have been 6380 ft), while it
                    is certain that at least an equal quantity is imported into England from
                    Yokohama. Although the Japanese peppermint plant has been imported by a London
                    merchant, no attempt has as yet been made to cultivate the plant in order to
                    manufacture menthol in England. Menthol is now (1884), however, manufactured
                    from <hi rend="italic">M. Piperita</hi> in the United States, where also <hi
                    rend="italic">M. arvensis,</hi> var. <hi rend="italic">piperascens,</hi> is
                    cultivated.</p>
                <p>Oil of peppermint is used in medicine as an antispasmodic for the relief of
                    griping pains in the alimentary canal, to expel flatulence, to relieve nausea,
                    to hide the taste of other medicines, and to act as an adjunct to purgatives.
                    The dose is usually from one to three minims. It forms a most valuable remedy in
                    diarrhoea, acting as an antiseptic, and as a stimulant to the circulation, and
                    as an anodyne. The oil rubbed over the head is used in China to cure sunstroke.
                    Menthol has lately come largely into use as a remedy for neuralgia, being
                    moulded by heat into the form of small cones, which are rubbed over the part
                    affected. A small portion placed on the tongue frequently relieves headache, and
                    catarrh and coryza if placed in the nostril. The largest consumption of the oil
                    is in the manufacture of peppermint lozenges.</p>
                <p>The following mode of cultivation is adopted by Mr Holland, at Market Deeping. A
                    rich friable soil, retentive of moisture, is selected, and the ground is well
                    tilled 8 to 10 inches deep. The plants are propagated in the spring, usually in
                    April and May. When the young shoots from the crop of the previous year have
                    attained a height of about 4 inches they are pulled up and transplanted into new
                    soil. They grow vigorously the first year, and throw out numerous stolons on the
                    surface of the ground. After the crop has been removed these are allowed to
                    harden or become woody, and then farmyard manure is scattered over the field and
                    ploughed in. In this way the stolons are divided into numerous pieces, and
                    covered with soil before the frost sets in. If the autumn is wet they are liable
                    to become sodden, and rot, and the next crop fails. In the spring the fields are
                    dressed with Peruvian guano. In new ground the peppermint requires hand-weeding
                    two or three times, as the hoe cannot be used without injury to the plants.
                    Moist heavy weather in August is apt to cause the foliage to drop off and leave
                    the stems almost bare. Under these circumstances rust <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pucciniα Nenthae)</hi> also is liable to attack the plants. This is prevented
                    to a certain extent by a rope being drawn across the plants, by two men walking
                    in the furrows, so as to remove excessive moisture. The average yield of
                    peppermint is about 165 cwt. per acre. The first year’s crop is always cut with
                    the sickle to prevent injury to the stolons. The herb of the second and third
                    year is cut with scythes, and then raked by women into loose heaps ready for
                    carting. The field is then gleaned by boys, who add what they collect to the
                    heaps. The plants rarely yield a fourth crop on the same land. The harvest
                    usually commences in the beginning or middle of August, or as soon as the plants
                    begin to flower, and lasts for six weeks, the stills being kept going night and
                    day. The herb is carted direct from the field to the stills, which are made of
                    copper, and contain about 5 cwt. of the herb. Before putting the peppermint into
                    the still water is poured in to a depth of about 2 feet, at which height a false
                    bottom is placed, and on this the herb is thrown and trodden down by men. The
                    lid, which fits into a water-joint, is then let down by pulleys and fastened by
                    two bars, any excess of pressure or temperature being indicated by the water
                    that is ejected at the joint. The distillation is conducted by the application
                    of direct heat at the lowest possible temperature, and is continued for about
                    four and a half hours. When this operation is completed, the lid is removed and
                    a rope is attached to a hook on the false bottom, which, as well as the herb
                    resting on it, is raised bodily by a windlass and the peppermint carried away in
                    the empty carts on their return journey to the fields, where it is placed in
                    heaps and allowed to rot, being subsequently mixed with the manure applied in
                    the autumn as above stated.</p>
                <p>At Mitcham extra payment is given to the reapers to induce them to keep the mint
                    free from corn mint <hi rend="italic">{Μentha arvensis)</hi> and other herbs,
                    which would injure or spoil the flavour of the oil if not removed before
                    distillation. The usual yield of oil, if the season be warm and dry, is said to
                    be 1 oz. from 5 lb of the fresh flowering herb, but, if wet and unfavourable,
                    the product is barely half that quantity. Mr Holland estimates the yield of a
                    charge of the still at from 1 lb 12 oz. to 5 lb. The oil improves in mellowness
                    even if kept as long as ten or fourteen years. The green colour sometimes
                    present in the oil is stated to be due to a quantity of water larger than
                    necessary having been used in the distillation; on the other hand, if the herb
                    be left in the still from Saturday to Monday, the oil assumes a brown tint</p>
                <p>In France peppermint is cultivated on damp rich ground at Sens, in the department
                    of the Yonne. In Germany it is grown in the neighbourhood of Leipsic, where the
                    little town of Cölleda produces annually as much as 40,000 cwt. of the herb. In
                    the United States peppermint is cultivated on a most extensive scale, chiefly in
                    southern Michigan, the west districts of New York State, and Ohio. The amount of
                    peppermint oil now produced in the United States has been estimated at 70,000 lb
                    annually, of which 30,000 lb are exported, about two-thirds of this quantity
                    being produced in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n544/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0544-0519"/> New York State and the remaining one-third in
                    Michigan. The yield averages from 10 to 30 lb per acre. The cultivation of
                    peppermint has recently been extended to the southern States. In Michigan the
                    plant was introduced in 1855, and in 1858 there were about ‘2100 acres under
                    cultivation, and 100 distilleries yielding 15,000 tb of oil. In 1870 one of the
                    best-known growers of New York State is said to have sent out as much as 57,365
                    lb. In 1876 the United States exported to Hamburg 25,840 lb of peppermint oil
                    against 14,890 lb sent by Great Britain to the same port. (E. Μ. H.)</p>
