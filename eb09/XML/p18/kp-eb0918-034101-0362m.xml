                    should, perhaps, more especially deal with public men and public things. The
                    distinction, however, has been rarely observed in practice, and the chief
                    interest in the word is in its curious and rather legendary origin. According to
                    the received tradition, Pasquino was a tailor (others say a cobbler) who had a
                    biting tongue, and lived in the 15th century at Rome. His name, at the end of
                    that century or the beginning of the next, was transferred to a statue which had
                    been dug up in a mutilated condition (some say near his shop) and was set up at
                    the corner of the Palazzo Orsini (α∕. Palazzo Braschi). To this statue it became
                    the custom to affix squibs on the papal Government aħd on prominent persons. At
                    the beginning of the 16th century Pasquin had a partner provided for him in the
                    shape of another statue found in the Campus Martius, said to represent a river
                    god, and dubbed Marforio, <hi rend="italic">a foro Martis.</hi> The regulation
                    form of the pasquinade then became one of dialogue or rather question and
                    answer, in which Marforio usually addressed leading inquiries to his friend. The
                    proceeding soon attained a certain European notoriety, and a printed collection
                    of the squibs due to it (they were long written in Latin verse, with an
                    occasional excursion into Greek) appeared in 1510. In the first book of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pantagruel</hi> (1532 or there abouts) Rabelais introduces books
                    by Pasquillus arid Marρhurius in the catalogue of the library of St Victor, and
                    later he quotes some utterances of Pasquin’s in his letters to the bishop of
                    Maillezais. These, by the way, show that Pasquin was by no means always
                    satirical, but dealt in grave advice and comment. The 16th century was indeed
                    Pasquin’s palmy time, and in not a few of the rare printed collections of his
                    utterances Protestant polemic (which was pretty certainly not attempted on the
                    actual statue) is mingled. These utterances were not only called pasquinades but
                    simply pasquils <hi rend="italic">(Pasquillus, Pas-quillo,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pasquille),</hi> and this form was sometimes used for the mythical personage
                    himself. Under this title a considerable satirical literature of quite a
                    different kind from the original personal squibs and political comments grew up
                    in England at the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th century under
                    the titles of <hi rend="italic">Pasquil</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s Apology,
                    Pasquil</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s Nightcap,</hi> &lt;fcc. The chief writers
                    were Thomas Nash and, after his death, Nicholas Breton. These pieces (of extreme
                    rarity, but lately reissued by the Rev. A. B. Grosart, in private reprints of
                    the works of their authors) were in prose. The French pasquils (examples of
                    which may be found in Fournier’s <hi rend="italic">Varietes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Historiques et Littéraires)</hi> were more usually in verse. In
                    Italy itself Pasquin is said not to have condescended to the vernacular till the
                    18th century. During the first two hundred years of his career few mornings, if
                    any, found him unplacarded, and the institution supplied a kind of rough and
                    scurrilous gazette of public opinion. But the proceeding gradually lost its
                    actuality, and was, moreover, looked on with less and less favour by the
                    authorities. Indeed a sentinel was latterly posted to prevent the placarding. It
                    is said, however, that isolated pasquinades, having at least local
                    appropriateness, occurred not many years ago. Marforio, it should be added, was
                    soon removed from his companion’s neighbourhood to the Capitol. Contemporary
                    comic periodicals, especially in Italy, still occasionally use the
                    Marforio-Pasquin dialogue form. But this survival is purely artificial and
                    literary, and pasquinade has, as noted above, ceased to have any precise
                    meaning.</p>
