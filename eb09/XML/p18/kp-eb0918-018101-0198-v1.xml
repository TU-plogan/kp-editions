                <p><label type="entry">PALEY, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label> (1743-1805),
                    was born in 1743 at Peterborough, where his father was one of the minor canons
                    of the cathedral. The Paley family belonged to the West Riding of Yorkshire, and
                    in 1745 Paley’s father was appointed head master of the grammar school of
                    Giggleswick, his native parish. Here Paley received his early education under
                    his father’s care. In 1759 he proceeded to Cambridge, where his first
                    undergraduate years were given up, according to his own account, more to society
                    than to study. But, being roused by a reproof from one of his companions, he
                    used the remainder of his time to such advantage that he came out senior
                    wrangler at the end of his course. After taking his degree in 1763, Paley was
                    for about three years assistant in a school at Greenwich; but on his election to
                    a fellowship he returned to Cambridge, and became, in 1768, one of the junior
                    tutors of his college. His colleague in this office was John Law, son of Dr
                    Edmund Law, then master of Peterhouse, and afterwards bishop of Carlisle. To the
                    connexion thus formed Paley was afterwards indebted for his first preferments in
                    the church. As tutor at Christ’s, Paley lectured on Locke, Clarke, and Butler,
                    and also delivered a systematic course on moral philosophy, which formed the
                    basis, more than ten years later, of his well-known treatise. The subscription
                    controversy was then agitating the university, and Paley published an anonymous
                        <hi rend="italic">Defence</hi> of a pamphlet in which Bishop Law had
                    advocated the retrenchment and simplification of the thirty-nine articles. But,
                    though Paley was all for “worshipping God in that generality of expression in
                    which He himself has left some points,” he did not see his way to join the
                    petitioners for a relaxation of the terms of subscription. His own view of the
                    articles, as simply “articles of peace,” probably led him to consider their
                    action as a piece of overstrained conscientiousness. In 1776 Paley vacated his
                    fellowship by marriage, and retired to the rectory of Musgrave in Westmoreland,
                    which had been conferred on him the year before by the bishop of Carlisle. This
                    very modest living was soon supplemented by the vicarage of Dalston, and
                    presently exchanged for that of Appleby. In 1782 he became archdeacon of
                    Carlisle on the appointment of the younger Law to an Irish bishopric. His first
                    important work, <hi rend="italic">The Principles of Moral and Political
                        Philosophy,</hi> was published (as <hi rend="italic">Principles of Morality
                        and Politics')</hi> in 1785, and Paley received the unusually large sum of
                    &lt;£1000 for the copyright. The book at once became the ethical text-book of
                    the university of Cambridge, and passed through fifteen editions in the author’s
                    lifetime. It was followed in 1790 by his first essay in the field of Christian
                    apologetics, <hi rend="italic">Horae Paulinae,</hi><hi rend="italic">or the
                        Truth of the Scripture History of St Paul evinced by a comparison of the
                        Epistles which bear his name with the Acts of the Apostles and with one
                        another.</hi> Though the original idea of the book was derived from
                    Doddridge, this is probably the most original of its author’s works. It was
                    followed in 1794 by a more general work in the same field, the celebrated <hi
                        rend="italic">View of the Evidences of Christianity.</hi> Paley’s
                    latitudinarian views, combined with a certain homely outspokenness in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Moral and Political Philosophy</hi> regarding the foundations
                    of civil authority (“the divine right of kings is like the divine right of
                    constables ”), are said to have debarred him from the highest positions in the
                    church. But his able defence of the faith brought him substantial
                    acknowledgments from the episcopal bench. The bishop of London gave him a stall
                    in St Paul’s; the bishop of Lincoln made him subdean of that <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n199/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0918-0199-0182"/> diocese; and the bishop of Durham conferred
                    upon him the rectory of Bishop-Wearmouth, worth £1200 a year. Paley transferred
                    his household to Bishop-Wearmouth in 1795. His wife, the mother of eight
                    children, had died four years before, and in the end of 1795 Paley married a
                    second time. During the remainder of his life his time was divided between
                    Bishop-Wearmouth and Lincoln. In 1800 he was attacked by the disease of the
                    kidneys which ultimately carried him off. It was in the intervals of comparative
                    health and ease that remained to him that his last, and in some respects his
                    most remarkable, work was produced, <hi rend="italic">Natural Theology, or
                        Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity collected from the
                        Appearances of Nature</hi> (1802). He endeavoured, as he says in dedicating
                    the book to the bishop of Durham, to repair in the study his deficiencies in the
                    church. He died on the 25th May 1805.</p>
                <p>In the dedication just referred to, Paley claims a systematic unity for his
                    works. It is true that “they have been written in an order the very reverse of
                    that in which they ought to be read”; nevertheless the <hi rend="italic">Natural
                        Theology</hi> forms “the completion of a regular and comprehensive design.”
                    The truth of this will be apparent if it is considered that the <hi
                        rend="italic">Moral and Political Philosophy</hi> admittedly embodies two
                    presuppositions—(1) that “God Almighty wills and wishes the happiness of His
                    creatures,” and (2) that adequate motives must be supplied to virtue by a system
                    of future rewards and’punishments. Now the second presupposition depends,
                    according to Paley, on the credibility of the Christian religion (which he
                    treats almost exclusively as the revelation of these “new sanctions” of
                    morality). The <hi rend="italic">Evidences</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Horae</hi><hi rend="italic">Paulin«.</hi> were inténded as a demonstration
                    of this credibility. The argument of these books, however, depends in turn upon
                    the assumption of a benevolent Creator desirous of communicating with His
                    creatures for their good; and the <hi rend="italic">Natural Theology,</hi> by
                    applying the argument from design to prove the existence of such a Deity,
                    becomes the foundation of the argumentative edifice. The sense of unity in the
                    structure is increased to a reader of the present day by the uniformity of the
                    point of view from which the world is regarded throughout. Paley has popularized
                    for 19th-century use the Deistic conception of the universe and the divine
                    economy which was common ground last century both to the assailants and the
                    defenders of orthodox Christianity. ·</p>
                <p>In his <hi rend="italic">Natural Theology</hi> Paley has adapted with consummate
                    skill the argument which Ray (1691) and Derham (1711) and Nieuwentyt<note

                            was brought against Paley in the <hi rend="italic">Athenaeum</hi> for
                            1848. Paley refers several times to Nieuwentyt, who uses the famous
                            illustration of the watch. But the illustration is not peculiar to
                            Nieuwentyt, and had been appropriated by many others before Paley. In
                            the case of a writer whose chief merit is the way in which he has worked
                            up existing material, a general charge of plagiarism is almost
                            irrelevant.</p></note> (1730) had already ι <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi>
                    nade familiar to Englishmen. “For my part,” he says, “I take my stand in human
                    anatomy”; and what he everywhere insists upon is “the necessity, in each
                    particular case, of an intelligent designing mind for the contriving and
                    determining of the.forms which organized bodies bear.” This is the whole
                    argument, and the book consists of a mass of .well-chosen instances marshalled
                    in support of it. But by placing Paley’s facts in a new light, the theory of
                    evolution has deprived his argument of its force, so far as it applies the idea
                    of special contrivance to individual organs or to species. Paley’s idea of
                    contrivance is only applicable if we suppose a highly developed organism to be
                    dropped suddenly into foreign surroundings. But the relation of an organism to
                    its environment is not of this external nature, and the adaptation of the one to
                    the other must be regarded as the result of a long process of interaction in the
                    past history of the species. In thus substituting the operation of general laws
                    for Paley’s continual invocation of a supernatural cause, evolution passes no
                    judgment on the question of tne ultimate dependence of these laws upon
                    intelligence; but it evidently alters profoundly our general conception of the
                    relation of that intelligence to the world.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Evidences of Christianity</hi> is mainly a condensation of
                    Bishop Douglas’s <hi rend="italic">Criterion</hi> and Lardner’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Credibility of the Gospel History.</hi> But the task is so
                    judiciously performed that it would probably be difficult to get a more
                    effective statement of the external evidences of Christianity than Paley has
                    here presented. The general position, "however, that the action of the first
                    preachers of Christianity was due “solely” to their belief in the occurrence of
                    certain miraculous events is on the same level as the view that “the proper
                    business of a revelation” is to certify future rewards and punishments. It
                    betrays a defective analysis of the religious consciousness. For the rest, his
                    idea of revelation depends upon the same mechanical conception of the relation
                    of God to the λvorld which dominates his <hi rend="italic">Natural
                        Theology;</hi> and he seeks to prove the divine origin of Christianity by
                    isolating it from the general history of mankind, whereas later writers find
                    their chief argument in the continuity of the process of revelation.</p>

                <p>The face of the world has changed so greatly since Paley’s day that we are apt to
                    do less than justice to his undoubted merits. He is nowhere original, and
                    nowhere profound, but he justly claims to be “something more than a mere
                    compiler.” His strong reasoning power, his faculty of clear arrangement and
                    forcible statement, place him in the first rank of expositors and advocates. He
                    masses his arguments, it has been said, with a general’s eye. His style is
                    perfectly perspicuous, and its “strong home-touch” compensates for what is
                    lacking in elasticity and grace. Paley’s avoidance of ultimate speculative
                    questions commended him to his own generation, and enabled him to give full
                    scope to the shrewd practical understanding in which his strength lay. He
                    displays little or no spirituality of feeling; but this is a matter in which one
                    age is apt to misjudge another, and Paley was at least practically benevolent
                    and conscientiously attentive to his parish duties. The active part he took in
                    advocating the abolition of the slave-trade is evidence of a wider power of
                    sympathy. His unconquerable cheerfulness becomes itself almost religious in the
                    last chapters of the <hi rend="italic">Natural Theology,</hi> when we consider
                    the circumstances in which they were composed. The chapter on the goodness of
                    the Deity is more touched with feeling than any other part of his writings, and
                    impresses the reader with respect for his essential goodness of heart. (A. SE.
