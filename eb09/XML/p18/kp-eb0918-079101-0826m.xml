                    special sciences, and to indicate the main divisions into which, as matter of
                    historical fact, its treatment has fallen.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Historical Use of the Term.—</hi> 'The most helpful
                    introduction to such a task is afforded by a survey of the steps by which
                    philosophy differentiated itself, in the history of Greek thought, from the idea
                    of knowledge and culture in general. These steps may be traced in the gradual
                    specification of the term. The tradition which assigns the first employment of
                    the word to Pythagoras has hardly any claim to be regarded as authentic; and the
                    somewhat self-conscious modesty to which Diogenes Laertius attributes the choice
                    of the designation is, in all probability, a piece of etymology crystallized
                    into narrative. It is true that, as a matter of fact, the earliest uses of the
                    word (the verb <hi rend="italic">φιλοσοφεω</hi> occurs in Herodotus and
                    Thucydides) imply the idea of the <hi rend="italic">pursuit</hi> of knowledge;
                    but the distinction between the <hi rend="italic">σοφός,</hi> or wise man, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">φιλόσοφος,</hi> or lover of wisdom, appears first in the
                    Platonic writings, and lends itself naturally to the so-called Socratic irony.
                    The same thought is to be found in Xenophon, and is doubtless to be attributed
                    to the historical Socrates. But the word soon lost this special implication.
                    What is of real interest to us is to trace the progress from the idea of the
                    philosopher as occupied with any and every department of knowledge to that which
                    assigns him a special kind of knowledge as his province. A specific sense of the
                    word first meets us in Plato, who defines the philosopher as one who apprehends
                    the essence or reality of things in opposition to the man who dwells in
                    appearances and the shows of sense. The philosophers, he says, “are those who
                    are able to grasp the eternal and immutable”; they are “those who set their <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n827/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0827-0792"/> affections on that which in each case really
                    exists” <hi rend="italic">(Rep.,</hi> 480). In Plato, however, this distinction
                    is applied chiefly in an ethical and religious direction; and, while it defines
                    philosophy, so far correctly, as the endeavour to express what things are in
                    their ultimate constitution, it is not yet accompanied by a sufficient
                    differentiation of the subsidiary inquiries by which this ultimate question may
                    be approached. Logic, ethics, and physics, psychology, theory of knowledge, and
                    metaphysics are all fused together by Plato in a semi-religious synthesis. It is
                    not till we come to Aristotle—the encyclopaedist of the ancient world— that we
                    find a demarcation of the different philosophic disciplines corresponding, in
                    the main, to that still current. The earliest philosophers, or “physiologers,”
                    had occupied themselves chiefly with what we may call cosmology; the one
                    question which covers everything for them is that of the underlying substance of
                    the world around them, and they essay to answer this question, so to speak, by
                    simple inspection. In Socrates and Plato, on the other hand, the start is made
                    from a consideration of man’s moral and intellectual activity; but knowledge and
                    action are confused with one another, as in the Socratic doctrine that virtue is
                    knowledge. To this correspond the Platonic confusion of logic and ethics and the
                    attempt to substitute a theory of concepts for a metaphysic of reality.
                    Aristotle’s methodic intellect led him to separate the different aspects of
                    reality here confounded. He became the founder of logic, psychology, ethics, and
                    aesthetics as separate sciences; while he prefixed to all such (comparatively) £
                    )ecial inquiries the investigation of the ultimate nature of existence as such,
                    or of those first principles which are common to, and presupposed in, every
                    narrower field of knowledge. For this investigation Aristotle’s most usual name
                    is “first philosophy”; but there has since been appropriated to it, apparently
                    by accident, the title “metaphysics.” “Philosophy,” as a term of general
                    application, was not, indeed, restricted by Aristotle or his successors to the
                    disciplines just enumerated. Aristotle himself includes under the title, besides
                    mathematics, all his physical inquiries. It was only in the Alexandrian period,
                    as Zeller points out, that the special sciences attained to independent
                    cultivation. Nevertheless, as the mass of knowledge accumulated, it naturally
                    came about that the name “philosophy” ceased to be applied to inquiries
                    concerned with the particulars as such. The details of physics, for example,
                    were abandoned to the scientific specialist, and philosophy restricted itself in
                    this department to the question of the relation of the physical universe to the
                    ultimate ground or author of things. This inquiry, which was long called
                    “rational cosmology,” may be said to form part of the general science of
                    metaphysics, or at all events a pendant to it. By the gradual sifting out of the
                    special sciences philosophy thus came to embrace primarily the inquiries grouped
                    as “metaphysics” or “first philosophy.” These would embrace, according to the
                    scheme long current, ontology proper, or the science of being as such, with its
                    branch sciences of (rational) psychology, cosmology, and (rational or natural)
                    theology. Subsidiary to metaphysics, as the central inquiry, stand the sciences
                    of logic and ethics, to which may be added aesthetics, constituting three
                    normative sciences, —sciences, that is, which do not, primarily, describe facts,
                    but rather prescribe ends. It is evident, however, that if logic deals with
                    conceptions which may be considered constitutive of knowledge as such, and if
                    ethics deals with the harmonious realization of the highest known form of
                    existence, both sciences must have a great deal of weight in the settling of the
                    general question of metaphysics.</p>
                <p>Modern modifications of the above scheme will be presently considered; but it is
                    sufficiently accurate as a storting-point, and its acceptance by so many
                    generations of thinkers is a guarantee for its provisional intelligibility.
                    Accordingly, we may say that “philosophy” has been understood, during the
                    greater part of its history, to be a general term covering the various
                    disciplines just enumerated. It has frequently tended, however, and still tends,
                    to be used as specially convertible with the narrower term “metaphysics.” This
                    is not unnatural, seeing that it is only so far as they bear on the one central
                    question of the nature of existence that philosophy spreads its mantle over
                    psychology, logic, or ethics. The organic conditions of perception and the
                    associative laws to which the mind, as a part of nature, is subjected, are
                    nothing to the philosopher; and therefore the handing over of (empirical)
                    psychology to special investigators, which is at present taking place, can be
                    productive of none but good results. Similarly, logic, so far as it is an art of
                    thought or a doctrine of fallacies, and ethics, so far as it is occupied with a
                    natural history of impulses and moral sentiments, do neither of them belong,
                    except by courtesy, to the philosophic province. But, although this is so, it is
                    perhaps hardly desirable to deprive ourselves of the use of two terms instead of
                    one. It will not be easy to infuse into so abstract and bloodless a term as
                    “metaphysics” the fuller life (and especially the inclusion of ethical
                    considerations) suggested by the more concrete term “philosophy.”</p>
                <p>We shall first of all, then, attempt to differentiate philosophy from the special
                    sciences, and afterwards proceed to take up one by one what have been called the
                    philosophical sciences, with the view of showing how far the usual
                    subject-matter of each is really philosophical in its bearing, and how far it
                    belongs rather to the domain of science strictly so called. We shall also see in
                    the course of this inquiry in what these various philosophical disciplines
                    differ from one another, and how far they merge into another, or have, as a
                    matter of fact, been confused at different periods in the history of philosophy.
                    The order in which, for clearness of exposition, it will 'be most convenient to
                    consider these disciplines will be psychology, epistemology or theory of
                    knowledge, and metaphysics, then logic, aesthetics, and ethics. Finally, the
                    connexion of the last-mentioned with politics (or, to speak more modernly, with
                    jurisprudence and sociology) and with the philosophy of history will call for a
                    few words on the relation of these sciences to general philosophy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Philosophy and Science.—</hi> In distinguishing philosophy from
                    the sciences, it may not be amiss at the outset to guard against the possible
                    misunderstanding that philosophy is concerned with a subject-matter different
                    from, and in some obscure way transcending, the subject-matter of the sciences.
                    Now that psychology, or the observational and experimental study of mind, may be
                    said to have been definitively included among the positive sciences, there is
                    not even the apparent ground which once existed for such an idea. Philosophy,
                    even under its most discredited name of metaphysics, has no other subject-matter
                    than the nature of the real world, as that world lies around us in everyday
                    life, and lies open to observers on every side. But if this is so, it may be
                    asked what function can remain for philosophy when every portion of the field is
                    already lotted out and enclosed by specialists? Philosophy claims to be the
                    science of the whole; but, if we get the knowledge of the parts from the
                    different sciences, what is there left for philosophy to tell us? To this it is
                    sufficient to answer generally that the synthesis of the parts is something more
                    than that detailed knowledge of the parts in separation which is gained by the
                    man of science. It is with the ultimate synthesis that philosophy concerns
                    itself; it has to show that the subject-matter which λve are all dealing with in
                    detail really <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a whole, consisting of articulated
                    members. Evidently, therefore, the relation existing between<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n828/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0828-0793"/> philosophy and the sciences will be, to some
                    extent, one of reciprocal influence. The sciences may be said to furnish
                    philosophy with its matter, but philosophical criticism reacts upon the matter
                    thus furnished, and transforms it. Such transformation is inevitable, for the
                    parts only exist and can only be fully, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> truly,
                    known in their relation to the whole. A pure specialist, if such a being were
                    possible, would be merely an instrument whose results had to be co-ordinated and
                    used by others. Now, though a pure specialist may be an abstraction of the mind,
                    the tendency of specialists in any department naturally is to lose sight of the
                    whole in attention to the particular categories or modes of nature’s working
                    which happen to be exemplified, and fruitfully applied, in their own sphere of
                    investigation; and in proportion as this is the case it becomes necessary for
                    their theories to be co-ordinated with the results of other inquirers, and set,
                    as it were, in the light of the whole. This task of co-ordination, in the
                    broadest sense, is undertaken by philosophy; for the philosopher is essentially
                    what Plato, in a happy moment, styled him, <hi rend="italic">συνοπτικός,</hi>
                    the man who insists on seeing things together. The aim of philosophy (whether
                    attainable or not) is to exhibit the universe as a rational system in the
                    harmony of all its parts; and accordingly the philosopher refuses to consider
                    the parts out of their relation to the whole whose parts they are. Philosophy
                    corrects in this way the abstractions which are inevitably made by the
                    scientific specialist, and may claim, therefore, to be the only concrete
                    science, that is to say, the only science which takes account of all the
                    elements in the problem, and the only science whose results can claim to be true
                    in more than a provisional sense.</p>
                <p>For it is evident from what has been said that the way in which we commonly speak
                    of “facts” is calculated to convey a false impression. The world is not a
                    collection of individual facts existing side by side and capable of being known
                    separately. A fact is nothing except in its relations to other facts; and as
                    these relations are multiplied in the progress of knowledge the nature of the
                    so-called fact is indefinitely modified. Moreover, every statement of fact
                    involves certain general notions and theories, so that the “facts” of the
                    separate sciences cannot be stated except in terms of the conceptions or
                    hypotheses which are assumed by the particular science. Thus mathematics assumes
                    space as an existent infinite, without investigating in what sense the existence
                    or the infinity of this “Unding,” as Kant called it, can be asserted. In the
                    same way, physics may be said to assume the notion of material atoms and forces.
                    These and similar assumptions are ultimate presuppositions or working hypotheses
                    for the sciences themselves. But it is the office of philosophy, or theory of
                    knowledge, to submit such conceptions to a critical analysis, with a view to
                    discover how far they can be <hi rend="italic">thought out,</hi> or how far,
                    when this is done, they refute themselves, and call for a different form of
                    statement, if they are to be taken as a statement of the ultimate nature of the
                    real.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The revisional
                    office which philosophy here assumes constitutes her the critic of the sciences.
                    It is in this connexion that the meaning of the definition of philosophy as “the
                    science of principles” can best be seen. This is perhaps the most usual
                    definition, and, though vague, one of the least misleading.</p></note> The first
                    statement may frequently turn out to have been merely provisionally or
                    relatively true; it is then superseded by, or rather inevitably merges itself
                    in, a less abstract account. In this the same “facts” appear differently,
                    because no longer separated from other aspects that belong to the full reality
                    of the known world. There is no such thing, we have said, as an individual fact;
                    and the nature of any fact is not fully known unless we know it in all its
                    relations to the system of the universe, or, in Spinoza’s phrase, “sub specie
                    aeternitatis.” In strictness, there is but one <hi rend="italic">res</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">completa</hi> or concrete fact, and it is the business of
                    philosophy, as science of the whole, to expound the chief relations that
                    constitute its complex nature.</p>
                <p>The last abstraction which it becomes the duty of philosophy to remove is the
                    abstraction from the knowing subject which is made by all the sciences,
                    including, as we shall see, the science of psychology. The sciences, one and
                    all, deal with a world of objects, but the ultimate fact as we know it is the
                    existence of an object for a subject. Subject-object, knowledge, or, more
                    widely, self-consciousness with its implicates—this unity in duality is the
                    ultimate aspect which reality presents. It has generally been considered,
                    therefore, as constituting in a special sense the problem of philosophy.
                    Philosophy may be said to be the explication of what is involved in this
                    relation, or, in modern phraseology, a theory of its possibility. Any would-be
                    theory of the universe which makes its central fact impossible stands
                    self-condemned. On the other hand, a sufficient analysis here may be expected to
                    yield us a statement of the reality of things <hi rend="italic">in its last
                    terms,</hi> and thus to shed a light backwards upon the true nature of our
                    subordinate conceptions.</p>

                    (ontology; see <hi rend="smallcaps">Meta physic).</hi> A special relation has
                    always existed between psychology and systematic philosophy, but the closeness
                    of the connexion has been characteristic of modern and more particularly of
                    English thought. The connexion is not difficult to explain, seeing that in
                    psychology, or the science of mind, we study the fact of intelligence (and moral
                    action), and have, so far, in our hands the fact to which all other facts are
                    relative. From this point of view we may even agree with Sir W. Hamilton when he
                    quotes Jacobi’s dictum—“Nature conceals God; man reveals God.” In other words,
                    as has just been said, the ultimate explanation of things cannot be given by any
                    theory which excludes from its survey the intelligence in which nature, as it
                    were, gathers herself up. But knowledge, or the mind as knowing, willing,
                    &lt;fcc., may be looked at in two different ways. It may be regarded simply as a
                    fact, in which case the evolutions of mind may be traced and reduced to laws in
                    the same way as the phenomena treated by the other sciences. This study gives us
                    the science of empirical psychology, or, as it is now termed, psychology <hi
                    rend="italic">sans phrase.</hi> In order to give an adequate account of its
                    subject-matter, psychology may require higher or more complex categories than
                    are employed in the other sciences, just as biology, for example, cannot work
                    with mechanical categories alone, but introduces the conception of development
                    or growth. But the affinities of such a study are manifestly with the sciences
                    as such rather than with philosophy; and it has been already pointed out that
                    the division of labour in this respect is proceeding rapidly. Since it has been
                    taken up by specialists, psychology is being established on a broader basis of
                    induction, and with the advantage, in some departments, of the employment of
                    experimental methods of measurement. But it is not of mind in this aspect that
                    such assertions can be made as those quoted above. Mind, as studied by the
                    psychologist—mind as a mere fact or phenomenon—grounds no inference to anything
                    beyond itself. The distinction between mind viewed as a succession of “states of
                    consciousness” and the further aspect of mind which philosophy considers is very
                    clearly put in a recent article by Professor Croom Robertson, who also makes a
                    happy suggestion of two terms to designate the double point of view.</p>

                <p>“We may view knowledge as mere subjective function, but it has its full meaning
                    only as it is taken to represent what we may call objective fact, or is such as
                    is named (in different circumstances) real, valid, true. As mere subjective
                    function, which it is to the psychologist, it is best spoken of by an
                    unambiguous name, and for this there seems none better than Intellection. We may
                    then say that psychology is occupied with the natural function of <hi

                    its various modes (perception, representative imagination, conception, &amp;c.)
                    according to the various circumstances in which the laws are found at work.
                    Philosophy, on the other hand, is theory of <hi rend="italic">Knowledge</hi> (as
                    that which is known).”—“Psychology and Philosophy,” <hi rend="italic">Mind,</hi>

                <p>The confusion of these two points of view has led, and still leads, to serious
                    philosophical misconception. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that, in the
                    English school since Hume, psychology superseded properly philosophical inquiry.
                    The infusion of epistemological matter into the numerous analyses of the human
                    mind rendered the substitution plausible and left men satisfied. And we find
                    even a thinker with a wider horizon like Sir W. Hamilton encouraging the
                    confusion by speaking of “psychology <hi rend="italic">or</hi>
                    metaphysics,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is true
                    that he afterwards modifies this misleading identification l&gt;y introducing
                    the distinction between empirical psychology or the phenomenology of mind and
                    inferential psychology or ontology, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> metaphysics
                    proper. But he continues to use the terms “philosophy,” “metaphysics,” and
                    “mental science” as synonymous.</p></note> while his lectures on metaphysics are
                    mainly taken up with what belongs in the strictest sense to psychology proper,
                    with an occasional excursus (as in the theory of perception) into epistemology.
                    That this confusion is on the way to be obviated for the future is largely due
                    to the Kantian impulse which has been strongly felt of late in English thought,
                    and which has acted in this matter on many who could not, by any laxity of
                    terminology , be numbered as Kantians or Neo-Kantians. The distinction between
                    psychology and theory of knowledge was first clearly made by Kant, who
                    repeatedly insisted that the <hi rend="italic">C</hi><hi rend="italic">ri,tique
                    of</hi><hi rend="italic">Pure Reason</hi> was not to be taken as a psychological
                    inquiry. He defined his problem as the <hi rend="italic">quid</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">juins</hi> or the question of the validity of knowledge, not its
                    <hi rend="italic">quid</hi><hi rend="italic">facti</hi> or the laws of the
                    empirical genesis and evolution of intellection (to use Professor Robertson’s
                    phraseology). Since Kant philosophy has chiefly taken the form of theory of
                    knowledge or of a criticism of experience. Not, indeed, a preliminary criticism
                    of our faculties or conceptions such as Kant himself proposed to institute, in
                    order to determine the limits of their application; such a criticism <hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">extra</hi> of the nature of our
                    experience is essentially a thing impossible. The only criticism which can be
                    applied in such a case is the immanent criticism which the conceptions or
                    categories exercise upon one another. The organized criticism of these
                    conceptions is really nothing more than the full explication of what they mean
                    and of what experience in its full nature or notion is. This constitutes the
                    theory of knowledge, and lays down, in Kantian language, the conditions of the
                    possibility of experience. These conditions are the conditions of knowledge as
                    such, of self-consciousness in general, or, as it may be put, of objective
                    consciousness. The inquiry is, therefore, logical or transcendental in its
                    nature, and does not entangle us in any decision as to the conditions of the
                    genesis of such consciousness in the individual. When we inquire into subjective
                    conditions, we are thinking of facts causing other facts. But the logical or
                    transcendental conditions are not causes or even factors of knowledge; they are
                    the statement of its idea. Hence the dispute at the present time between
                    evolutionist and transcendentalist rests, in general, on an <hi rend="italic"
                    >ignoratio</hi><hi rend="italic">elenchi</hi>; for the history of the genesis of
                    an idea (the historical or genetic method) does not contain an answer to— though
                    it may throw light on—the philosophic question of its truth or validity.
                    Speaking of this transcendental consciousness, Kant goes so far as to say that
                    it is not of the slightest consequence “whether the idea of it be clear or
                    obscure (in empirical consciousness), no, not even whether it really exists or
                    not. But the possibility of the logical form of all knowledge rests on its
                    relation to this apperception as a faculty or potentiality” (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Werke,</hi> ed. Hartenstein, iii. 578 note). Or, if we return to the
                    distinction between epistemology and psychology, by way of illustrating the
                    nature of the former, we may take the summing up of Mr Ward in a valuable
                    article on “Psychological Principles” recently contributed to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mind</hi> (April 1883, pp. 166, 167). “Comparing psychology and epistemology,
                    then, we may say that the former is essentially genetic in its method, and
                    might, if we had the power to revise our existing terminology, be called
                    biology; the latter, on the other hand, is essentially devoid of everything
                    historical, and treats, <hi rend="italic">sub specie aeternitatis,</hi> as
                    Spinoza might have said, of human knowledge, conceived as the possession of mind
                    in general.”</p>
                <p>Kant’s problem is not, in its wording, very different from that which Locke set
                    before him when he resolved to “inquire into the original, certainty, and extent
                    of human knowledge together with the grounds and degrees of belief, opinion, and
                    assent.” Locke’s <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi> is undoubtedly, in its intention,
                    a contribution to the theory of knowledge, as any one may verify for himself by
                    turning to the headings of the chapters in the fourth book. But, because time
                    had not yet made the matter clear, Locke suffered himself to digress in his
                    second book into the purely psychological question of the origin of our ideas,
                    or, as Kant called it, the physiology of the human mind. Appearing thus, first,
                    as the problem of perception (in Locke and his English successors), widening its
                    scope and becoming, in Kant’s hands, the question of the possibility of
                    experience in general, epistemology may be said to have passed with Hegel into a
                    completely articulated “logic,” that claimed to be at the same time a
                    metaphysic, or an ultimate expression of the nature of the real. This introduces
                    us to the second part of the question we are seeking to determine, namely, the
                    relation of epistemology to metaphysics.</p>
                <p>It is evident that philosophy as theory of knowledge must have for its complement
                    philosophy as metaphysics or ontology. The question of the truth of our
                    knowledge, and the question of the ultimate nature of what we know, are in
                    reality two sides of the same inquiry; and therefore our epistemological results
                    have to be ontologically expressed. But it is not every thinker that can see his
                    way with Hegel to assert in set terms the identity of thought and being. Hence
                    the theory of knowledge becomes with some a theory of human ignorance. This is
                    the case with Herbert Spencer’s doctrine of the unknowable, which he advances as
                    the result of epistemological considerations in the philosophical prolegomena to
                    his system. Very similar positions were maintained by Kant and Comte; and, under
                    the name of “agnosticism,” the theory has popularized itself of late in the
                    outer courts of philosophy, and on the shifting borderland of philosophy and
                    literature. The truth is that the habit of thinking exclusively from the
                    standpoint of the theory of knowledge tends to beget an undue subjectivity of
                    temper. And the fact that it has become usual for men to think from this
                    standpoint is very plainly seen in the almost universal description of
                    philosophy as an analysis of “experience,” instead of its more old-fashioned
                    designation as an inquiry into “the nature of things.” Now it is matter of
                    universal agreement that the problem of being must be attacked indirectly
                    through the problem of knowledge; and therefore this substitution certainly
                    marks an advance, in so far as it implies that the fact of experience, or of
                    self-conscious existence, is the chief fact to be dealt with. But if so, then
                    self-consciousness must really be treated as existing, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n830/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0830-0795"/> and as organically related to the rest of
                    existence. If self-consciousness be treated in this objective fashion, then we
                    pass naturally from epistemology * to metaphysics or ontology. (For, although
                    the term “ontology” has been as good as disused, it still remains true that the
                    aim of philosophy must be to furnish us with an ontology or a coherent and
                    adequate theory of the nature of the existent.) But if, on the other hand,
                    knowledge and existence be <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >initio</hi> opposed to one another—if consciousness be set on one side as over
                    against existence, and merely holding up a mirror to it—then it follows with
                    equal naturalness that the truly objective must be something which lurks
                    unrevealed behind the subject’s representation of it. Hence come the different
                    varieties of a so-called phenomenalism. The upholders of such a theory would, in
                    general, deride the term “metaphysics” or “ontology”; but it is evident, none
                    the less, that their position itself implies a certain theory of the universe
                    and of our own place in it, and philosophy with them will consist, therefore, in
                    the establishment of this theory.</p>
                <p>Without prejudice, then, to the claims of epistemology to constitute the central
                    philosophic discipline, we may simply note its liability to be misused. The
                    exclusive preoccupation of men’s minds with the question of knowledge during the
                    last quarter of a century or more drew from Lotze the caustic criticism that
                    “the continual sharpening of the knife becomes tiresome, if, after all, we have
                    nothing to cut with it.” Stillingfleet’s complaint against Locke was that he was
                    “one of the gentlemen of this new way of reasoning that have almost discarded
                    substance out of the reasonable part of the world.” The same may be said with
                    greater truth of the devotees of the theory of knowledge; they seem to have no
                    need of so old-fashioned a commodity as reality. Yet, after all, Fichte’s dictum
                    holds good that knowledge <hi rend="italic">as</hi> knowledge— <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> so long as it is looked at as knowledge—is, <hi rend="italic">ipso
                    facto, not</hi> reality. The result of the foregoing, however, is to show that,
                    as soon as epistemology draws its conclusion, it becomes metaphysics; the theory
                    of knowledge passes into a theory of being. The ontological conclusion,
                    moreover, is not to be regarded as something added by an external process; it is
                    an immediate implication. The metaphysic is the epistemology from another point
                    of view — regarded as completing itself, and explaining in the course of its
                    exposition that relative or practical separation of the individual known from
                    the knowable world which it is a sheer assumption to take as absolute. This, not
                    the so-called assumption of the implicit unity of being and thought, is the
                    really unwarrantable postulate; for it is an assumption which we are obliged to
                    retract bit by bit, while the other offers the whole doctrine of knowledge as
                    its voucher.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Logic, Aesthetics, and Ethics.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> If
                    the theory of knowledge thus takes upon itself the functions discharged of old
                    by metaphysics, it becomes somewhat difficult to assign a distinct sphere to
                    logic. It has already been seen how the theory of knowledge, when it passed out
                    of Kant’s hands, and tried to make itself <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> complete
                    and (ά) presuppositionless, became for Hegel a logic that was in reality a
                    metaphysic. This is the comprehensive sense given to logical science in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Logic (&lt;∕.v.)</hi> in this work; and it is there
                    contended that no other definition can be made consistent with itself. It is, of
                    course, admitted that this is not the traditional use of the term (see vol. xiv.
                    p. 802). Ueberweg’s definition of logic as “the science of the regulative laws
                    of thought” (or “the normative science of thought ”) comes near enough to the
                    old sense to enable us to compare profitably the usual subject-matter of the
                    science with the definition and end of philosophy. The introduction of the term
                    “regulative” or “normative” is intended to differentiate the science from
                    psychology as the science of mental events. In this reference logic does not
                    tell us how our intellections connect themselves as mental phenomena, but how we
                    ought to connect our thoughts if they are to realize truth (either as
                    consistency with what we thought before or as agreement with observed facts).
                    Logic, therefore, agrees with epistemology (and differs from psychology) in
                    treating thought not as mental fact but as knowledge, as idea, as having meaning
                    in relation to an objective world. To this extent it must inevitably form a part
                    of the theory of knowledge. But, if we desire to keep by older landmarks and
                    maintain a distinction between the two disciplines, a ground for doing so may be
                    found in the fact that all the main definitions of logic point to the
                    investigation of the laws of thought in a subjective reference,—with a view,
                    that is, by an analysis of the operation, to ensure its more correct
                    performance. According to the old phrase, logic is the art of thinking.
                    Moreover, the fact that ordinary logic investigates its laws primarily in this
                    reference, and not disinterestedly as immanent laws of knowledge or of the
                    connexion of conceptions, brings in its train a limitation of the sphere of the
                    science as compared with the theory of knowledge. We find the logician uniformly
                    assuming that the process of thought has advanced a certain length before his
                    examination of it begins; he takes his material full-formed from perception,
                    without, as a rule, inquiring into the nature of the conceptions which are
                    involved in our perceptive experience. Occupying a position, therefore, within
                    the wider sphere of the general theory of knowledge, ordinary logic consists in
                    an analysis of the nature of general statement, and of the conditions under
                    which we pass validly from one general statement to another. But the logic of
                    the schools is eked out by contributions from a variety of sources <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> from grammar on one side and from psychology on
                    another), and cannot claim the unity of an independent science.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Aesthetics</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.vf</hi> may be treated
                    as a department of psychology or physiology, and in England this is the mode of
                    treatment that has been most general. To what peculiar excitation of our bodily
                    or mental organism, it is asked, are the emotions due which make us declare an
                    object beautiful or sublime? And, the question being put in this form, the
                    attempt has been made in some cases to explain away any peculiarity in the
                    emotions by analysing them into simpler elements, such as primitive organic
                    pleasures and prolonged associations of usefulness or fitness. But, just as
                    psychology in general can in no sense do duty for a theory of knowledge, so it
                    holds true of this particular application of psychology that a mere reference of
                    these emotions to the mechanism and interactive play of our faculties cannot be
                    regarded as an account of the nature of the beautiful. The substitution of the
                    one inquiry for the other may doubtless be traced in part to the latent
                    assumption—standing very much in need of proof—that our faculties are
                    constructed on some arbitrary plan, without reference to the general nature of
                    things. Perhaps by talking of “emotions” we tend to give an unduly subjective
                    colour to the investigation; it would be better to speak of the <hi
                    rend="italic">perception</hi> of the beautiful. Pleasure in itself is
                    unqualified, and affords no differentia. In the case of a beautiful object the
                    resultant pleasure borrows its specific quality from the presence of
                    determinations essentially intellectual in their nature, though not reducible to
                    the categories of science. We have a <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">facie</hi> right, therefore, to treat beauty as an objective
                    determination of things. The question of aesthetics would then be
                    formulated—What is it in things that makes them beautiful, and what is the
                    relation of this aspect of the universe to its ultimate nature, as that is
                    expounded in metaphysics? The answer constitutes the substance of aesthetics,
                    considered<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n831/mode/1up"

                    simply in abstract terms; aesthetics includes also an exposition of the concrete
                    phases of art, as these have appeared in the history of the world, relating
                    themselves to different stages of the spirit’s insight into itself and into
                    things.</p>
                <p>Of <hi rend="smallcaps">Ethics</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.vf</hi> it may also be
                    said that many of the topics commonly embraced under that title are not strictly
                    ethical at all, but are subjects for a scientific psychology employing the
                    historical method with the conceptions of heredity and development, and calling
                    to its aid, as such a psychology will do, the investigations of ethnology, and
                    all its subsidiary sciences. To such a psychology must be relegated all
                    questions as to the origin and development of moral ideas. Similarly, the
                    question debated at such length by English moralists as to the nature of the
                    moral faculty (moral sense, conscience, &lt;tc.) belongs entirely to psychology.
                    This is more generally admitted in regard to the controversy concerning the
                    freedom of the will, though that still forms part of most ethical treatises. If
                    we exclude such questions in the interest of systematic correctness, and seek to
                    determine for ethics a definite subjectmatter, the science may be said to fall
                    into two departments. The first of these deals with the notion of duty, as such,
                    and endeavours to define the ultimate end of action; the second lays out the
                    scheme of concrete duties which are deducible from, or which, at least, are
                    covered by, this abstractly-stated principle. The second of these departments is
                    really the proper subject-matter of ethics considered as a separate science; but
                    it is often conspicuous by its absence from ethical treatises. However moralists
                    may differ on first principles, there seems to be remarkably little practical
                    divergence when they come to lay down the particular laws of morality. Hence, as
                    it must necessarily be a thankless task to tabulate the commonplaces of conduct,
                    the comparative neglect of this part of their subject is perhaps sufficiently
                    explained. It may be added that, where a systematic account of duties is
                    actually given, the connexion of. the particular duties with the universal
                    formula is in general more formal than real. It is only under the head of
                    “casuistry” that ethics has been much cultivated as a separate science. The
                    first department of ethics, on the other hand, is the branch of the subject in
                    virtue of which ethics forms part of philosophy. As described above, it merges
                    in general metaphysics or ontology, and ought rather to be called, in Kant’s
                    phrase, the metaphysic of ethics. A theory of obligation is ultimately found to
                    be inseparable from a metaphysic of personality. The connexion of ethics with
                    metaphysics will be patent as a matter of fact, if it be remembered how Plato’s
                    philosophy is summed up in the idea of the good, and how Aristotle also employs
                    the essentially ethical notion of end as the ultimate category by which the
                    universe may be explained or reduced to unity. But the necessity of the
                    connexion is also apparent, unless we are to suppose that, as regards the course
                    of universal nature, man is altogether an <hi rend="italic">imperium in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">imperio,</hi> or rather (to adopt the forcible phrase of Marcus
                    Aurelius) an abscess or excrescence on the nature of things. If, on the
                    contrary, we must hold that man is essentially related to “a common nature,” as,
                    the same writer puts it, then it is a legitimate corollary that in man as
                    intelligence we ought to ’ find the key of the whole fabric. At all events, this
                    method of approach must be truer than any which, by restricting itself to the
                    external aspect of phenomena as presented in space, leaves no scope for
                    inwardness and life and all that, in Lotze’s language, gives existence “value.”
                    Historically we may be said in an intelligible sense to explain the higher by
                    showing its genesis from the lower. But in philosophy it is exactly the reverse;
                    the lower is always to be explained by the higher. In the ethical reference it
                    has been customary to argue, as Sir W. Hamilton does, from man’s moral being to
                    “an Intelligent Creator and Moral Governor of the Universe.” It is evident that
                    the argument <hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">analogia hominis</hi>
                    may sometimes be carried too far; but if a “chief end of man” be discoverable
                    —di'0pω7rιvov <hi rend="italic">αγαθόν,</hi> as Aristotle wisely insisted that
                    the ethical end must be determined—then it may be assumed that this end cannot
                    be irrelevant to that ultimate “meaning” of the universe which, according to
                    Lotze, is the quest of philosophy. If “the idea of humanity,” as Kant called it,
                    has ethical perfection at its core, then a universe which is organic must be
                    ultimately representable as a moral order or a spiritual kingdom such as
                    Leibnitz named, in words borrowed from Augustine, a city of God.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Politics, Sociology, Philosophy of History.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> In Aristotle we can observe how ethics is being
                    differentiated from politics, but this differentiation does not, and ought not
                    to, amount to a complete separation. The difficulty, already hinted at, which
                    individualistic systems of ethics experience in connecting particular duties
                    with the abstract principle of duty is a proof of the failure of their method.
                    For the content of morality we are necessarily referred, in great part, to the
                    experience crystallized in laws and institutions and to the unwritten law of
                    custom, honour, and good breeding, which has become organic in the society of
                    which we are members. The development of society is therefore brought within the
                    scope of philosophy. So far as this development is traced in a purely historical
                    spirit, it will be simply a sequence of efficient causes, in which, starting
                    with a b c, we eventually arrive at A B C. But, if this sequence is to be
                    philosophized, it must be shown that we have no means of knowing what a b c is
                    except in its relation to A B C, its resultant. We interpret the process,
                    therefore, as the realization of an immanent end. The state, as the organism in
                    whose play morality is realized, becomes an interest of reason; and the
                    different forms of state-organization are judged according to the degree in
                    which they realize the reconciliation of individual freedom and the play of
                    cultured interests with stable objectivity of law and an abiding consciousness
                    of the greater whole in which we move. So far as the course of universal history
                    can be truly represented as an approximation to this reconciliation by a
                    widening and deepening of both the elements, we may claim to possess a
                    philosophy of history. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. se</hi><hi rend="superscript
