                    only when he was forced to do so by the enemy. Indeed, his attempt to withdraw
                    the Spartan contingent from the post of honour on the right, in order to avoid
                    encountering the native Persian troops under Mardonius, savours of positive co

                    respected the dead; a proposal made by a Greek after the battle to avenge the
                    death of Leonidas by mutilating the corpse of the gallant Mardonius received
                    from Pausanias a stern rebuke. After the expulsion of the Persians from Greece
                    Pausanias led a Greek fleet (478 or 477) to Cyprus and thence to Byzantium,
                    which he captured from the Persians. But the successes he had hitherto enjoyed
                    only fed without satisfying his ambition. He conceived the design of making
                    himself master of all Greece, and with this view he opened a correspondence with
                    Xerxes, offering to marry his daughter and reduce Greece to a Persian province.
                    The proposal was hailed with delight by the Persian monarch. Puffed up with
                    these hopes, Pausanias now assumed by anticipation the airs and state of a
                    tyrant, and by his overbearing manners offended the Greeks so deeply that in
                    disgust they transferred the leadership of the allied forces from Sparta to
                    Athens,—a momentous step, from which sprang the maritime empire of Athens.
                    Pausanias was recalled to Sparta and tried, but, though convicted and punished
                    for minor offences, the evidence was insufficient to substantiate the charge of
                    treason, and he was acquitted. Having afterwards the folly to return to
                    Byzantium in a private capacity and reopen communications with Persia, he was
                    again recalled and put on his trial. There was strong suspicion of his treason,
                    but no positive evidence. It was known, too, that he had incited the Helots to
                    revolt, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n458/mode/1up"

                    would join him; but, with characteristic caution, the authorities declined to
                    accept the evidence of a Helot against a Spartan, and Pausanias might, after
                    all, have been acquitted if it had not been that a messenger to whom he
                    entrusted a letter for Artabazus, the Persian satrap, opened it, and, finding in
                    it a direction to put the bearer to death, carried it to the ephors. But not
                    until they had contrived to overhear a conversation between Pausanias and his
                    messenger were the ephors satisfied of his guilt; and then they proceeded to
                    arrest him. Foreseeing their intention, Pausanias took refuge in the temple of
                    Athene of the Brazen House. The ephors took off the roof, blocked up the doors,
                    and starved him. When on the point of death he was dragged out, that his corpse
                    might not defile the sanctuary. This happened about 467.</p>
