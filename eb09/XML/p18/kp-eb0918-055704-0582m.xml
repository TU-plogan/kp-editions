                    miles north-east of Shíráz, and not far from where the small river Pulwár flows
                    into the Kur (Kyrus), there is a large terrace with its east side leaning on
                    Kúhi Rahmet (“the Mount of Grace ”). The other three sides are formed by a
                    retaining wall, varying in height with the slope of the ground from 14 to 41
                    feet; and on the west side a magnificent double stair, of very easy steps, leads
                    to the top. On this terrace, which is not perfectly level, stand and lie the
                    ruins of a number of colossal buildings, all constructed of exquisite dark-grey
                    marble from the adjacent mountain. The stones were laid without mortar, and many
                    of them are still <hi rend="italic">in situ,</hi> although the iron clamps by
                    which they were fastened together have been stolen or destroyed by rust. The

                    vestibules most imposing. Especially striking are the huge pillars, of which a
                    number still stand erect. No traveller can escape the spell of these majestic

                    work of Texier, and still far more to that of Flandin and Coste. Good sketches,

                    “photogrammetric” plan surpasses all previous attempts in accuracy. The numerous
                    reliefs found in this group of ruins (especially on the great double stair),
                    executed in a very remarkable style of art, were first brought within the scope
                    of accurate examination by these works, since, with some individual exceptions
                    (as in Ouseley), the drawings of the figures in the older works were quite
                    inadequate.</p></note> It is to be observed that several of the buildings were
                    never finished. Stolze has shown that in some cases even the mason’s rubbish has
                    not been removed, and remarks accordingly that in those early times, just as at
                    the present day, an Oriental prince would rather commence a new building of his
                    own than complete the unfinished work of his predecessor.</p>

                    notions of the Persians, who are utterly ignorant of the real history of their
                    country before Alexander, often received too much attention; hence many of them
                    were of opinion that the buildings were of much higher antiquity than the time
                    of Cyrus; and even those who rightly regarded them as the works of the
                    Achaemenians were unable to support their theory by conclusive evidence.<note

                    inscriptions found on the ruins and in the neighbourhood has put an end to all
                    doubt on this point. We now read with absolute certainty that some of the
                    edifices are the work of Darius I., Xerxes, and Artaxerxes III. (Ochus), and
                    with equal certainty we may conclude that all the others were built under the
                    Achaemenian dynasty.</p>
                <p>Behind Takhti Jamshid are three sepulchres hewn out of the rock in the hillside,
                    the façades, one of which is incomplete, being richly ornamented with reliefs.
                    About 8 miles to the north-north-east, on the opposite side of the Pulwár, rises
                    a perpendicular wall of rock, in which four similar tombs are cut, at a
                    considerable height from the bottom of the valley. The modern Persians call this
                    place <hi rend="italic">Nakshi Rustam</hi> (“the picture of Rustam”) from the
                    Sasanian reliefs beneath the opening, which they take to be a representation of
                    the mythical hero Rustam. That the occupants of these seven tombs were kings
                    might be inferred from the sculptures, and one of those at Nakshi Rustam is
                    expressly declared in its inscription to be the tomb of the great Darius,
                    concerning whom Ctesias relates that his grave was in the face of a rock, and
                    could be reached only by means of an apparatus of ropes. Ctesias mentions
                    further, with regard to a number of Persian kings, either that their remains
                    were brought ∏.ρ&lt;rας, “to the Persians,” or that they died there.<note

                    Ctesias (or rather in the extracts of Photius) about Darius II., which is

                    not deemed worthy of honourable burial, there is good reason for the
                    omission.</p></note> Now we know that Cyrus was buried at Pasargadae, the modern

                    there is any truth in the statement that the body of Cambyses was brought home
                    “to the Persians” his burying-place must be sought somewhere beside that of his
                    father. In order to identify the graves of Persepolis we must bear in mind that
                    Ctesias assumes that it was the custom for a king to prepare his own tomb during
                    his lifetime. Hence the kings buried at Nakshi Rustam are probably, besides
                    Darius, Xerxes I., Artaxerxes I., and Darius II. Xerxes II., who reigned for a
                    very short time, could scarcely have obtained so splendid a monument, and still
                    less could the usurper Sogdianus. The two completed graves behind Takhti Jamshid
                    would then belong to Artaxerxes II. and Artaxerxes III. The unfinished one is
                    perhaps that of Arses, who reigned at the longest two years, or, if not his,
                    then that of Darius III. (Codomannus), who is one of those whose bodies are said
                    to have been brought “to the Persians.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Another small group of ruins in the same style is found at the village of Hájí
                    ábád, on the Pulwár, a good hour’s walk above Takhti Jamshid. These formed a
                    single building, which was still intact 900 years ago, and was used as the
                    mosque of the then existing city of Istakhr. For there is no other place that
                    can have answered to the description of the eminent geographer Makdisí, who was
                    himself in this neighbourhood, when he says: “The chief mosque <hi rend="italic"
                    >(jámiP)</hi> of Istakhr is situated beside the bazaars. It is built after the

                    others compare the ruins of Takhti Jamshid to those of Palmyra and

                <p>In the time of its greatest prosperity the Persian metropolis must undoubtedly
                    have covered a great part of the extremely fertile valley of the Pulwár. It is
                    not at all necessary to suppose that its limits are determined by the two heaps
                    of ruins. The great bulk of the houses would, of course, be built in the
                    wretched manner which is all but universal in the East.</p>

                    thither with a few followers, but was refused admission by Tiridates, the
                    commandant of the citadel, who had already commenced negotiations with
                    Alexander, and at last surrendered the place with its immense treasures to the
                    conqueror. In a subsequent battle Ariobarzanes was killed.<note anchored="true"

                    the king.</p></note> Alexander then ordered a general massacre, and gave up the
                    city to be plundered. In the citadel he placed a garrison of 3000 men under
                    Nicarchides,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This again
                    is only found in Curtius. Alexander was in the heart of a country which he had
                    laid waste, but by no means thoroughly subdued, which hated him bitterly, and
                    which was the native land of the dynasty; he was amongst a people who still felt
                    themselves to be the dominant race, and knew that their king was still alive.
                    That in these circumstances he should have a strong garrison under a trustworthy
                    Macedonian was simply a matter of course. Nicarchides afterwards commanded a
                    trireme in the fleet that sailed from the Indus to the Tigris (Arrian, <hi
                    rend="italic">Indiea,</hi> xix. 5; after Nearchus).</p></note> and then caused
                    the royal palaces to be set on fire,—certainly not in a drunken freak, but
                    apparently with deliberate calculation on the effect it would produce on the
                    minds of the Asiatics.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Now it has hitherto been universally admitted that “the palaces” or “the palace”
                    (τα <hi rend="italic">βaσlλeιd)</hi> burned down by Alexander are those now in
                    ruins at Takhti Jamshid, as already described. From Stolze’s investigations it
                    appears that at least one of these, the castle built by Xerxes, bears evident
                    traces of having been destroyed by fire.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Dr Stolze has kindly explained to the writer of this article
                    that the layer of charcoal in the “hall of a hundred pillars” is apparently the
                    result not of a conflagration but of gradual decomposition.</p></note> The
                    locality described by Diodorus after Clitarchus corresponds in important
                    particulars with Takhti Jamshid, for example, in being supported by the mountain
                    on the east.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The name of

                    details, such as the triple wall, which it is difficult to reconcile with the
                    existing state of things, we must bear in mind on the one hand the great
                    destruction that must have been wrought in the course of thousands of years, and
                    on the other that small inaccuracies are not to be wondered at in a writer like
                    Clitarchus, who is constantly straining after effect. There is, however, <hi
                    rend="italic">one</hi> formidable difficulty. Diodorus says that the rock at the
                    back of the palace containing the royal sepulchres rises so steep that the
                    bodies could be raised to their last resting-place only by mechanical
                    appliances. This is not true of the graves behind Takhti Jamshid, to which, as
                    Stolze expressly observes, one can easily ride up; on the other hand, it is
                    strictly true of the graves at Nakshi Rustam. Stolze has accordingly started the
                    theory that the royal castle of Persepolis stood close by Nakshi Rustam, and has
                    sunk in course of time to shapeless heaps of earth, under which the remains may
                    be concealed. He and Andreas, our highest authorities on the topography of this
                    district,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We are here
                    again indebted to private communications from Stolze, as well as to his
                    published papers.</p></note> consider this spot peculiarly adapted for the site
                    of a citadel, while the water-supply would suffice for a numerous court-retinue
                    and garrison, and for a royal residence with its palaces and gardens.
                    Nevertheless -we are unable to adopt this suggestion. The vast ruins of Takhti
                    Jamshid, and the terrace constructed with so much labour, appear to us of more
                    importance than any number of doubts and conjectures. These remains can hardly
                    be anything else than the ruins of palaces and the other belongings of a kingly
                    residence; as for temples, the Persians had no such thing, at least in the time
                    of Darius and Xerxes. And it can hardly be supposed that such solid structures
                    were much more numerous in former times, and that these alone have survived
                    owing to their peculiar situation on the terrace. For, in the first place, it is
                    evident at a glance that the situation itself is of an exceptional kind.
                    Moreover, Persian tradition at a very remote period knew of only three
                    architectural wonders in that region, which it attributed to the fabulous queen
                    Humái (Khumái)—the grave of Cyrus at Murgáb, the building at Hájí ábád, and
                    those on the great terrace.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    safest therefore to identify these last with the royal palaces destroyed by
                    Alexander. Clitarchus, who can scarcely have visited the place himself, has

                    behind the palaces with those of Nakshi Rustam; indeed he appears to imagine
                    that all the royal sepulchres were at the same place. It is possible, however,
                    that the discrepancy originated with Diodorus, who often makes his extracts in a

                    >city</hi> being set on fire.</p></note></p>
                <p>If it should prove that, after all, the terrace is not large enough to have
                    contained the treasure-houses and the barracks of the garrison, in addition to
                    the palaces, or that Alexander could not have set fire to the latter without
                    endangering the former and the safety of the whole fortress, then we should have
                    to assume that a separate citadel (άκρα) stood somewhere outside of the terrace
                    with the palaces. There are many positions naturally adapted for defence in the
                    vicinity. But, as far as yet appears, such an assumption is scarcely required.
                    Of course we need not suppose that the number 3000 represents the actual
                    strength of Alexander’s garrison; and we must consider that, when Darius, in the
                    height of his power, laid out this place in the heart of his empire, he was
                    thinking more of regal magnificence than of security. A high Avail and a guard
                    of 200 men Avould suffice for the protection of the treasures at a time when

                    The city must have gradually declined in the course of time; but the ruins of

                    laid, and once more there arose round the tombs of the Achaemenians Avhat was
                    for centuries the theoretical metropolis of a great monarchy whose
                    administrative capitals lay far to the west. Istakhr acquired special importance
                    as the centre of priestly Avisdom and orthodoxy. In its most flourishing days it
                    Avas probably as large as Persepolis had been, whose ruins undoubtedly furnished
                    much of the material for its houses. The peaceable resident, intent on building
                    his house or hut, has too often proved more destructive to ancient buildings
                    than a foreign invader or even the disintegrating forces of nature. The Sasanian
                    kings have covered the face of the rocks in this neighbourhood, and in part even
                    the Achae-meniaι ruins, Avith their sculptures and inscriptions, and must
                    themselves have built largely here, although never on the same scale of
                    magnificence as their ancient predecessors. The Romans knew as little about
                    Istakhr as the Greeks had done about Persepolis, and this in spite of the fact
                    that for four hundred years they maintained relations, friendly or hostile,

                <p>At the time of the Arabian conquest Istakhr offered a desperate resistance,
                    Avhich Avas reneAved again and again before the place was finally subdued. Blood
                    flowed like Avater in these struggles for religion and liberty. Nevertheless the
                    city was still a place of considerable importance in the first century of Islam,
                    although its greatness was speedily eclipsed by the neAV metropolis Shiraz. In
                    the 10th century Istakhr had become an utterly insignificant place, as may be
                    seen from the descriptions of Istakhrí, a native (c. 950), and of Makdisí (c.
                    985). At this time the little tθAvn occupied approximately the site assigned to
                    it on Flandin’s map, near the present village of Hájí ábád, surrounding the
                    ruined structure of the Achaemenians, and principally on the left side of the
                    stream. During the folloAving centuries Istakhr gradually declined, until, as a
