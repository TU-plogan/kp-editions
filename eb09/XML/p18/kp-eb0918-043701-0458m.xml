                    itinerary through the Peloponnesus, including Attica, Baeotia, and Phocis, with
                    a rather slight mention of the adjacent islands and some of the principal towns
                    on the Asiatic coast. It was evidently compiled by one whose interest was mainly
                    centred in making notes of art-collections as they existed in the Greek temples
                    and public places in the time of the Antonines. In connexion with these he
                    expatiates on the myths and legends locally preserved, and thus he has handed
                    down to us much valuable mythological material which would otherwise have been
                    lost. A large portion of his work, however, is devoted to Greek history,
                    properly so called, though, after the manner of Herodotus and the early
                    logographers, he draws no distinction between legend and history. In a general
                    sense he may be styled an antiquary rather than an art-critic, a man of industry
                    rather than of genius, and one who deserves praise more from the matter of his
                    work than for the manner of it. Of the personal history of Pausanias nothing is
                    recorded. He lived during the prosperous times of the Roman empire under
                    Hadrian, whom he often mentions by name, and his successors Antoninus Pius and
                    Marcus Aurelius, the latter of whom became emperor in 161 <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    the Moors. Mention is also made of the “wall” raised between the Forth and the
                    Clyde by the elder Antonine to keep off the assaults of the Brigantes. About
                    himself and his birthplace the author is singularly reticent. Nor has his work
                    any formal introduction or conclusion. He commences abruptly with a description
                    of Attica: “The mainland of Hellas off the Cyclades and opposite the Aegean Sea
                    is called Attica, the jutting headland of which is Sunium. There is a harbour
                    when you have sailed past this foreland, and a temple of Athena the Sunian
                    goddess on the height.” He goes on to describe Athens at considerable length,
                    and gives a valuable though too brief account of the Parthenon and the great
                    bronze statue of the goddess on the Acropolis, the work of Phidias,<note

                    referred to by Aristophanes <hi rend="italic">(Eg.,</hi> 1172) and Euripides <hi

                    were visible to those sailing into the harbour from Sunium. On the ivory and
                    gold statue of the goddess in the Parthenon (c. 24) he writes very briefly; on
                    the Erechtheum and its antiquities he expatiates more largely. The great temple
                    of Ephesus, the very site of which was lost till Mr Wood’s explorations between
                    1863 and 1874, appears to have been perfect in his time, but he does not
                    describe it; he merely says<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>vii. (Achaica), 5, 2.</p></note> that “Ionia contains temples such as are
                    not elsewhere to be seen, and first of all that of the Ephesian goddess,
                    remarkable for its size and its wealth in general.”</p>
                <p>Like Herodotus and Strabo, Pausanias was a traveller and an inquirer. In some
                    respects it is probable that he imitates the manner of Herodotus, as in his
                    credulity<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As when he
                    says, as if seriously (viii. 2,. 4), that it seems to him quite credible that
                    Lycaon was changed into a wolf and Niobe into a stone in the good old times when
                    the gods conversed with men on earth.</p></note> and the affectation of reserve
                    in sacred matters. But, while geography and ethnology chiefly engaged the
                    attention of Strabo, art and antiquities generally form the staple of
                    Pausanias’s work. The passion of the Romans for securing specimens of Greek art
                    had long been fed by the plunder of temples and the removal of statues from the
                    towns of the Greek provinces, so graphically described in the orations against
                    Verres. Pausanias comments on the great antiquity of this kind of sacrilege. “It
                    is clear,” he remarks,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>viii. 46, 2.</p></note> “that Augustus was not the first who established the
                    custom of carrying away offerings from the temples of conquered nations, but
                    that he merely followed a very old precedent.” And he quotes many examples of
                    statues removed by right of conquest, as from Troy, from Brauron and Branchidae
                    by Xerxes, from Tiryns by the Argives, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In the age of the Antonines special attention was directed to the works of art
                    still remaining in the Greek cities. The work known as Antonine’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Itinerary,</hi> which is a kind of handbook of the whole Roman
                    empire and its complex system of roads and colonies, may have suggested to
                    Pausanias a “Description of Greece,” on the lines laid down by Herodotus and
                    Strabo; but we have no exact date of the composition of either work. Leland
                    compiled his <hi rend="italic">Itinerary</hi> or tour through Britain on much
                    the same principles, and his record of churches and castles as they remained in
                    the later years of Henry VIII. is a survey of mediaeval art which resembles the
                    notes of Pausanias formed from his own inquiry and observation.</p>

                    plunderings of Verres and the costly purchases of Cicero<note anchored="true"

                    which are matters of history. Nevertheless, after the drain of more than three
                    centuries, “Pausanias,” says Mr. Westropp,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">The Cycle of Development of the Art of

                    describe 2827 statues.”</p>
                <p>Whether Pausanias had any real taste or enthusiasm for or judgment of fine art
                    does not appear from his somewhat matter-of-fact accounts. He reminds us of a
                    catalogue of goods made with the view of a sale, <hi rend="italic">minus</hi>
                    the auctioneer’s “puffing.” Nor is his motive much more apparent; he may have
                    written to let connoisseurs know what was yet to be had, or to put on record
                    existing works, with the names of the artists, as a protest against further
                    spoliation, or he may have been commissioned by imperial authority to make a
                    list of the art-treasures still exhibited to travellers in the Roman provinces.
                    In the century from Augustus to Trajan Greek education in art, literature, and
                    philosophy was much affected by the rich and well-born Romans, and collections
                    of Greek bronzes and real or spurious articles of antiquity were keenly competed
                    for, as we know from many of the epigrams of Martial.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Propertius has a curious critique on the

                <p>Pausanias does not usually say that an object is beautiful; he tells us what it
                    is, where it is, and who executed it; that is generally all. Occasionally he
                    remarks that a statue is “worth <pb break="no"

                    hardly ever attempted. In ii. 27, 5 he speaks highly of Polyclitus as an
                    architect, and says that none can rival him for beauty or proportion. In vii. 5,
                    2 he says the temples of Hera in Samos and of Athena at Phocaea “were objects of
                    admiration,” though they had been burned and greatly injured by the Persians.
                    Occasionally (as vit 5, 4; 26, 6) he guesses the name of an unknown artist from
                    the style of a sculpture; in vii. 25, 4 he describes some marble statues of
                    women as showing a good style of art, <hi rend="italic">(χoυσaι τiχwηs eb.</hi>
                    His descriptions of a series of designs, like those painted by Polygnotus in the

                    (Phocica), 25-31.</p></note> are dry and without a glimpse of
                    discrimination,—mere lists of names and subjects, like modern “guides” to a
                    gallery or museum of art. At the same time the minuteness of observation and the
                    careful record of all the inscribed names are most commendable, and the value of
                    the account to us from a literary point of view, as showing what subjects were
                    regarded as “Homeric” in the time of Polygnotus, a contemporary of Pericles,
                    cannot be overrated. The same remarks apply to the account of the famous “chest
                    of Cypselus,” preserved at Olympia, and claiming a great antiquity from the
                    inscriptions being written <hi rend="italic">βουστροφηδόν,</hi> alternately from

                    scenes chiefly taken from the <hi rend="italic">Troica</hi> with these
                    words:<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>19, 2, p.

                    conjecture. The inscriptions upon it may perhaps be by another hand; but our
                    general impression ιvas that the designer was Eumelus of Corinth, mainly on
                    account of the processional hymn which he composed for Delos.” This Eumelus is
                    believed to have flourished about 750 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The
                    suspicion of Pausanias that the inscriptions were later make it probable that
                    the whole design and workmanship were imitative on an archaic model.</p>
                <p>Recent explorations, especially those at Olympia, are largely indebted to the
                    careful and detailed accounts of Pausanias.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the few faint expressions of pleasure or praise that the writer indulges in.
                    “You would be pleased,” he says, “also with the temple of Hercules at Erythrae,
                    and that of Athena at Priene, the latter on account of the statue, the Heracleum
                    for its antiquity.” These remarks show that he had visited and knew something of
                    the temples in Ionia. The tomb of Mausolus at Halicarnassus he mentions in terms
                    approaching to praise, viii. 16, 4.</p></note> His notes on the topography of
                    Athens, though he passes over several of the more important buildings, as the
                    great theatre and the Odeum, with little more than a mere reference, are still
                    the principal authority confinning the allusions in early writers. He seems,
                    indeed, to have admired objects more for their antiquity than for their beauty.
                    He often diverges into long details of history, largely mixed with legend, as in
                    his long account of the Messenian wars in book iv.; indeed, mythology and
                    history proper stand with Pausanias in precisely the same category. He does not
                    show any great advance in this respect from the times of Hecataeus or Pherecydes
                    of Syros.</p>
                <p>The style of Pausanias is simple and easy, but it is wanting in the quaintness
                    and vivacity of Herodotus, and it has not the florid eloquence of Plato or
                    Lucian. The simple and genuine credulity of Herodotus seems foolish or affected
                    in a writer who lived in a much more advanced period of human knowledge. Thus he
                    gravely tells us<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>viii.
                    (Arcadica), 18, 5.</p></note> that the water of the Styx will break crystal and
                    precious stones and vessels of clay, and cause metals, even gold, to decay, and
                    can only be kept in a horse’s hoof.</p>
                <p>The titles of the several books are taken from the divisions of the Peloponnesus,
                    together with the three lying immediately north of the isthmus; the first book
                    being devoted to Attica, the ninth to Baeotia, and the tenth to Phocis. The
                    remainder are (ii.) Corinthiaca, (iii.) Laconica, (iv.) Messeniaca, (v. and vi.)
                    Eliaca, (vii.) Achaica, (viii. ) Arcadica. In adopting this nomenclature he
                    probably followed the <hi rend="italic">Troica, Persica,</hi> &amp;c., of
                    Hellanicus. A vast mass of information is contained in these several books,
                    which may be closely compared in their treatment and in the great variety of
                    subjects with English “county histories.”</p>
                <p>Without the sustained interest and the genial humour which characterize the work
                    of Herodotus, composed as it evidently was for recital and not for private
                    reading, Pausanias is an accurate and diligent recorder of what he saw and knew.
                    He copied inscriptions, and, like Herodotus, he often quotes oracles; in
                    ascertaining the names of artists he is particularly careful. That he had made
                    great research into the history and topography of Greece is abundantly shown;
                    but he is rather chary in his reference to previous authors. Of Herodotus he
                    makes mention in eight or nine places, of Plutarch in one (i. 36, 4), of Plato
                    in four. Thucydides is referred to once (vi. 19, 5), Acusilaus once (ii. 16, 4),
                    Hellanicus twice, Hecataeus four times, Strabo nowhere. Of the poets, epic,
                    lyric, and dramatic, he displays a good knowledge, as well as of Pindar, whom he
                    frequently quotes. It is clear, therefore, that Pausanias was a literary man,
                    and perhaps it is more an idiosyncrasy than a fault that he is cold and prosaic
                    in his descriptions. Of the author’s birth, family, or country there are no
                    indications. The name is Doric, but the style is the Attic of Plutarch, Strabo,
                    and Lucian.</p>
                <p>The best editions of Pausanias are those of Sicbelis (5 vols. 8vo, Leipsic,
                    1822-28), and of Schubart and walz (3 vols. 8vo, Leipsic, 1838-40). Schubαrt <hi

                    careful and complete index. This is an excellent and accurate edition, and one
                    which leaves nothing to be desired. (F. A. P.)</p>
