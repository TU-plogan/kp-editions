                <p><label type="entry">PHRYNICHUS</label>, the name of a number of distinguished
                    Greeks, of whom the most prominent were the following.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Phrynichus,</hi> one of the earliest tragic poets of
                    Athens, was the son of Polyphradmon, and a pupil or fo11ower of Thespis, who is
                    commonly regarded as the founder of tragedy. But such were the improvements
                    introduced by Phrynichus that some of the ancients regarded him as its real
                    founder. He flourished, according to Cyrillus and Eusebius, in 483 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> but he gained a poetical victory (probably his
                    first) as èarly as 511. His famous play the <hi rend="italic">Capture of
                        Miletus</hi> was probably composed shortly after the conquest of that city
                    by the Persians (494). It moved the Athenians to tears; they fined the poet 1000
                    drachms for reminding them of the woes of their friends, and decreed that the
                    play should never be used again. In 476 Phrynichus won another poetical victory,
                    probably with his play the <hi rend="italic">Phaenissae,</hi> which celebrated
                    the defeat of Xerxes at Salamis (480). The drama derived its name from the
                    chorus of Phoenician women. On this occasion Themistocles acted as choragus, and
                    it is probable that the play was written to revive his waning popularity by
                    reminding the Athenians of his great deeds. The <hi rend="italic">Persians</hi>
                    of Aeschylus (exhibited in 472) was an imitation of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Phcenissae</hi> of Phrynichus. Phrynichus died in Sicily, perhaps at the
                    court of Hiero, tyrant of Syracuse, who welcomed those other great contemporary
                    poets Aeschylus and Pindar. The titles of his plays mentioned by Suidas and
                    others show that he treated mythological as well as contemporary subjects; such
                    are the titles <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic">Danaides,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Actaeon,</hi><hi rend="italic">Alcestis,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Tantalus.</hi> But in his plays, as in the early tragedies generally, the
                    dramatic element was subordinate to the lyric element as represented by the
                    chorus. Indeed in his earliest dramas there can only have been one actor, for
                    the introduction of two actors was a novelty due to his younger contemporary
                    Aeschylus, who first exhibited in 499. Phrynichus was especially famous for the
                    sweetness of his songs, which were sung by old people down to the time of
                    Aristophanes. Connected with the predominance of the chorus in early tragedies
                    was the prominence in them of the dance. There is an epigram ascribed to
                    Phrynichus in which he boasts that the figures of his dances were as various as
                    the waves of the sea. According to Suidas it was Phrynichus who first introduced
                    female characters on the stage (played by men in masks). The few remains of his
                    works are collected by Wagner and Nauck in their editions of the fragments of
                    the Greek tragedians.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Phrynichus,</hi> a poet of the Old Attic Comedy and a
                    contemporary of Aristophanes, is said by Suidas to have been an Athenian, but
                    according to the scholiast on Aristophanes <hi rend="italic">(Frogs,</hi> 13) he
                    was satirized as a foreigner. His first comedy was exhibited in 429 B.c.
                    (according to Suidas, as corrected by Clinton and Meineke). He composed ten
                    plays, of which the <hi rend="italic">Solitary</hi> (“Monotropos”) was exhibited
                    in 414 along with the <hi rend="italic">Birds</hi> of Aristophanes and gained
                    the third prize, and the <hi rend="italic">Muser</hi> carried off the second
                    prize in 405, Aristophanes being first with the <hi rend="italic">Frogs.</hi>
                    This poet <hi rend="italic">(Frogs,</hi> 13) accuses Phrynichus of employing
                    vulgar tricks to raise a laugh, and he was further charged with plagiarism and
                    defective versification, but such accusations were too commonly bandied between
                    rival poets to merit much attention. He was not included by the Alexandrian
                    critics in their canon of the best poets. The remains of his works, which have
                    been edited with the other fragments of the Attic Comedy by Meineke and Bothe,
                    are too scanty to allow us to judge of their merits.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="smallcaps">Phrynichus</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Arabius,</hi> a
                    grammarian of Bithynia, lived in the reigns of the emperors Marcus Antoninus and
                    Commodus (2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> According to Suidas he was
                    the author of the following works; (1) an <hi rend="italic">Atticist, or On
                        Attic Words,</hi> in two books; (2) <hi rend="italic">Υιθeμeνων</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">συναγωγή·,</hi> (3) <hi rend="italic">'∑οφιστικη
                        πaρaσκevη,</hi> or Sophistical Preparation, in forty-seven or (according to
                    others) seventy-four books. We have an account of the last-mentioned work by
                    Photius, who had read thirty-six books of it. The copy used by Photius contained
                    only thirty-seven books, but he states that the author in a preface addressed to
                    the emperor Commodus, to whom the work was dedicated, promised, if life lasted,
                    to write as many more books. Separate parts of the work were dedicated to
                    various friends, and Phrynichus excused its delays and imperfections on the
                    ground of numerous illnesses. It consisted of a collection of Attic words and
                    phrases, arranged in alphabetical order, and distinguished according to the
                    purposes they were meant to serve, whether oratorical, historical,
                    conversational, jocular, or amatory. The models of Attic style, according to
                    Phrynichus, were Plato, Demosthenes and the other nine Attic orators (viz.,
                    Antiphon, Andocides, Lysias, Isocrates, Isaeus, Aeschines, Dinarchus, Lycurgus,
                    Hyperides), Thucydides, Xenophon, Aeschines the Socratic, Critias, Antisthenes,
                    Aristophanes and the other poets of the Old Comedy, together with Aeschylus,
                    Sophocles, and Euripides. Of these, again, he assigned the highest place to
                    Plato, Demosthenes, and Aeschines the Socratic. The work was learned, but prolix
                    and garrulous. A fragment of it, contained in a Paris MS., was published by
                    Montfaucon, and again by Im. Bekker in the first volume of his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Anecdota Graeca</hi> (Berlin, 1814). We possess another work of Phrynichus
                    which is not mentioned by Photius, but is, perhaps, identical with the <hi
                        rend="italic">Atticist</hi> mentioned by Suidas. This is the <hi
                        rend="italic">Selection (Ecloge) of Attic Words and Phrases.</hi> It is
                    dedicated to Cornelianus, a man of literary tastes, and one of the emperor’s
                    secretaries, who had invited the author to undertake the work. It is a
                    collection of current words and forms which deviated from the Old Attic
                    standard. Side by side with these incorrect words and forms are given the true
                    Attic equivalents. The work is thus a “lexicon antibarbarum,” and is interesting
                    as illustrating the changes through which the Greek language had passed between
                    the 4th century B.c. and the 2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    Phrynichus is especially severe upon Menander, and wonders what people can see
                    in him to admire so much. The style is concise and pointed, and is occasionally
                    relieved by touches of dry humour. The book is divided into two parts, of which
                    the second appears in some editions as a separate work under the title of <hi
                        rend="italic">Epitome.</hi> Editions of it, with valuable notes, have been
                    published by Chr. Aug. Lobeck (Leipsic, 1820) and W. G. Rutherford (London,
                    1881). Lobeck devotes his attention chiefly to the later, Rutherford to the
                    earlier usages noticed by Phrynichus.</p>
                <p>There was also an Athenian general Phrynichus in the Peloponnesian War, who took
                    a leading part in establishing the oligarchy of the Four Hundred at Athens in
                    411 B.c. He was assassinated in the same year.</p>
