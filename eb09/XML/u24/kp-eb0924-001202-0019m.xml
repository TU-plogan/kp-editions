                    fertile, highly cultivated, and densely peopled plain. Within the enclosures,
                    consisting of a wall and deep ditch that can be flooded, there is a mixed
                    Mohammedan and Christian population of from 25,000 to 30,000, while the
                    surrounding district is studded with over 300 populous villages. Some of the
                    streets are broader than is usual in Oriental towns and several are traversed by
                    running water; but, beyond a busy bazaar and two or three old mosques, there is
                    nothing of any interest. The chief industries are weaving, dyeing, and
                    especially tillage, abundant crops of rice, melons, cotton, and excellent
                    tobacco being raised in the neighbourhood. Urmia has for many years been the
                    centre of an American mission, which has had considerable success, especially
                    amongst the so-called “Chaldean” or Nestorian Christians. According to an old
                    tradition, Urmia was the birthplace of Zoroaster.</p>
                <p>The lake, which takes its name from the town, and which is also known as the
                    Daria-cha, or “Little Sea,” is a completely landlocked basin, filling a shallow
                    depression at the east foot of the Kurdish Highlands, but still about 5000 feet
                    above sea-level. It is 90 miles long north and south, 30 miles broad, and 250
                    round, with a total area of 1600 square miles, but a mean depth of not more than
                    10 or 12 feet (45 in the deepest part sounded by Monteith), so that the whole
                    volume is at least six times less than that of the much smaller lake of Geneva.
                    There are as many as fifty-six islands, grouped chiefly towards the south, the
                    largest 5 miles by 2, the smallest mere rocks, and none permanently inhabited,
                    although they are tilled or used for grazing horses and sheep in winter.
                    Although fed by numerous streams, the lake is intensely saline, more so even
                    than the Dead Sea, and is consequently inhabited by no fish or other aquatic
                    fauna, except a peculiar species of small crustacean, which affords abundant
                    food to numerous swans and other wild-fowl. The salt, which forms extensive
                    incrustations some inches thick round about the shelving north-eastern and
                    southern shores, appears to be derived from Tertiary beds (Dr E. Tietze), and
                    the geological formation appears to resemble that of Lake Niris in southern
                    Persia (Blanford). The whole lacustrine basin, including the farthest sources of
                    its influents, has an area of about 20,000 square miles, and the flooded part
                    stood formerly at a much higher level than at present, as is shown by the
                    watermarks on the encircling heights, and by the Shahi peninsula in the
                    north-east, which at one time was certainly an island. In recent years the
                    evaporation has on the whole balanced the inflow, although the lake is now said
                    to be slightly rising, owing to the larger discharge from the Jaghatu and Tatau,
                    which were formerly to a great extent absorbed in irrigating the southern
                    Miandab plain. Near the Selmas river and at the village of Dihkergan in the
                    south-east occur the famous “marble springs,” yielding the pink, yellow, and
                    white “marble of Tabriz,” used for ornamenting many public buildings throughout
                    western Asia.</p>
