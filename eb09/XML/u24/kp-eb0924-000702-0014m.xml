                    already briefly referred to under <hi rend="smallcaps">Chemistry</hi> (vol. v.
                    p. 542). The credit of its discovery as an element must be assigned to Klaproth,
                    who in 1789 isolated from pitch-blende a yellow oxide which, while obviously
                    metallic, was foreign to all the known metals. He accordingly viewed it as the
                    oxide of a new metal, which he named uranium, after the newly discovered planet
                    of Herschel. From the yellow oxide he obtained, by reduction with charcoal at a
                    high temperature, what he took to be metallic uranium. Berzelius about 1823
                    found that the yellow oxide, when treated with excess of sulphuric acid, united
                    with it into a sulphate, not unlike the ferric salt Fe <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>.3SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> in its
                    character. Hence he concluded that the uranium salt is Ur <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>.3SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, where Ur
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, according to his

                    substitute for Berzelius’s actual numbers the corresponding values calculated

                    until Péligot in 1840 discovered that Berzelius’s (and Klaproth’s) metal
                    contains oxygen, and that his (Ur <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) O <hi

                    Berzelius, have been amply confirmed by all subsequent investigators; only now,
                    on theoretical grounds, first set forth by Mendeljeff, we have come to double
                    Péligot’s atomic weight, so that throughout this article U signifies 240 parts
                    of uranium, while UO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> stands as the formula of the
                    yellow oxide, and UO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> as that of Berzelius’s
                    metal.</p>
                <p>The only practically available raw material for the extraction of uranium is
                    pitch-blende (Germ. and Fr. <hi rend="italic">Uranpecherz),</hi> which occurs
                    associated with lead and silver ores, chiefly in Joachimsthal and at Przibram in
                    Bohemia, at Schneeberg in Saxony, and at Redruth in Cornwall, forming greenish
                    or brownish black masses clustering together like grapes. Its hardness is 5∙5.
                    The specific gravity varies from 6∙4 to 8, the mineral almost invariably
                    presenting itself in intimate intermixture with a host of foreign metallic
                    compounds, such as sulphides, arsenides, &amp;c. Pure pitch-blende is U <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi>, which in relatively
                    good specimens forms some 80 per cent. or more of the whole.</p>
                <p>In the chemical treatment of the ore, it is expedient to begin by removing at
                    least part of the arsenic and sulphur of the admixtures by roasting, and then to
                    wash away the light oxides with water or dissolve them away with hydrochloric
                    acid. In one of the many processes proposed the purified ore is disintegrated
                    with hot nitric acid, to produce nitrates, which are then converted into
                    sulphates by evaporation with oil of vitriol. The sulphates are treated with
                    water, which dissolves the uranium and other soluble salts, while silica,
                    sulphate of lead, &amp;c., remain; these are removed by filtration. From the
                    solution the arsenic, copper, &amp;c., are precipitated by sulphuretted hydrogen
                    as sulphides, which are filtered off. The filtrate contains the uranium as
                    uranous and the iron as ferrous salt. These are oxidized by means of chlorine or
                    some other oxidizing agent, and precipitated conjointly by excess of ammonia.
                    The precipitate, after having been collected and washed, is digested with a warm
                    concentrated solution of carbonate of ammonia, which dissolves the uranium as a
                    yellow solution of uranate of ammonia, while the hydrated oxide of iron, the
                    alumina, &amp;c., remain. These are filtered off hot, and the filtrate is
                    allowed to cool, when crystals of the uranate separate out. The mother liquor
                    includes generally more or less of nickel, cobalt, zinc, and other heavy metals,
                    which, as Wohler showed, can be removed as insoluble sulphides by the addition
                    of sulphide of ammonium; uranium, under the circumstances, is not precipitated
                    by sulphide of ammonium. The filtrate, on being boiled down, yields a second
                    crop of uranate of ammonia. This uranate when ignited in a platinum crucible
                    leaves a green oxide of the composition U <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 8</hi>, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., artificial pitch-blende,
                    which serves as a starting point for the preparation of uranium compounds. The
                    green oxide, as a rale, requires to be further purified. One method for this
                    purpose is to convert it into a solution of the nitrate UO <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> (NO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and from
                    it to precipitate the metal as oxalate by the addition of oxalic acid (Péligot).
                    The latter (UO <hi rend="subscript"> 2.</hi> C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) yields a purer oxide, UO <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi>, or, in the presence of air, U <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 8</hi>, on ignition.</p>
                <p>Metallic uranium, as shown by Péligot, can be obtained by the reduction of a
                    mixture of dry chloride of potassium and dry uranous chloride, UC1 <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, with sodium at a red heat (for details see handbooks
                    of chemistry). The metal, which is easily separated from the slag by treatment
                    with water, remains as a dark heavy powder or in white compact globules,
                    according to the temperature at which it was produced. According to Zimmermann,
                    to whom we owe a recent investigation on the matter, pure compact uranium is a
                    white malleable metal, which is pretty hard, though “softer than steel.” Its
                    specific gravity has the high value 18∙7; its specific heat is 0∙02765,
                    corresponding to U = 240. The fusing point, from Zimmermann’s statements on its
                    preparation, seems to lie at bright redness. The compact metal when exposed to
                    the air tarnishes only very slowly. The powdery metal when heated in air to 150°
                    or 170° C. catches fire and burns brilliantly into U <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi>. Dilute sulphuric acid attacks it but
                    slowly; hydrochloric acid, especially if strong, dissolves it readily, with the
                    formation, more immediately, of a hyacinth-coloured solution of U <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, which, however,
                    readily absorbs oxygen from the air, with the formation of a green solution of
                    UC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, which in its turn gradually passes into one of
                    yellow uranyl salt, UO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.C1 <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi>.</p>

                    dissolves in hot oil of vitriol; the mass, when treated with water, dissolves;

                    The anhydrous chloride UC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> was prepared for the
                    first time by Péligot by heating an intimate mixture of the green oxide and
                    charcoal to redness in a current of dry chlorine; it is obtained as sublimate of
                    black-green metallic-looking octahedra. The chloride is very hygroscopic.
                    Uranous salts pass into uranic (uranyl) compounds under the same circumstances
                    under which ferrous salts become ferric, only they do so far more readily.</p>

                    soluble in water. This salt is used in photography, also in analysis as a

                    is mixed with one of ammonia, or potash, or soda, the uranium is precipitated in

                    Solutions of uranyl salts (nitrate, &amp;c.) behave to reagents as follows:
                    sulphuretted hydrogen produces green uranous salt with precipitation of sulphur;

                    sulphur; ammonia gives a yellow precipitate of uranate of ammonia,
                    characteristically soluble in hot carbonate of ammonia solution; prussiate of
                    potash gives a brown precipitate which in appearance is not unlike the
