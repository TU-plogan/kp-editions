                <p><label type="entry">URAL-ALTAIC LANGUAGES</label>. The Ural-Altaic, Finno-Tatar,
                    or “Turanian” languages constitute one of the primary linguistic families (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Philology,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 779) of the eastern
                    hemisphere, occupying a vast domain, which extends with few interruptions from
                    the Balkan Peninsula, Hungary, and Lapland eastwards to the Pacific Ocean, and
                    from the Arctic Ocean southwards to China proper, Tibet, and the Mediterranean.
                    It thus comprises nearly the whole of Asiatic and a considerable section of
                    European Russia, the northern half of the Chinese empire, a large part of north
                    Persia, by far the greater part of Asia Minor, and extensive tracts in European
                    Turkey, Austria, and Scandinavia, with an area of not less than 10,000,000
                    square miles and a total population of over 40,000,000. Philologists recognize
                    six well - marked branches, which, with their main subdivisions and four
                    outlying doubtful or extinct members of the family, may be tabulated as under

                <p>In its morphology Ural-Altaic belongs to the agglutinating order of speech,
                    differing from other languages of this order chiefly in the exclusive use of
                    suffixes attached to the unmodified root, and partly blended with it by the
                    principle of progressive vowel harmony, in virtue of which the vowels of all the
                    suffixes are assimilated to that of the root. Thus the typical formula is <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">R + r + r + r,</hi> &amp;c., where R is the root, always placed
                    first, and <hi rend="smallcaps">r, r, r . . .</hi> the successive postfixed
                    relational elements, whose vowels conform by certain subtle laws of euphony to
                    that of the root, which never changes. These suffixes differ also from the case
                    and verbal endings of true inflecting languages (Aryan, Semitic) in their
                    slighter fusion with the root, with which they are rather mechanically united
                    (agglutinated) than chemically fused into a term in which root and relational
                    element are no longer separable. Hence it is that the roots, which in Aryan are
                    generally obscured, blurred, often even changed past the possibility of
                    identification, in Ural-Altaic are always in evidence, unaffected by the
                    addition of any number of formative particles, and controlling the whole
                    formation of the word. For instance, the infinitive element <hi rend="italic"
                    >mak</hi> of the Osmanli <hi rend="italic">yaz-mak =</hi> to write becomes <hi
                    rend="italic">mek</hi> in <hi rend="italic">sev-mek =</hi> to love (vowel
                    harmony), and shifts its place in <hi rend="italic">sev-il-mek =</hi> to be
                    loved (imperfect fusion with the root), while the root itself remains unchanged
                    as to form and position in <hi rend="italic">sev-ish-il-mek</hi> = to be
                    impelled to love, or in any other possible combination with suffixed elements.
                    The facility with which particles are in this way tacked on produces an
                    exuberance, especially of verbal forms, which in Osmanli, Finnish, Magyar,
                    Tungus, and Mordvinian may be said to run riot. This <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n9/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0009-0002"/> is particularly the case when the numerous modal
                    forms become further complicated by incorporating the direct pronominal object,
                    as in the Magyar <hi rend="italic">varjak</hi> = they await him, and the
                    Mordvinian <hi rend="italic">palasa</hi> = I embrace him. Thus arise endless
                    verbal combinations, reckoned in Turki at nearly 30,000, and past counting in
                    the Ugrian group.</p>
                <p>Another marked peculiarity of the Ural-Altaic, at least as compared with the
                    inflecting orders of speech, is weak subjectivity, the subject or agent being
                    slightly, the object of the action strongly accentuated, so that “it was done by
                    him” becomes “it was done with him, through him, or in his place” <hi
                    rend="italic">(apud eum).</hi> From this feature, which seems to be
                    characteristic of all the branches, there follow some important consequences,
                    such as a great preponderance of locative forms in the declension,—the
                    nominative, and often even the possessive, being expressed by no special suffix.
                    Hence also the object normally precedes the subject, while the idea of
                    possession (to have) is almost everywhere replaced by that of being (to be), so
                    that, even in the highly developed Osmanli, “I have no money” becomes
                    “money-to-me not-is” <hi rend="italic">(Akchehím yok-dür).</hi> In fact the verb
                    is not clearly differentiated from the noun, so that the conjugation is mainly
                    participial, being effected by agglutinating pronominal, modal, temporal,
                    negative, passive, causative, reciprocal, reflexive, and other suffixes to
                    nominal roots or gerunds: I write = writing-to-me-is. Owing to this confusion of
                    noun and verb, the same suffixes are readily attached indifferently to both, as
                    in the Osmanli <hi rend="italic">ján =</hi> soul, <hi rend="italic">ján-ler</hi>
                    = souls, and <hi rend="italic">yázár =</hi> he will write, <hi rend="italic"
                    >yázár-ler</hi> = they will write. So also, by assimilation, the Yakut <hi
                    rend="italic">kötördör kötöllör =</hi> the birds fly (from root <hi
                    rend="italic">kot</hi> = flying), where <hi rend="italic">kötöl</hi> stands for
                    <hi rend="italic">kötör,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dör</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">lör,</hi> the Osmanli <hi rend="italic">ler,</hi> or suffix of
                    plurality.</p>
                <p>But, notwithstanding this wealth of nominal or verbal forms, there is a great
                    dearth of general relational elements, such as the relative pronoun, grammatical
                    gender, degrees of comparison, conjunctions, and even postpositions. Byrne’s
                    remark, made in reference to Tungus, that “there is a great scarcity of elements
                    of relation, very few conjunctions, and no true postpositions, except those
                    which are given in the declension of the noun,”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Gen. Prin. of Struct. of
                    Bang.,</hi> i. p. 391, London, 1885.</p></note> is mainly true of the whole
                    family, in which nouns constantly do duty for formative suffixes. Thus nearly
                    all the Ostiak postpositions are nouns which take the possessive suffix and
                    govern other nouns in the genitive, precisely as in the Hindi: <hi rend="italic"
                    >ādmī-kī-tărăf (men) găyā =</hi> man-of-direction (in) I went = I went towards
                    the man, where the so-called postposition <hi rend="italic">tărăf,</hi> being a
                    feminine noun = direction, requires the preceding possessive particle to be also
                    feminine <hi rend="italic">(kī</hi> for <hi rend="italic">kē).</hi></p>
                <p>As there are thus only two classes of words,—the roots, which always remain
                    roots, and the suffixes, which always remain suffixes,—it follows that there can
                    be no true composition or word-building, but only derivation. Even the numerous
                    Magyar nominal and adjectival compounds are not true compounds, but merely two
                    words in juxtaposition, unconnected by vowel harmony and liable to be separated
                    in construction by intervening particles. Thus in <hi rend="italic">aran-sinü
                    =</hi> gold-colour = golden, the first part <hi rend="italic">aran</hi> receives
                    the particle of comparison, the second remaining unchanged, as if we were to say
                    “gold-er-colour” for “more golden”; and <hi rend="italic">ata-fi</hi> = relative
                    becomes <hi rend="italic">ata-m-fi-a</hi> = my relative, with intrusion of the
                    pronominal <hi rend="italic">m =</hi> my.</p>
                <p>But, while these salient features are common, or nearly common, to all, it is not
                    to be supposed that the various groups otherwise present any very close
                    uniformity of structure or vocabulary. Excluding the doubtful members, the
                    relationship between the several branches is far less intimate than between the
                    various divisions of the Semitic and even of the Aryan family, so that, great as
                    is, for instance, the gap between English and Sanskrit, that between Lapp and
                    Manchu is still greater.</p>
                <p>After the labours of Castrén, Csink, Gabelentz, Schmidt, Böhtlingk, Zenker,
                    Almqvist, Radloff, Munkacsi-Berat, and especially Winkler, their genetic
                    affinity can no longer be seriously doubted. But the order of their genetic
                    descent from a presumed common organic Ural-Altaic language is a question
                    presenting even greater difficulties than the analogous Aryan problem. The
                    reason is, not only because these groups are spread over a far wider range, but
                    because the dispersion from a common centre took place at a time when the
                    organic speech was still in a very low state of development. Hence the various
                    groups, starting with little more than a common first germ, sufficient, however,
                    to give a uniform direction to their subsequent evolution, have largely diverged
                    from each other during their independent development since the remotest
                    prehistoric times. Hence also, while the Aryan as now known to us represents a
                    descending line of evolution from the synthetic to the analytic state, the
                    Ural-Altaic represents on the contrary an upward growth, ranging from the
                    crudest syntactical arrangements in Manchu to a highly agglutinating but not
                    true inflecting state in Finnish.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“Meine Ansichten werden sich im Fortgange ergeben, so
                    namentlich dass ich nicht entfernt die finnischen Sprachen für flexivische
                    halten kann” (H. Winkler, <hi rend="italic">Uralaltaische Völker,</hi> i. p.
                    54). Yet even true inflexion can scarcely be denied at least to some of the
                    so-called Yenisei Ostiak dialects, such as Kotta and others still surviving
                    about the middle Yenisei and on its affluents, the Agul and Kan (Castrén, <hi
                    rend="italic">Yen</hi>., <hi rend="italic">Ostjak., und Kott. Sprachlehre,</hi>
                    1858, Preface, pp. v-viii). These, however, may be regarded as aberrant members
                    of the family, and on the whole it is true that the Ural-Altaic system nowhere
                    quite reaches the stave of true inflexion.</p></note> No doubt Manchu also, like
                    its congeners, had formerly possessive affixes and personal elements, lost
                    probably through Chinese influences; but it can never have possessed the
                    surprisingly rich and even superabundant relational forms so characteristic of
                    Magyar, Finn, Osmanli, and other western branches. As regards the mutual
                    relations of all the groups, little more can now be said than that they fall
                    naturally into two main divisions—Mongolo-Turkic and
                    Finno-Ugro-Samoyedo-Tungusic—according to the several methods of employing the
                    auxiliary elements. Certainly Turkic lies much closer to Mongolic than it does
                    to Samoyedic and Tungusic, while Finno-Ugric seems to occupy an intermediate
                    position between Turkic and Samoyedic, agreeing chiefly in its roots with the
                    former, in its suffixes with the latter. Finno-Ugric must have separated much
                    earlier, Mongolic much later, from the common connexion, and the latter, which
                    has still more than half its roots and numerous forms in common with Turkic,
                    appears on the whole to be the most typical member of the family. Hence many
                    Turkic forms and words can be explained only by reference to Mongolic, which has
                    at the same time numerous relations to Finno-Ugric and Samoyedic that have been
                    lost in Turkic and Tungusic. It may therefore be concluded that the Finno-Ugric
                    migrations to the north and west and the Tungusic to the east had been completed
                    while the Turkic and Mongolic tribes were still dwelling side by side on the
                    Altai steppes, the probable cradle of the Ural-Altaic peoples.</p>
                <p>How profoundly the several groups differ one from the other even in their
                    structure is evident from the fact that such assumed universal features as
                    unchangeable roots and vowel harmony are subject to numerous exceptions, often
                    spread over wide areas. Not only is assimilation of final consonants very
                    common, as in the Osmanli <hi rend="italic">bulun-mαk</hi> for the Uigur <hi
                    rend="italic">bulul-mαk,</hi> but the root vowel itself is frequently subject to
                    <hi rend="italic">umlaut</hi> through the influence of suffixed vowels, as in
                    the Aryan family. Thus in the Surgut dialect of Ostiak the long vowels of
                    nominal stems become modified before the possessive suffix, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ā</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ē</hi> to <hi rend="italic">ī</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ō</hi> to <hi rend="italic">ū</hi> (Castrén). It is still more
                    remarkable to find that the eastern (Yenisei) Ostiak has even developed verbal
                    forms analogous to the Teutonic strong conjugation, the presents <hi
                    rend="italic">tabāq', abbatag'an,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">datpaq'</hi>
                    becoming in the past <hi rend="italic">tobāq', abbatog'an,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">datpiyaq'</hi> respectively; so also <hi rend="italic">taig,
                    tōrg,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tārg,</hi> present, past, and imperative, are
                    highly suggestive of Teutonic inflexion, but more probably are due to Tibetan
                    influences. In the same dialects many nouns form their plurals either by
                    modifying the root vowel, in combination with a suffixed element, or by
                    modification alone, the suffix having disappeared, as in the English <hi
                    rend="italic">foot—feet, goose—geese.</hi> So also vowel harmony, highly
                    developed in Finnish, Magyar, and Osmanli, and of which two distinct forms occur
                    in Yakutic, scarcely exists at all in Tchere-missian, Votyak, and the Revel
                    dialect of Esthonian, while in Mordvinian and Siryenian, not the whole word, but
                    the final vowels alone are harmonized. The unassimilated Uiguric <hi
                    rend="italic">kilur-im</hi> answers to the Osmanli <hi rend="italic"
                    >kilur-um,</hi> while in Manchu the concordance is neglected, especially when
                    two consonants intervene between the root and the suffixed vowels. But too much
                    weight should not be attached to the phenomenon of vowel harmony, which is of
                    comparatively recent origin, as shown in the oldest Magyar texts of the 12th
                    century, which abound in such discordances as <hi rend="italic"
                    >halál-nek,</hi><pb break="no"

                    organic Ural-Altaic speech, but was independently developed by the different
                    branches on different lines after the dispersion, its origin being due to the
                    natural tendency to merge root and suffix in one harmonious whole. The principle
                    being thus of a purely psychological character, and necessarily an aftergrowth,
                    it is not surprising to find no traces of it in the oldest and even in the later
                    Accad texts, as seen by comparing the old <hi rend="italic">idi bar-mun-sib</hi>
                    with the more recent <hi rend="italic">igi mun-sib-bar.</hi></p>
                <p>This progressive vocalic harmony has been compared to a sort of progressive <hi
                    rend="italic">umlaut,</hi> in which the suffixed vowels are brought by
                    assimilation into harmony with those of the root All vowels are broadly divided
                    into two categories, the guttural or hard and the [)alatal or weak, the
                    principle requiring that, if the root vowel be hard, the suffixed must also be
                    hard, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> But in some of the groups there is
                    an intermediate class of “neutral” vowels, which do not require to be
                    harmonized, being indifferent to either category. In accordance with these
                    general principles the vowels in some of the leading members of the Altaic
                    family are thus classified by L. Adam—<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>A close analogy to this law is presented by the Irish rule of “broad to broad”
                    and “slender to slender,” according to which under certain conditions a broad
                    (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>, <hi rend="italic">o, u)</hi> must be followed in the
                    next syllable by a broad, and a slender (<hi rend="italic">e</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi>) by a slender. Obvious parallelisms are also such forms in
                    Latin as <hi rend="italic">annus, perennis, ars, iners, lego, diligo,</hi>
                    where, however, the root vowel is modified by the affix, not the affix by the
                    root. But such instances suffice to show that the harmonic principle is not
                    peculiar to the Ural-Altaic, but only more systematically developed in that than
                    in most other linguistic families.</p>
                <p>This is not the place to discuss the vexed question of the relation of the
                    Babylonian Accad and Sumirian, or of the Etruscan, with the Ural-Altaic
                    linguistic stock. It must therefore suffice to state in a general way that,
                    according to the latest views, both of those long extinct languages were really
                    branches either of the Finno-Ugric or of the Turko-Mongolic division of that
                    family. In reply to the objection that Sumirian was a prefix language, it is
                    pointed out that Neo-Sumirian, extinct some 1600 years before the Christian era,
                    had already become postfixing, so that the <hi rend="italic">nin-gar</hi> of the

                    settled, as may be judged from the fact that such specialists as Dr Zimmern and
                    Dr Hommel are still at issue on the fundamental question of the Ural-Altaic
                    affinities of Accad and Sumirian. The position of Etruscan is much the same, the
                    main outcome of recent controversy being that this primitive Italian language
                    can scarcely have been a member of the Aryan, whatever its relationship to the
                    Finno-Tataric family.</p>
                <p>Regarding the Japanese and Corean languages, it may be remarked that Winkler
                    agrees with Boiler in unhesitatingly including the former, while doubtfully
                    excluding the latter from this connexion. On the other hand, W. G. Aston (<hi
                    rend="italic">Journ. Roy. Asiat. Soc.,</hi> August 1879) considers that both are
                    as nearly related to one another as English and Sanskrit. The probability
                    therefore is that Japanese and Corean are aberrant branches of the Ural-Altaic
                    family, and that they separated at long intervals from the parent stock and at
                    such remote periods that their affinities can no longer be clearly traced.</p>
