                <p><label type="entry">USURY</label>. An ancient legal conception, it has been said,
                    corresponds not to one but to several modern conceptions; and the proposition is
                    equally true when economic is substituted for legal. Until quite recent times
                    the term “usury” covered a number of essentially different social phenomena.
                    “Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother, usury of money, usury of
                    victuals, usury of anything that is lent upon usury. Unto a stranger thou mayest
                    lend upon usury; but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury, that the
                    Lord thy God may bless thee” (Deut. xxiii. 19, 20). In this sentence we find
                    interest of all kinds blended together, and the natural economic tendencies
                    directly counteracted by the moral and religious law. At the present day,
                    “usury,” if used in the old sense of the term, would embrace a multitude of
                    modes of receiving interest upon capital to which not the slightest moral taint
                    is attached. The man who does not in some shape or other lend his capital upon
                    “usury” is, in the modern world, generally considered as lacking in his duty to
                    himself or his family. The change in the moral attitude towards usury is perhaps
                    best expressed by saying that in ancient times so much of the lending at
                    interest was associated with cruelty and hardship that all lending was branded
                    as immoral (or all interest was usury in the moral sense), whilst at present so
                    little lending takes place, comparatively, except on commercial principles, <pb

                    immoral taint. This change in the attitude of common-sense morality in respect
                    to “anything that is lent upon usury” is one of the most peculiar and
                    instructive features in the economic progress of society.</p>
                <p>“It is worthy of remark,” says Grote (<hi rend="italic">History of Greece,</hi>
                    vol. iii. p. 144), “that the first borrowers must have been for the most part
                    men driven to this necessity by the pressure of want and contracting debt as a
                    desperate resource without any fair prospect of ability to pay; debt and famine
                    run together in the mind of the poet Hesiod. The borrower is in this unhappy
                    state rather a distressed man soliciting aid than a solvent man capable of
                    making and fulfilling a contract; and if he cannot find a friend to make a free
                    gift to him in the former character he would not under the latter character
                    obtain a loan from a stranger except by the promise of exorbitant interest and
                    by the fullest eventual power over his person which he is in a position to
                    grant.” This remark, though suggested by the state of society in ancient Greece,
                    is largely applicable throughout the world until the close of the early Middle
                    Ages. Borrowers were not induced to borrow as a rule with the view of employing
                    the capital so obtained at a greater profit, but they were compelled of
                    necessity to borrow as a last resort. The conditions of ancient usury find a
                    graphic illustration in the account of the building of the second temple at
                    Jerusalem (Neh. v. 1-12). The reasons for borrowing are famine and tribute. Some
                    said, “We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy
                    corn, because of the dearth ;” others said, “We have borrowed money for the
                    king’s tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards . . . and, lo, we bring
                    into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, . . . neither is it in
                    our power to redeem them, for other men have our lands and vineyards.” In
                    ancient Greece we find similar examples of the evil effects of usury, and a law
                    of bankruptcy resting on slavery. In Athens about the time of Solon’s
                    legislation (594 B.c.) the bulk of the population, who had originally been small
                    proprietors or metayers, became gradually indebted to the rich to such an extent
                    that they were practically slaves. Those who still kept their property nominally
                    were in the position of Irish cottiers: they owed more than they could pay, and
                    stone pillars erected on their land showed the amount of the debts and the names
                    of the lenders. Usury had given all the power of the state to a small
                    plutocracy. The remedy which Solon adopted was of a kind that we are accustomed
                    to consider as purely modern. In the first place, it is true that according to
                    ancient practice he proclaimed a general <hi rend="italic">seisachtheia,</hi> or
                    shaking off of burdens: he cancelled all the debts made on the security of the
                    land or the person of the debtor. This measure alone would, however, have been
                    of little service, had he not at the same time enacted that henceforth no loans
                    could be made on the bodily security of the debtor, and the creditor was
                    confined to a share of the property. The consequence of this simple but
                    effective reform was that Athens was never again disturbed by the agitation of
                    insolvent debtors. Solon left the rate of interest to be determined by free
                    contract, and sometimes the rate was exceedingly high, but none of the evils so
                    generally prevalent in antiquity were experienced.</p>
                <p>When we turn to Rome, we find exactly the same difficulties arising, but they
                    were never successfully met. As in Athens in early times, the mass of the people
                    were yeomen, living on their own small estates, and in time they became
                    hopelessly in debt. Accordingly the legislation of the XII. Tables, about 500
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> was intended to strike at the evil by
                    providing a maximum rate of interest. Unfortunately, however, no alteration was
                    made in the law of debt, and the attempt to regulate the rate of interest
                    utterly failed. In the course of two or three centuries the small free farmers
                    were utterly destroyed. By the pressure of war and taxes they were all driven
                    into debt, and debt ended practically, if not technically, in slavery. It would
                    be difficult to over-estimate the importance of the influence of usury on the
                    social and economic history of the Roman republic. In the provinces the evils of
                    the system reached a much greater height. In 84 B.C. the war tax imposed by
                    Sulla on the province of Asia was at first advanced by Roman capitalists, and
                    rose within fourteen years to six times its original amount. It is interesting
                    to observe that the old law of debt was not really abolished until the
                    dictatorship of Julius Caesar, who practically adopted the legislation of Solon
                    more than five centuries before; but it was too late then to save the middle
                    class. About this time the rate of interest on first-class security in the city
                    of Rome was only about 4 per cent., whilst in the provinces from 25 to 50 per
                    cent. were rates often exacted. Justinian made the accumulation of arrears (<hi
                        rend="italic">anatocismus)</hi> illegal and fixed the rate at 6 per cent.,
                    except for mercantile loans, in which the rate received was 8 per cent. On the
                    whole it was truly said of usury during the republic and early years of the
                    empire: “Sed vetus urbi fenebre malum et seditionum discordiarumque creberrima
                    causa.” Even when it came to be authorized by Roman law under certain
                    restrictions, it was still looked upon as a pernicious crime. “Cicero mentions
                    that Cato, being asked what he thought of usury, made no other answer to the
                    question than by asking the person who spoke to him what he thought of
                    murder.”</p>
                <p>It was only natural, considering the evils produced by usury in ancient Greece
                    and Rome, that philosophers should have tried to give an <hi rend="italic">a
                        priori</hi> explanation of these abuses. The opinion of Aristotle on the
                    barrenness of money became proverbial, and was quoted with approval throughout
                    the Middle Ages. This condemnation by the moralists was enforced by the fathers
                    of the church on the conversion of the empire to Christianity. They held usury
                    up to detestation, and practically made no distinction between interest on
                    equitable moderate terms and what we now term usurious exactions.<note

                            Cunningham’s <hi rend="italic">Usury.</hi></p></note> The consequence of
                    the condemnation of usury by the church was to throw all the dealing in money in
                    the early Middle Ages into the hands of the Jews. A full account of the mode in
                    which this traffic was conducted in England is given by Madox in chapter vii. of
                    his <hi rend="italic">History of the Exchequer</hi> (London, 1711). The Jews
                    were considered as deriving all their privileges from the hand of the king, and
                    every privilege was dearly bought. There can be no doubt that they were
                    subjected to most arbitrary exactions. At the same time, however, their dealings
                    were nominally under the supervision of the Jews’ exchequer, and a number of
                    regulations were enforced, partly with the view of protecting borrowers and
                    partly that the king might know how much his Jews could afford to pay. It was
                    probably mainly on account of this money-lending that the Jews were so heartily
                    detested and liable to such gross ill-treatment by the people. A curious
                    illustration of this popular animosity is found in the insertion of a clause in
                    the charters granted by Henry III. to Newcastle and Derby, forbidding any Jew to
                    reside in either place. Ultimately in 1290 the Jews were expelled in a body from
                    the kingdom under circumstances of great barbarity, and were not allowed to
                    return until the time of Cromwell. Before the expulsion of the Jews, however, in
                    spite of canonical opposition, Christians had begun to take interest openly; and
                    one of the most interesting examples of the adaptation of the dogmas of the
                    Church of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n32/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0032-0019"/> Rome to the social and economic environment
                    is found in the growth of the recognized exceptions to usury. In this respect
                    the canonical writers derived much assistance from the later Roman law. Without
                    entering into technicalities, it may be said generally that an attempt was made
                    to distinguish between usury, in the modern sense of unjust exaction, and
                    interest on capital. Unfortunately, however, the modifications which were really
                    admitted were not openly and avowedly made by a direct change in the statutes,
                    but for the most part they were effected (as so many early reforms) under the
                    cover of ingenious legal fictions. One of the most curious and instructive
                    results of this treatment has been well brought out by Walter Ross in the
                    introduction to his <hi rend="italic">Lectures on the Law of Scotland</hi>
                    (1793). He shows, in a very remarkable manner and at considerable length, that
                    “to the devices fallen upon to defeat those laws (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>,
                    against usury) the greatest part of the deeds now in use both in England and
                    Scotland owe their original forms” (vol. i. p. 4). One of the consequences of
                    this indirect method of reforming the law was that in some cases the evil was
                    much exaggerated. “The judges,” says Ross, “could not award interest for the
                    money; that would have been contrary to law, a moral evil, and an oppression of
                    the debtor; but, upon the idea of damages and the failure of the debtor in
                    performance, they unmercifully decreed for double the sum borrowed.” He may well
                    remark that imagination itself is incapable of conceiving a higher degree of
                    inconsistency in the affairs of men (compare Blackstone, vol. iii. pp. 434,
                    435).</p>
                <p>In the limits assigned to this article it is impossible to enter further into the
                    history of the question, but an attempt may be made to summarize the principal
                    results so far as they bear upon the old controversy, which has again been
                    revived in some quarters, as to the proper relation of law to usury and
                    interest. (1) The opinion of Bentham that the attempt directly to suppress usury
                    (in the modern sense) will only increase the evil is abundantly verified. Mere
                    prohibition under penalties will practically lead to an additional charge as
                    security against risk. The evils must be partly met by the general principles
                    applicable to all contracts (the fitness of the contracting parties, &amp;c.)
                    and partly by provisions for bankruptcy. Peculiar forms of the evil, such as
                    mortgaging to excessive amounts in countries largely occupied by peasant
                    proprietors, may be met by particular measures, as, for example, by forbidding
                    the accumulation of arrears. (2) The attempt to control interest in the
                    commercial sense is both useless and harmful. It is certain to be met by
                    fictitious devices which at the best will cause needless inconvenience to the
                    contracting parties; restraints will be placed on the natural flow of capital,
                    and industry will suffer. (3) In the progress of society borrowing for
                    commercial purposes has gradually become of overwhelming importance compared
                    with borrowing for purposes of necessity, as in earlier times. By far the
                    greater part of the interest now paid in the civilized world is, in the language
                    of the English economists, only a fair reward for risk of loss and for
                    management of capital, and a necessary stimulus to saving.</p>
