                    works, such as Butler’s <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Saints,</hi> it is to the
                    effect that “these holy martyrs seem . . . to have met a glorious death in
                    defence of their virginity from the army of the Huns. . . . They came originally
                    from Britain, and Ursula was the conductor and encourager of the holy troop.”
                    The scene of the martyrdom is placed near the lower Rhine.</p>
                <p>The date has been assigned by different writers to 238, c. 283, and <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi>. 451. The story, however, is unknown both to Jerome and to
                    Gregory of Tours—and this though the latter gives a somewhat detailed
                    description of the Cologne church dedicated to that Theban legion with which the
                    tradition of the martyred virgins was very early associated. The story of their
                    fate is not entered under 21st October in the martyrology of Bede (<hi
                    rend="italic">ob. c</hi>. 735), of Ado (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 858), of
                    Usuard <hi rend="italic">(ante</hi> 877), Notker Balbulus (896), or Hrabanus
                    Maurus (845); but a 9th-century life of St Cunibert <hi rend="italic">(ob.</hi>
                    663) associates a prominent incident in the life of this saint with the basilica
                    of the sacred virgins at Cologne (Surius, vi. 275, ed. 1575). Not only does
                    Archbishop Wichfrid attest a grant to the church of the sacred virgins outside
                    the walls of Cologne (in 927), but he was a large donor in his own person. Still
                    earlier a Cologne martyrology, written, as Binterim plausibly urges, between 889
                    and 891, has the following entry under 21st October: “xi. virg. Ursule Sencie
                    Gregorie Pinose Marthe Saule Britule Satnine Rabacie Saturie Paladie.” Much
                    shorter entries are found in two of the old martyrologies printed in Migne
                    (cxxxviii. 1207, 1275). A more definite allusion to the legend may be found <hi
                    rend="italic">(c.</hi> 847) in Wandelbert’s metrical martyrology (21st
                    October):</p>
                <p>“Tunc numerosa simul Rheni per littora fulgent Christi virgineis erecta tropaea
                    maniplis Agrippinae urbi, quarum furor impius olim Millia mactavit ductricibus
                    inclyta sanctis.”</p>
                <p>The full legend first makes its appearance in a festival discourse <hi
                    rend="italic">(sermo)</hi> for 21st October, written, as internal evidence seems
                    to show, between 731 and 839. This <hi rend="italic">sermo</hi> does not mention
                    St Ursula, but makes Pinnosa or Vinnosa the leader of these spiritual “amazons,”
                    who, to avoid Maximian’s persecution, left their island home of Britain,
                    following their bridegroom Christ towards that East whence their faith had come
                    a hundred years before. The concurrent traditions of Britain, Batavia (where
                    many chapels still preserved their memory), and Cologne are called in evidence
                    to prove the same origin. The legend was already very old and the festival
                    “nobis omni tempore celeberrima”; but, as all written documents had disappeared
                    since the burning of the early church erected over the sacred bones, the
                    preacher could only appeal to the continuous and careful memory of the society
                    to which he belonged <hi rend="italic">(nostrates).</hi> Even in his time there
                    were sceptics who pointed dubiously to the full-grown bones of “widows” and of
                    men among the so-called virgin relics. But to <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>
                    reasoners who mocked at the notion of gathering so large a band of virgins in
                    one place there was a triumphant answer ready: if Christ, while yet a man on
                    earth, could summon “twelve legions of angels” to his aid, surely we could allow
                    that a meagre band of “less than 12,000 virgins might follow the stainless lamb”
                    in heaven. The author of the <hi rend="italic">sermo</hi> pointedly rejects the
                    two theories that connected the holy virgins with the Theban band and brought
                    them as pilgrims from the East to the West; but he adds that even in his days
                    there still existed an inscription in the church, showing how it had been
                    restored from its foundations by a certain “Clematius, vir consularis, ex
                    partibus Orientis.”</p>
                <p>Two or three centuries later the <hi rend="italic">Passio XI. MM. SS.
                    Virginum,</hi> based apparently on the revelations made to Helentrude, a nun of
                    Heerse near Paderborn, gives a wonderful increase of detail. The narrative in
                    its present form may date somewhere between 900 and 1100, while Helentrude
                    apparently flourished before 1050. According to her account, the son of a
                    powerful pagan king demands in marriage Ursula, the beautiful daughter of
                    Deonotus, a king “in partibus Britanniae.” Ursula is warned by a dream to demand
                    a respite of three years, during which time her companions are to be 11,000
                    virgins collected from both kingdoms. After vigorous exercise in all kinds of
                    manly sports to the admiration of the populace, they are carried off by a sudden
                    breeze in eleven triremes to Thiel in Guelderland on the Waal. Thence they sail
                    up the Rhine by way of Cologne to Basel, at which place they make fast their
                    vessels and proceed on foot to Rome. Returning, they re-enter their ships at
                    Basel, but are slaughtered by the Huns when they reach Cologne. Their relics are
                    then collected and buried “sicut hodie illic est cernere,” in a spot where “to
                    this day” no meaner sepulture is permitted. Then follows the usual allusion to
                    Clematius; the date is expressly fixed at 238; and the whole revelation is
                    seemingly ascribed to St Cordula, one of the eleven thousand, who, after
                    escaping death on the first day by hiding in one of the vessels, on the morrow
                    gave herself up to death of her own accord. Towards the beginning of the 12th
                    century Sigebert of Gembloux <hi rend="italic">(ob.</hi> 1112) gives a brief <hi
                    rend="italic">résumé</hi> of the same story. He is the first to introduce the
                    name of Attila, and dates the occurrence 453.</p>
                <p>Passing over the visions and exhumations of the first half of the 12th century,
                    we come to the singular revelations of St Elizabeth of Schönau. These
                    revelations, delivered in Latin, German, or a mixed jargon of both languages,
                    were turned into simple Latin by Elizabeth’s brother Egbert, from whose words it
                    would seem that in 1156 an old burial ground had lately been laid open near
                    Cologne. The cemetery was naturally associated with the legend of St Ursula;
                    and, this identification once accepted, it is not unlikely that, when more
                    careful investigation revealed male skeletons and tombstones bearing the names
                    of men, other and more definite epitaphs were invented to reconcile the old
                    traditions with the facts of such a damaging discovery. Hence perhaps the
                    barefaced imposture: “Cyriacus, papa Romanus, qui cum gaudio suscepit sanctas
                    virgines et cum eis Coloniam reversus martyrium suscepit.” One or two
                    circumstantial forgeries of this kind would form the basis of a scheme for
                    explaining not a few other problems of the case, such as the plain inscription
                    “Jacobus,” whom St Elizabeth promptly transformed into a supposititious British
                    archbishop of Antioch, brother to the equally imaginary British Pope Cyriacus.
                    For these epitaphs, with others of a humbler kind, were brought before St
                    Elizabeth to be identified in her ecstatic converse with St Verena, her cousin
                    St Ursula, and others. Elizabeth herself at times distrusted her own
                    revelations: there was no Cyriac in the list of the popes; Antherus, who was
                    said to be his successor (235-236), died more than two centuries before Attila,
                    to whom common report assigned the massacre; and it was hardly credible that
                    James of Antioch could cut eleven thousand epitaphs in less than three days.
                    Every doubt, however, was met by the invention of a new and still more
                    improbable detail. According to St Verena, the virgins suffered when Maximus and
                    “Africanus” were <hi rend="italic">principes</hi> at Rome (’387-388).</p>
                <p>In 1183 the mantle of St Elizabeth fell upon Hermann Joseph, a Praemonstratensian
                    canon at Steinfeld. He had to solve a more difficult problem than St
                    Elizabeth’s; for the skeletons of little <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n21/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0021-0014"/> children, ranging in age from two months to seven
                    years, had now been found buried with the sacred virgins. But even such a
                    difficulty Hermann explains away as readily as he does the fact of his having
                    changed St Elizabeth’s name for the royal bridegroom from Aetherius to
                    Holofernes: the prince in question had two names, and the little children were
                    brothers, sisters, or more distant relatives of the eleven thousand. Heimann’s
                    revelations are mainly taken up with an attempt to show the mutual relationship
                    of nearly all the characters he introduces. The names are a most extraordinary
                    mixture. Among British bishops we have Michael William, James, and Columbanus.
                    Sovereign princes,—an Oliver, a Clovis, and a Pippin,—start out in every page,
                    till the writer finds it necessary to apologize for the number of his kings and
                    his own blunders. But, for all this, Hermann exposes his own doubts when he
                    tells that often, as he was preparing to write, he heard a voice bidding him lay
                    down the pen, “for whatever you write will be an unmixed lie.” Hermann makes St
                    Ursula a native of Brittany, and so approximates to the version of the story
                    given by Geoffrey of Monmouth (<hi rend="italic">Historia Britonum),</hi>
                    according to whom Maximian, after fleeing from Rome, and acquiring Britain by
                    marriage, proceeds to conquer Brittany and settle it with men from the island
                    opposite. For these settlers he has to find British wives, and to this end
                    collects 11,000 noble and 60,000 plebeian virgins, who are wrecked on their
                    passage across. Certain of the vessels being driven upon “barbarous islands,”
                    their passengers are slain by Guanius and Melga, “kings of the Huns and Picts,”
                    whom Gratian had called in to his aid against Maximian. In this version St
                    Ursula is a daughter of Dionotus, king of Cornwall. Hermann alludes more than
                    once to the <hi rend="italic">Historia Britonum,</hi> and even to King
                    Arthur.</p>
                <p>The legend of St Ursula is perhaps the most curious instance of the development
                    of an ecclesiastical myth. We know, however, too little about its earlier stages
                    to justify any serious attempt at estimating what amount of historic truth
                    underlies it, and it is doubtful whether many of the efforts in this direction
                    do not make a larger demand on human credulity than the legend itself. Even in
                    the earliest form known to us this legend is probably the complex growth of
                    centuries, and any claim to the discovery of the first germ can hardly approve
                    itself to the historic sense. These remarks apply especially to that venerable
                    rationalization which evolves the whole legend from a misreading of <hi
                    rend="italic">Undecimilla</hi> into <hi rend="italic">undecim millia.</hi> A
                    more modern theory makes St Ursula the Christianized representative of the old
                    Teutonic goddess Freya, who, in Thuringia, under the name of Hörsel, welcomed
                    the souls of dead maidens. Not a few singular coincidences seem to point in the
                    same direction, especially the two virgins, “Martha and Saula,” whom Usuard
                    states to have suffered “cum aliis pluribus” on 20th October, whence they were
                    probably transferred to 21st October. It is curious to note that Jerome and many
                    of the earliest martyrologies extant have on 21st October the entry “Dasius
                    Zoticus, Gaius <hi rend="italic">cum duodecim militibus.”</hi> Even in copies of
                    Jerome this is transformed into <hi rend="italic">millibus</hi>; and it is
                    perhaps not impossible that to this misreading we may indirectly owe the
                    “thousands” in the Ursula legend. So far as is known to the present writer, the
                    two entries are mutually exclusive in all the early martyrologies mentioned in
                    this article, and in those printed in Migne, cxxxvii. The earlier “Dasius” entry
                    seems to disappear steadily, though slowly, as the Ursula legend works its way
                    into current martyrologies.</p>
