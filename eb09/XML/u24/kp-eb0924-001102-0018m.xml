                    the Lake of Lucerne, the southern arm of which is also within the canton. Its
                    total area is 415∙4 square miles; of these 184∙4 are classed as productive, 40∙3
                    are covered with forests, 44∙3 consist of glaciers, and 7∙7 of the lake. The
                    highest point in the canton is the Galenstock (11,802 feet). The population in
                    1880 amounted to 23,694 (men having a majority of 3000 over women), showing an
                    increase of 7649, or 39∙4 per cent., since 1870, owing to the St Gotthard
                    Railway. German is the native tongue of 18,024 persons, Italian of 5313. The
                    canton has always been very strongly Roman Catholic (23,149 in 1880). It was
                    included up to 1814 in the diocese of Constance (except the valley of Urseren,
                    which was in that of Chur), and since then has formed part of no diocese, but is
                    provisionally administered by the bishop of Chur. In Uri the limits of the
                    ecclesiastical parishes are the same as those of the civil communes. The capital
                    is Altdorf (2901 inhabitants). Göschenen (2990) and Wasen (2744) have increased
                    since the opening of the St Gotthard Railway (1880), which runs through the
                    greater part of the canton. The inhabitants are occupied in agricultural and
                    pastoral pursuits, and are very saving and industrious. The main valley is
                    fertile, but the side glens are very wild. Education is still very backward and
                    largely in the hands of the priests; but an improvement was made in 1885. The
                    main characteristics of the people are extreme conservatism and a passionate
                    attachment to their religion.</p>
                <p>Uri is first mentioned in history in 732 as the place to which Eto, abbot of
                    Reichenau, was banished. For the early history of the canton, see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Switzerland,</hi> vol. xxii. pp. 783-787. In 1410 a perpetual
                    alliance was made with the upper valley of Urseren or Val Orsera, the latter
                    being allowed its own headman and assembly, and courts under those of Uri, with
                    which it was not fully incorporated till 1803. In 1440 Uri alone won the Val
                    Leventina for good, the title being confirmed by a treaty of 1466 with the duke
                    of Milan and by the bloody fight of Giornico (1478). At the Reformation, Uri
                    clung to the old faith (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Switzerland,</hi> vol. xxii.
                    pp. 790-791). In 1798 on the formation of the Helvetic republic Uri lost all its
                    Italian possessions. In September 1799 Suwaroff and the Russian army, having
                    crossed the St Gotthard to Altdorf, were forced by the French to pass over into
                    Schwyz, instead of sailing down the lake to Lucerne. In 1803 Uri became an
                    independent canton again, with Urseren, but without the Val Leventina. It tried
                    hard to bring back the old state of things in 1814-15, and opposed all attempts
                    at reform, joining the League of Sarnen in 1832 to maintain the pact of 1815,
                    opposing the proposed revision of the pact, and being one of the members of the
                    Sonderbund in 1843. Despite defeat in the war of 1847, Uri voted against the
                    federal constitution of 1848, and by a crushing majority against that of 1874.
                    The existing constitution of Uri is that framed in 1850 and amended in 1851,
                    1872, 1879, and 1881. The “landesgemeinde,” composed of all male citizens of
                    twenty years of age, meets annually on 1st May, and is the supreme legislative
                    assembly. There is a subordinate legislative assembly (landrath), consisting of
                    the landammann or headman and his deputy, 4 of the members of the executive, and
                    70 elected members (1 for every 300 of the population), which drafts bills and
                    passes laws provisionally in case of necessity. The executive consists of 9
                    members—the landammann, his deputy, and the treasurer, with 6 elected members.
                    By an immemorial custom 7 men of 7 different families, bearing different names,
                    can cause an extraordinary meeting of the assembly of their “gemeinde” to be
                    summoned, or call on the landrath to do the same in the case of the
                    “landesgemeinde.”</p>
