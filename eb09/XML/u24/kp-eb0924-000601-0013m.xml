                    belongs to the “Kirghiz provinces,” or governor-generalship of the steppes.
                    Apart from a narrow strip of land in the north, where the slopes of the Obschiy
                    Syrt, covered with a fertile black earth and stretches of forest, descend
                    towards the Ural river, and the gentle slopes of the Mugojar Hills in the
                    north-east, Uralsk consists of dry steppes and deserts, which fall with an
                    imperceptible gradient towards the Caspian. Most of the province is below
                    sea-level, the zero-altitude line running from Kamyshin on the Volga to the
                    south of the town of Uralsk. The steppe-land consists for the most part of sandy
                    clay, sands containing shells of molluscs now living in the Caspian, salt clay,
                    and shifting sands. It is also dotted with numerous salt lakes, partly remains
                    of old lagoons of the Caspian. To the south-east Uralsk extends over the
                    northern part of the Ust-Urt plateau. Red sandstones (Permian ?) and chalk are
                    met with only in the north, the remainder of the province being covered with
                    Post-Pliocene Caspian deposits, which conceal the underlying rocks.</p>
                <p>Uralsk is watered by the Ural, which rises in Orenburg at a height of 2100 feet
                    above sea-level, but soon descends to the lowlands, where it flows south, west,
                    and south, entering the Caspian after a course of 800 miles. Its chief
                    tributaries, the Sakmara, the Or, and the Ilek, are in the north; along its
                    lower course the Great and Little Uzeñs and many small streams on the left bank
                    fail to join the main river, being lost in lakes before reaching it. The Emba,
                    which has its course in the north of the Ust-Urt plateau, reaches the Caspian by
                    a series of shallow lagoons, which were navigable in the 18th century.</p>
                <p>The climate is influenced by the Central Asian steppes. A cold and dry winter is
                    succeeded by a hot and still drier summer, during which the grass, and sometimes
                    all the crops, are destroyed by the burning heat. Uralsk, although lying wholly
                    to the south of 51° 30' N. lat., has the same average yearly temperature as
                    Moscow and south Finland (39° ∙5); its January is colder than that of north
                    Finland (3°), while July averages 73°</p>
                <p>The character of the vegetation can be easily inferred from the above. The
                    prairies and forest tracts of the north soon disappear, their place being taken
                    by the vegetation of the south Russian steppes. This has, however, to struggle
                    with the much poorer vegetation, Central Asian in character, of the sandy
                    regions to the west of the lower Ural, and the saliniferous vegetation of the
                    clayey deserts of the Emba. The Ust-Urt has herbaceous steppes, where the want
                    of irrigation and rain destroys all vegetation by the end of summer. Wide belts
                    of rushes grow along the banks of the rivers and on the shores of the
                    Caspian.</p>
                <p>The population of the province, 525,330 in 1883, is made up of three different
                    elements,—Ural Cossacks, who constitute about one-fifth, and numbered nearly
                    90,000 in 1879, some 15,000 Russian peasants, and Kirghiz. Of these 405,000 are
                    still nomads. The Kirghiz are almost entirely dependent on cattle-breeding, and
                    before the outbreak of the murrain of 1879 were reckoned to have 429,500 horses,
                    221,800 head of cattle, 1,411,000 sheep, and 175,000 camels. From that epidemic
                    the Russians lost two-thirds of their horses and one-third of their other stock,
                    whilst the Khirgiz lost more than three-fourths of both horses and cattle. The
                    Ural Cossacks, descendants of those independent communities of free settlers and
                    Raskolniks who are so often mentioned in Russian history under the name of Yaik
                    Cossacks, owing to their unwillingness to submit to the rule of the czars, are
                    fine representatives of the Great Russian race, though not without some
                    admixture of Tartar and Kalmuck blood. Their chief occupations are
                    cattle-breeding and fishing, the latter a most important source of income. The
                    rich fisheries in the Ural and the Caspian are the property of the community as
                    a whole (the <hi rend="italic">voisko),</hi> and are subdivided according to the
                    needs and working powers of the separate villages.<note anchored="true"

                    hired labourers. There are also fisheries in the Emba. Walrus-hunting is also
                    engaged in. Agriculture was first introduced between 1830 and 1840; but now more
                    than 300,000 cwts. of wheat are exported annually. Nearly 130,000 cwts. of salt
                    are obtained from the lakes every year. The manufactures of the province, which
                    possesses a few steam flour-mills and a number of tanneries and tallow-melting
                    works, are unimportant. Trade by barter is extensively carried on with the
                    Kirghiz. Fish, corn, cattle, hides, tallow, and the like are exported, while
                    manufactured wares are imported to the value of about £1,500,000 per annum.</p>
                <p>Uralsk is divided into four districts, the chief towns of which are— Uralsk
                    (20,680 inhabitants in 1879), Kalmykoff (1510), Gurieff at the mouth of the Ural
                    (4380), and Temirsk, a small port, now the administrative centre of the district
                    of Embinsk. Several villages have populations of from 2000 to 5000 each.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> In the first half of the 16th century Uralsk was
                    occupied by the Nogai horde, a remnant of the Golden Horde, which retired there
                    after the fall of Astrakhan and Kazan; the khans resided at Saraitchik on the
                    Ural. At the same time the lower parts of the Ural were occupied by Russian
                    runaway serfs and tree Cossacks who did not recognize the authority of Moscow.
                    They took Saraitchik in 1560 and formed an independent community, like the <hi
                    rend="italic">sitch</hi> of the Zaporog Cossacks. The Moscow princes,
                    recognizing the importance of these military settlements, <pb break="no"

                    various privileges. But, when they attempted to bring them under the centralized
                    rale of the empire and prosecuted them for nonconformity, the Cossacks revolted,
                    first under Razin, and afterwards under Pugatcheff. After the latter rising, the
                    name of Ural was officially given to the Yaik river and the Yaik Cossacks. The
                    disbanding of their artillery, the planting of Russian garrisons within the
                    domains of the <hi rend="italic">voisko,</hi> and the interference of Russian
                    officials in their interior organization during the 19th century occasioned a
                    series of smaller outbreaks, the latest of which, in 1874, against the new law
                    of military service, resulted in the deportation of 2500 Cossacks, with their
                    families, to Turkestan.</p>
