                    stands in a commanding position on a spur of the Tuscan Apennines, near the
                    valley of the Metaurus, about 20 miles from the Adriatic. It grew up, chiefly in
                    the 14th century, around the stronghold of the Montefeltro family. Federigo da
                    Montefeltro, lord of Urbino from 1444 to 1482, was one of the most successful
                    condottieri chiefs of his time, and not only a man of great military and
                    political ability, but also an enthusiastic patron of art and literature, on
                    which he lavished immense sums of money. Federigo much strengthened his
                    position, first by his own marriage with Battista, one of the powerful Sforza
                    family, and secondly by marrying his daughter to Giovanni della Rovere, the
                    favourite nephew of Pope Sixtus IV., who in return conferred upon Federigo the
                    title of duke. Federigo’s only son Guidubaldo, who succeeded his father, married
                    in 1489 a very gifted lady, Elizabeth Gonzaga, of the ruling family in Mantua.
                    In 1497 he was expelled from Urbino by Caesar Borgia, son of Alexander VI., but
                    regained his dukedom in 1503, after Caesar’s death. Guidubaldo was the last duke
                    of the Montefeltro line; at his death in 1508 he bequeathed his coronet to
                    Francesco Maria della Rovere, nephew of Julius II., and for about a century
                    Urbino was ruled by its second dynasty of the Della Rovere family. In 1626 the
                    last descendant of Francesco, called Francesco Maria II., when old and childless
                    abdicated in favour of Pope Urban VIII., after which time Urbino, with its
                    subject towns of Pesaro, Fano, Fossombrone, Gubbio, Castel Durante, Cagli, and
                    about 300 small villages, became part of the Papal States until the suppression
                    of the temporal power in 1870.</p>
                <p>During the reigns of Federigo and Guidubaldo, Urbino was one of the foremost
                    centres of activity in art and literature in Italy, and was known as the Italian
                    Athens. In 1468 Federigo gave orders to a Dalmatian architect, Luciano da
                    Laurana, to build him a magnificent fortified palace; it was finished and
                    enlarged by the Florentine Baccio Pintelli during Guidubaldo’s reign. Rich
                    friezes, sculptured architraves of doors and windows, and other decorations in
                    marble, painting, and wood-work were executed by the sculptor Ambrogino di
                    Milano, and by Francesco<pb break="no"

                    Vasari wrongly states to have been the principal architect of the palace.
                    Federigo adorned his palace with fine series of paintings by Piero della
                    Francesca, Melozzo da Forli, Paolo Uccello, and Raphael’s father, Giovanni
                    Santi; and, in addition to the crowd of able Italian artists whom he invited to
                    his court, Flemish painters, such as Justus of Ghent, visited and worked in this
                    hospitable city.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    works of art from the palace of Urbino were scattered in the 17th century. Two
                    paintings of the Sciences, part of a series executed for Federigo, are now in
                    the National Gallery, London, where they are doubtfully attributed to Melozzo da
                    Forli. Another by Justus of Ghent is in the royal collection at
                    Windsor.</p></note> The rich wood-work in the palace, decorated with <hi

                    rooms were filled with magnificent furniture, costly gold and silver plate, and
                    works of art of all kinds. Literature was no less encouraged under the patronage
                    of Federigo: it was at his court that Piero della Francesca wrote his celebrated
                    work on the science of perspective, Francesco di Giorgio his <hi rend="italic"

                    probably from jealousy, he has omitted to mention either Justus of Ghent or
                    Francesco di Giorgio, the latter a man of extraordinarily versatile talents, who
                    was much employed by the duke to design fortifications and military engines, to
                    paint wall decorations, and to carve sculptured ornaments.<note anchored="true"

                    personal character and genius by the duke is shown in a letter which Federigo

                    decorations, the ducal palace still exists in a good state of preservation: it
                    is a very picturesque, massive building of irregular plan, suited to its uneven
                    site, and stands up very nobly on the hill, dominating all the rest of the

                <p>Throughout the whole of the 16th century the state of Urbino was one of the chief

                    with Urbino are those of the Ferrarese painter and friend of Raphael, Timoteo
                    della Vite, who spent most of his life there, and Bramante, the greatest

                    1822.</p></note> The Milanese sculptor, Ambrogino, who worked so much for
                    Federigo, married a lady of Urbino, and was the progenitor of the Baroccio
                    family, among whom were many able mathematicians and painters. Federigo
                    Baroccio, Ambrogino’s grandson, was a very popular painter, some of whose works
                    still exist in the cathedral and elsewhere in Urbino. This city was also the
                    birthplace of Pope Clement XI.. of several cardinals of the Albano family, and
                    of Bernardino Baldi, Fabretti, and other able scholars.</p>
                <p>The modern city of Urbino, with a population of 5087 in 1880, is the seat of an
                    archbishop, and still possesses a small university, but is not a thriving place.
                    The cathedral, a building of no special interest, stands in the great piazza
                    opposite the ducal palace, which is now used for municipal purposes and contains
                    the city archives. In the sacristy there is a very beautiful miniature-like
                    painting of the Scourging of Christ, by Piero della Francesca. One of the finest
                    paintings by this artist is a large altar-piece of the Madonna enthroned between
                    angels and saints, now in the Brera at Milan; it contains a very noble kneeling
                    figure of Federigo in full armour, showing his strange profile disfigured by a
                    bullet, which carried away part of the bridge of his nose. It was originally a
                    votive retable given by the duke to the monastic church of San Bernardino, about
                    a mile outside the walls of Urbino, where Federigo and Guidubaldo were buried.
                    The modest house where Raphael was born and spent his boyhood is still
                    preserved. It is now the property of a society of artists, and so is safe from
                    destruction. Its rooms form a sort of museum of engravings and other records of
                    Raphael’s works, together with a picture of the Madonna by his father, Giovanni
                    Santi, formerly thought to be by Raphael himself. The Institute of the Fine Arts
                    in the Marches contains a small but interesting collection of pictures,
                    including works by Giovanni Santi, Justus of Ghent, Timoteo della Vite, and
                    other 15th-century artists. The picture of the Holy Communion by Justus is
                    specially valuable from its containing fine portraits of the Montefeltro family
                    and members of the ducal court. On the walls of the chapel of the guild or
                    confraternity of San Giovanni are some valuable early frescos, painted by
                    Lorenzo da San Severino and his brother, of the Florentine school, about 1416.
                    An interesting collection of Roman inscriptions, arranged by the palaeographer
                    Fabretti, is still preserved on the upper walls of a court in the ducal palace.
                    In the church of S. Spirito are two paintings by Luca Signorelli, the
                    Crucifixion and the Day of Pentecost, originally intended for a processional
                    banner. The theatre, decorated by Girolamo Genga, is one of the earliest in
                    Italy; in it was performed the first Italian comedy, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Calandria</hi> of Cardinal Bibbiena, the friend of Leo X. and Raphael. The
                    magnificent library formed by the Montefeltro and Della Rovere dukes has been
                    removed to Rome.</p>
