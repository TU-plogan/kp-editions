                <p><label type="entry">URAL MOUNTAINS</label>. The girdle of mountains which extends
                    from the Arctic Ocean southwards nearly to the Caspian Sea, and is now regarded
                    as separating Europe from Asia, was anciently the subject of various myths. Even
                    the Slavonians, who in the 11th century frequently visited the region of the
                    Urals for trade with the Ugrians (which people at that time lived there),
                    described them as mountains reaching to the sky, intersected by terrible
                    precipices, and as being inhabited by a population of cave-dwellers. Although
                    crossed by a continuous stream of Russian colonizers from the 16th century
                    onwards, the Ural Mountains still retained something of their mythical character
                    in Western literature, and in the 18th century they received from geographers
                    the high-sounding designation of <hi rend="italic">montes dicti angulus
                    terrae.</hi> The Russians describe them either as Kamen (stone) merely or by the
                    appropriate name of Poyas (girdle), while the name of Urals <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Urały)</hi> —derived either from the Ostiak <hi rend="italic">urr</hi> (chain
                    of mountains) or from the Turkish <hi rend="italic">aral-tau</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">ural-tau—</hi> has with them become a generic name for extensive
                    mountain chains. (See plate II. vol. xxi. and plate I. vol. xxii.).</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding numerous scientific expeditions by which the exploration of
                    various parts of the range began to be undertaken from the earlier portion of
                    the 19th century, and notwithstanding partial accurate surveys and levellings
                    and numerous geological researches made within the last thirty years, the real
                    structure of the Urals, both orographical and geological, remains still
                    imperfectly known. Even on maps otherwise good they are still very often
                    represented as an unbroken chain, at least 1200 miles in length, running north
                    and south from the Arctic Ocean to the sources of the river Ural. But every
                    fresh addition to our knowledge has made it increasingly apparent that their
                    real structure is much more complicated; and in view of recent explorations it
                    becomes plain that the Urals consist of a series of several separate upheavals,
                    some having a north-western direction and some a north-eastern, which reach
                    their maximum heights along a zone which lies nearly north and south. They have
                    thus some resemblance to the mountain-chains of Central Asia and Siberia,—which
                    also have north-eastern and north-western directions, but are grouped in zones
                    which, roughly speaking, lie west and east,—although in both cases chains
                    running either along meridians or along parallels are, wherever they exist at
                    all, only rare exceptions.</p>
                <p>The composite nature of the Urals is best seen at the northern and southern
                    extremities of the system, where the upheavals assume the character of distinct
                    chains of mountains. The Pai-hoi Mountains are a ridge which, beginning at the
                    head of Kara Bay, runs north-west, and is continued in the Island of Vaigatch
                    and the southern island of Nova Zembla; and the Northern Urals, which join the
                    Pai-hoi chain at the head of Kara Bay, run northeast and south-west as far south
                    as 64° N. lat. In their middle portion the architecture of the Urals is
                    complicated by the plateaus of middle Russia. The southern parts do not consist,
                    as Humboldt supposed, of ramifications from main meridional chain, but of a
                    series of parallel ranges running distinctly from north-east to south-west, as
                    is plainly seen in the excellent maps recently published by the Russian
                    Geological Committee.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>I. The Pai-hoi or coast ridge (Samoyedic “stony ridge ”) is quite independent of
                    the Urals proper, from which it is separated by a marshy <hi rend="italic"
                    >tundra,</hi> some 30 miles wide. It has a distinct north-northwesterly and
                    north-westerly trend along the shores of the Kara Sea; and, although it is cut
                    by the Ugrian Strait, there is no doubt <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n11/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0011-0004"/> that it is continued in Vaigatch Island and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Nova Zembla</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> Its dome-shaped
                    summits, which attain a height of about 1000 feet above the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tundra</hi> (Vozaipai, 1312 feet), are completely bare of trees, and its stony
                    crags are separated by broad marshy tundras. It is uninhabited</p>
                <p>II. The Obdorsk or Northern Urals, which begin within a few miles of the head of
                    Kara Bay (Konstantinoff Kamen, in 68° 30' N. lat., 1490 feet), and extend in a
                    south-western direction as far as the 64th parallel, form a distinct ridge of
                    mountains, stony and craggy, sloping steeply towards the south-east and gently
                    towards the marshes of Russia. Its highest elevations are on the 66th and 67th
                    parallels (3600 to 4370 feet). Sometimes the main chain has on the west two or
                    three secondary ones, formed by the upheaval of sedimentary rocks, and it is
                    towards the southern extremity of one of those that the highest peaks of the
                    Urals occur (Sablya, 5407 feet, in 64° 47' N. lat., and Teplos-iz, 5540 feet, in
                    63° 55'). Dense coniferous forests, consisting chiefly of fir, pine, and larch,
                    cover the slopes of the mountains and the narrow valleys; but, as the less
                    hospitable latitudes are approached, every species except the larch gradually
                    disappears and the upper limit of vegetation (2400 feet in the south) rapidly
                    descends till it reaches the very base of the mountains towards the Arctic
                    Circle, and forest vegetation disappears altogether about 65° lat. (67° in the
                    plains of Russia and Siberia). These inhospitable hill-tracts, rising from the
                    wide tundras which stretch for hundreds of miles to the west and east of the
                    Urals, are quite uninhabited, save for a few hunters, who visit them in the
                    summer in pursuit of the reindeer which here seek refuge from the mosquitoes of
                    the lowlands.</p>
                <p>III. Although usually reckoned to the Northern Urals, the section between the
                    64th and 61st parallels has again a wholly distinct character. It is represented
                    on the maps as a girdle of chains, 20 to 35 miles in width, running north and
                    south, and separated by long valleys. From the broad plateaus, or <hi
                    rend="italic">parmas,</hi> which stretch towards the north-west, it might be
                    conjectured, however, that the structure is more complicated; and the recent
                    researches by MM. Fedoroff and Ivanoff have, in fact, shown that what is
                    described as the main chain (or, more correctly, the main water-parting) of the
                    Urals is a succession of plateaus stretching in a north-westerly direction,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See map in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Izvestia</hi> or the Kuss. Geogr. Soc., vol. xxii.,
                    1886.</p></note> with broad, flat, marshy valleys, and rising here and there
                    into isolated dome-shaped flat summits, mostly under 3000 feet (Yang-tuny, 62°
                    43' N. lat., 4166 feet). The whole region, except the mountain summits, is
                    densely clothed with coniferous forests, birch appearing only occasionally in
                    the south, and even the Scotch pine only in a few valleys. This part of the
                    range is also uninhabited.</p>
                <p>IV. The Middle Urals, between 61° and 55° 30' N. lat., and about 80 miles in
                    breadth, are the best known, as they contain the richest iron, copper, and gold
                    mines (Bogosłovsk, Gorobła-godatsk, and Ekaterinburg Urals). The Deneshkin Kameñ
                    in the north (4238 feet) and the Tara-tash in the south (2800 feet) may be
                    considered as marking the limits of this section. Here the orographical
                    structure is still more complicated, and the necessity of distinguishing the
                    separate upheavals becomes still more apparent. In the north (61st to 60th
                    parallel) there is a succession of chains with a distinct north-eastern trend;
                    and it still remains an open question whether, for two degrees farther south,
                    the whole of the gosłovsk Urals (5135 feet in the Konjakoff Kameñ, and from 3000
                    to 4000 feet in several other summits) do not consist of chains having the same
                    direction. Farther south a broad swelling, which crosses northern Russia from
                    the Kanin peninsula in the north to the sources of the river Petchora in the
                    south-east, joins the Urals, and is continued into Asia by the plateau of the
                    Tura and Isset rivers. To the south of the Katchkanar (2891 feet), <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> from the 58th to the 56th parallel, therefore, the
                    Urals assume the appearance of broad swellings from 1000 to 2000 feet in height,
                    deeply ravined and with gentle slopes. These low and ravine-broken plateaus, the
                    higher parts of which can be reached from Russia on a very gentle gradient, have
                    been utilized for centuries as the chief highway to Siberia. They have none of
                    the aspects of an alpine tract; and the traveller to Siberia cannot but
                    experience a feeling of disappointment as his horses, still running at full
                    speed, reach the marble column, inscribed “Europe” on one side and “Asia” on the
                    other, which marks the water-parting (1180 feet) between the Russian and
                    Siberian rivers. The eastern slope is steeper, but even there Ekaterinburg is
                    only 350 feet below the water-parting. The valleys have a decidedly
                    south-eastern direction, and such is also the course of the railway from Perm to
                    Tyumeñ, as soon as it reaches the Siberian slope. The plateau-like swellings of
                    this division terminate farther south in a depression, about 70 miles broad,
                    stretching from north-west to south-east, where the waterparting has a height of
                    only a few hundred feet. The Middle Urals are still densely forested,
                    notwithstanding the immense quantities of timber and fuel which are constantly
                    being taken from them. The vegetation is much more varied than in the north
                    (birch, oak, lime, and maple), a rich undergrowth of bushes growing together
                    with the conifers, and the banks of the rivers being adorned with the wild
                    cherry <hi rend="italic">(Prunus padus),</hi> poplar, willow, and alder. The
                    valleys and lower slopes are covered with a thick sheet of rich humus and have
                    become the site of large and wealthy villages. The mines also have given rise to
                    a considerable population. The southern parts of the Middle Urals may be
                    estimated to have a total agricultural and mining population of nearly
                    1,500,000.</p>
                <p>V. The Southern Urals (from 55° 30' to 51° N. lat.) are now well known both
                    orographically and geologically;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Carte Géologique,</hi> sheet 139, <hi
                    rend="italic">ut sup.</hi></p></note> and it appears that, instead of consisting
                    of three chains of mountains radiating from Mount Yurma, as was formerly
                    supposed, they consist of a series of three parallel chains running north-east
                    and south-west, and therefore constitute a quite independent part of the Ural
                    complexus. The Ural-tau proper is a low sinuous chain extending due south-west
                    and hardly exceeding 2200 to 2800 feet in height. It slopes gently towards the
                    north-west and abruptly towards the south-east, where several short and low
                    chains (Ilmen, Irenty, &amp;c. ) rise in the basins of the Mias and the Ui. In
                    the west a chain separated from the Ural-tau by a longitudinal valley
                    accompanies it throughout its entire length. This, although pierced by the
                    rivers which rise in the longitudinal valley just mentioned (Ai, upper Byełaya),
                    nevertheless rises to a much greater height than the Ural-tau. Its wild stony
                    ridge has an altitude of 3375 feet in the Yurma, and 3950 feet in the Taganai;
                    while the Urenga and Iremel Mountains exceed 3500 feet, and the peaks bearing
                    these names reach 4013 and 5040 feet respectively. Farther west, another series
                    of chains, parallel to the above, is described under various names (Zurat-kul,
                    Zigałga, Nary); they reach nearly the same altitudes (Zigałga and Yaman-tau,
                    4880 and 5400 feet respectively). A number of other chains, also parallel and
                    ranging from 2000 to 3000 feet, accompany them in the west. The whole system has
                    thus the character of a swelling nearly 65 miles wide, intersected by a series
                    of parallel chains, the results of as many foldings of the sedimentary rocks,
                    which have undergone extensive denudation. Some of the chains are exceedingly
                    craggy, and most of them are covered with masses of angular <hi rend="italic"
                    >débris,</hi> sometimes concealed under thick sheets of marshy mosses. The
                    gorges by which the rivers pierce the Devonian limestones on their way towards
                    the lower terraces are most picturesque in the west, where the Urals assume an
                    alpine character. The forests are no longer continuous; the gentle slopes of the
                    hilly tracts are dotted with woods, mostly of deciduous trees, while the hollows
                    contain rich pasture grounds. The thick layers of sedimentary rock which are
                    lifted <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi> on the western slope cover a wide area
                    farther to the west in the shape of a plateau which already assumes the features
                    of a steppe (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Ufa).</hi> The whole region, formerly the
                    abode of Bashkirs, is rapidly being colonized by Russians.</p>
                <p>Farther south, between the 53d and 51st parallels, the Ural-tau, still composed
                    of crystalline rocks (diorite, serpentine, granite), continues in the same
                    direction, but is covered as we advance by horizontal Cretaceous deposits and,
                    except when deeply trenched by rivers, assumes the appearance of a plateau which
                    hardly reaches 1500 feet. It is continued farther south-west (towards the Volga)
                    under the name of Obschiy Syrt. A narrow longitudinal valley watered by the
                    Sakmara (right-hand tributary of the Ural) separates the Ural-tau and the
                    Guberlinsk Mountains (as the preceding tract is called) from the Irendyk chain,
                    about 20 miles in width, which reaches 2300 feet in its higher parts. It is cut
                    by the Ural river at Orsk and extends farther south-west towards the sources of
                    the Ilek; while in the east a wide granitic plateau, with only a few remainders
                    of its former Devonian and Carboniferous covering, some 130 miles broad and
                    nearly 1000 feet high, lies about the sources of the Siberian rivers, and is
                    known by such local names as Kara-Edyr-tau, Djabik-Karagai, and the like.</p>
                <p>VI. As a rule the Urals are not shown on maps to the south of the great bend of
                    the Ural river, where quite independent ranges of hills, or flat swellings, are
                    represented (Jaman-tau, Mugojar Hills). It appears, however, from recent
                    exploration<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>P. Nazaroff,
                    in <hi rend="italic">Bull. de la Soc. des Naturalistes de Moscou,</hi> 1886, No.
                    4.</p></note> that the Mugojar Hills may safely be regarded as a farther
                    continuation of the upheavals which constitute the Urals. The Cretaceous plateau
                    north of the Ural river is continued to the south of it; it again assumes a

                    Hills, which consist of diorites and crystalline slates and reach their maximum
                    in the Airuk Mountain (about 1000 feet). A range of heights connects the Mugojar
                    Hills with the Ust-Urt plateau (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Transcaspian
                    Region).</hi> It is hardly necessary to say that these plateaus and flat hills
                    to the south of the river Ural have all the characters of the Ciscaspian and
                    Transcaspian steppes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> Whatever the variety of the orographically
                    independent systems of mountains and plateaus embodied under the general name of

                    Denudation has been active on so grand a scale that entire strata of sedimentary
                    deposits have been removed from their original positions and scattered in the

                    if this agency be taken into account, the Urals seem to come under the category
                    of what the Germans call asymmetric <hi rend="italic">Faltengebirge,</hi> and
                    thus exhibit a great resemblance to the western Alps. A broad strip of granites,
                    syenites, diorites, and porphyries, with their subordinate gneisses and
                    crystalline slates, belonging to the Laurentian and Huronian systems,
                    constitutes the main axis of upheaval, and this axis is invariably situated in
                    the eastern part of the mountain region. The asymmetry thus resulting is the
                    more pronounced as the Azoic rocks are mostly covered directly by Tertiary and
                    Quaternary deposits on their Siberian slope; while towards the west they are
                    covered with vast layers of Silurian, Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian, and
                    Triassic rocks, which are manifoldly folded so as to constitute a series of
                    chains parallel to the main axis and mostly lifted to much greater heights than
                    the older Azoic rocks.</p>
                <p>The crystalline rocks which must have constituted the primary ridges mostly
                    appear in the shape of plateaus, water-and glacier-worn, with undulating
                    surfaces; and the hills which rise above the plateaus are mostly dome-shaped and
                    are seldom marked by the craggy characters which are met with in the limestone
                    and sandstone mountains of the subsequent formations. Masses of angular <hi
                    rend="italic">débris</hi> and great blocks cover both the plateaus and the
                    mountains; and only a very few traces of the sediments which may have partially
                    covered the Azoic crystalline rocks are sporadically met with. But, as a rule,
                    they have remained a continent since the Huronian epoch. As for the Primary and
                    Secondary deposits of the western slope, they are represented by Silurian,
                    Devonian, Carboniferous, Permio-Carboniferous, Permian, and Triassic deposits,
                    attaining great thicknesses and following one another in succession so as to
                    appear on the surface as strips lying parallel to the Urals. The strip occupied
                    by the Silurian quartzites, limestones, and slates is narrow, even in its
                    northern portion. Farther south it disappears, and the deposits which formerly
                    were assigned to the Silurian period are now considered to be mostly Devonian.
                    These latter, mostly littoral in character and much resembling those of the
                    Eifel and Belgium, occupy wide areas to the west of the main axis of the Urals.
                    Their lower parts are much metamorphosed. The Carboniferous
                    deposits,—coal-bearing in the Middle and Southern Urals, —although appearing at
                    the surface only as a narrow strip in the west Urals, occupy an extensive area,
                    but are concealed by the largely developed Permian deposits, and that series of
                    sediments which must be considered as intermediate between the Carboniferous and
                    the Permian. These latter, described as “Permo-Carbon” by Russian and German
                    geologists, are largely developed in the west Urals. Their fossils belong to a
                    fauna intermediate between the Carboniferous and the Permian, which was formerly
                    known as that of Artinsk; but since two more series of the same intermediate
                    character have been described the whole has been brought under the general name
                    of Permio-Carboniferous deposits. The Permian deposits cover a wide zone all
                    along the western slope of the Urals from north to south, and are most important
                    on account of their copper ores, salt-beds, and salt-springs. They are also
                    covered with variegated marls which are almost quite destitute of fossil
                    organisms, so that their age is not yet quite settled. Some Russian geologists
                    continue to consider them as Permian, while the majority of recent explorers
                    assign them to the Triassic age.</p>
                <p>The glaciation of the Urals is still a debated question. Even those geologists
                    who now acknowledge that the Scandinavian icesheet covered middle Russia
                    hesitate to admit the existence of an ice-cap covering the Middle and Southern
                    Urals,—the want of polished and striated rocks being the chief argument for the
                    negative. But, if the disintegrated state of the rocks which are best fitted to
                    maintain glacial polishing and striation, their thick coverings of <hi
                    rend="italic">débris,</hi> and the action of lichens and mosses in obliterating
                    the traces of glaciation be taken into account, as also the prevalence of
                    erratic blocks, and the character of the deposits filling up the valleys, it
                    must be regarded as most probable that the Urals, too, must soon be included
                    within the limits of former glaciation (as has been already done by a few
                    explorers, such as Polyakoff). The Lacustrine (Post-Glacial) deposits are widely
                    spread all over the slopes of the Urals. Immense marshes, which have recently
                    emerged, in the north, and numberless lakes in the south, which are but small in
                    comparison with their size at a recent period, as also Lacustrine deposits in
                    the valleys, all go to show that during the Lacustrine period the Urals were as
                    much dotted with lakes as Finland is at the present time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climatic, Geo-Botanical, and Geo-Zoological Importance.—</hi>
                    The importance of the Urals as a climatic and geo-botanical boundary can no
                    longer be regarded as very great. Most European species of plants freely cross
                    the Urals into Siberia, and several Siberian species travel across them into
                    northern Russia. But, being a zone of hilly tracts extending from north to south
                    in a meridional direction, the Ural Mountains necessarily exercise a powerful
                    influence in driving a colder northern climate, as well as a northern flora and
                    fauna, farther towards the south along their axis. The harshness of the climate
                    at the meteorological stations of Bogo-stovsk, Zlatoust, and Ekaterinburg is not
                    owing merely to their elevation a few hundred feet above sea-level. Even if
                    reduced to sea-level, the average temperatures of the Ural meteorological
                    stations are such as to produce a local deflexion of the isotherms towards the
                    south. The same is true with regard to the limits of distribution of vegetable
                    and animal species. It has been already stated that the northern limits of
                    tree-vegetation descend towards more southern latitudes on the Northern Urals
                    and in the vicinity of the chain. The same is true with regard to many other
                    species of plants. In like manner several Arctic species of animals come much
                    farther south than they might otherwise have done: the reindeer, for instance,
                    is met with as far south as the 52d parallel. The Southern Urals introduce
                    amidst the Ciscaspian steppes the forest vegetation, flora, and fauna of middle
                    Russia.</p>
                <p>In the distribution of the races of mankind the Urals have also played an
                    important part. To the present day the Northern Urals are the abodes of Finnish
                    stems (Samoyedes, Zyrians, Voguls, and Permians) who have been driven from their
                    former homes by Slavonian colonization, while the steppes on the slopes of the
                    Southern Urals have continued to be inhabited by the Turkish stems of the
                    Bashkirs. The Middle Urals were also in the 9th century the abode of the
                    Ugrians, and their land, Biarmia (now Perm), was well known to the Byzantine
                    historians for its mineral wealth,—there being at that time a lively intercourse
                    between the Ugrians and the Greeks. Compelled to abandon their abodes, they
                    moved south on the Ural slopes towards the land of the Khazars, and through the
                    prairies of south-eastern and southern Russia (the Λε <hi rend="italic"
                    >βεδία</hi> of Constantine Porphyrogenitus) towards the Danube and to their
                    present seat—Hungary,—leaving but a very few memorials in the Northern and
                    Middle Urals.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Comp. <hi

                    At present the Urals, especially the Middle and the Southern, are being more and
                    more colonized by Great Russian immigrants, while the Finnish stems are rapidly
                    melting away.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Metallurgy and Mining.—</hi> The mineral wealth of the Urals
                    was known to the Greeks in the 9th century, and afterwards to the Novgorodians,
                    who penetrated there in the 11th century for trade with the Ugrians. When the
                    colonies of Novgorod (Vyatka, Perm) fell under the rule of Moscow, the Russian
                    czars soon understood the importance of the Ural mines, and Ivan III. sent out
                    German engineers to explore that region. In 1558 the whole of the present
                    government of Perm was given by the rulers of Moscow to the brothers Strogonoff,
                    who began to establish salt-works and mines for iron and copper. Peter I. gave a
                    new impulse to the mining industry by founding several iron-works, and from
                    1745, when gold was first discovered, the Russian colonization of the Urals took
                    a new departure. The colonization was, however, of a double character, being
                    partly free—chiefly by Nonconformists in search of religious freedom in the
                    wildernesses of the Urals—and partly compulsory,—the Government sending peasant
                    settlers who became serfs to the iron and copper works, and were bound to supply
                    them with ores and wood for fuel. Until 1861 all work at the mines was done by
                    serfs belonging either to private persons (the Strogonoffs, Demidoffs, and
                    others) or to the crown. At present (1888) only a few works, maintained for
                    supplying the army, belong to the crown.</p>
                <p>Gold is found both in veins and in alluvial or diluvial deposits, and is
                    extracted from both; but the former yield only a moderate quantity annually
                    (2180 to 2780 lb in 1882-84). The gold from the Ural mines constitutes nearly
                    one-fifth of the total amount obtained throughout the Russian empire. Platinum
                    is found either in connexion with gold dust or separately, the platinum mines of
                    the Urals being the only ones worked in Russia. Osmium, iridium, and nickel are
                    found at several places, but their industrial importance is small. Silver is
                    also met with at several places, but only 2383 lb were extracted during the
                    years 1875 to 1884. The copper mines, chiefly in Perm, but partly also in Ufa,
                    are very important, nearly two-thirds of the total amount of the metal mined in
                    Russia being obtained from eight works in the Urals. The average amount of gold,
                    platinum, and copper annually yielded by the Ural mines is given in the

                <p>Owing to the immense extent of forest, the coal mining industry is but of recent
                    origin in the Urals. Only six pits were at work in Perm in 1884; and of recent
                    years from 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 cwts. have been annually extracted (about 5
                    per cent. of the coal raised in the Russian empire). Finally, salt was raised in
                    Perm, Orenburg, and Uralsk to the amount of 9,422,000 cwts. in 1884.</p>
                <p>The precious (amethyst, topaz, emerald, tourmaline, &amp;c.) and ornamental
                    (malachite, carsovite, &amp;c.) stones of the Urals are familiar in all European
                    museums, and are found in most beautiful varieties. The crown works at
                    Ekaterinburg supply admirable works of art, while a numerous population at
                    Ekaterinburg and in the neighbouring villages support themselves by searching
                    for precious and ornamental stones and preparing them for export. Of the 330,750
                    workmen engaged in 1884 in mining and metallurgical industries throughout the
                    Russian empire 183,914 were employed in the Urals, as well as nearly one-half of
                    the motive power (steam-engines and water-wheels) used at the mining and
                    metallurgical works of Russia, Poland, and Finland. The exports from the Urals
                    are made chiefly by means of the rivers, which are navigable in their upper
                    parts only during the spring. There is not as yet any railway connecting the
                    Urals with Russia. The line of Siberian railway which now connects the
                    iron-works of the eastern slope with the Kama at Perm has certainly increased
                    the exports; but they are still so small in comparison with the expense of the
                    line that the railway is worked at a loss, the deficiency being made good from
                    the imperial budget, and the whole mining and metallurgical industry of the
                    Urals is still maintained by means of high protective duties imposed on foreign
                    metals and metallic wares.</p>
                <p>Several wealthy towns have grown up in the Ural valleys in connexion with mining
                    industry and administration. <hi rend="smallcaps">Ekaterinburg</hi><hi

                    Avzyano-Petrovsk have populations from 5000 to 10,000.</p>
