                    682-685) for its physiological relations, we consider it here only as a chemical

                    2</hi>, was discovered by H. M. Rouelle in 1773; Fourcroy and Vauquelin in 1799
                    published the first exact investigation on it. In 1828 Wöhler showed that it can
                    be obtained by the union in aqueous solutions of cyanic acid with ammonia, and
                    thus for the first time effected what was then considered an impossibility,
                    namely, the artificial preparation of an organic compound from mineral matter.
                    For the extraction of urea from urine the latter is concentrated by evaporation
                    (more or less, according to its original strength), and then, after cooling,

                    present as such, the urea being liberated. The mixed solution of urea and the
                    nitrate is evaporated to a small volume and allowed to stand, when the bulk of
                    the barytic nitrate crystallizes out. The rest is removed by evaporating the
                    mother liquor to dryness over a water-bath and extracting the urea with strong
                    alcohol. To obtain fine crystals, the filtered alcoholic solution is evaporated
                    to dryness, the residual urea dissolved in a very little hot water, and the
                    solution allowed to cool <pb break="no"

                    long colourless columns, not unlike those of nitrate of potash.</p>
                <p>Wohler’s synthetical method for preparative purposes usually assumes the
                    following form. Powdered prussiate of potash (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Prussic
                    Acid)</hi> is dehydrated by heating, the anhydrous salt mixed with half its
                    weight of anhydrous binoxide of manganese, and the mixture heated in a flat iron
                    pan until the deflagration, which soon sets in, is completed. The residue now
                    consists of oxides of iron and manganese and of cyanate of potash, NCO. K,
                    formed from the cyanide of potassium of the prussiate by oxidation. The cyanate
                    of potash is extracted by means of the least sufficient quantity of cold water
                    (hot water decomposes the salt, with the formation of ammonia and carbonate of
                    potash), and the solution is mixed at once with the calculated weight of
                    sulphate of ammonia, 1(NH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> for 2NCO. K. The two salts decompose each
                    other into sulphate of potash and cyanate of ammonia; the latter, however,
                    passes spontaneously and almost instantaneously into urea :—</p>
                <p>NCO. NH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> =CO(NH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>Cyanate of ammonia. Urea.</p>
                <p>The sulphate of potash is eliminated exactly as the nitrate of baryta is in the
                    urine method. That urea is not cyanate of ammonia itself is proved, first by the
                    fact that real cyanate of ammonia (preparable by the union of anhydrous cyanic
                    acid with ammonia gas) is a different substance, and secondly by its not
                    yielding any ammonia when dissolved in cold caustic potash ley. Urea behaves to
                    certain strong acids like a feeble basis, uniting (CON <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> parts) with HNO <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi> parts of nitric, ½H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi rend="subscript">
                    4</hi> of sulphuric, and ½C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">
                    4</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> of oxalic acid into crystalline salts. As
                    shown by its formula, urea is the amide of carbonic acid: <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e</hi>., it is CO(OH) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>- 2OH + 2NH <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and consequently an anhydride of carbonate of ammonia,
                    CO(O. NH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. An aqueous
                    solution of urea, when heated to 200° in a sealed-up tube, breaks up into
                    carbonic acid and ammonia; and dry carbonate of ammonia, when kept at a certain
                    temperature, suffers partial conversion into urea and water.</p>
                <p>Of the many methods for the quantitative determination of the urea in urine, the
                    simplest is to treat a measured volume with excess of solution of hypobromite of
                    soda (a solution of bromine in caustic soda ley) and to measure the volume of
                    nitrogen evolved. By theory CON <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + 3NaBrO = 3NaBr + CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + 2H
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O (the CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is absorbed
                    by the excess of alkali); but in practice, according to Dupre, through unknown
                    causes only 91 per cent. of the nitrogen is actually evolved, which must be
                    remembered in the calculation of the result.</p>
