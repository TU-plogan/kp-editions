                    deep impression upon him; and after studying divinity at Trinity College,
                    Cambridge, of which he was elected a fellow in 1756, he determined to devote
                    himself wholly to astronomy. He early became intimate with Bradley, and in 1761
                    was deputed by the Royal Society to make observations of the transit of Venus at
                    St Helena. During the voyage he introduced into navigation the determination of
                    longitude by lunar distances, a method which Mayer’s recently published tables
                    had made practically possible. In 1763 he undertook a voyage to Barbados to test
                    Harrison’s watches, which, however, he reported to be inferior to the method of
                    lunars for determining longitude. In 1765 he succeeded Bliss as
                    astronomer-royal, and thereafter devoted himself with singular energy to the
                    duties of his office, which he held till his death, February 9, 1811.</p>
                <p>Maskelyne’s first contribution to astronomical literature was “A Proposal for
                    Discovering the Annual Parallax of Sirius,” published in 1760 in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> in which also most of his later
                    original memoirs appeared— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> his observations of the
                    transit of Venus (1761 and 1769), observations on the tides at St Helena (1762),
                    astronomical observations at St Helena (1764) and at Barbados (1764). In 1763 he
                    published a small octavo, <hi rend="italic">The British Mariner’s Guide,</hi>
                    which contains the valuable suggestion that, in order to facilitate the finding
                    of longitude at sea, lunar distances should be calculated beforehand for each
                    year and published in a form accessible to navigators. This suggestion, the germ
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac,</hi> was approved of by the
                    Government, and under the care of Maskelyne the <hi rend="italic">Nautical
                    Almanac</hi> for 1767 was published in 1766. During the remainder of his life
                    Maskelyne continued to superintend the publication of this invaluable annual,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac</hi> for 1815 being the last which he
                    prepared. Another valuable service which he rendered astronomy was his inducing
                    the Government to print his observations annually. Flamsteed’s and Bradley’s
                    observations had been private property, and were published as such. The result
                    of Maskelyne’s action was the accumulation and rapid dissemination of a long
                    series of observations which from their continuity and accuracy have been of
                    inestimable value to astronomers, and form along with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nautical Almanac</hi> his most lasting monument. The whole work of the
                    observatory was carried on by him and his one assistant in a most methodical
                    manner, Greenwich being in point of organization second to none amongst the
                    observatories of the day. He introduced several improvements in the use of the
                    instruments, being, for example, the first astronomer who measured to tenths of
                    a second; and he prevailed upon the Government to replace Bird’s mural quadrant,
                    which had become untrustworthy, by a repeating circle of 6 feet in diameter. The
                    new instrument was constructed by Troughton; but Maskelyne did not live to see
                    it completed. In 1772 he suggested to the Royal Society the famous Schehallion
                    experiment for the determination of the earth’s density. Forty years previously
                    Bouguer had demonstrated by experiment that Chimborazo in South America affected
                    the direction of the plumb-line quite appreciably; but his observations were not
                    made with sufficient care to deduce therefrom any trustworthy result.
                    Maskelyne’s experiments were made in 1774 (see <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions</hi> for 1775), the apparent difference of latitude between two
                    stations on opposite sides of the mountain being compared with the real
                    difference of latitude obtained by triangulation. From Maskelyne’s observations
                    Hutton deduced by laborious calculations that tħe density of the earth was 4’5
                    times that of pure water. Playfair subsequently estimated with greater accuracy
                    the mass of Schehallion, and obtained 4 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7 for the
                    earth’s mean density. Maskelyne also took a great interest in various geodesical
                    operations, notably the measurement of the length of a degree of latitude in
                    Maryland and Pennsylvania <hi rend="italic">(Philosophical Transactions,</hi>
                    1769), which was carried out by Mason and Dixon in 1766-68, and later the
                    determination of the relative longitude of Greenwich and Paris <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Philosophical Transactions,</hi> 1787). Cassini, Legendre, and Μéchain
                    conducted the triangulation on the French side; on the English side the work was
                    carried on under the superintendence of General Roy. This triangulation was the
                    beginning of the great trigonometrical survey which has since been extended all
                    over the country. A volume of <hi rend="italic">Selections</hi> (London, 1812)
                    contains several papers that were published, by Maskelyne as additions to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac.</hi> His observations fill three large folio
                    volumes, and many of them were reprinted in Vince’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Astronomy.</hi></p>
