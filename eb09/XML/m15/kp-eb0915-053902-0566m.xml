                    (1536-1624), a celebrated Spanish historian, was born of obscure parentage at
                    Talavera de la Reina in 1536. He studied at the university of AlcalA, and was
                    admitted at the age of seventeen into the Society of Jesus, where he soon
                    attracted notice by his brilliant talents and extensive acquirements. Called to
                    the Collegium Romanum in 1561, he there professed theology four years, and
                    reckoned among his pupils Robert Bellarmine, afterwards the famous cardinal. He
                    then passed into Sicily, where he remained for about two years, and in 1569 he
                    was sent to Paris, where his -expositions of the writings of Aquinas attracted
                    large audiences. In 1574 the decline of his health compelled him to give up
                    teaching, and he obtained permission to return to Spain; the rest of his life
                    was passed at the Jesuits’ house in Toledo, in a vigorous literary activity
                    which was interrupted only by the molestations to which his too great
                    independence, liberality, and candour exposed him. He died on February 17,
                    1624.</p>
                <p>His great work, <hi rend="italic">Historiae de Piébus Hispaniae,</hi> first
                    appeared in twenty books at Toledo' in 1592; ten books were subsequently added
                    (1605), bringing the work down to the accession of Charles <hi rend="italic"
                    >V.,</hi> and in a still later abstract of events the author completed it to the
                    accession of Philip IV. in 1621. It was so well received that Mariana was
                    induced to translate it into Spanish. The first part of this in some respects
                    new work <hi rend="italic">{Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">de Espana}</hi>
                    appeared in 1601; it was completed in 1609, and much enlarged and improved in
                    three subsequent editions which appeared during the translator’s lifetime. It
                    has been frequently reprinted since 1624, both in Latin and in Spanish; and an
                    English translation by J. Stevens appeared in 1699. Mariana’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >History</hi> is justly esteemed for the extent of the author’s researches, for
                    the general accuracy of his acquaintance with the materials at his command, for
                    the sagacity of his reflexions and characterizations, and above all for the
                    merit of his style, which, in its simplicity, vividness, and directness, has
                    deservedly been compared to that of Livy. The modern student may regret but can
                    hardly blame the credulity with which in too many cases he has without the least
                    attempt at historical criticism adopted the “received traditions of his
                    country.” Of the other works of Mariana, the most interesting is his treatise
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Rege et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Regis</hi><hi rend="italic">Institutione,</hi> of which the first edition,
                    dedicated to Philip III., appeared at Toledo in 1599. In its sixth chapter the
                    question whether it is lawful to overthrow a tyrant is freely discussed and
                    answered in the affirmative,—a circumstance which brought much popular odium
                    upon the Jesuits, especially after the assassination of Henry IV. of France in
                    1610. See Bayle’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire</hi> and Hallam’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Literary History,</hi> part ii. chap. iv. A volume entitled <hi

                    published by Mariana at Cologne in 1609, containing in particular a tract “On
                    Mortality and Immortality,” and another “De Mutatione Monetae,” was put upon the
                    Index Expurgatorius, and led to the confinement and punishment of its author by
                    the Inquisition. During his confinement there was found among his papers a
                    criticism upon the Jesuits <hi rend="italic">(De las Enfermedades de la
                    Compailia de Jesus</hi><hi rend="italic">y de sus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Remcdios'),</hi> which was believed to have been written by him. It was not
                    printed until after his death (1625).</p>
