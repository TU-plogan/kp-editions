                    dialect (to which those of Hasselt, St Fruiden, and Sittand are nearly akin) has
                    remained comparatively free from such admixture. Its phonology is peculiarly
                    interesting both in itself and because its history can be traced to an early
                    date by authentic documents. The Old Frankish psalms and the Limburg sermons are
                    written in it; and it was also the original dialect of the St Servatius Legend
                    (ed. by Bormanns) now transcribed in the Belgian Limburg dialect, and of
                    Veldeke’s <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> (ed. by Behoghel), now in Middle High

                <p>Buckau; the last three of these are separated from the town by the ramparts and
                    glacis, but are all included within the new line of advanced bastions. In the
                    Elbe, between the old town and the Friedrichstadt, lies an island called the
                    Werder, occupied by the citadel, and united with both banks by bridges. With the
                    exception of the Breiter Weg, a handsome thoroughfare running from north to
                    south, tbθ streets of the town proper are narrow and crooked. Along the Elbe,
                    however, extends a fine promenade named the Fürstenwall, at one end of which
                    stands a monument in commemoration of the Franco-German war. To the south of the
                    inner town is the Friedrich-Wilhelm’s Garten, a beautiful park laid out on the
                    site of the celebrated convent of Bergen, which was founded in 937 and
                    suppressed in 1810. By far the most important building in Magdeburg is the
                    cathedral, a handsome and massive structure of the 13th and 14th centuries,
                    exhibiting an interesting blending of Romanesque and Gothic architecture. The
                    two fine towers were completed about 1520. The interior contains the tombs of
                    the emperor Otho the Great and his wife Edifha, an English princess, and the
                    fine monument of Archbishop Ernest, executed in 1497 by Peter Vischer of
                    Nuremberg. The Liebfrauenkirche, the oldest church in Magdeburg, is an
                    interesting Romanesque edifice of the 12th and 13th centuries. The chief secular
                    buildings are the town hall, built in 1691 and enlarged in 1866, the theatre,
                    the governor’s house, the central railway station, and the exchange. The Breiter
                    Weg and the old market contain numerous fine private houses in the style of the
                    Renaissance. In front of the town-hall stands an equestrian statue of the
                    emperor Otho the Great, erected towards the close of the 13th century. The
                    favourable situation of Magdeburg, in the very heart of Germany, and on the Elbe
                    below all its principal affluents, has made it one of the most important
                    commercial towns in the empire, and it is also the focus of several important
                    railways. The chief articles of commerce are agricultural and colonial products,
                    manufactured goods, and wine. The town and its suburbs contain numerous
                    manufactories of woollen, cotton, and silk goods, sugar, spirits, tobacco,
                    organs and pianos, chocolate, and chicory. Magdeburg is the headquarters of the
                    4th corps of the German army, and the seat of the provincial court of appeal and
                    administrative offices, of a Lutheran consistory, and of a superintendent
                    general of the Evangelical (Reformed) Church. It also contains two gymnasia, two
                    “Realschulen,” schools of art, medicine, surgery, and mining, and numerous
                    scientific and charitable institutions. The population of Magdeburg in 1880 was
                    97,539, or, including Neustadt and Buckau, 137,109.</p>
                <p>Magdeburg, which was in existence as a small trading settlement at the beginning
                    of the 9th century, owes its early prosperity chiefly to the emperor Otho I.,
                    who established a Benedictine convent here in 937 (see above). In 968 it became
                    the seat of an archbishop, who was also primate of Germany, and exercised sway
                    over an extensive territory. By the 13th century Magdeburg had become a
                    flourishing commercial town and an important member of the Hanseatic League. Its
                    bench of sheriffs <hi rend="italic">(Sch'oppenstuhl)</hi> became celebrated, and
                    “Magdeburg law,” securing the administrative independence of municipalities, was
                    adopted in many parts of Germany, Poland, and Bohemia. During the Middle Ages
                    the citizens were almost constantly at variance with the archbishops, and by the
                    end of the 15th century b⅛d become nearly independent of them. It should,
                    however, be noted that Magdeburg never became a free city of the empire. The
                    town embraced the Reformation in 1524, and was thenceforth governed by
                    Protestant administrators or archbishops. On the refusal of the citizens to
                    accept the “Interim,” Magdeburg was besieged by Maurice of Saxony in 1550, and
                    capitulated in 1551 on favourable terms. During the Thirty Years’ War the city
                    was twice besieged, and suffered terribly. It successfully resisted Wallenstein
                    for seven months in 1629, but was stormed and sacked by Tilly in 1631. The whole
                    town, with the exception of the cathedral, the Frauenkirche, and about 140
                    houses, was burned to the ground, and 30,000 of its 36,000 inhabitants were
                    butchered without regard to age or sex. The town recovered from this deadly blow
                    with wonderful rapidity. In 1648 the archbishopric was converted into a secular
                    duchy, to fall to Brandenburg on the death of the last administrator, which
                    happened in 1680. In 1806 Magdeburg was taken by the French and annexed to the
                    kingdom of Westphalia, but it was restored to Prussia in 1814, on the downfall
                    of Napoleon. Otto von Guericke, the inventor of the air-pump, was burgomaster of
                    Magdeburg at the time of Tilly’s siege. Carnot died here in exile, and is buried
                    in the cemetery, and Luther was at school here and sang in the streets for bread
                    with other poor choristers.</p>
