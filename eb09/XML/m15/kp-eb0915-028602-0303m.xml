                    His fame rests chiefly on his successful wars, in particular his numerous
                    invasions of India. His military capacity, inherited from his father,
                    Nasir-ud-din Subuktigin, was strengthened by youthful experience in the field.
                    Subuktigin, a Turki slave of Alptigin, governor of Khorâsân under Abd’ ul Malik
                    Nüh, king of the Sâmâni dynasty of Bokhara, early brought himself to notice. He
                    was raised to high office in the state by Alptigin’s successor, Abù Ishâk, and
                    in 366 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi> (977 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> by
                    the choice of the nobles of Ghazni, he became their ruler. He soon began to make
                    conquests in the neighbouring countries, and in these wars he was accompanied by
                    his young son Mahmüd. On one occasion, when Mahmüd was fourteen years of age,
                    his advice with respect to a military operation in the hills was approved and
                    adopted by the generals. Before he had reached even this age he encountered in
                    two expeditions under his father the Indian forces of Jaipâl, raja of Lahore,
                    whom Subuktigin defeated on the Punjab frontier.</p>
                <p>In 994 Mahmüd was made governor of Khorâsân, with the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saif-ed-daulah</hi> (“Sword of the State”), by the Sâmâni emir, Abd’ ul Malik
                    Nüh. Two years later, his father Subuktigin died in the neighbourhood of Balkh,
                    having declared his second son, Ismâil, who was then with him, to be his
                    successor. As soon as Ismâil had assumed the sovereignty at Balkh, Mahmüd, who
                    was at Nishâpür, addressed him in friendly terms, proposing a division of the
                    territories held by their father at his death. Ismâil rejected the proposal, and
                    was immediately attacked by Mahmüd and defeated. Retreating to Ghazni, he there
                    yielded, and was imprisoned, and Mahmüd obtained undisputed power as sovereign
                    of Khorâsân and Ghazni (997).</p>
                <p>The Ghaznavi dynasty is sometimes reckoned by native historians to commence with
                    Subuktigin’s conquest of Bιist and Kusdâr (978). But Subuktigin, throughout his
                    reign at Ghazni, continued to acknowledge the Sâmâni suzerainty, as did Mahmüd
                    also, until the time, soon after succeeding to his father’s dominions, when he
                    received from the caliph of Baghdad, Al Kâdir Billah, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >khilat</hi> or robe of honour, with a letter recognizing his sovereignty, and
                    conferring on him the titles <hi rend="italic">Ύ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >αmin-ed-daulah (“</hi> Right Hand of the State ”), and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amin-ul-Millat</hi> (“Guardian of the Faith ”). From this time it is the name
                    of the caliph that is inscribed on Mahmüd’s coins, together with his own new
                    titles.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Even before
                    succeeding his father he struck coins in his own name at Nisâbür (Nishâpür),
                    when he was governor of Khorâsân.</p></note> Previously the name of the</p>
                <p>Sâmâni sovereign, Mansür bin Nüh (successor of Abd’ ul NIalik) is given along
                    with his own former title, Saif-ed-daulah Mahmüd. The earliest of those of the
                    new form gives his name Mahmüd bin Subuktigin. Thereafter his father’s name does
                    not appear on his coins, but it is inscribed again on his tomb.</p>
                <p>The new honours received from the caliph gave fresh impulse to Mahmüd’s zeal on
                    behalf of Islam, and he resolved on an annual expedition against the idolaters
                    of India. He could not quite carry out this intention, but a great part of his
                    reign was occupied with his Indian campaigns. In 1000 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> he started on the first of these expeditions, but it does not appear
                    that on this occasion he went farther than the hill country near Peshawar. The
                    hostile attitude of Khalaf ibn Ahmad, governor of Sistân, called Mahmüd to that
                    province for a short time. He was appeased by Khalaf’s speedy submission,
                    together with the gift of a large sum of money, and further, it is said, by his
                    subdued opponent addressing him as <hi rend="italic">sultan,</hi> a title new at
                    that time, and by which Mahmüd continued to be called, though he did not
                    formally adopt it, or stamp it on his coins. Four years later Khalaf, incurring
                    Mahmüd’s displeasure again, was imprisoned, and his property confiscated.</p>
                <p>Mahmüd’s army first crossed the Indus in 1001, opposed by Jaipâl, raja of Lahore.
                    Jaipâl was defeated, and Mahmüd, after his return from this expedition, is said
                    to have taken the distinctive appellation of <hi rend="italic">Ghazi</hi>
                    (“Valiant for the Faith ”), but he is rarely so called.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The emperor Bâbar gives him this title
                    (1526). He himself was the second Mohammedan king who had conquered India, the
                    first being Sultan Mahmüd Ghâzi.</p></note> On the next occasion (1005) Mahmüd
                    advanced as far as Bhera on the Jhelum, when his adversary Anang-pâl, son and
                    successor of Jaipâl, fled to Kashmir. The following year saw Mahmüd at Multan.
                    When he was in the Punjab at this time, he heard of the invasion of Khorâsân by
                    Ilak Khan, ruler of Transoxiana (whose daughter Mahmüd had married). After a
                    rapid march back from India, Mahmüd repelled the invaders. Ilak Khan, having
                    retreated across the Oxus, returned with reinforcements, and took up a position
                    a few miles from Balkh, where he was signally defeated by Mahmüd.</p>
                <p>Two years had elapsed since his last visit to India when Mahmüd again entered the
                    Punjab (1008), this time for the express purpose of chastising Séwah Pâl, who,
                    having become a Mussulman, and been left by Mahmüd in charge of Multan, had
                    relapsed to Hinduism. The Indian campaign of the following year (1009) was a
                    notable one. Near the Indus Mahmüd was opposed again by Anang-pâl, supported by
                    powerful rajas from other parts of India. After a severe fight, Anang-pâl’s
                    elephants were so terror-struck by the fire-missiles flung amongst them by the
                    invaders that they turned and fled, the whole army retreating in confusion and
                    leaving Mahmüd master of the field.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The terms in which native historians have described the
                    effects of these missiles—not unlike the account given by De Joinville of the
                    Greek fire which caused such consternation to the army of St Louis something
                    more than two centuries later—gave rise at one time to the idea that something
                    like modern artillery was'meant. The fact that naphtha is distinctly mentioned
                    as having been used by Mahmüd on a later occasion, and the knowledge that
                    petroleum is found at several places on both sides of the Indus near the scene
                    of the fight with Anang-pâl, furnish the most probable explanation.</p></note>
                    Mahmüd, after this victory, pushed on through the Punjab to Nagar-két (Kangra),
                    and carried off much spoil from the Hindu temples’ to enrich his treasury at
                    Ghazni. In 1011 Mahmüd, after a short campaign against the Afghans under
                    Mohammed ibn Sûr in the hill country of Ghor, marched again into the Punjab. The
                    next time (1014) he advanced to Thanésar, another noted stronghold <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n304/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0304-0287"/> of Hinduism, between the Sutlej and the Jumna.
                    Having now found his way across all the Punjab rivers, he was induced on two
                    subsequent occasions to go still farther. But first he designed an invasion of
                    Kashmir (1015), which was not carried out, as his progress was checked at
                    Léh-kôt, a strong hill-fort in the north-west of the Punjab. And then before
                    undertaking his longer inroad into Hindustan he had to march north into Khwârizm
                    (Khiva) against his brother-in-law Mamιin, who had refused to acknowledge
                    Mahmùd’s supremacy. The result was as usual, and Mahmüd, having committed
                    Khwârizm to a new ruler, one of Mamün’s chief officers, returned to his capital.
                    Then in 1018, with a very large force, he proceeded to India again, extending
                    his inroad this time to the great Hindu cities of Mathra on the Jumna and Kanauj
                    on the Ganges. To the glory of reducing the one and receiving the submission of
                    the other he added, as was his custom, the further satisfaction of carrying back
                    great stores of plunder from both to his own country. Three years later he went
                    into India again, marching over nearly the same ground, to the support, this
                    time, of the raja of Kanauj, who, having made friendship with the Mohammedan
                    invader on his last visit, had been attacked by the raja of Kalinjar. But Mahmùd
                    found he had not yet sufficiently subdued the idolaters nearer his own border,
                    between Cabul and the Indus, and the campaign of the year 413 (1022 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> was directed against them, and reached no farther
                    than Peshawar. Another march into India the following year was made direct to
                    Gwalior.</p>
                <p>The next expedition (1025) is the most famous of all. The point to which it was
                    directed was the temple of Somnath on the coast of the Gujerât peninsula. After
                    an arduous journey by Multan, and through part of Rajputana, he reached Somnath,
                    and met with a very vigorous but fruitless resistance on the part of the Hindus
                    of Gujerât. Moslem feet soon trod the courts of the great temple. The chief
                    object of worship it contained was broken up, and the fragments kept to be
                    carried off to Ghazni. The story is often told of the hollow figure, cleft by
                    Mahmüd’s battleaxe, pouring out great store of costly jewels and gold. But the
                    idol in this Sivite temple was only a tall block or pillar of hewn stone, of a
                    familiar kind. The popular legend is a very natural one. Mahmùd, it was well
                    known, made Hindu temples yield up their most precious things. He was a
                    determined idol-breaker. And the stone block in this temple was enriched with a
                    crown of jewels, the gifts of wealthy worshippers. These data readily give the
                    Somnath exploit its more dramatic form. For the more recent story of the Somnath
                    gates see <hi rend="smallcaps">Ghazni,</hi> vol. x. p. 560.</p>
                <p>After the successes at Somnath, Mahmùd remained some months in India before
                    returning to Ghazni. Then in 1026 he crossed the Indus once more into the
                    Punjab. His brilliant military career closed with an expedition to Persia, in
                    the third year after this, his last visit to India. The Indian campaigns of
                    Mahmùd and his father were almost, but not altogether, unvarying successes. The
                    Moslem historians touch lightly on reverses. And, although the annals of
                    Rajputana tell how Subuktigin was defeated by one raja of Ajmfr and Mahmüd by
                    his successor, the course of events which followed shows how little these and
                    other reverses affected the invader’s progress. Mahmüd’s failure at Ajmir, when
                    the brave raja Bisal-deo obliged him to raise the siege but was himself slain,
                    was when the Moslem army was on its way to Somnath. Yet Mahmud’s Indian
                    conquests, striking and important in themselves, were, after all, in great
                    measure barren, except to the Ghazni treasury. Mahmüd retained no possessions in
                    India under his own direct rule. But after the repeated defeats, by his father
                    and himself, of two successive rajas of Lahore, the conqueror assumed the right
                    of nominating the governors of the Punjab as a dependency of Ghazni, a right
                    which continued to be exercised by seven of his successors. And for a time, in
                    the reign of Masâùd II. (1098-1114), Lahore was the place of residence of the
                    Ghaznavi sovereign. Certain silver coins of Mahmüd’s reign bear inscriptions in
                    Sanskrit characters as well as Arabic, betokening sovereignty in India. They are
                    dated 418 and 419 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.,</hi> the two years immediately
                    following his last visit to the Punjab, and are struck at a place called by his
                    name, Mahmüdpür, supposed to be Lahore. There are also copper coins struck at
                    Lahore (now retaining legible dates) bearing Mahmüd’s name and the caliph’s, in
                    Arabic characters only. Mahmüd’s coins are numerous and historically important.
                    They were issued from mints at Nisâbür, Hirât, Ghaznah (a common alternative
                    form of the name), Farwân, and Balkh, besides Mahmüdpür and Lahore, just
                    mentioned. Mahmüd died at Ghazni in 1030, the yean following his expedition to
                    Persia, in the sixty-first year of his age and thirty-third of his reign.</p>
                <p>Mahmud stands conspicuous for his military ardour, his ambition, strong will,
                    perseverance, watchfulness, and energy, combined with great courage and
                    unbounded self-reliance. But his tastes were not exclusively military. His love
                    of literature brought men of learning to Ghazni. His acquaintance with Moslem
                    theology was recognized by the learned doctors. Mahmüd is accused of avarice. It
                    has been said that the prospect of booty was as strong a motive power in these
                    repeated invasions of India as his love of military glory and desire to shine as
                    a champion of the faith. An illustration commonly given of his want of
                    liberality is his treatment of the poet Firdousi. Delighted with a portion which
                    was read to him of the poet’s metrical romance narrating the deeds of the early
                    kings Of Persia, Mahmüd presented him with a thousand <hi rend="italic"
                    >dindrs,</hi> one for each couplet, with an implied promise, or at least
                    expectation on the part of the author, of payment on the same scale for the
                    rest. The completed <hi rend="italic">Shdh Ndman,</hi> presented in due course,
                    contained no less than sixty thousand couplets, and the reward this time was
                    given in <hi rend="italic">dirhems</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic"
                    >dindrs.</hi> Firdousi retired in disgust to his native place, Tüs, and
                    satirized the sultan. At a later time, it is said, Mahmüd sent him the larger
                    sum; but the poet died just before it arrived. Mahmüd had the general reputation
                    of giving liberal and discerning encouragement to learned and literary men.
                    Among those who took up their abode at Ghazni in his time, the most noted, after
                    Firdousi, were the poet Unsuri of Balkh, whose compositions were largely devoted
                    to the praise of the sultan Mahmud; another poet, Asjudi of Merv, who wrote a
                    grand ode on the Somnath expedition; El Utbi of Khoräsan, author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kitdb-i-Yamini,</hi> a history of Subuktigin and of Mahmüd (to
                    about the middle of his reign); and the accomplished historian, Abd Rihan,
                    called Al Biπini, author of the <hi rend="italic">Tarikh xd Hind,</hi> as well
                    as of a number of scientific works. The sultan established large educational
                    institutions at Ghazni.</p>
                <p>Mahmüd also found time to bestow attention on other arts of peace, and did not
                    neglect his capital and the country around. Large sums were devoted to important
                    public works. The building of the great Jama Masjid of Ghazni is described by El
                    Utbi in admiring terms. A splendid palace which Mahmüd built induced wealthy
                    nobles at Ghazni to erect great mansions for. themselves. Two fine towers or
                    minarets at Ghazni, 140 feet in height, bearing Mahmüd’s name (though one is
                    said to have been built by his successor) have attracted the attention of
                    travellers.. They are of a remarkable construction, the lower part with a zigzag
                    or starshaped outline, the upper part round, like the third and fourth stories
                    of the Kutb Minar at Delhi, built two centuries later. Like the Kutb pillar too,
                    they are isolated, and may, like it, have served as the minarets for a separate
                    mosque or mosques. The dam called the <hi rend="italic">Band-i-Sultdn,</hi>
                    which Mahmüd constructed to form an artificial lake for irrigation, appears to
                    have been a really great and substantial work.</p>
                <p>Mahmüd, besides being marked by small-pox, had an ill-favoured countenance, and
                    knew it. Courtiers met his allusions to his personal appearance by the familiar
                    complimentary remarks about inward graces more than counterbalancing outward
