                <p><label type="entry">MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE</label>, or, as it is now more usually
                    termed, <hi rend="smallcaps">Forensic Medicine,</hi> is that branch of state
                    medicine which treats of the application of medical knowledge to the purposes of
                    the law. The term medical jurisprudence, though sanctioned by long usage, is not
                    an appropriate one; since the subject is, strictly speaking, a branch of
                    medicine rather than of jurisprudence; it does not properly include sanitation
                    or <hi rend="smallcaps">Hygiene</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.υ.),</hi> both this and
                    medical jurisprudence proper being distinct branches of state medicine. The
                    connexion between medicine and the law was perceived long before medical
                    jurisprudence was recognized, or had obtained a distinct appellation. It first
                    took its rise in Germany, and subsequently, but more tardily, received
                    recognition in Great Britain.</p>
                <p>Forensic medicine, or medical jurisprudence proper as distinguished from hygiene,
                    embraces all those questions which bring the medical man into contact with the
                    law, and embraces (1) questions affecting the civil rights of individuals, and
                    (2) injuries to the person.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Questions Affecting the Civil or Social Rights of
                    Individuals.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Development of the Human Frame.—</hi> The development of the
                    physical and mental powers of the human being is a matter of the highest
                    importance, and is a factor of great consequence in determining criminal
                    responsibility, civil responsibility, or the power of giving validity to civil
                    contracts, and in determining the personal identity of a living person or of a
                    corpse. Human life is usually divided into the five periods of <hi rend="italic"
                    >infancy, childhood, youth, manhood,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">old age.</hi>
                    Some writers increase the number of these, unnecessarily, to seven periods,
                    without any practical advantage.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Infancy</hi> is the period from birth till the first or milk
                    set of teeth begin to be shed—usually about the seventh year. During this period
                    the body increases in size and stature more, relatively, than at any other
                    period of existence; and the mental faculties undergo great development. The
                    milk teeth, twenty in number, are evolved in a definite order, beginning with
                    the central incisors at about six months, and ending with the second molars
                    about the termination of the second year. From the size and stature of the body,
                    the development of the teeth, and the more or less advanced state of
                    ossification or solidification of the bony skeleton, conclusions may be drawn as
                    to the probable age of the infant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Childhood</hi> extends from the commencement of the shedding of
                    the milk teeth to the age of puberty—usually from the seventh to the fourteenth
                    or fifteenth year. During this period the body expands, as well as the bony
                    structures, without any clearly marked difference in structure being observable
                    between the sexes except as regards the genitals, so that it is impossible to
                    distinguish absolutely between the male and the female skeleton during this
                    period. The milk-teeth are shed, and are replaced by the second or permanent
                    set, thirty-two in number, though these do not usually all make their appearance
                    during childhood. Marked differences between the proclivities of the sexes are
                    noticeable even at an early period of childhood, and long before the
                    characteristic functions begin to be developed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Youth</hi> is marked at its commencement by the changes which
                    occur at puberty—the development of the genitals in both sexes, the appearance
                    of hair on the genitals, the appearance of a beard in the male, the development
                    of the breasts in the female, the appearance of the monthly flow in the female,
                    and the ability to secrete semen in the male. Marked mental changes now occur,
                    and the generative functions are perfected. Youth terminates at tire age of
                    legal majority, twenty-one years; or perhaps the period ought to be extended to
                    twenty-five years of age, as it is with some nations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manhood</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Womanhood}</hi> is the
                    period of perfection of all the bodily and mental powers. It ceases in woman
                    with the cessation of the monthly flow at about forty-five years of age; but in
                    man it often extends to a much later period of life.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Old Age</hi> begins with the decay of the bodily and mental
                    faculties, and is characterized by wrinkling of the skin, loss of the teeth,
                    whitening of the hair, and feebleness of the limbs. In its later stages decay of
                    the mental faculties, deafness, obscurity or loss of vision, and bowing of the
                    spine are added.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Duration of Human Life.—</hi> The chances of human life form
                    an important subject of inquiry, which has been elucidated by the labours of
                    Price, Milne, Farr, and others; and on deductions from comparisons of birth and
                    death rates is founded the system of annuities, insurance against loss in
                    sickness, and the insurance of lives. Since the establishment of compulsory
                    registration of deaths, our knowledge of the ordinary and extraordinary chances
                    of human life has been much extended, and surer data are now available for
                    calculations of probabilities of life, of survivorships, and of the payments
                    which ought to be made in benefit clubs. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Insurance</hi>
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Longevity.</hi></p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Personal Identity.</hi> —It might be imagined that there is
                    little danger, with the exercise of ordinary care, of mistaking one person for
                    another; but the remarkable case of the Tichborne claimant, and some other
                    less-known but perhaps equally singular instances, have demonstrated that
                    mistakes as to the identity of individuals are easily made, and are more
                    frequent than is commonly supposed. Where the identity has to be established or
                    disproved after long absence, exposure to foreign climates and great hardships,
                    wounds, &amp;c., the problem is often one of extreme difficulty. The data for
                    identifying a person are individual and family likeness, stature, the colour of
                    the eyes, peculiarities of garb and manner, recollection of antecedent events,
                    but more especially marks on the person either congenital or acquired. Such are
                    <hi rend="italic">naevi</hi> or mother’s marks, scars, and disunited or badly
                    united fractures, known to have existed upon the missing person. An accurate
                    solution of the question is, nevertheless, often a matter of the greatest
                    difficulty.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Marriage.—</hi> Under this head the medical jurist has to
                    deal principally with the nubile age, viewed in the light of nature and
                    according to legislative enactments, and with such physical circumstances as
                    affect the legality of marriages, or justify divorce.</p>
                <p>In Great Britain the age at which the sexes are first capable of propagating the
                    species is later than in more southern climes. Ordinarily it does not occur
                    before fifteen years of age for the male and fourteen for the female;
                    exceptionally, however, it occurs at the ages of thirteen and of twelve (or even
                    less) respectively in the male and female. By legislative enactment,
                    nevertheless, parents and guardians may, in England at all events, forbid the
                    marriage of young people till the age of legal majority. The only physical
                    circumstances which in Great Britain form a bar to marriage are physical
                    inability to consummate, and the insanity of one of the parties at the time of
                    marriage. Both those circumstances have been pleaded and sustained in the law
                    courts. In other countries minor physical circumstances, as disease, are held to
                    invalidate marriage.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Impotence and Sterility.—</hi> These may arise from organic
                    or from functional causes,— the former being alone irremediable, and as such
                    taken cognizance of by the law courts. On this subject it is unnecessary to
                    enlarge here.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n810/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0810-0779"/>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Pregnancy.—</hi> This subject presents one of the widest
                    fields for medico-legal evidence. The limits of age between which it is
                    possible, the limits of utero-gestation, and the signs of pregnancy may all in
                    turn be the subjects of investigation.</p>
                <p>The limits of age between which pregnancy is possible are usually fixed by the
                    appearance and cessation of the monthly flow; and these ordinarily begin about
                    fourteen and cease at forty-five years of age. Exceptionally they appear as
                    early as the tenth year, and may not cease till the end of the fifth decade of
                    life. Cases, however, have occurred where a woman has conceived before
                    menstruating; and a few doubtful cases of conception are recorded in women
                    upwards of fifty, or even sixty, years of age. The general fact of pregnancy
                    being limited by the age of puberty on the one hand and the cessation of the
                    monthly flow—or fifty years as the extreme limit of age— must be accepted as the
                    safest guide in practice.</p>
                <p>The limits of utero-gestation are not in England fixed by legislation. The French
                    code fixes the extreme limit of three hundred days. The ordinary period is forty
                    weeks and a half, or two hundred and eighty-three days from the cessation of the
                    last monthly flux. The limit of three hundred days, as fixed by the French code,
                    is perhaps never exceeded, if ever reached. The uncertainty of females in fixing
                    the exact date of conception has given rise to the discrepant opinions of
                    physiologists on the subject. It is well known, however, that among the higher
                    animals the period is not a precise one; and impregnation and conception are
                    doubtless not necessarily coincident.</p>
                <p>The signs of pregnancy are of the utmost importance to the medical jurist. He may
                    be called upon to pronounce upon the virtue of a female, to sustain or rebut a
                    plea for divorce, to determine whether a capital sentence shall be carried out,
                    or to determine whether it is probable that an heir will be born to an estate.
                    Should he err in his judgment—and mistakes are very possible iu the earlier
                    months of utero-gestation—he may commit a grievous wrong. Medical jurists are in
                    the habit of classifying the signs of pregnancy as uncertain or certain; it is
                    the former which are most regarded by the public, but the latter are alone of
                    probative value to the jurist. The usual and uncertain signs are the cessation
                    of the monthly flow, nausea, sickness, a darkening of the areola and the
                    formation of a secondary areola around the nipple, enlargement of the breasts,
                    increased size of the abdomen, the formation of a tumour in the womb,
                    quickening, and the motions of the foetus. There are also other minor signs of
                    less importance. The certain signs are the uterine souffle, which is a peculiar
                    soft sound heard over the abdomen, and synchronous with the maternal pulse;
                    ballottement, or the examination for a floating tumour in the abdomen between
                    the fifth and eighth months of pregnancy; and the pulsations of the foetal
                    heart, heard by means of the stethoscope. These pulsations are much quicker
                    than, and not synchronous with, the maternal pulse. This is the only indubitable
                    sign of pregnancy. It is inapplicable before the fourth month of gestation.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Parturition.—</hi> The <hi rend="italic">imminence</hi> of
                    the process of parturition is of comparatively little interest to the medical
                    jurist; but the <hi rend="italic">signs of recent delivery</hi> are
                    all-important. These signs are the bruised, swollen, and lacerated state of the
                    external genitals, relaxation and dilatation of the vagina and womb, the
                    existence of a peculiar vaginal discharge known as the lochia, a relaxed and
                    fissured condition of the abdominal walls, a peculiar aspect of the countenance,
                    and the distended state of the breasts due to the secretion of milk. Thelochial
                    discharge is the most characteristic sign. All the signs may disappear within
                    ten days of delivery, though this is not usual.</p>
                <p>Connected with parturition, the question of <hi rend="italic">viability of</hi>
                    the child is not unimportant. After the intra-uterine age of seven months is
                    reached a child is certainly viable. The period at which the foetus becomes
                    viable cannot be stated with certainty; but five calendar months, or one hundred
                    and fifty days, is perhaps the nearest approximation which can be made. The
                    viability of a child is judged by its size and weight, its general state of
                    development, the state of the skin, hair, and nails, its strength or feebleness,
                    the ability to cry, and its power of taking maternal nourishment. The question
                    of viability has important bearings upon the crime of infanticide, and the
                    succession to property.</p>
                <p>The subject of <hi rend="italic">super∙foetation,</hi> or the possibility of two
                    conceptions having occurred resulting in the birth of twins with a considerable
                    intervening interval, is a very obscure one, and has given rise to much
                    controversy,—its existence being affirmed by some medical jurists, and denied by
                    others. There is much, however <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> the existence of a
                    double or bifid womb), to countenance the view that a double conception is
                    possible.</p>
                <p>In the curious case of a man marrying a woman having possession of an estate of
                    inheritance, and by her having issue born alive and capable of inheriting her
                    estate, the man on the death of his wife holds her lands for life as a tenant by
                    the “curtesy” of England. Here the meaning of “born alive” is different from the
                    meaning of the same expression as used respecting infanticide. In questions of
                    tenancy by the curtesy it has been decided that any kind of motion of the child,
                    as a twitching and tremulous motion of the lips, is sufficient evidence of
                    live-birth. As regards infanticide, proof of a conclusive separate existence of
                    the child is demanded before live-birth is admitted.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Monsters and Hermaphrodites.—</hi> To destroy any living
                    human birth, however unlike a human creature it may be, is to commit a crime.
                    Blackstone states that a monster which hath not the shape of mankind hath no
                    inheritable blood; but the law has not defined a monster, nor what constitutes a
                    human form. The same author states that if, in spite of deformity, the product
                    of birth has human shape, it may be an heir. Hermaphrodites are beings with
                    malformations of the sexual organs, simulating a double sex. Physiologists do
                    not admit, however, the existence of true hermaphrodites with double perfect
                    organs, capable of performing the functions of both sexes.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Paternity and Affiliation.—</hi> These are often matters of
                    great doubt. A considerable time may elapse between the absence or death of a
                    father and the birth of his reputed child. As has already been said, three
                    hundred days is the utmost limit to which physiologists would extend the period
                    of utero-gestation. This subject in volves questions respecting children born
                    during a second marriage of the mother, posthumous children, bastardy, and
                    alleged cases of posthumous children.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Presumption of Survivorship.—</hi> Μ hen two or more
                    persons perish by a common accident, when a mother and her new-born child are
                    found dead, and in a few analogous cases, important civil rights may depend upon
                    the question which lived the longest; and great ingenuity has been displayed in
                    elucidating the disputes which have arisen in the law courts in such cases.</p>
                <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Maladies Exempting from Discharge of Public Duties</hi>
                    frequently demand the attention of the medical man. He may be called upon to
                    decide whether a man is able to undertake military or naval service, to act as a
                    juryman without serious risk to life or health, <hi rend="italic">or</hi> to
                    attend as a witness at a trial. An endeavour to give a fearless and honest
                    certificate should animate the medical man in the discharge of this delicate
                    duty.</p>
                <p>12. <hi rend="italic">Feigned and Simulated Diseases</hi> often require much <pb

                    imposture. Where there is reason to suppose that a disease is simulated, much

                <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Insanity</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Mental Alienation.—</hi>
                    This subject presents an enormous field to the medical jurist. A medical man may
                    be required to give evidence in any of the law courts, civil, criminal, or
                    ecclesiastical, before commissions <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lunatico inquirendo,</hi> or before a magistrate, as to the sanity or insanity
                    of an individual; and he may have to sign certificates of unsoundness of mind
                    with the view of providing for the safe custody and proper treatment of a
                    lunatic. Hence he must be familiar with the chief forms of insanity (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Insanity),</hi> and be able to distinguish and treat each of
                    these. He will also be required to detect feigned insanity, and to examine
                    persons charged with crime with the view of preventing real lunatics from being
                    treated as criminals.</p>
                <p>The terms “unsoundness of mind,’’ applied to the condition of the mind itself,
                    and “<hi rend="italic">non compos mentis</hi>” to the person whose mind is
                    affected, are legal terms applied to insanity. Lawyershave disputed as to
                    whether imbecility should or should not be included under the head of insanity;
                    but medical men include under this category all disorders or defects of the mind
                    which disqualify a person for managing his affairs, and entering into a binding
                    contract, or which render the individual morally irresponsible for his or her
                    otherwise criminal actions. There is good legal authority for recognizing four
                    forms of unsoundness of mind— <hi rend="italic">idiocy, dementia, mania,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">monomania.</hi></p>
                <p>The chief questions respecting unsoundness of mind which present themselves to
                    the medical jurist are—is the person of sound or unsound mind; if unsound, are
                    there real lucid intervals; is he fit to manage his affairs, to contract a
                    marriage, or to execute a will; is lie dangerous to others <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ί</hi></p>
                <p>As grounds for restraint, the law recognizes only these conditions—danger to
                    himself, inability to manage his own affairs and property, and danger to the
                    person of others. Before an individual can be placed under restraint in an
                    asylum the certificates of two medical men must be obtained, and the formal
                    order of a relation or friend. The certificates to be valid must be signed by
                    legally qualified medical practitioners having no interest, direct or indirect,
                    in the patient, or in the asylum to which be is to be sent. The medical
                    examiners must pay separate visits, each medical man examining the patient
                    separately. The certificates, which remain valid for seven days only, must bear
                    the exact address of the lunatic, his occupation, and the date of the
                    examination; they must also set forth distinctly the grounds of the opinion they
                    express, under the separate heads of facts observed by the examiner, and facts
                    (to be specified) communicated by others. In the case of pauper lunatics one
                    medical certificate only is required, which is supplemented by an order from a
                    justice of the peace. In urgent cases also one medical certificate suffices for
                    incarceration in an asylum, provided that within three days of the patient’s
                    reception two other such certificates are signed by two other medical
                    practitioners, not being connected with the asylum, upon a like examination. The
                    superintendent or proprietor of the asylum must in all cases forward to the
                    commissioners of lunacy a notice of admission within one clear day from the
                    patient’s admission. Any infringement of the statutory regulations subjects the
                    person who commits it to a heavy penalty.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Injuries to tπe Person.</hi></p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Defloration.—</hi> The signs of defloration are obscure and
                    uncertain; and it is rather by the coexistence of several of the usual marks
                    than the existence of any one sign, that any just conclusion can be arrived
                    at.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Rape.</hi> —This crime consists in the carnal knowledge of a
                    woman forcibly and against her will. The resistance must be to the utmost, else
                    the crime of rape has not been committed in the legal sense of the word. The
                    proofs of rape, accordingly, apart from the consistency of the woman’s story,
                    mainly depend on the presence of the signs of defloration, and on marks of
                    injury on the man.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Mutilation.—</hi> This may consist in the cutting or maiming
                    of any member; castration is the most important, and perhaps but rarely effected
                    as a crime. Self-mutilation, giving rise to false accusations, is occasionally
                    resorted to.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Criminal Abortion.—</hi> The crime of abortion consists in
                    unlawfully administering to a woman, or causing to be taken by her (whether she
                    be with child or not), with intent to procure her miscarriage, any poison or
                    noxious thing, or using for the same purpose any instrument or other means
                    whatsoever; also in the use of the same means, with the same intent, by any
                    woman being with child.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Homicide.—</hi> The legal sense of the term homicide
                    excludes such injuries as are the result of either accident or of suicide. It
                    embraces murder or wilful homicide, manslaughter or culpable homicide, casual
                    homicide, and justifiable homicide.</p>
                <p>As a preliminary in all cases of homicide, it is the duty of the medical jurist
                    in the first place to ascertain the fact of death, and to distinguish between
                    real and apparent death; and then to determine, if possible, the period at which
                    death took place.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Infanticide</hi> or child murder is by the British law treated
                    with the same severity as the murder of an adult. Indeed infanticide as a crime
                    distinct from murder has no legal recognition. Practically this severity defeats
                    itself, and offences which are really cases of child murder are often treated
                    simply as cases of concealment of birth. The iniquity of the old law which threw
                    the onus of proof of still-birth on the mother now no longer exists, and the law
                    demands strict proof of live-birth at the hands of the prosecution. Hence the
                    subject involves very nice points of forensic medicine. The chil∣l must be
                    proved to have arrived at the period when there was a probability of its living
                    (proof of viability); and as the establishment of respiration is necessary to
                    prove live-birth the evidences of this act must be carefully investigated. The
                    size and position of the lungs, and the state of the vessels concerned in foetal
                    circulation, must be carefully noted. The foetal lungs are dark, dense, and
                    liver-like in appearance and consistence, and sink when immersed in water;
                    whilst the fully respired lungs are rosy, marbled, and soft and crepitant when
                    handled. Minor degrees of respiration are recognized by the appearance of little
                    groups of dilated air-vesicles, and by the fact that, although the lungs as a
                    whole may sink in water, certain portions of them, into which respired air has
                    penetrated, float in water even after subjection to firm pressure in the hand.
                    Care must be taken, nevertheless, to exclude buoyancy of the lung due to
                    putrefaction; in this case the air may be expelled by gentle pressure, and the
                    previously buoyant portion of lung now sinks in water. It is impossible,
                    however, to distinguish certainly between a lung naturally inflated and one
                    artificially insufflated.</p>
                <p>It must be borne in mind that, although live-birth cannot be affirmed in the
                    absence of signs of respiration, the presence of these signs is not proof of
                    live-birth in the legal sense of the term. The law demands for live-birth a
                    separate existence of the child after delivery; and breathing may take place
                    whilst the child is still either wholly or partially within the maternal
                    passages, and in some special cases whilst still within the womb itself.</p>
                <p>When proofs of respiration—it may be to such an extent as to leave no doubt as to
                    live-birth—have been found, the cause of death is then to be investigated.
                    Wounds, and other forms of injury, must be sought for. There may be signs of
                    strangulation, suffocation, puncture of the fontanelles, and consequent injury
                    to the brain, the administration of a poison, or other means of procuring death.
                    It must be borne in mind that some of these causes may be brought about by
                    omission, or even by accident. Thus strangulation may arise from natural and
                    unrelieved pressure of the navel string on the neck of the child; suffocation
                    from immersion of the face of the child in the maternal discharges, or by
                    pressure of clothes on the mouth. Death may result from haemorrhage through
                    neglect to tie the navel string, or the infant may perish from exposure to
                    cold.</p>
                <p>In the case of exposed infants it is very important to ascertain the real mother.
                    As such exposure usually takes place soon after birth, comparison of the age of
                    the infant with the signs of recent delivery in the suspected mother is the best
                    method of proving the relation.</p>
                <p>Ordinary <hi rend="italic">homicide</hi> may be accomplished by several modes
                    that may sometimes be ascertained by examination of the body. Of ono of the most
                    important of these consideration is deferred to the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Poisons.</hi></p>
                <p>Death by <hi rend="italic">asphyxia</hi> is a common mode of accomplishing
                    homicide, as by suffocation, drowning, hanging, strangulation, or by exposure to
                    mephitic air. Suicide and accidental death from these causes are still more
                    common. (1) <hi rend="italic">Drowning is</hi> thought to produce death
                    occasionally by the suddenness of the shock causing suspension of the functions
                    of circulation and respiration—by shock without a struggle. The usual mode of
                    death appears, however, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n812/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0812-0781"/> to be by the circulation of unoxygenated blood
                    through the brain acting as a poison upon .that organ; and this is attended with
                    all the phenomena of asphyxia, as in suffocation. The phenomena attending
                    asphyxia are as follows. As soon as the oxygen in the arterial blood, through
                    exclusion of air, sinks below the normal, the respiratory movements grow deeper
                    and at the same time more frequent; both the inspiratory and expiratory phases
                    are exaggerated, the supplementary respiratory muscles are brought into play,
                    and the breathing becomes hurried. As the blood becomes more and more venous,
                    the respiratory movements continue to increase both in force and frequency. Very
                    soon the expiratory movements become more marked than the inspiratory, and every
                    muscle which can in any way assist in expiration is brought into play. The
                    orderly expiratory movements culminate in expiratory convulsions; these violent
                    efforts speedily exhaust the nervous system, and the convulsions suddenly cease
                    and are followed by a period of calm. The calm is one of exhaustion; all
                    expiratory active movements have ceased, and all the muscles of the body are
                    flaccid and quiet. But at long intervals lengthened deep inspiratory movements
                    take place; then these movements become less frequent; the rhythm becomes
                    irregular, so that each breath becomes a more and more prolonged gasp, which
                    becomes at last a convulsive stretching of the whole body; and with extended
                    limbs and a straightened trunk, with the head thrown back, the mouth widely
                    open, the face drawn, and the nostrils dilated, the last breath is taken. The
                    above phenomena are not all observèd except in cases of sudden and entire
                    exclusion of air from the lungs. In slow asphyxia, where the supply of air is
                    gradually diminished (e.&lt;∕., in drowning), the phenomena are fundamentally
                    the same, but with minor differences. The appearances of the body after death
                    from drowning are various. There may be pallor of the countenance, or this may
                    be livid and swollen. The air passages are filled with frothy mucus, and there
                    may be water in the stomach. The ends of the fingers are often excoriated from
                    grasping at objects; and weeds, &amp;c., are sometimes found grasped in the
                    hands. The distinction between murder and suicide by drowning can rarely be made
                    out by examination of the body alone, and is usually decided from collateral
                    circumstances or marks of a struggle. Attention must also be paid to the
                    existence of wounds on the body, marks of strangulation on the neck, and the
                    like. (2) <hi rend="italic">Hanging</hi> may result in death from asphyxia, or,
                    as is more particularly the case in judicial hanging, some injury is inflicted
                    on the upper portion of the spinal cord, resulting in instant death. The
                    ordinary appearances of death from asphyxia may be found: dark fluid blood,
                    congestion of the brain, intensely congested lungs, the right cavities of the
                    heart full, and the left comparatively empty of blood, and general engorgement
                    of the viscera. Ecchymosis may he found beneath the site of the cord, or a mere
                    parchmenty appearance. There may even be no mark of the cord visible. The mark,
                    when present, usually follows an oblique course, and is high up the neck. The
                    fact that a body may be suspended after death, and that if this be done speedily
                    whilst the body is still warm there may be a <hi rend="italic">post-mortem</hi>
                    mark undistinguishable from the mark observed in death from hanging, must not be
                    forgotten. (3) <hi rend="italic">Suffocation</hi> may occur from the impaction
                    of any substance in the glottis, or by covering up the mouth and nose. It is
                    frequently of accidental origin, as when substances become accidentally impacted
                    in the throat, and when infants are overlaid. The phenomena are those of pure
                    asphyxia, which have already been detailed. On <hi rend="italic"
                    >post-mortem</hi> examination the surface of the lungs is found covered with
                    minute extravasations of blood, known as punctated ecchymosis. (4) <hi
                    rend="italic">Strangulation</hi> may be accomplished by drawing a cord tightly
                    round the neck, or by forcibly compressing the windpipe (throttling). Hence
                    there may be either a circular mark round the neck, not so oblique as after
                    hanging, or the marks of the fingers may be found about the region of the
                    larynx. The cartilaginous structures of the larynx and windpipe may be broken.
                    The mark of the ligature is often low down in the neck. The signs of asphyxia
                    are present in a marked degree. (5) <hi rend="italic">Mephitism.—</hi> Death
                    from the inhalation of irrespirable gases is a mode of assassination seldom
                    employed, but is frequently resorted to on the Continent by suicides, charcoal
                    fumes being commonly used for the purpose (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Poisons).</hi></p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Death from Starvation.—</hi> Cases occur in which it is
                    important to distinguish this from other modes of death. In such cases the skin
                    becomes harsh and dry, and may acquire a peculiar odour; the subcutaneous fat
                    disappears; the gums shrink away from the teeth; the tongue and mouth become
                    dark-coloured and dry; the eyes are bloodshot; the intestines become thin and
                    their coats translucent; the gall-bladder is distended. The period of total
                    abstinence from food required to kill an adult is unknown, and greatly depends
                    upon whether there be access to liquid. In some cases persons have .been able to
                    subsist on little or no nourishment for long periods, the body being in a state
                    of quasi-hibernation.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Death from Extremes of Temperature.—</hi> (1) Death from
                    cold is not often observed in the' British Isles. A portion only of the body, as
                    the extremity of a limb, may perish from extreme cold. After the first sensation
                    of tingling experienced on exposure to severe cold, loss of sensation
                    supervenes, with languor and an irresistible propensity to sleep. The tendency
                    to this forms an extreme danger in such cases. (2) Death from extreme heat
                    usually occurs in the form of burning and scalding, attended with destruction of
                    a large portion of the cutaneous structures. Here the cause of death is obvious.
                    The human body is capable of exposure to very hot air—as is seen in Turkish
                    baths—for a considerable period with impunity. Sun-stroke is a cerebral
                    affection brought on by too great exposure to a hot atmosphere, especially
                    whilst undergoing fatigue.</p>

                    an artificial electric current may cause instant death. No visible marks of the
                    effects of the electric current may be left, or the body may be singed or
                    discoloured, or the skin may be perforated at one or two spots.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Wounds.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The examination of
                    wounds, whether fatal or not, often becomes an important branch of forensic
                    medicine. Wounds are usually divided into <hi rend="italic">contused, lacerated,
                    incised, punctured,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gunshot</hi> wouuds. For poisoned
                    wounds see <hi rend="smallcaps">Poisons.</hi> Each kind of wound requires to be
                    minutely examined and described, as theyare in approved works on surgery. The
                    degree of danger from each should be familiar to the medical jurist; and he
                    should recollect that there is no wound which may not become incidentally fatal
                    from improper treatment, peculiarities of constitution, or accidental
                    inoculation with septic material. Punctured wounds or stabs require minute
                    attention; for there have been instances in which death has been produced by an
                    instrument so small as a pin thrust into a vital part. <hi rend="italic">Wounds
                    of the</hi><hi rend="italic">head</hi> are always dangerous, especially if the
                    blow has been severe. The person so wounded may die without division of the
                    skin, or fracture of the bones, as happens in what is known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >concussion</hi> of the brain. Contusions which do not divide the skin may
                    fracture the skull; or the inner table of the skull may be fractured without the
                    outer being broken or depressed. Even wounds of the scalp may prove fatal, from
                    inflammation extending towards the brain. Punctured wounds of the head are more
                    dangerous than cuts, as more likely to excite fatal inflammation. When the brain
                    and its membranes are injured, all such wounds are generally fatal. Wounds of
                    the face or organs of sense are often dangerous, always disfiguring, and
                    productive of serious inconvenience, <hi rend="italic">W</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ounds of</hi><hi rend="italic">the</hi><hi rend="italic">neck</hi> are always
                    very serious wherever more than the skin is divided. The danger of opening large
                    blood-vessels, or wounding important nerves, is imminent; even the division of a
                    large vein in the neck has proved immediately fatal, from the entrance of air
                    into the vessel, and its speedy conveyance to the heart. A blow on the neck has
                    instantly proved fatal, from injury to an important nerve, generally the
                    pneumogastric or the sympathetic. Dislocations and fractures of the bones of the
                    neck prove instantly fatal. <hi rend="italic">Wounds</hi><hi rend="italic">of
                    the chest</hi> are always serious when the cavity is penetrated, though persons
                    may recover from wounds of the lungs, and have even survived for some time
                    considerable wounds of the heart. This last is an important fact; because we are
                    not always to consider the spot where the body of a person killed by a wound of
                    the heart, and apparently remaining where he fell, is found as that in which the
                    fatal wound was inflicted. Instances have occurred of persons surviving severe
                    wounds of the heart for several days. Broken ribs are never without danger; and
                    the same may be said of severe contusions of the chest, from the chance of
                    inflammation extending inwards. Wounds penetrating both sides of the chest are
                    generally considered as fatal; but possibly there may be recovery from such. <hi
                    rend="italic">Wounds of the abdomen,</hi> when they do not completely penetrate,
                    may be considered as simple wounds, unless when inflicted with great force, so
                    as to bruise the contents of the abdominal cavity; in that case they may produce
                    death without breach of surface, from rupture of some viscus, as sometimes
                    happens from blows or kicks upon the belly. Wounds injuring the peritoneum are
                    highly perilous, from the risk of severe inflammation. Wounds of the stomach or
                    intestines, or of the gall-bladder, generally prove mortal, from the effusion of
                    their contents into the peritoneal cavity producing fatal inflammation. Wounds
                    of the liver, spleen, or kidneys are generally soon mortal, from the great
                    vascularity of those organs. Wounds of the extremities, when fatal, may
                    generally be considered so from excessive haemorrhage, from the consequences of
                    inflammation and gangrene, or from the shock to the system when large portions
                    of the limb are forcibly removed, as in accidents from machinery, and in wounds
                    from firearms.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Poisonous</hi><hi rend="italic">Food.—</hi> Under certain
                    conditions, various articles of diet, especially butcher meat, eggs, milk,
                    butter, cheese, and honey, may become possessed of poisonous properties, and
                    this may arise from a variety of causes besides the introduction of known and
                    specific poisons. Moreover, certain kinds of animal food—fish chiefly —may have
                    definite toxic properties. Food may be more or less poisonous—(1) from
                    unsoundness, either from putridity or decomposition or disease; (2) from the
                    presence of parasites(3) from mouldiness, or presence of deleterious microscopic
                    fungi; and (4) where the flesh is that of animals which have fed on noxious
                    plants, —and under this head may also be classed poisonous honey, which bees
                    have gathered from poisonous plants, G <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> &gt;) It
                    may be of the nature of poisonous fish, using the term fish in the popular
                    sense. (6) Certain fungi or mushrooms are poisonous. Parasitic diseases would,
                    strictly speaking, come under the first head; but the preventive<pb break="no"

                    infested with parasites will alone be treated of in this place.</p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Poisonous Vegetables.—</hi> Unsound or even rotten
                    vegetables and fruits may be consumed, and become fertile sources of varied
                    forms of poisoning, especially in hot summers. The symptoms produced by the
                    ingestion of large quantities of unsound fruit or vegetables are of a diarrhoeal
                    character, not often of an alarming severity, except in the cases of the young
                    and feeble. They may, however, sometimes attain a fatal severity. The cause is
                    usually obvious, anil the treatment is simple; mild purgatives, as rhubarb or
                    castor oil, with or followed by opiates, to remove peccant matters from the
                    intestines; <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> and stimulants, as ammonia or alcohol,
                    if there be much collapse. Certain fungi or mushrooms are known to be
                    specifically poisonous, such as the <hi rend="italic">Amanita</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">muscaria,</hi> or fly-fungus, and others. Certain kinds of
                    mushrooms, usually innocuous, are occasionally poisonous or deleterious; and.
                    the cause of this is not always clear. Poisonous fungi produce narcotic and
                    irritant symptoms.</p>
                <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Poisonous, Tainted, or Putrid Meat.—</hi> The obvious
                    characteristics of good sound flesh meat are that its colour is red—neither pale
                    pink nor deep purple; that it is marbled in appearance; firm and elastic to the
                    touch, scarcely moistening the fingers; having a slight and not unpleasant
                    odour; and that when exposed to the air for a day or two it should neither
                    become dry on the surface nor wet and sodden. Sound meat is acid to litmus
                    paper; unsound meat may be neutral or alkaline. Meat may be tainted with physic
                    administered to the animal. It is a common practice, when a fat and valuable
                    animal is unwell, to physic it, and if its recovery be not speedy to slaughter
                    it. The meat of such animals may often be met with in our markets, and may
                    induce illness from the physic with which it is contaminated. The effects of
                    simple putridity are most varied. It is well known that some nations habitually
                    eat putrid meat, and even prefer it to fresh; and the development of rottenness
                    in eggs for the epicure is an art in China. There is no doubt that habit has
                    much to do with the tolerance by the stomach of putrid meat, whether cooked or
                    uncooked. But tainted game, and indeed all kinds of meat in which putrefaction
                    has commenced, may indubitably produce disease. This is chiefly of a diarrhoeal
                    character, preceded by rigors, and attended with collapse and, it may be,
                    convulsions and other signs of a profound affection of the nervous system. The
                    effects of such tainted meat are slight as compared with those which are
                    produced by the sausage-poison, developed by a sort of modified putrefaction in
                    certain German sausages. These sausages, when they become musty and soft in
                    their interior, nauseous in odour and flavour, and strongly acid to test paper,
                    acquire a highly poisonous character, and are frequently fatal in their effects.
                    The symptoms produced by the use of poisonous flesh are gastric pain, vomiting,
                    diarrhoea, depression, coldness of the limbs, and weak irregular action of the
                    heart. Fatal cases end in convulsions and oppressed respiration, death ensuing
                    from the third to the eighth day. The nature of the sausage-poison, which is
                    probably akin to that of putrid and indeed all non-specifically tainted meats,
                    has been a matter of considerable controversy. Some have held that the poisonous
                    action is due to the development of rancid fatty acids; others believe that a
                    so-called catalytic body is produced, capable of setting up by contact a similar
                    catalytic action. Others have regarded the sausage-poison as due to the
                    formation of pyrogeneous acids during the drying or smoking of the sausages. The
                    recent discovery by Selmi of a class of poisonous alkaloids or amides, termed
                    <hi rend="italic">ptomaines,</hi> developed during putrefaction of animal
                    matters, on the one hand, and the discovery by Ballard and Klein, still more
                    recently, that the fatally poisonous properties of hams prepared according to
                    the American method may be due to the presehce of a parasitic bacillus, point to
                    one or other of these two latter causes as that of the effects of
                    sausage-poison. Others again have referred the effects to the presence of a
                    microscopic fungus— <hi rend="italic">Sarcina</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >botulina.</hi></p>
                <p>The poisonous nature of the flesh of animals which have fed on certain plants—for
                    example, hares which have fed on certain species of rhododendron, pheasants on
                    the kalmia shrub, &amp;c.—has been abundantly demonstrated, and need only be
                    referred to here. The honey from bees which have garnered on poisonous plants,
                    as the azalea, may likewise be deleterious; and the fact is of classic interest.
                    The milk even of goats which have browsed on poisonous herbs has also proved
                    poisonous.</p>
                <p>(3) <hi rend="italic">Diseased Meat.—</hi> The poisonous effects of meat affected
                    with certain parasites—trichinae, cysticerci, trematodes, &amp;c., is an
                    undoubted fact. Great quantities of meat pass through our markets which is
                    undoubtedly the flesh of animals affected with disease, such as foot-and-mouth
                    disease, pleuro-pneumonia, pig typhoid, the so-called scarlatina of swine,
                    sheep-pox, &amp;c.; and the question is quite undecided as to whether such flesh
                    produces any injurious effects. To stop the sale of such meat would be to cut
                    off large sources of our meat supplies. The evils attending the use of such
                    diseased meat, when well cooked, have undoubtedly been exaggerated; but, on the
                    other hand, there is enough evidence to show that the use of certain kinds of
                    diseased meat may be followed by serious results. Thus it is generally admitted
                    that the flesh of animals which have suffered from pleuro-pneumonia and murrain
                    will give rise to boils and carbuncles. Braxy mutton may also produce disease
                    when eaten. Trichinae will produce trichinosis, flukes, the tape-worm, &amp;c.
                    Hams are occasionally fatally poisonous; and this has been traced to the
                    presence of.certain low organisms known as <hi rend="italic">bacilli.</hi></p>
                <p>(4) <hi rend="italic">Poisonous Fish.—</hi> Fish is sometimes a poisonous article
                    of food. Cases of poisoning by the so-called shell-fish of the British islands
                    are not unfrequently met with. Generally it is the eating of crabs, lobsters,
                    and mussels which produces such results. These are usually of a distressing
                    rather than of a serious character, nettle-rash being a common symptom.
                    Occasionally, however, fatal results have ensued from the use of mussels. In
                    tropical seas poisonous fish are more plentiful—the golden sardine, the bladder
                    fish, the grey snapper, &amp;c.; and, these being eaten by larger fish, as the
                    barracuda, perch, globe-fish, conger eel, &amp;c., the latter may in turn become
                    poisonous.</p>
                <p>Good cookery, that is, exposure to a sufficiently high temperature for a
                    sufficiently lengthened time, is undoubtedly the best measure to adopt short of
                    absolute destruction of unsound and diseased meat. Sö long as meat is
                    high-priced, and the effects of diseased meat so little understood and so
                    undefined, it will be impossible to induce medical officers of health and
                    sanitary inspectors to seize all the diseased and unsound meat which is daily
                    offered for sale. Notwithstanding all that has been said to the contrary,
                    experienced observers are pretty well agreed that thorough exposure of the meat
                    throughout to the temperature at which albumen is coagulated is destructive to
                    the parasites of flesh. Smoking is less effective. Salting is more effective
                    than smoking; but there is some evidence to show that salting may merely hold
                    the life of organisms in suspense without entirely destroying their vitality;
                    and thus in the conversion of salted pork into hams—a process of re-salting and
                    subsequent drying—the specific germ (a bacillus) has been known to be again
                    rendered harmful. It is not known whether efficient cooking entirely removes the
                    deleterious effects of flesh affected with other than parasitic disease, as for
                    example pleuro-pneumonia.</p>
                <p>The curative measures for the results of eating poisonous food cannot be
                    specifically described. They are those which must be arrived at on general
                    principles. Symptoms are to be treated, and the powers of the patient sustained
                    until the deleterious matter is removed by the ordinary channels, or the
                    trichinae have become encysted.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">History of Forensic Medicine.</hi></p>
                <p>The true origin of medical jurisprudence is of comparatively recent date,
                    although traces of its principles may be perceived in remote times. Among the
                    ancient Greeks the principles of medical science appear only to have been
                    applied to legislation in certain questions relating to legitimacy. In the
                    writings of Galen we find, however, remarks on the differences between the
                    foetal and the adult lungs; he also treats of the legitimacy of seven months’
                    children, and discusses feigned .diseases. Turning to Rome, we find that the
                    laws of the Twelve Tables fix three hundred days as the extreme duration of
                    utero-gestation. It is doubtful whether the Roman law authorized medical
                    inspections of dead bodies. In the code of Justinian we find <hi rend="italic"

                    of a recognized connexion between medicine and law. It was not, however, by the
                    testimony of living medical witnesses that such questions were to be settled,
                    but on the authority of Hippocrates.</p>
                <p>Medical jurisprudence, as a science, dates only from the 16th century. In 1507
                    the bishop of Bamberg introduced a penal code in which the necessity of medical
                    evidence in certain cases was recognized; and in 1532 the emperor Charles V.
                    persuaded the diet of Ratisbon to adopt an uniform code of German penal
                    jurisprudence, in which the civil magistrate was enjoined in all cases of doubt
                    or difficulty to obtain the evidence of medical witnesses,—as in cases of
                    personal injuries, infanticide, pretended pregnancy, simulated diseases, and
                    poisoning. The true dawn of forensic medicine dates, however, from the
                    publication in 1553 of the <hi rend="italic">Constitutio Criminalis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Carolina</hi> in Germany. A few years later Weiher, a physician,
                    having undertaken to prove that witches and demoniacs are, in fact, persons
                    subject to hypochondriasis and hysteria, and should not be punished, aroused
                    popular indignation, and was with difficulty rescued from the flames by his
                    patron, William duke of Cleves.</p>
                <p>At the close of the 16th century Ambrose Paré· wrote on monsters, on simulated
                    diseases, and on the art of drawing up medico-legal reports; Pineau also
                    published his treatise on virginity and defloration. About the same time as
                    these stimuli to the study of forensic medicine were being made known in Paris,
                    the first systematic treatise on the science appeared in Sicily in the form of a
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Relationibus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Medicorum</hi> by Fidele. Paulo Zacchia, the illustrious Roman
                    medical jurist, moreover, published from 1621 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n814/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0814-0783"/> to 1635 a work entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quaestiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Medico-Legales,</hi> which marks a new era in
                    the history of the science,—·a work which displays an immense amount of learning
                    and sagacity in an age when chemistry was in its infancy, and physiology very
                    imperfectly understood. The discovery of the circulation of the blood by Harvey
                    soon followed, and gave a new impetus to the study of those branches of forensic
                    medicine having direct relations to physiology; and to Harvey we owe the idea
                    how to apply Galen’s observations on the differences between the foetal and the
                    adult lungs to the elucidation of cases of supposed infanticide. About this
                    time, too, Sebiz published two treatises, on the signs of virginity and on the
                    examination of wounds respectively. In the former he contended that the hymen
                    was the real mark of virginity; but this was denied by Augenio and Gassendi. In
                    1663 Bartholin, a Danish physician, investigated the period of human uterine
                    gestation, a subject which had engaged the attention of Aristotle. He also
                    proposed the “hydrostatic test” for the determination of live-birth—a test still
                    in use, and applied by observing whether the lungs of an infant float or sink in
                    water. Swammerdam explained the rationale of the process in 1677; but it was not
                    till 1682 that it was first practically applied by Jan Schreyer.</p>
                <p>Germany, ever the leader in questions of forensic medicine, introduced the first
                    public lectures on medical jurisprudence. Michaelis gave the first course about
                    the middle of the 17th century in the university of Leipsic; and these were
                    followed by the lectures of Bohn, who also published <hi rend="italic">De
                    Renunciatione</hi><hi rend="italic">Vulnerum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cui accesserunt Dissertationes</hi><hi rend="italic">binae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de partu enecato, et an quis vivus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >morhιusve</hi><hi rend="italic">aquis submersus, strangulatus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aid</hi><hi rend="italic">vulneratus fuerit,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">De Officiis Medici Duplicis, Clinici et Forensis.</hi> Welsch and
                    Amman wrote on the fatality of wounds, and Licetus. on monsters.</p>
                <p>From the time of Ambrose Paré the mode of conducting investigations in forensic
                    medicine had attracted attention in France; and in 1603 Henry IV. authorized his
                    physician to appoint persons skilled in medicine and surgery to make
                    medico-legal inspections and reports in all cities and royal jurisdictions; in
                    1692, difficulties having arisen, Louis XIV. created hereditary royal physicians
                    and surgeons for the performance of like duties. These, having become a corrupt
                    and venal body, were suppressed in 1790. The only works on forensic medicine
                    which appeared in France during the 17th century, however, were Gendry’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Sur les Moyens de bien rapporter à</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Justice,</hi> and Blégny’s <hi rend="italic">Doctrine</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Rapports en Chirurgie.</hi> At the beginning of the 18th century the latter was
                    superseded as a text-book by Devaux’s <hi rend="italic">I.'art de faire</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des rapports</hi><hi rend="italic">en Chirurgie.</hi> Valentini
                    followed with two works, which were finally incorporated in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Corpus Juris Medico-Legale</hi> which appeared in 1722. This work
                    is a vast storehouse of medico-legal information, and a summary of the knowledge
                    of the time.</p>
                <p>Professorships for teaching the subject were founded in the German universities
                    early in the 18th century, and numerous treatises on forensic medicine were
                    published. Teichmeyer’s <hi rend="italic">Institutiones</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Medidnae</hi><hi rend="italic">Legalis</hi> long formed the text-book of the
                    subject; and Alberti, professor of legal medicine at Halle, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Systema</hi> gave to the world a most complete and laborious
                    treatise on the science. His industrious collection of facts renders his works a
                    precious mine of information. Indeed towards the close of last century the
                    Germans were ' almost the only cultivators of legal medicine. But in France the
                    celebrated case of Villeblanche attracted attention to the subject, and called
                    forth Louis, who in a memoir on utero-gestation attacked with powerful arguments
                    the pretended instances of protracted pregnancy, and paved the way for the
                    adoption in the <hi rend="italic">Code</hi><hi rend="italic">Napoléon</hi> of
                    three hundred days as the limit of utero-gestation, a period in precise
                    accordance with the ancient Roman law of the Twelve Tables. Louis also wrote on
                    death from hanging, and pointed out the mode by which we may distinguish murder
                    from suicide under such circumstances. It is he who is credited with having been
                    the first in France to publicly teach the just application of medical knowledge
                    to jurisprudence. Foderé’s celebrated <hi rend="italic">Traité de Médecine
                    Légale</hi> appeared in 1798, and marks a new era in the annals of legal
                    medicine.</p>
                <p>No British author wrote systematically on forensic medicine till 1788, when Dr
                    Samuel Farr published a short treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Elements of
                    Medical Jurisprudence</hi>; but this was merely an abridgment of an earlier work
                    of Fazelius. Previous writers, as Mead, Munro, Denman, Percival, and the two
                    Hunters, had, however, dealt with fragments of the subject; nevertheless the
                    science as a whole was little appreciated or recognized in this country during
                    the last century.</p>
                <p>In the present century France took the lead; and the institution of three
                    professorships of forensic medicine at the end of the 18th century produced
                    excellent fruits. In 1814 Orfila, a Spaniard by birth, but naturalized in
                    France, published his <hi rend="italic">Toxicologie,</hi> a work which
                    revolutionized this branch of medical jurisprudence, and first placed the
                    knowledge of poisons upon a scientific basis. Since the time of Orfila, France
                    has never ceased to have one or more living medical jurists, among the most
                    recent of whom we must enumerate Tardieu, whose treatises on abortion, on
                    poisons, on wounds,</p>
                <p>&amp;c., are justly celebrated. Germany too has industriously pursued the
                    subject, and Casper’s great work on forensic medicine will ever remain a classic
                    in the science. In Russia Dragendorff has greatly contributed to our knowledge
                    of poisons.</p>
                <p>Though forensic medicine may be said to have been entirely neglected in England
                    till the beginning of the present century, its progress has since been by no
                    means slow or unimportant; and the subject now forms a recognized and obligatory
                    portion of medical study. The first lectures delivered in Great Britain were
                    given in the university of Edinburgh in 1801 by the elder Dr Dunean; and the
                    first professorship was held by his son in 1803. Dr Alfred Swaine Taylor gave
                    the first course of lectures delivered in England, at Guy s Hospital in 1831;
                    and in 1863 the university of London made forensic medicine a separate subject
                    for examination and honours for medical graduates. In 1822 there was not in the
                    English language any treatise of authority either on medical jurisprudence or on
                    any important division of the subject; for it was not till the following year
                    that the useful compendium of Paris and Fonblanque was published; and even half
                    a century ago medical jurisprudence may be said to have been almost in its
                    infancy as compared with what it is now. Since 1829 Great Britain has produced
                    an abundant crop of literature on forensic medicine. Sir Robert Christison’s
                    admirable treatise on <hi rend="italic">Toxicology,</hi> Dr A. S. Taylor’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Principles and Practice of Medical Jurisprudence,</hi> the same
                    author’s <hi rend="italic">Elements of Medical Jurisprudence,</hi> Dr Guy’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Forensic Medicine,</hi> and Ogston’s <hi rend="italic">Lectures on
                    Medical Jurisprudence</hi> are well-known and widely circulated works. The
                    separate memoirs of Taylor, Christison, Guy, and others are also storehouses of
                    facts and deductions in the science.</p>
                <p>America, too, has not been behind hand in the race. Wharton and Stillé’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Manual</hi> and Wormley’s <hi rend="italic">Toxicology</hi> are
                    the best-known works of American authors. - (T. S.*)</p>
