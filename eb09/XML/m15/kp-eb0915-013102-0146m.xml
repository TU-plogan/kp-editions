                <p>of four principal streets, which meet in the market-place, and within the last
                    twenty years has undergone great improvements. The old church of St Michael, on
                    the brow of the hill, was founded by Eleanor, queen of Edward I., in 1278, and
                    in 1740 was partly rebuilt and greatly enlarged. The lofty steeple by which its
                    massive tower was formerly surmounted was battered down by the parliamentary
                    forces during the civil war. Connected with the church there are two chapels,
                    one of which, Rivers Chapel, belonged to a college of secular priests founded in
                    1501 by Thomas Savage, afterwards archbishop of York. Both the church and
                    chapels contain several ancient monuments. For the free grammar school,
                    originally founded in 1502 by Sir John Percival, and refounded in 1552 by Edward
                    VI., a new building was erected in 1856 at a cost of £3000. A commercial school
                    was erected in 1840 out of the funds of the grammar school. Among the other
                    public buildings are the town hall in the Grecian style (1823-24), with a new
                    frontage (1869-70), the union workhouse (1843-44), the county lunatic asylum
                    (1868-71), and the infirmary (1872). The neighbouring castle of the duke of
                    Buckingham was the residence of Duke Humphrey in the 15th century. Originally
                    the trade of Macclesfield was principally in twist and silk buttons, but this
                    has been completely superseded by the manufacture of all kinds of silk. The
                    first mill for silk-throwing was opened in 1756, and the manufacture of broad
                    silks was introduced in 1790. Besides this staple trade, there are various
                    textile manufactures and extensive breweries. The population of the municipal
                    borough (3235 acres) in 1871 was 35,540, and of the parliamentary borough (3272
                    acres) 35,570. In 1881 the numbers were 37,514 and 37,620.</p>
                <p>Previous to the Conquest, Macclesfield constituted a portion of the royal demesne
                    of the earls of Mercia. At Domesday it was included in the earldom of Chester,
                    and after the abolition of that jurisdiction it relapsed to the crown. In 1261
                    it was made a borough, and in 1678 it obtained incorporation from Charles II. It
                    has returned two members to parliament since the first Reform Act, and its
                    boundary was enlarged in 1868.</p>

                    died in London, October 17, 1873. He was the posthumous son of one of
                    Abercrombie’s captains, and spent his childhood under the care of his godfather,
                    General Le Mesurier, hereditary governor of Alderney. Schooled in Arctic
                    exploration by his service under Captain Back on board the “Terror,” he was
                    first lieutenant of the “Enterprise” during the Franklin search expedition
                    (1848-49), and in 1850 was placed in command of the expedition which, battling
                    with the frozen sea for four years, succeeded in passing from ocean to ocean to
                    the north of the American continent. M*Clure was knighted on bis return, and
                    received gold medals from the English and the French geographical societies.
                    During the Canadian insurrections of 1836-38 he had performed some gallant
                    exploits on the lakes,—on one occasion, in the eagerness of pursuit, infringing
                    the territory of the United States; and between 1856 and 1861 he rendered good
                    service in the Chinese war at the storming of Canton, &amp;c. His latter years
                    were spent in a quiet country life. He was appointed Commander of the Bath in
                    1859, and had attained the rank of vice-admiral on the retired list. See Admiral

                    in Berwickshire, Scotland, November 1772. He studied in Edinburgh University,
                    and thereafter in the divinity hall at Whitburn. In 1796 he was ordained
                    minister of the Second Associate Congregation, Edinburgh, the place of worship
                    being in the Potterrow.</p>
                <p>At an early period in its history the Secession Church in Scotland had been
                    divided by a controversy about the burgess oath into Burghers and Antiburghers;
                    but towards the close of the century the Antiburgher Synod, to which M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 4</hi> Crie belonged, showed symptoms of a disposition to
                    qualify adherence to the subordinate standards of the Church of Scotland on such
                    points as the magistrate’s power <hi rend="italic">circa sacra</hi> and national
                    covenanting, and a new historical manifesto was prepared called <hi
                    rend="italic">The Narrative and Testimony,</hi> which was adopted as a term of
                    communion by the general synod in 1804. M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Crie
                    was one of those who protested against this departure, as they deemed it, from
                    Secession principles, and, declining to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the
                    synod, constituted themselves into a presbytery under the name of “The
                    Constitutional Associate Presbytery.” M‘Crie was in consequence deposed by the
                    Associate Synod, and his congregation withdrew with him to a place of worship in
                    the south side of the town, in which he officiated to the close of his life.</p>
                <p>From the time of his settlement in Edinburgh, M'Crie devoted himself to
                    historical investigations into the history, constitution, and polity of the
                    churches of the Reformation; and the first ripe fruits of his study were given
                    to the public in November 1811 in the form of <hi rend="italic">The Life of John
                    Knox, containing illustrations of the History of the Reformation in
                    Scotland,</hi> which procured for the author the degree of D.D. from his alma
                    mater, an honour conferred then for the first time upon a Scottish dissenting
                    minister. At the solicitation of his friend Andrew Thomson, M‘Crie became a
                    contributor to <hi rend="italic">The Edinburgh Christian Instructor,</hi> and in
                    three successive numbers for 1817 he subjected Sir W. Scott’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tales of my Landlord</hi> to a criticism which took the form of a <hi
                    rend="italic">Vindication of the Covenanters.</hi> Preserving the continuity of
                    his historical studies, he followed up his first work with <hi rend="italic">The
                    Life of Andrew Melville,</hi> 1819. Negotiations for union between the Burghers
                    and Antiburghers resulted, in 1820, in the formation of the United Secession
                    Synod, and called forth from Dr M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Crie <hi

                    their Removal,</hi> in which what he considered to be the fallacious and
                    unscriptural character of the plan for union adopted by the United Synod is
                    pointed out. Several of his former brethren among the Antiburghers, dissatisfied
                    with the union of 1820, had formed themselves into a separate synod, and between
                    these and the Constitutional Presbytery a union was formed in 1827, the uniting
                    bodies assuming the name of the Associate Synod of Original Seceders, of which
                    branch of the Secession in Scotland M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Crie
                    continued through the rest of his life the best known representative. In 1827 he
                    published a <hi rend="italic">History of the Progress and Suppression of the
                    Reformation in Italy in the</hi> 16tΛ <hi rend="italic">century,</hi> and in
                    1829 a similar <hi rend="italic">History of the Reformation in Spain.</hi></p>
                <p>Great as was his absorption in historical research, it did not prevent his taking
                    a lively interest in the leading questions of the day; in pamphlets and on the
                    platform he maintained his convictions, not always popular, on such matters as
                    Greek independence, Catholic emancipation, the “Marrow” and “Voluntary”
                    controversies, Irish education, and church patronage. His evidence on the
                    last-named matter before a committee of the House of Commons is contained in the
                    parliamentary publications of 1834.</p>

                    life of John Calvin. Although he had been gathering material for this project
                    for several years, it was not till a late period of his life that, stimulated by
                    the assistance of his son John, then in Geneva, he seriously addressed himself
                    to the task. Only three chapters of the work were completed when the writer was
                    struck down by apoplexy. He died on the 5th of August 1835.</p>
