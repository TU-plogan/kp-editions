                <p><label type="entry">MANIPUR</label>, a native state in north-eastern India, lying
                    between 24° 35' and 24-° 48' 30'' N. lat., and between 93° and 94° 40' E. long.,
                    is bounded on the N. by the Nâga country and the hills overlooking the Assam
                    valley, on the W. by Câchâr district, and on the E. by Independent Burmah. On
                    the south the boundary is undefined, and abuts on the country inhabited by
                    various independent wild hill tribes of Lushais, Kukis, Ac. The state consists
                    of an extensive valley, estimated at about 650 square miles in extent, and a
                    large surrounding unsurveyed tract of difficult mountainous country stretching
                    between Assam, Câchâr, Burmah, and Chittagong. The total area is estimated at
                    about 7600 square miles. The population of the Manipur valley and the
                    surrounding hills is supposed to be about 74,000 hill-men and 65,000 Manipuris.
                    The hill ranges generally run north and south, with occasional connecting spurs
                    and ridges of lower elevation between. Their greatest altitude is in the north,
                    where they reach to upwards of 8000 feet above sea-level. The principal
                    geographical feature in the valley is the Logtak Lake, an irregular sheet of
                    water of considerable size, but said to be yearly growing smaller. The valley is
                    watered by numerous rivers, the Bârak being the most important. The hills are
                    densely clothed with tree jungle and large forest timber. There are large herds
                    of wild elephants* as well as tigers, leopards, bears, buffaloes, Ac. The
                    country seems to be singularly free from poisonous snakes; the cobra does not
                    appear to exist in the valley, but the boa constrictor is found in the dense
                    forests to the south.</p>
                <p>The first relations of the British with Manipur date from 1762, when the raja
                    solicited British aid to repel a Burmese invasion, and a treaty was entered
                    into. The force was recalled, and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0513-0490"/> but little communication between the two
                    countries took place until 1824, on the outbreak of the first British Burmese
                    war. British assistance was again invoked by the raja, and the Burmese were
                    finally expelled both from the Assam and Manipur valleys. A political agent acts
                    as a means of communication between the state and the British Government.
                    Manipur valley appears to have been originally occupied by several tribes which
                    came from different directions. Although their general facial characteristics
                    are Mongolian, there is a great diversity of feature among the Manipuris, some
                    of them showing a regularity approaching the Aryan type. I⅛ the valley the
                    people are chiefly Hindus, that religion being apparently of recent
                    introduction. They have a caste system of their own, different from that of
                    India, and chiefly founded on what is known as the system of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ΙαΙΙύρ</hi> or forced labour. Every male between the ages of seventeen and
                    sixty is obliged to place his services at the disposal of the state for a
                    certain number of days each year, and to different classes of the people
                    different employments are assigned. About four hundred Mohammedan families,
                    descendants of settlers from Bengal, reside to the east of the capital. The
                    aboriginal hill-men belong to one of the two great divisions of Nâgas and Kukis,
                    and are subdivided into innumerable clans and sections with slight differences
                    in language, customs, or dress. The state is noted for the excellence of its
                    breed of ponies. The now popular English game of polo was introduced from
                    Manipur, where it forms a great national pastime. The trade is but small, owing
                    chiefly to the want of means of transport, none of the roads being available for
                    wheeled carts.</p>
