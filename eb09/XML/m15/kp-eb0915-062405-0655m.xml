                <p><label type="entry">MATCHES</label>. Till the close of the 18th century flint and
                    steel with tinder box and sulphur-tipped splints of wood—“spunks”or matches—were
                    the common means of obtaining fire for domestic and other purposes. The sparks
                    struck off by the percussion of flint and steel were made to <pb break="no"

                    carbonized fragments of cotton and linen; the entire mass of the tinder was set
                    into a glow, developing sufficient heat to ignite the sulphur with which the
                    matches were tipped, and thereby the splints themselves were set on fire.
                    Instead of tinder, match-paper or touch-paper, a thick bibulous paper
                    impregnated with saltpetre (nitrate of potash), and amadou or German tinder, a
                    thick leathery and porous preparation from the fungus <hi rend="italic"

                <p>It was not till 1805 that any attempt was made to use chemical agency for the
                    ordinary production of fire. In that year Μ. Chancel, assistant to Professor
                    Thenard of Paris, introduced an apparatus consisting of a small bottle
                    containing asbestos, saturated with strong sulphuric acid, with splints or
                    matches coated with sulphur, and tipped with a mixture of chlorate of potash and
                    sugar. The matches so prepared, when brought into contact with the sulphuric
                    acid in the bottle, ignited, and thus, by chemical action, fire was produced. It
                    appears also that in the same year phosphorus matches were known in Paris, and
                    in 1809 Derepas proposed to lessen the dangerously great inflammability of the
                    phosphorus match by making an igniting mixture of that element with magnesia. It
                    is also said that Μ. Derosne made a friction match with a phosphorus tip in
                    1816. Again in 1823 a phosphorus match was proposed, but it came into little
                    use. In this case the composition consisted of equal parts of phosphorus and
                    sulphur cautiously melted together in a glass tube. The tube w as then securely
                    corked, and, to obtain a light, a splint was introduced into the mixture, and a
                    small pellet detached, which on withdrawal and exposure almost spontaneously
                    ignited. In that year (1823) a decided impetus was given to the artificial
                    evolution of fire by the introduction of the Döbereiner lamp, so called after
                    its inventor Professor Döbereiner of Jena. The action of this elegant invention
                    depends on the remarkable property possessed by spongy or highly porous platinum
                    of determining the combination of hydrogen and oxygen and the formation of water
                    at common atmospheric temperatures. In the Döbereiner lamp hydrogen is evolved
                    in a suitable vessel by the action of zinc on acidulated w ater. The gas so
                    liberated, w hen required, is passed through a fine orifice by means of a
                    stop-cock, and impinging on a mass of spongy platinum mounted in a frame it
                    combines with oxygen of the air, thereby developing an intense heat, which
                    quickly causes the platinum to glow, and ultimately is sufficiently intense to
                    set the stream of hydrogen itself on fire. The Döbereiner lamp is still
                    occasionally seen, but it is chiefly used in connexion with chemical
                    lectures.</p>
                <p>The first really practical friction matches were made in England in 1827, by Mr
                    John Walker, a druggist of Stockton-on-Tees. These were known as “Congreves”
                    after Sir William Congreve, Bart., the inventor of the Congreve rocket, and
                    consisted of wooden splints or sticks of cardboard coated with sulphur and
                    tipped with a mixture of sulphide of antimony, chlorate of potash, and gum. With
                    each box of eighty-four, which was retailed at a shilling, there was supplied a
                    folded piece of glass paper, the folds of which were to be tightly pressed
                    together, while the match was drawn through between them. In 1830 the so-called
                    “Prometheans” were patented by Mr S. Jones of London. These consisted of a short
                    roll of paper with a small quantity of a mixture of chlorate of potash and sugar
                    at one end, a thin glass globule of strong sulphuric acid being attached at the
                    same point. When the sulphuric acid was liberated by pinching the glass globule,
                    it acted on the mixed chlorate and sugar, producing fire.</p>
                <p>The phosphorus friction match of the present day was first introduced on a
                    commercial scale in 1833; and it appears to have been made almost simultaneously
                    in several distinct centres. The name most prominently connected with the early
                    stages of the invention is that of Presch el of Vienna, who in 1833 had a
                    factory in operation for making phosphorus matches, fusees, and amadou slips
                    tipped with igniting composition. At the same time also matches were being made
                    by Moldenhauer in Darmstadt; and for a long series of years Austria and the
                    South-German states were the principal centres of the new industry. Improvements
                    in the manufacture have been numerous; and the industry is now carried on with a
                    complete system of ingenious labour-saving machinery. The use of phosphorus as a
                    principal ingredient in the igniting mixture of matches has not been free from
                    very serious disadvantages. It is a deadly poison, the free dissemination of
                    which has led to many accidental deaths, and also to numerous cases of wilful
                    poisoning and suicides. Workers also who are exposed to phosphoric vapours are
                    subject to a peculiarly distressing disease which attacks the jaw, and
                    ultimately produces necrosis of the jawbone; it appears, however, that, with
                    scrupulous attention to ventilation and cleanliness, almost all risk of the
                    disease may be avoided. Strenuous efforts have been made by numerous inventors
                    to introduce matches having no phosphorus in their igniting mixture, but
                    hitherto with indifferent success. The most serious objections to the use of
                    phosphorus have, however, been overcome by the discovery of the modified
                    condition of that body known as red or amorphous phosphorus, made by Professor
                    Anton Von Schrötter of Vienna in 1845, and the utilization of that substance in
                    the now well-known “safety matches” invented by Lundström of Sweden in 1855, and
                    first manufactured in the United Kingdom by Bryant &amp; May of London. Red
                    phosphorus is, in itself, a perfectly innocuous substance, and no evil effects
                    arise from freely w orking the compositions of which it forms an ingredient. The
                    fact again that safety matches ignite only in exceptional circumstances on any
                    other than the prepared surfaces which accompany the box—which surfaces and not
                    the matches themselves contain the phosphorus required for ignition—makes them
                    much less liable to cause accidental fires than the kinds more commonly in
                    use.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufacture.—</hi> The operations carried on in a match factory
                    may be grouped under the four heads of preparing the splints, dipping the
                    matches, box-making, and filling. The varieties of wood principally used for
                    matches are poplar, aspen, yellow pine, and white pine. Splints are either round
                    or quadrangular, the former having been at one time exceedingly common, when
                    Austrian manufactures ruled the markets; but, now that Sweden is the principal
                    match-manufacturing country, matches are nearly all square in section. For
                    cutting square splints many ingenious machines have been devised, some of which,
                    worked by enginepower, can turn out from 15,000,000 to 17,000,000 splints per
                    day. In Sweden the manufacturers use principally aspen or cleangrained pine
                    wood, preferring sections 12 to 20 inches in diameter, newly felled and full of
                    sap. If dry, the wood must be, soaked before it is fit for the operations
                    through which it passes. The timber is cut into blocks about 15 inches
                    long—sufficient for seven matches—and being freed from bark it is fixed in a
                    special form of turning lathe, and by means of a fixed cutting tool acting on
                    its entire length a continuous veneer or band the thickness of a match is cut
                    off. With each revolution of the block the knife advances proportionately to the
                    thickness of the band cut off, and thus a uniformly thick slice is obtained
                    continuously. At the same time eight small knives cut the veneer into seven
                    separate bands each the length of a match, and thus in one operation seven long
                    ribbons of wood the length and thickness of a match are obtained. These ribbons
                    are next broken into lengths of from 6 to 7 feet, knotty pieces are removed, and
                    to cut them into single matches they are fed into a machine which acts somewhat
                    like a straw-chopper. From 120 to 140 bands are acted on in the apparatus, and a
                    ratchet arrangement feeds them forward the thickness of a match at each stroke
                    of the cutter, which thus cuts off 120 to 140 matches per stroke. Worked by hand
                    the machine delivers about 5,000,000 splints per day, and by power it can be run
                    to turn out double that number. The matches are next <pb break="no"

                    stove, and thereafter they are sifted in a kind of partitioned sieve to free
                    them from fragments and splinters. The sifting process also arranges all the
                    splints in parallel order and in uniform quantities, whereby they may be
                    conveniently bundled and prepared for the dipping which next follows. For the
                    dipping process it is necessary to keep each match free from contact with its
                    neighbour, and indeed allow it such a space that each may be fully coated and
                    yet there be no danger of the igniting composition clotting the heads into one
                    mass. To effect this the splints are by an ingenious machine separately arranged
                    at uniform intervals between the lathes of a dipping frame. The dipping frames
                    are made about 18 inches square, and are fitted with 44 movable lathes. Between
                    each pair of lathes 50 splints are inserted by the machine, and when tightened
                    up by screws each frame thus contains 44 × 50 = 2200 splints placed at regular
                    intervals, the heads of which are all on the same level. A single attendant can
                    place, by aid of the machine, about 1,250,000 matches in the dipping frames per
                    day. The dipping is done in a stove of masonry which contains three square
                    flat-bottomed shallow pans. In the first the splints are heated so as to
                    facilitate the absorption of paraffin; in the second their points are dipped
                    into molten paraffin scale; and in the third they receive their heads or tips of
                    igniting composition, that mixture being kept in a uniform thin stratum in the
                    pan, or in some cases it is supplied by an endless india-rubber belt which
                    revolves and dips into the composition. A skilful workman can dip from 3500 to
                    4000 frames, or about 8,000,000 matches, a day. The frames so dipped are
                    afterwards arranged in a heated apartment till the igniting composition is
                    dried, after which the matches are taken out and put up in boxes by hand.</p>
                <p>Match splints in the factories of the United Kingdom are generally cut in lengths
                    suitable for two matches, and dealt with in that form throughout. The
                    splint-cutting machine patented by John Jex Long of Glasgow in 1871 differs
                    essentially from the Swedish splint-making machinery above alluded to; it acts
                    on squared blocks two-match length, and is capable of producing up to 17,000,000
                    matches per day.</p>
                <p>The object of dipping in melted paraffin is, of course, to secure more ready
                    ignition of the wood. Sulphur was formerly employed for that purpose; and
                    enormous quantities of the cheaper matches made on the Continent and in America
                    continue to be sulphur dipped. The cheaper kinds are frequently “bundle dipped”
                    in the molten sulphur, after which their points are merely pressed against the
                    igniting composition.</p>
                <p>The chief element in the igniting mixture of ordinary matches is still common
                    phosphorus, combined with one or more other bodies which readily part with
                    oxygen under the influence of heat. Chief among these latter substances is
                    chlorate of potash, the body which causes the sharp explosive sound when a
                    common match is struck, and to the use of which there is a strong objection on
                    the Continent from the fear of explosions in dealing with the substance in large
                    quantities. The other oxygen-yielding bodies commonly found in matches are red
                    lead, nitrate of lead, bichromate of potash, and peroxide of manganese. The
                    proportions in which any of these bodies is present in various igniting
                    compositions are kept trade secrets; they vary greatly, as special regard must
                    be given to matches for damp climates, or for ocean transport, and to other
                    considerations. The igniting agents are made into a paste with glue or gum as an
                    adhesive agent, a little fine sand or powdered glass, and some colouring
                    ingredient such as cinnabar, smalt, magenta, or Prussian blue. Matches in which
                    amorphous phosphorus takes the place of the common variety, notwithstanding
                    several obvious advantages, have never come into general use. They were shown in
                    the Great Exhibition of 1851 by Bejl &amp; Black of London; and Foster &amp;
                    Warwa of Vienna, one of the earliest match-making firms, long continued to make
                    them, as did also Cogniet Père et Fils of Paris. As made by these and other
                    makers they were difficult to strike, requiring a special rough rubbing surface;
                    the head frequently broke away in the attempt to light them, and when they did
                    inflame it was with explosive violence and a loud spluttering noise. Dr Von
                    Schrötter, the discoverer of amorphous phosphorus, claims to have found a means
                    of preparing combinations of amorphous phosphorus with chlorate of potash and.
                    other oxygen-yielding compounds of all degrees of combustibility, and he states
                    that Hochstätter of Frankfort now manufactures matches with amorphous phosphorus
                    composition which may be ignited by rubbing on a cloth surface, which inflame
                    quietly, burn without smell or sparking, are not influenced by damp, and are
                    cheaper than common phosphorus matches. The use of amorphous phosphorus—but on
                    the rubbing surface only and not in the dipping composition (safety matches)—was
                    first suggested by Böttger, but it was not till a patent was secured by
                    Lundström in 1855 that the matches were brought into the market. According to J.
                    G. Gentele, the elements of the dipping mixture for the heads are—chlorate of
                    potash, 32 parts; bichromate of potash, 12; red lead, 32; sulphide of antimony,
                    24; and the ingredients of a suitable rubbing surface are eight parts of
                    amorphous phosphorus to nine of sulphide of antimony. There is no doubt,
                    however, that here too there is considerable diversity in the composition of the
                    mixtures. Igniting compositions entirely free from phosphorus depend for their
                    moderate degree of efficiency on the use of such agents as chlorate of potash,
                    sulphide of antimony, bichromate of potash, and red lead.</p>
                <p>“Vestas” are matches in which short pieces of “wax taper” are used in place of
                    wooden splints. The taper is prepared by drawing a series of wicks or strands of
                    twenty to thirty fine cotton threads through molten stearin, with some
                    proportion of paraffin. The wax quickly hardens on the threads, agglutinating
                    them to irregular hard strands, which are smoothed and rounded to the required
                    size by being drawn through iron plates perforated with holes the size of the
                    required taper. The tapers are cut to the match lengths, and set in dipping
                    frames by special machines. The making of vestas is an industry only second in
                    extent to the wooden match manufacture,—its headquarters being London,
                    Manchester, Marseilles, and the north of Italy. Fusees for the use of smokers
                    are made of strips of thick porous paper saturated with saltpetre and bichromate
                    of potash, and tipped with ordinary composition. They are now almost entirely
                    supplanted by vesuvians, which consist of large oval heads on both ends of a
                    round splint. These heads, made by repeated dipping, consist of a porous mixture
                    of charcoal, saltpetre, cascarilla or other scented bark, glass, and gum, and
                    they also are tipped with common igniting composition.</p>
                <p>Ordinary match boxes are made of thin veneers or skillets of wood the same as
                    used in splint making. The blocks used yield skillets the exact size of the box
                    or cover to be made, and the machine which shaves skillets off the block also
                    scores them along the lines by which they must be bent to form the box. The
                    folding, covering with paper, and labelling are operations performed by young
                    girls with remarkable rapidity. In dealing with double splints, the matches are
                    at the boxing stage cut asunder in small bundles with a lever knife by the box
                    filler, who acquires such delicacy of perception that at each operation she
                    seizes and divides the exact quantity required to fill two boxes. A good hand
                    will in this way fill 35 to 40 gross of boxes per day.</p>
                <p>It is calculated that in the principal European countries from six to ten matches
                    are used for each inhabitant daily. There is no way by which an exact estimate
                    of the extent of the trade in the United Kingdom can be obtained; but competent
                    authorities believe the yearly value of the matches made to be not less than
                    £1,500,000, and that the makers turn out about 300,000,000 matches daily. Of all
                    the makers Messrs Bryant &amp; May are by far the most extensive; and next comes
                    the Bell &amp; Black company, formed of a combination of makers in London,
                    Glasgow, Manchester, and York. In France the right to manufacture matches is a
                    Government monopoly farmed to the <hi rend="italic">Compagnie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">générale des allumettes chimiques</hi> for an annual payment of
                    16,000,000 francs, with 6 centimes extra per hundred matches in excess of forty
                    milliards sold yearly. The company has concentrated the whole of the manufacture
                    into twelve establishments, the largest of which are at Marseilles. The effect
                    of the monopoly in France is that matches are very costly, and the average
                    consumption per head throughout the country is considerably less than in other
                    countries. Sweden is the country which in recent years has been most intimately
                    identified with the growth of the industry. In that country, including with it
                    Norway, there were in 1880 forty-three match factories, many of them large, that
                    of Jönköping being among the most extensive in the world. The quantity of
                    matches exported that year was about 19,000,000 lb (22,900,000 skal-punds),
                    probably representing 50,000,000,000 matches. The yearly exports have increased
                    four-fold since 1870, and are still rapidly extending. In Germany there are two
                    hundred and twelve factories, which are estimated to make yearly about
                    60,000,000,000 matches; and Austria-Hungary—the original seat and centre of the
                    manufacture— possesses one hundred and fifty establishments, whence large
                    quantities of matches are exported to Russia, Turkey, Asia Minor, and the
                    neighbouring states of Italy. Throughout Europe about 1200 tons of phosphorus
                    are annually consumed in the manufacture of matches, the greater proportion
                    being produced in England.</p>
                <p>In the United States a tax of 1 cent per box containing one hundred is levied on
                    matches manufactured in the country, in addition to which there is an <hi
                    rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> duty of 35 per cent, on all matches imported. The
                    internal revenue tax of a cent per box is subject to a reduction of 10 per cent,
                    to manufacturers, with an additional discount of 5 per cent, on the purchase of
                    the stamps used for the boxes when quantities exceeding in value $50 are
                    purchased at one time. The result of these fiscal arrangements has been to
                    favour large monopolizirtg companies. Although there are nearly thirty
                    manufactories in the States at present, practically the match trade of the
                    country is in the hands of, or entirely controlled by, the Diamond Match Company
                    of New York, consisting of a combination of large manufacturers. During the year
                    1881 the revenue derived from the internal tax amounted to $3,272,258, while the
                    customs duty on imported matches yielded no more than $6186, these receipts
                    representing probably a consumption of 40,000,000,000 matches. (J. PA.) <pb
