                    family was Jacobite in its politics, and the second son, being apparently mixed
                    up in some of the plots of the time, joined the court of the Pretender at the
                    accession of George I., and was created by him earl of Dunbar. William Murray
                    was sent first to the grammar school at Perth, where he remained until he was
                    thirteen, and at that age was sent to Westminster at the suggestion of his
                    exiled brother, who had been in close relation with Atterbury (then dean of
                    Westminster), and probably desired to bring the boy under his influence. He was
                    elected a king’s scholar a year after his entrance, and in 1723 was first on the
                    list of scholars sent on the foundation to Christ Church, where he remained for
                    nearly four years. It had been originally intended that he should enter the
                    English church, as, although his own inclination while at school pointed
                    strongly towards the bar, the circumstances of his family seemed to forbid the
                    expense of a legal education. But this obstacle was removed by the kindness of
                    the father of one of his schoolfellows, and he was entered at Lincoln’s Inn.
                    Soon after he went to Oxford. In 1727 he took chambers in Lincoln’s Inn, and in
                    1730 was called to the bar. His studies from the time he left Westminster seem
                    to have been steadily directed towards his future profession, but in a manner
                    far more liberal than was then usual among lawyers. He had made himself at
                    Westminster and Oxford an admirable classical scholar; he paid particular
                    attention to English composition and to the art of debate; his historical
                    studies were extensive, and in the more strictly professional sphere his wide
                    view of the education necessary for a lawyer was shown by the knowledge he
                    acquired of Roman law and of the juridical writers of Scotland and France. At
                    the same time he enjoyed the advantage of mixing extensively with the best
                    literary society. He had early become an intimate friend of Pope, and his own
                    ability and accomplishments soon made him everywhere a man of mark.</p>
                <p>For two or three years he made little or no progress at the bar, but at length
                    his appearance in some important Scotch appeal cases brought him into notice,
                    and in Scotland at least he acquired an immense reputation by his appearance for
                    the city of Edinburgh when it was <pb break="no"

                    of the Porteous mob. His English business had as yet been scanty, but in 1737 a
                    single speech in a jury trial of note may be said to have placed him at the head
                    of the bar, and from this time he enjoyed a great business. In 1738 he married
                    Lady Elizabeth Finch, daughter of the earl of Winchelsea. His political career
                    commenced in 1742 with his appointment as solicitor-general. Probably his
                    political opinions were not of a marked party character; he had been bred a
                    Jacobite, and many of his earlier associates belonged to the high Tory camp, but
                    his calm sense and temper disinclined him to extreme factions, and indeed his
                    interest in politics seems at all times to have been subordinate to the love of
                    his profession. He had kept entirely aloof during the struggles which preceded
                    the fall of Sir Robert Walpole; he refused any purely political appointment, and
                    only took office as solicitor when he felt assured of the permanence of the new
                    administration. During the next fourteen years Murray was one of the most
                    conspicuous figures in the parliamentary history of the time. Although holding
                    an office of subordinate rank, and not sharing, nominally at least, in the
                    councils of the administration, he was the chief defender of their measures in
                    the House of Commons, and during the time that Pitt was in opposition had to
                    bear the brunt of his attacks. He was especially conspicuous in the great
                    debates on the employment of the Hanoverian troops, the treaty of
                    Aix-la-Chapelle, and the Regency Bill. In 1754 he became attorney-general, and
                    for the next two years acted as leader of the House of Commons under the
                    administration of the duke of Newcastle. During these years he had to defend a
                    weak Government against the incessant, vehement assaults of Pitt, and, according
                    to the testimony of contemporaries, acquitted himself brilliantly in the
                    contest. But in 1756, when the Government was evidently approaching its fall, an
                    unexpected vacancy occurred in the chief justiceship of the king’s bench, and he
                    claimed the office. Newcastle made every effort to retain him in the House of
                    Commons, feeling as he did that his departure would hasten the fall of the
                    Government, but Murray was inexorable. He seems to have been thoroughly tired of
                    his parliamentary life, and to have long looked forward to the bench as the
                    proper sphere of his work. He was at the same time raised to the peerage as
                    Baron Mansfield.</p>
                <p>From this time the chief interest of his career lies in his judicial work, but he
                    did not wholly dissever himself from politics. He became by a singular
                    arrangement, only once repeated subsequently in the case of Lord Ellenborough, a
                    member of the cabinet, and remained in that position through various changes of
                    administration for nearly fifteen years, and, although he persistently refused
                    the chancellorship, he acted as speaker of the House of Lords while the great
                    seal was in commission. During the time of Pitt’s ascendency he took but little
                    part in politics, but while Lord Bute was in power his influence was very
                    considerable, and seems mostly to have been exerted in favour of a more moderate
                    line of policy. He was on the whole a supporter of the prerogative, but within
                    definite limits. Macaulay terms him, justly enough, “the father of modern
                    Toryism, of Toryism modified to suit an order of things in which the House of
                    Commons is the most powerful body in the state.” In this spirit he continued to
                    act a conspicuous though not a foremost part in political life during the rest
                    of his career. During the stormy session of 1770 he came into violent collision
                    with Lord Chatham and Lord Camden in the questions that arose out of the
                    Middlesex election and the trials for political libel, and in the subsequent
                    years he was made the subject of the bitter attacks of Junius, in which his
                    early Jacobite connexions, and his apparent leanings to arbitrary power, were
                    used against him with extraordinary ability and virulence. In 1776 he was
                    created earl of Mansfield. In 1783, although he declined to re-enter the
                    cabinet, he acted as speaker of the House of Lords during the coalition
                    ministry, and with this his political career may be said to have closed. He
                    continued to act as chief justice until his resignation in June 1788, and after
                    five years spent in quiet retirement died peacefully on 20th March 1793. He left
                    no family, but his title had been re-granted (in 1792) with a direct remainder
                    to his nephew, Lord Stormont.</p>
                <p>Lord Mansfield’s great reputation rests chiefly on his judicial career. The
                    political trials in which he presided, although they gave rise to numerous
                    accusations against him, were conducted with singular fairness and propriety. He
                    was accused with especial bitterness of favouring arbitrary power by the law
                    which he laid down in the trials for libel which arose out of the publications
                    of Junius and Horne Tooke, and which at a later time he reaffirmed in the case
                    of the dean of St Asaph (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Libel).</hi> But, although his
                    political opinions led him to look with disfavour on the popular view, and
                    although it was unquestionably unfortunate that in some of these instances he
                    was a member of the cabinet which directed the proceedings, we must remember
                    that his view of the law was concurred in by the great majority bf the judges
                    and lawyers of that time, and was supported by undoubted precedents. In other
                    instances, when the Government were equally concerned, he was wholly free from
                    suspicion. He supported Lord Camden’s decision against general warrants, and
                    reversed the outlawry of Wilkes. While on the whole he leaned in opinion to a
                    view of the law which we should now call oppressive, there is no instance in
                    which he can justly be accused of wresting.it, and in every instance he treated
                    the accused with a fairness and decency which had not always been shown by his
                    predecessors. In another way he came into conflict with popular prejudices. He
                    was always ready to protect the rights of conscience, whether they were claimed
                    by Dissenters or Catholics, and the popular fury which led to the destruction of
                    his house during the Gordon riots was directed against him very much because a
                    Catholic priest, who was accused of saying mass, had escaped the penal laws by
                    his charge to the jury. His chief celebrity, however, is founded upon the
                    consummate ability with which he discharged the civil duties of his office. He
                    has always been recognized as the founder of English mercantile law. The common
                    law as it existed before his time was wholly inadequate to cope with the new
                    cases and customs which arose with the increasing development of commerce. The
                    facts were left to the jury to decide as best they might, and no principle was
                    ever extracted from them which might serve as a guide in subsequent cases. Lord
                    Mansfield found the law in this chaotic state, and left it in a form that was
                    almost equivalent to a code. Working patiently with the guildhall juries, whom
                    he trained to act in thorough understanding with him, he defined almost every
                    principle that governed commercial transactions in such a manner that his
                    successors had only to apply the rules he had laid down. His knowledge of Roman
                    and foreign law, and the general width of his education, freed him from the
                    danger of relying too exclusively upon narrow precedents, and afforded him a
                    storehouse of principles and illustrations, while the grasp and acuteness of his
                    intellect enabled him to put his judgments in a form which almost always
                    commanded assent. A similar influence was exerted by him in other branches of
                    the common law; and although, after his retirement, a reaction took place, and
                    he was regarded for a while as one wflιo had corrupted the ancient principles of
                    English law, these prejudices passed rapidly away, and the value of his work in
                    bringing the older law in harmony <pb break="no"

                    fully recognized.</p>
                <p>The chief defect of Lord Mansfield’s character was a certain coldness and want of
                    moral courage. He had no very warm attachment either to persons or opirdons,
                    although invariably kindly and considerate in his demeanour. Even his greatest
                    speeches owe their impressiveness to a certain intellectual nobleness and
                    breadth of view. His attachment to justice was not impassioned, but of the type
                    which is'bred from highest professional custom, and from the kind of
                    intellectual taste which led him so frequently to the ethical writings of
                    Cicero. He could not always face the enthusiasm of Chatham, and we cannot feel
                    certain that his courage would have sustained him through any very perilous
                    stand for righteousness. But in the sphere in which he was chiefly famous these
                    defects were scarcely disadvantages. His sense of duty and of personal dignity
                    was amply sufficient to bear him perfectly unstained through life. No suitor had
                    ever to complain of delay or neglect. His want of strong feeling only permitted
                    him to use his magnificent intellect with greater impartiality; and, if at any
                    time he was affected by personal prejudice, no trace of it was ever allowed to
                    appear. Nothing ever disturbed the perfect dignity and propriety of his judicial
                    conduct, which is apparent in every trial at which he presided. He impressed
                    himself on the mind of his contemporaries as one of the best examples of what a
                    great judge ought to be, and from that estimate a closer examination of his
                    claims will scarcely lead us to differ. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. gi.)</hi></p>
