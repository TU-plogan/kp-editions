                    population has steadily advanced from 966 in 1851 to 1550 in 1881. Though a

                    little interest but for the ruins of its abbey, now the property of the duke of
                    Buccleuch. It was formerly called Little Fordell, and its present name even
                    dates from the foundation of the monastery by David II. in 1136.</p>
                <p>There had been a Columbite monastery of Melrose at the place now known as Old
                    Melrose, about a mile and a half to the east of the village, but this
                    establishment, probably never of much architectural magnificence, had, according
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle of the Picts and Scots,</hi> been destroyed
                    by Kenneth M <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> Alpin in 839, and may never have
                    recovered from the disaster. King David’s abbey, which he entrusted to a body of
                    Cistercian monks from Rievaulx (Riuall) in Yorkshire, was dedicated on Sunday
                    28th July 1146; it was laid in ruins by Edward II. of England in 1322; Bruce
                    caused the work of restoration to be vigorously prosecuted, but the edifice was
                    again burned by Richard II. in 1385. The abbey church as it now stands
                    consequently belongs in the main to the latter half of the 14th century and the
                    first half of the 15th, with a good many portions of a considerably later
                    date.</p>
                <p>Architecturally the abbey may be described as a splendid example of the Middle
                    Pointed style, strongly affected on the one hand by Flamboyant and Perpendicular
                    tendencies, and on the other by the individuality of some of the builders.
                    Cruciform in plan, it measured 214⅛ feet from east to west, the width of the
                    nave being 69 feet, and across the transepts 115⅜. 3 he noble edifice was
                    damaged by the English in 1545; and since the Reformation it has been altered to
                    suit the necessities of Presbyterian worship (1618-1810), and plundered by
                    builders to supply ornaments for houses. The whole building is now in ruins. The
                    west end and a good part of the north side have disappeared; but the elevation
                    of the south side is nearly entire, both the transepts and the east end are
                    externally in very fair preservation, part of the central tower is standing, and
                    the sculptured roof still covers the east end of the chancel. Of the individual
                    features of the building, the great eastern window has been generally most
                    admired since Sir Walter Scott celebrated the moonlit aspect of its “slender
                    shafts of shapely stone.” It has five lights; the height is 37 feet and the
                    width 16; and the upper portion is filled in with delicate tracery of a
                    geometrical design. Very beautiful too is the whole gable of the south transept.
                    In the interior, on the north side of the nave, there still stand four of the
                    original square piers, and one of them shows a Norman “cap.” The choir, the west
                    end of which is shut off by a massive rood-screen, has been largely “spoiled by
                    rough 17th century work”; but enough remains of the decorative detail to provoke
                    the admiration and despair of the modern artist in stone. The facile and at the
                    same time elaborate rendering of vegetable forms, such as the Scotch “kail,” is
                    particularly striking. It was in the abbey-church of Melrose, where Alexander
                    II. had long before been buried near the high altar, that the heart of Bruce
                    found its final resting-place; and among the many tombs which afterwards
                    gathered under the same roof were those of his faithful knight James Lord
                    Douglas, Sir William the dark knight of Liddesdale, and the hero of Chevy
                    Chase.</p>
                <p>The ancient muniments of the abbacy have been preserved in the archives of the
                    earl of Morton; they were published by the Bannatyne Club (2 vols., 1837, <hi

                    documents is one of the very earliest specimens of the Scotch tongue. The <hi

                    (1835), edited by John Stevenson. From about 1140 till its close in 1265 the
                    chronicle may be considered original; it was put largely under contribution by
                    later compilers.</p>
