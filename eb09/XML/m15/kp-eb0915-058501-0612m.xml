                    followed the manner of painting proper to his native Siena, as improved by
                    Duccio, which is essentially different from the style of Giotto and his school,
                    and the idea that Simone was himself a pupil of Giotto is therefore wide of the
                    mark. The Sienese style is less natural, dignified, and reserved than the
                    Florentine; it has less unity of impression, has more tendency to pietism, and
                    is marked by exaggerations which are partly related to the obsolescent Byzantine
                    manner, and partly seem to forebode certain peculiarities of the fully developed
                    art which we find prevalent in Michelangelo. Simone, in especial, tended to an
                    excessive and rather affected tenderness in his female figures; he was more
                    successful in single figures and in portraits than in large compositions of
                    incident. He finished with scrupulous minuteness, and was elaborate in
                    decorations of patterning, gilding, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The first known fresco of Simone is the vast one which he executed in the hall of
                    the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena,— the Madonna Enthroned, with the Infant, and a
                    number of angels and saints; its date is 1315, at which early period of his life
                    he was already an artist of repute throughout Italy. In S. Lorenzo Maggiore of
                    Naples he painted a life-sized picture of King Robert crowned by his
                    brother,</p>
                <p>Lewis, bishop of Toulouse; this also is ex'ant, but much damaged. In 1320 he
                    painted for the high altar of the church of St Catharine in Pisa the Virgin and
                    Child between six saints; above are archangels, apostles, and other figures. The
                    compartmented portions of this work are now dispersed, some of them being in the
                    academy of Siena. Towards 1321 he executed for the church of St Dominic in
                    Orvieto a picture of the bishop of Savona kneeling before the Madonna attended
                    by saints, now in the Fabricceria of the cathedral. Certain frescos in Assisi in
                    the chapel of St Martin, representing the life of that saint, ascribed by Vasari
                    to Puccio Capanna, are now, upon strong internal evidence, assigned to Sijnone.
                    He painted also, in the south transept of the lower church of the same edifice,
                    figures of the Virgin and eight saints. In 1328 he produced for the Sala del
                    Consilio in Siena a work of a very different character—a striking equestrian
                    portrait of the victorious general Guidoriccio Fogliani de’ Ricci.</p>
                <p>Simone had married in 1324 Giovanna, the daughter of Memmo (Guglielmo) di
                    Filippuccio. Her brother, named Lippo Memmi, was also a painter, and was
                    frequently associated with Simone in his work; and this is the only reason why
                    Simone has come down to us with the familyname Memmi. »They painted together in
                    1333 the Annunciation which is now in the Uffizi gallery. Simone kept a bottega
                    (or shop), undertaking any ornamental work commissioned of him, and his gains
                    were large. In 1339 he settled at the papal court in Avignon, where he made the
                    acquaintance of Petrarch and Laura; and he painted for the poet a portrait of
                    his lady, which has not come down to us; it gave occasion for two of Petrarch’s
                    sonnets, in which Simone is highly eulogized. He also illuminated for the poet a
                    copy of the Comment of Servius upon Virgil, now preserved in the Ambrosian
                    library of Milan. He was largely employed in the decorations of the papal
                    buildings in Avignon, and several of his works still remain —in the cathedral,
                    in the hall of the consistory, and, in the two chapels of the palace, the
                    stories of the Baptist, and of Stephen and other saints. One of his latest
                    productions (1342) is the picture of Christ Found by his Parents in the Temple,
                    now in the Liverpool Gallery. Simone died in Avignon in July 1344.</p>
                <p>From this account of Simone’s principal works it will be perceived that those
                    with which his name and fame are most generally identified are no longer
                    regarded as his. These are the compositions, in the Campo Santo of Pisa, from
                    the legend of S. Ranieri, and the Assumption of the Virgin; and the great
                    frescos in the Cappellone degli Spagnuoli, in S. Maria Novella, Florence,
                    representing the Triumph of Religion through the work of the Dominican order,
                    &amp;c. Some of the works in question can be proved to have been done many years
                    after Simone’s death, and the others belong to a different school and style of
                    art.</p>
