                    the English form is nowadays most commonly applied by our sailors to the smaller
                    Albatroses, of about the size of a Goose, met with in the Southern
                    Ocean—corrupted into “Molly Mawk,” or otherwise modified. There is some
                    difference of opinion as to the number of species of small Albatroses, and it is
                    unfortunate that the results of the voyage of the “Challenger” do not clear up
                    the doubts that have been expressed. Three species have been described and
                    figured, the <hi rend="italic">Diomedea</hi><hi rend="italic">melanophrys</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">D. chlororhynchus</hi> for a long while, while the third,
                    <hi rend="italic">D. culminata,</hi> was discriminated by Gould <hi
                    rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1843, p. 107), who has stated that the
                    difference between it and the second is so apparent that he had no difficulty in
                    distinguishing them on the wing. Captain Hutton, on the other hand <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1865, p. 283), considers all three to be specifically
                    identical. Others, as appears by the <hi rend="italic">Report on the Birds</hi>
                    of the “Challenger” voyage (pp, 148, 149), while regarding <hi rend="italic">D.
                    melanophrys</hi> as distinct, would seem to unite <hi rend="italic">D.
                    culminata</hi> with <hi rend="italic">D. chlororhynchus.</hi> The first of these
                    birds, says Gould, is the commonest species of Albatros inhabiting the Southern
                    Ocean, and its gregarious habits and familiar disposition make it well known to
                    every voyager to or from Australia, for it is equally common in the Atlantic as
                    well as the Pacific. The back, wings, and tail are of a blackish-grey, but all
                    the rest of the plumage is white, except a dusky superciliary streak, whence its
                    name of Black-browed Albatros, as also its scientific epithet, are taken. The
                    bill of the adult is of an ochreous-yellow, while that of the young is dark.
                    This species (supposing it to be one) is said to breed on the Falkland Islands
                    and on Tristan da Cunha, but the latter locality seems questionable, for,
                    according to Carmichael <hi rend="italic">(Trans. Linn. Soc.,</hi> xii. p. 490),
                    <hi rend="italic">D. chlororhynchus</hi> is the bird of this group there found;
                    while Professor Moseley <hi rend="italic">(Notesofa Naturalist,</hi> p. 130)
                    calls it <hi rend="italic">D. culminata</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    observer just named describes it as making a cylindrical nest of grass, sedge,
                    and clay, with a shallow basin atop and an overhanging rim—the whole being about
                    14 inches in diameter and 10 in height. The bird lays a single white egg, which
                    is held in a sort of pouch formed by the skin of the abdomen, while she is
                    incubating. A few other details are given by him, but his visit was too hurried
                    to enable him to ascertain the more important and interesting points in the
                    economy of this Albatros which were neglected by his predecessor, Carmichael,
                    during his four months’ sojourn in 1816-17. <hi rend="italic">D. culminata</hi>
                    is said by Gould to be more plentiful in the Australian seas than elsewhere,

                    him between Sydney and the northern extremity of New Zealand, as well as in the
                    same latitude of the Indian Ocean. He describes its bill as having the
                    greyish-yellow ridge broad and flat, while that of <hi rend="italic">D.
                    chlororhynchus</hi> is laterally compressed and the ridge round. All these birds
                    seem to have much the same habits. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
