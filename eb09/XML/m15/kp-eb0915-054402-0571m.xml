                    frequently be cases in which naval operations can be supplemented by the landing
                    of a force. The armament, equipment, and discipline of the armies and navies of
                    such nations were in early days practically alike. But with the introduction of
                    more regular levies and better organization arose the necessity for having on
                    board ships-of-war an armed body organized to meet the altered condition of
                    things. Sailors were but engaged for periods during which ships were
                    commissioned; and their previous history and training did not tend to furnish
                    the material required. Regular armies on shore called for disciplined forces
                    afloat,—that is to say, for marines, or sea soldiers, who should have the
                    steadiness of the troops of the line, be accustomed to the peculiar duties of
                    ship life, and be subordinate to the naval authorities. ·</p>
                <p>Previous to 1664 the British navy had been manned chiefly by “impress”; but in
                    that year an order in council appeared, authorizing the formation of a force of
                    1200 soldiers, in six companies, to be raised for sea service during the Dutch
                    War. Probably it was recruited from the London Trained Bands, as the Royal
                    Marines, with the 3d battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the East Kent Regiment,
                    and the Royal London Militia, alone possess the privilege of marching through
                    the city with colours flying and bayonets fixed. Recruits were also obtained
                    from the foot guards; and in 1672 companies of the guards were employed on
                    shipboard. The Army List of 1684 shows for the first time the organized
                    battalion of marines, in H.R.H. the duke of York and Albany’s maritime regiment
                    of foot or “Admiral’s Regiment,” which, in that year, mustered on Putney Heath
                    twelve companies, with a full proportion of officers. This stood third in
                    seniority in the line, and eventually became the Coldstream Guards; the 4th, or
                    “Holland Regiment,” which also sent companies to sea, and had like the above
                    regiment been raised by the City of London, taking its place as 3d or “Old
                    Buffs.” Several other maritime regiments were successively formed and disbanded,
                    until, in 1702, Queen Anne directed the addition to the army of six regiments as
                    a marine corps, while six existing regiments were also appointed “for sea
                    service.” These were done away with in 1714, three only being retained, as the
                    30th, 31st, and 32d of the line. Independent companies, for service in the West
                    Indies, were also formed, becoming in 1742 the 49th foot. In 1739 six fresh
                    regiments were levied, and augmented in 1742 to ten, of 1000 men in ten
                    companies each; while three others were collected in America for colonial duty.
                    Though commanded by generals and colonels of the army, they were to be quartered
                    in the neighbourhood of the dockyards at Portsmouth, Sheerness, Chatham,
                    Deptford, Woolwich, and Plymouth; and the proportion of officers, viz., 100 men
                    with a captain to twenty with a subaltern, was fixed for the different classes
                    of vessels. No field officer was embarked unless a full battalion were sent. In
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n572/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0572-0545"/> 1745 two other battalions were specially raised
                    for service at Cape Breton, becoming finally the 5Oth and 51st foot; and in 1746
                    the ten regiments were restored to the army, taking rank from the 44th to the
                    53d. Previous to their disbandment as marines they had been partially under the
                    orders of the lord high admiral.</p>
                <p>By an order in council of 1755 a force of 5000 men in 50 companies was raised and
                    definitely placed under the naval authorities. They were to be stationed at
                    Chatham, Portsmouth, and Plymouth, the 4th or Woolwich division not being added
                    until 1805; and this body was gradually increased to 19,000 men in 1762, but
                    reduced in 1763 to about 4000. Commissions ceased to be purchasable, but
                    exchange with the army was, for a time, sanctioned. Naval admirals and captains
                    were appointed generals and colonels of marines in 1760, in consequence of a
                    representation from the commandants of divisions that there was an insufficient
                    number of field officers “for the discipline of the service.” This absurd
                    anomaly existed until 1833, when these useless sinecures were abolished.</p>
                <p>The revolt of the American colonies in 1775 led, again, to an increase in the
                    establishment, which by 1783 had reached 25,291 men,—followed by a reduction to
                    4495 the ensuing year. So urgent was the demand for marines during the struggle
                    that men were frequently embarked untrained; yet, so popular was the service,
                    they still “recruited better in every part of the island” than the army. Owing
                    to this unwise policy of reduction, the force, on the outbreak of the French War
                    in 1793, had to be supplemented, as formerly, by companies from the line; and at
                    its conclusion the marine corps again reached a total strength of more than
                    30,000 men. But there had been differences between the military and naval
                    authorities as to the employment of soldiers from the army; so that from 1815,
                    when the numbers again fell to about 6000, there has been a steady increase,
                    until an establishment suitable to the wants of the navy has been fixed. During
                    the long war, moreover, the necessity for the formation of a body of marine
                    artillery had become increasingly apparent. The services of marines in this
                    capacity had been previously demanded during the American War, when they were
                    employed in the half-moon battery and citadel at Halifax, and elsewhere in
                    batteries on shore, as some of them had been “trained in the service of great
                    guns” by Lieutenant Gillespie of the Royal Artillery. By an order in council of
                    the 18th August 1804, therefore, “in consequence of the inconvenience of
                    embarking the Royal Artillery,” it was directed that one company of marine
                    artillery, composed of the most intelligent and experienced officers and men,
                    should be formed at each division to be employed for the training of the
                    infantry, so as to embark efficient artillerymen in other vessels besides
                    “bombs.” This force suffered a reduction to two companies in 1822, since which
                    date it also has been steadily increased; and in 1862 the artillery companies
                    were separated from the light infantry and formed into a separate division at
                    Fort Cumberland, Portsmouth, whence the headquarters were transferred to Eastney
                    in 1869. In 1869 the Woolwich division was abolished, a depot for the training
                    of recruits being formed at Walmer. At present the Royal Marine force numbers 48
                    companies of infantry and 16 of artillery, showing a total force of 2532
                    artillery and 9862 infantry, at an expenditure of &lt;£913,456,</p>
                <p>Each division of Royal Marines has a total force of 16 companies, with a colonel
                    commandant, second commandant, 4 lieutenantcolonels, 14 majors, 20 captains, and
                    42 subalterns, inclusive of the divisional staff of instructors of gunnery,
                    musketry, &amp;c. The headquarter staff, in London, consists of a deputy and an
                    assistant adjutant-general, &amp;c.; and there are, in addition, three generals,
                    three lieutenant-generals, and six major-generals on the active list. The men
                    are recruited by special parties; they are enlisted for twelve years, with
                    permission to re-engage for nine more. All recruits undergo their preliminary
                    training at Walmer, and are then drafted to the several divisions,—those who
                    reach a higher standard being allowed to volunteer for the artillery. The
                    standard for infantry and artillery, and the system of pay, equipment, pension,
                    and divisional administration, are similar to those of the line and Royal
                    Artillery respectively. Officers are obtained by open competition from the
                    pass-lists for entrance to the Military Academy, Woolwich, and the Royal
                    Military College, Sandhurst. The successful infantry candidates are drafted to
                    their several divisions, and undergo a course of instruction under the military
                    instructor to the corps,—those for the artillery receiving a special training
                    for two years at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich.</p>
                <p>The Royal Marines, reckoning as part of the naval forces, are accounted for in
                    the navy estimates; though the names of the officers appear both in the Army and
                    Navy Lists. They are particularized in the Army Act as subject to military law
                    at stated times, serving on shore under the Act and the regulations in force in
                    the garrisons, where they perform the same duties as the land forces. Afloat
                    they are subject to the Naval Discipline Act; and a Marine Mutiny Act was
                    formerly passed annually for the “regulation of Her Majesty’s Royal Marine
                    forces while on shore,” stating that they were under the direction of the lord
                    high admiral, &amp;c. On board ship their duties are of a purely military
                    character, being confined to guard mounting, assisting to man boats for shore
                    operations, and helping to form the crews for the heavy guns. Though under the
                    supreme command of the naval authorities, they are only obliged to aid in work
                    on deck, and when landed are entirely commanded by their own officers.</p>
                <p>The war services of the corps are so numerous that they can be but briefly
                    referred to. First employed at Cork in 1690, they have been present in nearly
                    all the actions in which the navy has since then been engaged; and between that
                    date and 1800 they took part in 227 sea fights and 70 important operations on
                    shore. At Gibraltar and Manila, at Belleisle and Bunker’s Hill, at Negapatam,
                    the Cape, and Acre, they earned the special commendation of the leaders, as well
                    as for Lord Howe’s victory, and the great sea fights of Camperdown, Cape St
                    Vincent, and the Nile. Nor were their enemies backward in recognizing their
                    worth. At Belleisle the French, in describing .the troops whose valour had been
                    most conspicuous, designated the battalions of marines “les petits grenadiers”;
                    and at Acre General Berthier bore testimony to the conspicuous gallantry of
                    Major Oldfield, who fell in the attack on the fortress. From 1800 to 1815 they
                    saw constant service in 99 coast operations and 142 naval actions. After the
                    landing at Aboukir Bay in 1801 the “Bull Dogs” received high praise for the way
                    in which they had done their work. At the siege of Gaeta, at Rosas, and at Santa
                    Maura, the marines again distinguished themselves; and they took part in the
                    decisive battles at Copenhagen, Trafalgar, San Domingo, and the Dardanelles.
                    Three battalions were also specially brigaded with the line for active service
                    in America and Holland in 1813-15. Since that period the marines have shared in
                    the naval actions at Algiers, Navarino, Acre, the Baltic, and Black Sea, and
                    have fought by the side of the land forces at the Cape, in India, China, New
                    Zealand, Abyssinia, Ashantee, and Zululand, as also in those numerous petty
                    skirmishes in which the navy has been so repeatedly engaged. In the bombardment
                    of Alexandria (1882), and in the operations that followed it, the corps has
                    again seen service by sea and land. Nor have their services been less important
                    in other cases. Though forming part of the ships’ companies, and therefore at
                    times suffering from the same grievances, they have always been faithful to
                    their trust. In 1797, a period of much sedition throughout the country, all
                    efforts to shake their allegiance were fruitless, and the duke of York
                    especially commended their loyalty and zeal. Between that year and 1802, after
                    the mutinies of the Nore, Spithead, and Bantry Bay, of the “Temeraire,”
                    “Castor,” “Impétueux,” “Hermione,” “Gibraltar,” and “Excellent,” the marines
                    were publicly thanked for their devotion.</p>
                <p>As part of a ship’s company in naval actions, as a force landed to assist in
                    coast operations, and as troops acting in concert with the army, the marines
                    have won distinction and the commendation of both naval and military authorities
                    for two hundred years. The motto of the corps, “Per mare per terram,” needs no
                    explanation; the title “Royal” was added in 1802 “for its many and varied
                    services during the war,” and its former facings were altered from white to
                    royal blue; it was also in 1820, by an order in council, placed next in
                    seniority to the 49th Regiment. In 1827 the globe, surrounded by the laurel
                    wreath, for the siege of Belleisle, together with “Gibraltar” in commemoration
                    of the services performed there, was added by George IV. In 1855 the infantry
                    branch of the corps became “light infantry.”</p>
                <p>Although in the <hi rend="superscript"> , i</hi> armed strengths” of the great
                    European powers marines and marine artillery are mentioned, these troops have
                    little in common with those in the British navy. In France their duties are to
                    garrison the five military ports and colonies, and to take part in marine and
                    other wars. In Germany the marine <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n573/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0573-0546"/> battalions and artillery divisions at Kiel and
                    Wilhelmshafen are intended for coast defence only. In Holland, Austria, and
                    Italy also they have a military organization, but do not form a recognized part
                    of the complements of sea-going ships. America alone employs marines in the same
                    manner as England; and they have won, as their British comrades have, the
                    approbation of the naval authorities and, on nineteen occasions, the thanks of
                    Congress. Admiral Farragut’s opinion that ‘ ‘ the marine guard is one of the
                    great essentials of a man-of-war” is corroborated by that of Admiral Wilkes, who
                    considered that “marines constituted the great difference between a man-of-war
                    and a privateer.” Formed in 1775 for the “publick defense,” they rank as the
                    oldest force in the American service; and since that time they have shared in
                    land and sea operations in all parts of the world. In the famous battles between
                    the “Bonhomme Richard” and “Serapis” in 1777, and in that between the
                    “Chesapeake’’and “Shannon,” they displayed bril liant gallantry; and while on
                    the one hand they at Derne in 1803 first planted the American flag on a fortress
                    of the Old World, for which exploit “Tripoli” is inscribed on their colours,
                    they on the other shared in the hard fighting of the Mexican war as well as all
                    the important coast actions of the civil war of 1861-65. A proposal to
                    incorporate them with the army after the struggle met with universal
                    condemnation from the authorities best qualified to judge of their value. At
                    present they number seventy-eight officers and two thousand men under the
                    command of a commandant, who ranks as brigadier-general, with headquarters at
                    Washington. Their administration, organization, and equipment are, as in
                    England, identical with those of the soldiers of the line. They are enlisted for
                    five years, must be 5 feet 6 inches in height, between eighteen and thirty-five
                    years of age, and able to read and write. The complement on board ship varies
                    from thirteen to fifty-one officers and men, depending on the rating of the
                    vessel. Their device is a globe resting on an anchor and surmounted by an eagle.
                    “Ever faithful” is the title which Captain Luce, the historian of the force,
                    appropriately applies to them. (C. C. K. )</p>
