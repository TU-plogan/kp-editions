                    himself to the artillery, he became chemist to the Board of Ordnance (1803), and
                    thus began relations with the Government which materially affected his future
                    career. He still continued, however, to practise for a time as a physician, and
                    then resided at Blackheath. In the year 1811 be communicated his first papers to
                    the Geological Society. They were devoted to an elucidation of the geological
                    structure of Guernsey, of the Channel Islands, and of Heligoland. The evidence
                    they afforded of his capacity, and the fact that he already had received a
                    scientific appointment, probably led to his being selected by Government to make
                    some geological and mineralogical investigations in Scotland. He was asked to
                    report upon stones adapted for use in powder-mills, upon the suitability of the
                    chief Scottish mountains for a repetition of the pendulum experiments previously
                    conducted by Maskelyne and Playfair at Schiehallion, and on <pb break="no"

                    meridian of the Trigonometrical Survey. In the course of the explorations
                    necessary for the purposes of these reports he made extensive observations on
                    the geology and mineralogy of Scotland. He formed also a collection of the
                    mineral productions and rocks of that country, which he presented to the
                    Geological Society in 1814. At that time comparatively little had been done in
                    the investigation of Scottish geology. Finding the field so entirely his own,
                    and so full of promise, he devoted himself to its cultivation with great ardour.
                    One of his earliest and most important labours was the examination of the whole
                    range of islands along the west of Scotland, at that time not easily visited,
                    and presenting many obstacles to a scientific explorer. The results of this
                    survey appeared (1819) in the form of his <hi rend="italic">Description of the
                    Western Islands of Scotland, including the Isle of Man</hi> (2 vols. 8vo, with
                    an atlas of plates in 4to), which forms one of the classical treatises on
                    British geology. He continued to write papers, chiefly on the rocks and minerals
                    of Scotland, and had at last gathered so large an amount of information that the
                    Government was prevailed upon in the year 1826 to employ him in the preparation
                    of a geological map of Scotland. From that date up to the time of his death he
                    returned each summer to Scotland and traversed every district of the kingdom,
                    inserting the geological features upon Arrowsmith’s map, which was the only one
                    then available for his purpose. He lived to complete this great labour, and to
                    prepare also a small volume explanatory of the map, but he died before these
                    were published in 1836. Among his other works the following may be mentioned :—
                    <hi rend="italic">A Geological Classification of Rocks, ιvith Descriptive
                    Synopses, comprising the Elements of Geology,</hi> 1 vol. 8vo, 1821; <hi

                    letters to Sir Walter Scott, 4 vols. 8vo, 1824; <hi rend="italic">A System of
                    Geology, with a Theory of the Earth and an examination of its Connexion with the
                    Sacred Records,</hi> 2 vols. 8vo, 1831. His versatility of acquirement was shown
                    by the publication also of works on malaria, remittent and intermittent
                    diseases, the art of making wines, natural and revealed religion, besides
                    numerous memoirs in various departments of natural history and antiquities.
                    During a visit to Cornwall he was killed by being dragged along in the wheel of
                    his carriage, 21st August 1835.</p>
                <p>Dr Macculloch’s name will ever be regarded with honour as one of the pioneers of
                    geology in Britain. Essentially a mineralogist and petrographer, he was the
                    first to trace out with some approach to truth the general distribution of the
                    various rock-formations of Scotland. His temperament unhappily led him to look
                    with jealousy and mistrust upon the labours of some of his more illustrious
                    contemporaries, and even to ignore them in his published writings. In particular
                    he appears to have been irritated by the rapid advances made by palaeontological
                    geology, and the increasingly large place given to that department of the
                    science, while his own favourite domain of minerals and rocks was
                    proportionately neglected. His feelings of dissent were strongly expressed in
                    the posthumous memoir to accompany his map of Scotland; but their bitterness may
                    in part be attributed to the influence of failing health. Much hostile criticism
                    was expended on his description of the manners and customs of the Highlanders,
                    which were certainly amusing and picturesque, though sometimes his love of an
                    effective period seems to have led him to exaggeration. The way in which he was
                    appointed to conduct a geological survey of Scotland, unknown to the public
                    bodies of that country, also led to considerable opposition. But the solid
                    services rendered by Macculloch to the progress of geology πjust be regarded as
                    far outweighing any objections that have been made to his literary work or
                    peculiarities of character.</p>
                <p>M <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> CULLOCH, <hi rend="smallcaps">John Ramsay</hi>
                    (1779-1864), a distinguished writer on political economy and statistics, was
                    born on 1st March 1779, at Whithorn in Wigtownshire. His family belonged to the
                    class of “statesmen,” or small landed proprietors. Having received his early
                    education from his maternal grandfather, a Scotch clergyman, he came to
                    Edinburgh, and was for some time employed there as a clerk in the office of a
                    writer to the signet. But, the <hi rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> newspaper having
                    been established at the beginning of 1817, M <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi>
                    Culloch sent a contribution to the fourth number, the merit of which was at once
                    recognized; he soon became connected with the management of the paper, and
                    during 1818 and 1819 acted as editor. Most of his articles in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Scotsman</hi> related to questions of political economy, and he
                    delivered lectures in Edinburgh on that science. He now also began to write on
                    subjects of the same class in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> his
                    first contribution to that periodical being an article on Ricardo’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Principles of Political Economy</hi> in 1818. Within the next few
                    years he gave both public lectures and private instruction in London on
                    political economy, and had amongst his hearers or pupils many persons of high
                    social position, and some who were important in the political world. In 1823 he
                    was chosen to fill the lectureship established by subscription in honour of the
                    memory of Ricardo. A movement was set on foot in 1825 by Jeffrey and others to
                    induce the Government to found in the university of Edinburgh a chair of
                    political economy, separate from that of moral philosophy, the intention being
                    to obtain the appointment for MOulloch. This project fell to the ground; but in
                    1828 he was made professor of political economy in the London University. He
                    then fixed his residence permanently in London, where he continued his literary
                    work, being now one of the regular writers in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh
                    Review.</hi> Indeed it appears from a letter of his to Macvey Napier in 1830
                    that he regarded himself, though Napier did not admit the justice of the claim,
                    as entitled to be the sole contributor of economical articles to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Review.</hi> In 1838 he was appointed comptroller of Her Majesty’s
                    Stationery Office; the duties of this position, which he held till his death, he
                    discharged with conscientious fidelity, and introduced important reforms in the
                    management of the department. Sir Robert Peel, in recognition of the services he
                    had rendered to political science, conferred on him a literary pension of £200
                    per annum. He was elected a foreign associate of the Institute of France
                    (Academy of Moral and Political Sciences). He died, after a short illness, on
                    11th November 1864, in the seventy-sixth year of his age. To his personal
                    character and social qualities very favourable testimony is borne by those who
                    knew him best. In general politics he always remained a Whig pure and simple;
                    though he was in intimate relations with James Mill and his circle, he never
                    shared the Radical opinions of that group.</p>
                <p>M <hi rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> Cu11och cannot be regarded as an original
                    thinker on political economy. He did not contribute any new ideas to that
                    science, or introduce any noteworthy correction of the views, either as to
                    method or doctrine, generally accepted by the dominant school of his day. But
                    the work he did must be pronounced, in· relation to the wants of his time, a
                    very valuable one. It was at an important crisis that he appeared in the field
                    of economical discussion. The principles of free trade had been powerfully
                    asserted before the public in the celebrated petition of the merchants of
                    London, drawn up by Mr Tooke and presented to parliament by Mr Alexander Baring
                    in 1820. Political economy, to which the bullion controversy had previously
                    attracted much attention, was more and more engaging the minds of political
                    writers and of statesmen. But the new views had to encounter fierce and
                    sometimes unscrupulous opposition. The <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>
                    was the principal organ of the reformers, and was maintaining, when M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t</hi> Culloch became a writer in it, an energetic warfare
                    against the policy founded on the mercantile theory of wealth. Naturally endowed
                    with strong sense and sagacity, and possessing a rare capacity for arduous and
                    prolonged mental exertion, he threw himself, with the ardour of conviction, into
                    the great struggle. There can be no doubt that his labours on the whole
                    contributed largely to the diffusion of just ideas on the economic questions
                    then under debate, and to the right direction of the national legislation with
                    respect to them. It must at the same time be admitted that his treatment of the
                    subjects with which he dealt is not marked by any special breadth or elevation.
                    He adopted too hastily the theoretic exaggerations of some of Smith’s
                    successors, and exhibited in full measure their habitual deadness, in the study
                    of social questions, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n150/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0150-0135"/> to all but material considerations. In his
                    evidence before the parliamentary committee on the state of Ireland in 1825 he
                    stated opinions, afterwards more fully asserted in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edinburgh Review,</hi> on the subject of Irish absenteeism, which tended to
                    disgust persons of intelligence and right feeling with a science which, as
                    interpreted by him, seemed to lead to practical absurdities, and in other
                    quartets had, it is to be feared, the effect of supplying a plausible . excuse
                    for carelessness on the part of the rich and great with respect to the inferior
                    classes of society. These opinions could not be justified even on strictly
                    economic grounds, as has since been shown by Longfield and Senior. M*CuUoch had
                    in him an element of intellectual wilfulness or perverse self-assertion,
                    compared by his friends and admirers to the despotic dogmatism of Johnson, which
                    both in conversation and in his writings led him into the enunciation and
                    defence of paradoxes; a notable example of this is furnished by the obstinacy
                    with which to the last, in the teeth of evidence, he clung to the doctrine of
                    the impolicy of cheap postage. M <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Culloch was
                    deficient in literary taste, and never attained any high degree of excellence in
                    style. His expression is often slipshod, and a certain coarseness in his images
                    sometimes throws an air of vulgarity over his pages. His name will probably be
                    less permanently associated with anything he has written on economic science,
                    strictly so called, than with his great statistical and other compilations. His
                    <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Commerce and Commercial Navigation</hi> and his
                    <hi rend="italic">Statistical Account of the British Empire—</hi> however they
                    may be expanded and altered, as they have already been, in successive
                    editions—will long remain imposing monuments of his extensive and varied
                    knowledge and his indefatigable industry. Another useful work of reference, also
                    the fruit of wide erudition and much labour, is his <hi rend="italic">Literature
                    of Political Economy.</hi> Though weak on the side of the foreign literature of
                    the science, it is very valuable as a guide to British writers, and, in relation
                    to its entire field, has not yet been superseded by any English book.</p>
                <p>The following is as complete a list of his publications as it has been found
                    possible to form An Essay on the Reduction of the Interest on the National Debt,

                    valuable economical tracts, reprinted at Lord Overstone's expense, 1856-59. He
                    united in one volume (2d ed., 1859) a number of his minor Treatises and Essays
                    on subjects connected with Economic Policy, many of which had appeared as
                    articles in the Encyclopaedia Britannica. He also printed, for private
                    distribution amongst his friends, a catalogue of his library,—which contained a
                    fine collection of books on bls own special subjects,—adding critical and
                    biographical notices. He had edited in 1828 Smith’s Wealth of Nations, with a
                    life of the author, an introductory discourse, notes, and supplemental
                    dissertations; this work he greatly enlarged and improved in the editions of
                    1838 and 1850. In 1846 he edited Ricardo's works, with a notice of the life and
                    writings of the author. (J. K. I.)</p>
