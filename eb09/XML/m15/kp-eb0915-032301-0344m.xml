                    themselves as the aboriginal population. Elsewhere they are met in scattered
                    communities chiefly round the coast of Borneo, in the Sulu Archipelago, in
                    Tidor, Ternate, and some other members of the Molucca group, where they are held
                    to be intruders or immigrants from Sumatra.</p>
                <p>Long considered as an independent division of mankind, the Malays are now more
                    generally affiliated to the Mongol stock, of which A. R. Wallace, De
                    Quatrefages, and other eminent naturalists regard them as a simple variety more
                    or less modified by mixture with other elements. “The Malayan race, as a whole,
                    undoubtedly very closely resembles the East-Asian populations from Siam to
                    Manchuria. I was much struck with this when in the island of Bali I saw Chinese
                    traders who had adopted the costume of that country, and who could then hardly
                    be distinguished from Malays; and, on the other hand, I have seen natives of
                    Java who, as far as physiognomy was concerned, would pass very well for
                    Chinese.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Wallace’s <hi

                    not projecting, hands and feet small and delicate, legs very thin and weak,
                    coarse black hair, always lank and round in section, scant or no beard.<note

                <p>The departure from this description so frequently noticed in the archipelago must
                    be attributed to intermixture with the black Papuan stock in the east, and with
                    a distinct pre-Malay Caucasie element in the west. The presence of this
                    “Indonesian” element, as it is called by Dr Hamy, may now be regarded as an
                    ascertained fact, the recognition of which will help to remove many of the
                    difficulties hitherto associated with the natural history of the Malay race. It
                    at once explains, for instance, the apparent discrepancy between the foregoing
                    description of the ordinary Malay and that of the Battas, Orang Kabu, and many
                    other Sumatran and Bornean peoples described as tall and robust, with regular
                    features, symmetrical figure, light complexion, brown and wavy hair, and general
                    European appearance.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>These considerations also enable us to fix the true centre of dispersion of the
                    Malay race rather in Malacca than in Sumatra, contrary to the generally received
                    opinion. If they are to be physically allied to the Mongol stock, it is obvious
                    that the earliest migration must have been from High Asia southwards to the
                    peninsula, and thence to Sumatra, possibly at a time when the island still
                    formed part of the mainland. The national traditions of a dispersion from
                    Menangkabo or Palembang in South Sumatra must accordingly be understood to refer
                    to later movements, and more especially to the diffusion of the civilized Malay
                    peoples, who first acquired a really national development in Sumatra in
                    comparatively recent times. From this point they spread to the peninsula, to
                    Borneo, Sulu, and other parts of Malaysia, apparently since their conversion to
                    Islam, although there is reason to believe that other waves of migration must
                    have reached Further India and especially Camboja, if not from the same region
                    at all events from Java, at much earlier dates. The impulse to these earlier
                    movements must be attributed to the intro duction of Indian culture through the
                    Hindu and Buddhist missionaries, perhaps two or three centuries before the
                    Christian era. During still more remote prehistoric times various sections of
                    the Malay and Indonesian stocks were diffused westwards to Madagascar, where the
                    Hovas, of undoubted Malay descent, still hold the political supremacy, and
                    eastwards to the Philippines, Formosa, Micronesia, and Polynesia. This
                    astonishing expansion of the Malaysian peoples throughout the Oceanic area is
                    sufficiently attested by the diffusion of a common Malayo-Polynesian speech from
                    Madagascar to Easter Island, and from Hawaii to New Zealand. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Polynesia.</hi></p>
                <p>The Malays proper have long been divided socially into three distinct groups,
                    —the <hi rend="italic">Orang</hi><hi rend="italic">Benüa,</hi> or “Men of the
                    Soil,” that is, the uncivilized wild tribes; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orang-laut,</hi> or “Men of the Sea,” that is, the semi-civilized floating
                    population; and the <hi rend="italic">Orang Maldyu,</hi> or “Malay Men,” that
                    is, the civilized Malays with a culture, a literature, and a religion. The Orang
                    Benιia, called also <hi rend="italic">Orang Gunung,</hi> or “Highlanders,” and
                    sometimes even <hi rend="italic">Orang-utan,</hi> or “Wild Men,” constitute the
                    aboriginal Malay element, the “raw material,” so to say, of the race, which has
                    hitherto remained wholly unaffected by foreign influences, and which is still
                    grouped in small tribes at a very low stage of culture, living nearly
                    exclusively by the chase, and almost destitute of all social organization. They
                    are found chiefly in the more inaccessible wooded uplands of Malacca and
                    Sumatra, in the former region more or less intimately associated for ages with
                    the Negrito tribes, and in the latter island apparently the sole occupiers of
                    the land from the first. Intermediate between the Orang Benda and Orang Malayu
                    are the Orang-laut, the “Sea Gipsies” of English writers, who still occupy the
                    same low social position that they held when the Portuguese first reached
                    Malaysia. They were then described by De Barros under the name of Cellates, or
                    “people of the Straits,” as “a vile people dwelling more on the sea than on the
                    land,” and “living by fishing and robbing”; and this description is still
                    largely applicable, although piracy is now all but suppressed in the Eastern
                    waters. The Bajau and Millanau of the Sulu Archipelago and neighbouring coast
                    lands also belong to this class of sea nomads. Lastly, the Orang Malayu are that
                    section of the race which, under the influence first of the Hindus and then of
                    the Arabs, has developed a national life and culture, and which has founded more
                    or less powerful political states in various parts of the archipelago. But here
                    again it i⅜ necessary to distinguish between the civilized Malays proper, and
                    the other civilized branches of the race, to whom the term Malay is never
                    applied, and who speak languages which, while belonging to the common Malay
                    linguistic family, differ greatly from the standard Malay speech. The chief
                    divisions of all these civilized communities are as under :—</p>
                <p>Orang Malayu: Menangkabo, Palembang, and Lampong in Sumatra; petty states of the
                    Malay Peninsula; Borneo; Tidor; Ternate.</p>
                <p>Sumatran group: Achinese, Rejangs, Passumahs.</p>
                <p>Javanese group: Javanese proper, Sundanese, Madurese, Balinese.</p>
                <p>Celebes group: Bugis, Mangkassara, and others.</p>
                <p>Philippine group: Tagalas, Bisayans, Bicol, Sulu, and others. Outlying groups:
                    Hovas of Madagascar, Formosan Islanders.</p>
                <p>In all these the distinctly Malay physical type decidedly predominates, whereas
                    elsewhere in the archipelago the so-called Malays are often rather
                    “Indonesians,” in whom the distinctly Caucasie physical type predominates. Such
                    especially are the Battas and Orang Kubu of Sumatra, the Nias and Mentawey
                    islanders, the Rayans, and many of the Dyak tribes of Borneo.<note

                <p>In their temperament no less than in their features the Malays still betray their
                    Asiatic origin. They are described as of a taciturn, undemonstrative
                    disposition, little given to outward manifestations of joy or sorrow, yet
                    extremely courteous towards each other, and as a rule kind to their women,
                    children, and domestic animals. Slow and deliberate in speech, neither elated by
                    good nor depressed by bad fortune, normally impassive and indolent, they are
                    nevertheless capable of the greatest excesses when their passions are roused. I.

                    losses at gambling, jealousy or other domestic troubles, they are often seized
                    by the so-called “amok” fever, when they will rush wildly through the crowded
                    streets armed with their sharp krisses, cutting down all who cross their path
                    with incredible fury and without the least discrimination. Amongst the practices
                    and propensities _ which connect them with the Mongoloid inhabitants of
                    Indo-China the most striking are pile-building, especially in Java and Borneo;
                    cock-fighting, universal throughout the archipelago; a pronounced taste for
                    putrescent fish, with a corresponding dislike of milk; headhunting (Borneo and
                    Celebes); large ear-ornaments, greatly distending the lobe; husband entering the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Malay Language and Literature.</hi></p>
                <p>The Malay language is a member of the Malayan section of the Malayo-Polynesian
                    class of languages, but it is by no means a representative type of the section
                    which has taken its name from it. The area over which it is spoken comprises the
                    peninsula of Malacca with the adjacent islands (the Rhio-Lingga Archipelago),
                    the greater part of the coast districts of Sumatra and Borneo, the seaports of
                    Java, the Sunda and Banda Islands. It is the general medium of communication
                    throughout the archipelago from Sumatra to the Philippine Islands, and it was so
                    upwards of three hundred and fifty years ago when the Portuguese first appeared
                    in those parts.</p>
                <p>There are no Malay manuscripts extant, no monumental records with inscriptions in
                    Malay, dating from before the spreading of Islam in the archipelago, about the
                    end of the 13th century. By some it has been argued from this fact that the
                    Malays possessed no kind of writing prior to the introduction of the Arabic
                    alphabet (W. Robinson, J. J. de Hollander); whereas others have maintained, with
                    greater show of probability, that the Malays were in possession of an ancient
                    alphabet, and that it was the same as the Rechang (Marsden, Friederich), as the
                    Kawi (Van der Tuuk), or most like the Lampong (Kern),—all of which alphabets,
                    with the Battak, Bugi, and Macassar, are ultimately traceable to the ancient
                    Cambojan characters. With the Mohammedan conquest the Perso-Arabic alphabet was
                    introduced among the Malays; it has continued over since to be in use for
                    literary, religious, and business purposes. Where Javanese is the principal
                    language, Malay is sometimes found written with Javanese characters; and in
                    Palembang, in the Mënangkabo country of Middle Sumatra, the Rechang or Renchong
                    characters are in general use, so called from the sharp and pointed knife with
                    which they are cut on the smooth side of bamboo staves. It is only since the
                    Dutch have established their supremacy in the archipelago that the Roman
                    character has come to be largely used in writing and printing Malay. This is
                    also the case in the Straits Settlements.</p>
                <p>By the simplicity of its phonetic elements, the regularity of its grammatical
                    structure, and the copiousness of its nautical vocabulary, the Malay language is
                    singularly well-fitted to be the <hi rend="italic">lingua franca</hi> throughout
                    the Indian archipelago. It possesses the five vowels <hi rend="italic">a, i, u,
                    e, o,</hi> both short and long, and one pure diphthong <hi rend="italic"
                    >au.</hi> Its consonants are <hi rend="italic">k, g, ng, ch, j, n, t, d, n, p,
                    b, m, y, r, I, to, s, h.</hi> Long vowels can only occur in open syllables. The
                    only possible consonantal nexus in purely Malay words is that of a nasal and
                    mute, a liquid and mute and vice versa, and aliquid and nasal. Final <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> are all but suppressed in the
                    utterance. Purely Arabic letters are only used in Arabic words, a great number
                    of which have been received into the Malay vocabulary. But the Arabic character
                    is even less suited to Malay than to the other Eastern languages on which it has
                    been foisted. As the short vowels are not marked, one would, in seeing, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the word <hi rend="italic">bntng,</hi> think first of
                    <hi rend="italic">bintang,</hi> a star; but the word might also mean a large
                    scar, to throw down, to spread, rigid, mutilated, enceinte, a kind of cucumber,
                    a redoubt, according as it is pronounced <hi rend="italic">bantang, banting,
                    bentang, buntang, buntung, bunting, bonteng, benteng.</hi></p>
                <p>Malay is essentially, with few exceptions, a dissyllabic language, and the
                    syllabic accent rests on the penultimate unless that syllable is open and short;
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> dâtang, namâna, bësâr, diumpatkannalah. Nothing in
                    the form of a root word indicates the grammatical category to which it belongs;
                    thus, <hi rend="italic">käsih,</hi> kindness, affectionate, to ]ove; <hi
                    rend="italic">ganti,</hi> a proxy, to exchange, instead of. It is only in
                    derivative words that this vagueness is avoided. Derivation is effected by
                    infixes, prefixes, affixes, and reduplication. Infixes occur more rarely in
                    Malay than in the cognate tongues. Examples are— <hi rend="italic">gιιruh,</hi>
                    a rumbling noise, <hi rend="italic">gumûruh,</hi> to make such a noise; <hi
                    rend="italic">tunjuk,</hi> to point, <hi rend="italic">telunjuk,</hi> the
                    forefinger; <hi rend="italic">chûchuk,</hi> to pierce, <hi rend="italic"
                    >cherüchuk,</hi> a stockade. The import of the prefixes—me (meng, men, men,
                    mem), pë (pëng, pen, pen, pern), ber (bel), per, pel, ka, di, ter,—and
                    affixes—an, kan, i, lah—will best appear from the following examples: ·root word

                    &amp;c. Altogether there are upwards of a hundred possible derivative forms, in
                    the idiomatic use of which the Malays exhibit much skill. See especially H. von
                    Dewall, <hi rend="italic">De vormυeranderingcn</hi><hi rend="italic">der</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Maleische tool,</hi> Batavia, 1864; and J. Pijnappel, <hi
                    rend="italic">Maleisch-Hollandsch Woordenboek,</hi> Amsterdam, 1875, ‘ ‘
                    lnleiding.” In every other respect the language is characterized by great
                    simplicity and indefiniteness. There is no inflexion to distinguish number,
                    gender, or case. Number is never indicated when the sense is obvious or can be
                    gathered from the context; otherwise plurality is expressed by adjectives such
                    as <hi rend="italic">sagäla,</hi> all, and <hi rend="italic">bähak,</hi> many,
                    more rarely by the repetition of the noun, and the indefinite singular by <hi
                    rend="italic">sa</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sätu,</hi> one, with a class-word.
                    Gender may, if necessary, be distinguished by the words <hi rend="italic"
                    >laki-läki,</hi> male, and <hi rend="italic">përampûan,</hi> female, in the case
                    of persons, and of <hi rend="italic">jantan</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >bëtina</hi> in the case of animals. The genitive case is generally indicated by
                    the position of the word after its governing noun. Also adjectives and
                    demonstrative pronouns have their places after the noun. Comparison is effected
                    by the use of particles. Instead &lt;rf the personal pronouns, both in their
                    full and abbreviated forms,-conventional nouns are in frequent use to indicate
                    the social position or relation of the respective interlocutors, as, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g., hamba tuan,</hi> the master’s slave, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> I. These nouns vary according to the different localities. Another
                    peculiarity of Malay (and likewise of Chinese, Shan, Talaing, Burmese, and
                    Siamese) is the use of certain classwords or coefficients with numerals, such as
                    <hi rend="italic">orang</hi> (man), when speaking of persons, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ckor</hi> (tail) of animals, <hi rend="italic">këping</hi> (piece) of flat
                    things, <hi rend="italic">biji</hi> (seed) of roundish things; <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g., lima biji</hi><hi rend="italic">tëlor,</hi> five eggs. The number of
                    these class-words is considerable. Malay verbs have neither person or number nor
                    mood or tense. The last two are sometimes indicated by particles or auxiliary
                    verbs; but these are generally dispensed with if the meaning is sufficiently
                    plain without them. The Malays avoid the building up of long sentences. The two
                    main rules by which the order of the words in a sentence is regulated
                    are—subject, verb, object; and qualifying words follow those which they qualify.
                    This is quite the reverse of what is the rule in Burmese.</p>
                <p>The history of the Malays amply accounts for the number and variety of foreign
                    ingredients in their language. Hindus appear to have settled in Sumatra and Java
                    as early as the 4th century of our era, and to have continued to exercise sway
                    over the native populations for many centuries. These received from them into
                    their language a very large number of Sanskrit terms from which we can infer the
                    nature of the civilizing influence imparted by the Hindu rulers. Not only in
                    words concerning commerce and agriculture, but also in terms connected with
                    social, religious, and administrative matters, that influence is traceable in
                    Malay. See W. E. Maxwell, <hi rend="italic">Manual of the Malay Language,</hi>
                    1882, pp. 5-34, where this subject is treated more fully than by previous
                    writers. This Sanskrit element forms such an integral part of the Malay
                    vocabulary that in spite of the subsequent infusion of Arabic and Persian words
                    adopted in the usual course of Mohammedan conquest it has retained its ancient
                    citizenship in the language. The number of Portuguese, English, Dutch, and
                    Chinese words in Malay is not considerable; their presence is easily accounted
                    for by political or commercial contact.</p>
                <p>The Malay language abounds in idiomatic expressions, which constitute the chief
                    difficulty’ in its acquisition. It is sparing in the use of personal pronouns,
                    and prefers impersonal and elliptical diction. As it is rich in specific
                    expressions for the various aspects of certain ideas, it is requisite to employ
                    always the most appropriate term suited -to the particular aspect. In Maxwell’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Manual,</hi> pp. 120 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> no less than
                    sixteen terms are given to express the different kinds of striking, as many for
                    the different kinds of speaking, eighteen for the various modes of carrying,
                    &amp;c. An unnecessary distinction has been made between <hi rend="italic">High
                    Malay</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Low Malay.</hi> The latter is no separate
                    dialect at all, but a mere brogue or jargon, the medium of intercourse between
                    illiterate natives and Europeans too indolent to apply themselves to the
                    acquisition of the language of the people; its vocabulary is made up of Malay
                    words, with a conventional admixture of words from other languages; and it
                    varies, not only in different localities, but also in proportion to the
                    individual speaker’s acquaintance with Malay proper. The use is different as
                    regards the term <hi rend="italic">Jäwi</hi> as applied to the Malay language.
                    This has its origin in the names Great Java and Lesser Java, by which the
                    mediaeval Java and Sumatra were called, and it accordingly means the language
                    spoken along the coasts of the two great islands. <hi rend="subscript">

                    Malacca. ' In other states of the peninsula (Johor, Tringganu, Kelantan)
                    dialectical divergencies both as to pronunciation and the use of words have been
                    noted. The most important and the most interesting of all the Malay dialects is
                    that of Menangkabo (Menangkarbau) in the residency of Padang and in Upper Jambi,
                    in Central Sumatra. It abounds in diphthongs, and prefers vocalic to consonantal
                    terminations, thus changing final <hi rend="italic">al</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ar</hi> into α <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi>, <hi rend="italic"

                    >orang, mungko</hi> for <hi rend="italic">maka, lai</hi> for <hi rend="italic"

                    llenchong character is in general use in writing this dialect, for which purpose
                    it is far better suited than the Arabic. As early as 1822 a small tract on the
                    customs and traditions of Moko-Moko, in this dialect, was printed with a
                    translation at Bencoolen. But it is only in recent years that the Dutch have
                    commenced to pay the dialect the attention it deserves, by publishing texts,
                    with transliteration and translations, and supplying other materials for its
                    investigation. See the <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journal</hi> of the Asiatic Societies of Batavia and the Hague, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Indische</hi><hi rend="italic">Gids,</hi> and more especially the
                    philological portion, by A. I.. van Hasselt, of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Midden-Sumatra,</hi> iii. 1 (Leyden, 1880), where also the best and fullest
                    account of the Renchong character is to be found. Of other Malay dialects in
                    Sumatra, only the one spoken at Achih (Achin) deserves mention; in Java the
                    Batavian dialect shows the most marked peculiarities. The numerous and greatly
                    divergent dialects spoken in the Molucca Islands (valuable information on which
                    has been supplied by F. S. A. de Clercq, G. W. W. C. van Hoeveil, and A. van
                    Ekris) and in Timor differ so materially from the Malay of the peninsula and of
                    Menangkabo that they cannot be called Malay dialects at all; whereas the Malay
                    spoken in some parts of the Minahassa (Celebes) scarcely differs from Malay
                    proper.</p>
                <p>There is no grammar of Malay by a native writer with the sole exception of a
                    small tract of 70 pages, entitled <hi rend="italic">Bustänu</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">lkdtibιn,</hi> by Raja Ali Hajji of Rhio,
                    which was lithographed in the island of Penengal in 1857. A. Pigafetta, who
                    accompanied Magellan in lιis first voyage round the globe, was the first
                    European whose vocabulary of Malay words (450) has come down to us. Next in the
                    field were the Dutch, who provided a medium of intercourse between their traders
                    and the Malays. F. Houtman’s <hi rend="italic">Vocabulary and Conversations, in
                    Dutch, Malay, and Malagasy,</hi> appeared at Amsterdam in 1603; and it may be
                    noted that the Malay spoken in those days does not appear to have materially
                    altered since. The same dialogues appeared in English and Malay in 1614. Since
                    then numerous grammars, dictionaries, and conversation books have been brought
                    out by English and Dutch writers. As the best helps at present available for the
                    study of Malay may be recommended W. E. Maxwell’s <hi rend="italic">Manual of

                    literature— the one in prose, the other in poetry. The former comprises the
                    proverbs, the latter the “pantuns.” “Agriculture, hunting, fishing, boating, and
                    wood-craft are the occupations or accomplishments which furnish most of the
                    illustrations, and the number of beasts, birds, fishes, and plants named in a
                    collection of Malay proverbs will be found to be considerable” (W. E. Maxwell,
                    <hi rend="italic">Malay Proverbs).</hi> H. C. Klinkert published a collection in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Bijdragen tot de taalkunde van</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >N.</hi><hi rend="italic">I.</hi> (Journal of the Asiatic Society of the Hague)
                    for 1866, pp. 39-87. See also J. Habbema on the Menangkabo proverbs,, in vols.

                    <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire Malais-Français,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >passim.</hi> The pantuns are improvised poems, generally (though not
                    necessarily) of four lines, in which the first and third andthe second and
                    fourth rhyme. They are mostly love poems; and their chief peculiarity is that
                    the meaning intended to be conveyed is expressed in the second couplet, whereas
                    the first contains a simile or distant allusion to the second, or often has,
                    beyond the rhyme, no connexion with the second at all. The Malays are fond of
                    reciting such rhymes “in alternate contest fir several hours, the preceding
                    pantun furnishing the catchword to that which follows, until one of the parties
                    be silenced or vanquished.” SeeT. J. Newbold, <hi rend="italic">Account of the
                    British Settlements in the Straits of Malacca,</hi> vol. ii. 346; Klinkert in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Bijdragen</hi> for 1868, pp. 309-70; I.. K. Harmsen in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Tijdschrift,</hi> vol. xxi. pp. 480-533 (Menangkabo). If the
                    Malays have kept entirely aloof from the influences of Islam in this the most
                    characteristic part of their literature, they have almost equally preserved
                    their independence in the other departments. Not that this may be considered
                    entirely to their credit; for, if they had endeavoured to infuse into their
                    writings some of the spirit of Arabic and Persian historiography, poetry, and
                    fiction, it could not but have benefited the character of their own literary
                    productions. As it is, their histories and chronicles are a strange motley of
                    truth and fiction; their poems and novels lack coherence and imagination, and
                    are singularly monotonous and devoid of that spirit of chivalry which pervades
                    the corresponding branches of literature among the leading nations of Islam. As
                    Malay copyists are much given to making arbitrary changes, it happens that no
                    two MSS. agree, and that of many a popular work different recensions exist,
                    which, moreover, often go by different names. This circumstance greatly tends to
                    increase the difficulties, of editing Malay texts. Works on specially Mohammedan
                    subjects (theology, law, ethics, mysticism) are of course only imitations of
                    Arabic or Persian originals; there are also numerous novels and poems treating
                    of purely Mohammedan legends. But not only is there traceable in many of these a
                    slight • undercurrent of Hinduism and even pre-Hinduism; the Malays possess
                    also, and indiscriminately read along with their Mohammedan books, quite as many
                    works of fiction of purely Hindu origin. The want, however, of political
                    cohesion, and of a national spirit among tribes so. scattered as the Malays are,
                    which could have favoured the growth of a national epic or national songs,
                    sufficiently accounts for the absence from their literature of any productions
                    of this class, such as exist in Bugi and Macassar literature. The most popular
                    of their poetical productions are the <hi rend="italic">Shdir Ken Jambuhan,
                    Sha'ir</hi><hi rend="italic">Bidäsäri,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sha'ir

                    'Abdu'lmuluk,</hi> all of which have been printed. Among the prose works there
                    are various collections of local laws and customs <hi rend="italic"
                    >{undang-undang),</hi> chronicles (such as the <hi rend="italic">Sajarat

                    ssalätin,</hi> and a very large number of works of fiction and legendary lore,
                    some of which possess much descriptive power. They all bear the title Hikayat

                    without translation} chiefly in Holland, Batavia, and Singapore, and extracts
                    have been given in the various Malay chrestomathies by Dulaurier, De Hollander,
                    Niemann, Van der Tuuk, Grashuis, and in Marsden’s <hi rend="italic">Malay
                    Grammar.</hi> The best recent Malay writer was ‘Abdullah ibn *Abdelkadir Münshi
                    of Singapore, who died, it is said of poison, at Mecca, some eight and twenty
                    years ago. His autobiography, “journey to Kelantan,” and “pilgrimage to Mecca”
                    are patterns of Malay style, though the author’s contact with educated Europeans
                    is traceable in them, while his translation (from the Tamil version) of the <hi

                <p>Malay literature is fairly represented in England in the British Museum, the
                    India Office, and the Royal Asiatic Society, and descriptive catalogues of the
                    Malay MSS. in each of these libraries are available. See Niemann in the <hi

                    Malay MSS., upwards of 400 volumes, is in the library of the Asiatic Society of
                    Batavia. See I..∙ W. C. van den Berg, <hi rend="italic">Verslag van eene

                    been for the loss, by fire, on their passage from India, of three hundred Malay
                    MSS., the property of the late Sir T. S. Raffles, England would now boast of the
                    largest assemblage-of Malay MSS. in the world. On Malay literature in general
