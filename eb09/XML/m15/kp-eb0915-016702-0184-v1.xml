                <p><label type="entry">MACROBIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Ambrosius
                        Theodosius</hi></label>, a Roman grammarian and philosopher, who wrote
                    towards the beginning of the 5th century after Christ. He is described in the
                    superscription of the best MSS. as <hi rend="italic">vir clarissimus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">illustris</hi>; hence it has been
                    supposed that he is the Macrobius who was <hi rend="italic">praefectus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">prκioriιιs Hispaniarum</hi> in 399 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >a.d.,</hi> proconsul of Africa in 410, and chamberlain <hi rend="italic"
                        >(praepositus sacri cubiculi)</hi> in 422. But the tenure of high office at
                    that date was limited to Christians, and there is no evidence in the writings of
                    Macrobius that he was a Christian. On the contrary, he shows great interest in
                    the deities of paganism; his friends seem to have belonged wholly to the pagan
                    party; and his philosophical views are those of the Neo-Platonists. Hence the
                    identification is more than doubtful. It is possible, but by no means certain,
                    that he was the Theodosius to whom Avianus dedicates his fables. From the date
                    of the persons who are mentioned by him as contemporaries, he appears to have
                    flourished in the time of Honorius.</p>
                <p>The most important of his works is the <hi rend="italic">Conviviorum
                        Saturnaliorum-Libri Septem,</hi> containing an account of the discussions
                    held at the house of Vettius Praetextatus during the holiday of the Saturnalia.
                    The latter part of the second book and the beginning of the third, the second
                    half of the fourth book, and the end of the seventh havebeen lost; otherwise the
                    work is in fairly good preservation. It was written by the author for the
                    benefit of his son Eustachius, and contains a great variety of curious
                    historical, mythological, critical, and grammatical disquisitions, the value of
                    which is much increased by the frequent quotations from earlier writers. The
                    machinery is somewhat cumbrous; for, as in some of Plato’s dialogues, the
                    discussions are not .directly reported, but a certain Postumianus reproduces,
                    for his friend Decius, the account which he had received from a rhetorician
                    Eusebius, who had been present at them. There is but little attempt to give any
                    dramatic character to the dialogue; in each book some one of the personages
                    takes the leading part, and the remarks of the others serve only as occasions
                    for calling forth fresh displays of erudition. The first book is devoted to an
                    inquiry as to the origin of the Saturnalia and the festivals of Janus, which
                    leads to a history and discussion of the Roman calendar, and to an attempt to
                    derive all forms of worship from that of the sun. The second book begins with a
                    collection of <hi rend="italic">bons</hi><hi rend="italic">mots,</hi> to which
                    all present make their contributions, many of them being ascribed to Cicero and
                    Augustus; it then appears to have passed into a discussion of various pleasures,
                    especially of the senses; but almost the whole of this is lost. The third,
                    fourth, fifth, and sixth books are devoted to Virgil, dwelling respectively on
                    his learning in religious matters, his rhetorical skill, his debt to Homer (with
                    a comparison of the art of the two) and to other Greek writers, and the nature
                    and extent of his borrowings from the earlier Latin poets. The latter part of
                    the third book is taken up with a dissertation upon luxury and the sumptuary
                    laws intended to check it, which is probably a dislocated portion of the second
                    book, being entirely out of place where it stands. The seventh book is of a more
                    miscellaneous character, consisting largely of the discussion of various
                    physiological questions. The value of the work consists solely in the facts and
                    opinions quoted from earlier writers, for it is purely a compilation, and has
                    little in its literary form to recommend it.</p>
                <p>We have also two books of a commentary on the <hi rend="italic">Somnium
                        Scipionis</hi> narrated by Cicero in his <hi rend="italic">De RepubUca.</hi>
                    The nature of the dream, in which the elder Scipio appears to his (adopted)
                    grandson, and describes the life of the good after death and the constitution of
                    the universe from the Stoic point of view, gives occasion for Macrobius to
                    discourse upon many points of physics in a series of essays interesting as
                    showing the astronomical notions then current. The moral elevation of the
                    fragment of Cicero thus preserved to us gave the work a popularity in the Middle
                    Ages to which its own merits have little claim.</p>
                <p>There is a good critical edition of Macrobius, with a commentary by I.. van Jan
                    (2 vols., Leipsic, 1848-52), and a convenient and excellent edition of the text
                    by F. Eyssenhardt (Leipsic, 1868).</p>
