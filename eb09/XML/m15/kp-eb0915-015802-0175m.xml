                    school and university of Edinburgh, and was afterwards articled to Mr Inglis,
                    who was then attorney for the crown in the management of exchequer affairs. To
                    this comfortable post the author in due time succeeded, and perhaps knew as
                    little as any of that tribe ever did about the struggles and sorrows of a
                    literary career. For his work’s sake it would have been better if he had
                    travelled some of life’s rougher paths, or else been content to write about what
                    he had actually seen in the Scottish world of that day. There was plenty of
                    material there if he had had the open eye to see it, as "Walter Scott showed by
                    and by; and it is a pity that Mackenzie did not try his hand at it, having been
                    more in the heart of it than Scott could ever have been. As it is, his stories
                    are clearly not the fruit of his experience, but rather the echo of his reading.
                    He could write graceful enough sentences, somewhat artificial, yet smooth and
                    pointed; but the men he describes are mere shadows, and the life altogether
                    unreal. His first and best-known work, <hi rend="italic">The Man of
                    Feeling,</hi> was published anonymously when he was only twenty-six years of
                    age, and soon became highly popular. It was a droughty season in Scottish
                    literature, and therefore any little blossom, however sickly, was welcome for
                    its rarity. Hume and Robertson and Smith had left the scene; Burns was just
                    learning to think of the daisy he turned up with his ploughshare, and Fergusson
                    had lately closed his brief and troubled career. Mackenzie had the field all to
                    himself, and got the attention which is given to a solitary figure. He had read
                    the <hi rend="italic">Sentimental Journey,</hi> as one can see from expressions
                    here and there, as well as from the affectation of writing his story in a
                    fragmentary form; but he had not a gleam of Sterne’s humour to relieve the
                    sentimentality. He had read Richardson too, but he had none of that writer’s
                    subtle insight into character. Perhaps Goldsmith was his real model, but the
                    likeness was as that between a firefly and a star. The “man of feeling” is a
                    weak foolish creature, possessed with a futile benevolence, who goes up to
                    London, where his friends should never have let him go, and meets a variety of
                    sharpers, and comes out of their hands pretty much as Goldsmith makes the
                    vicar’s son do, only without the fun that clings to poor Moses. For this book is
                    all in one key, sentimental and lachrymose, and the hero dies at last, from no
                    particular cause, in a highly tragic fashion beside his fainting mistress. His
                    next work, <hi rend="italic">The Man of the World,</hi> is the picture of a born
                    villain, a rogue in grain, who begins his rascality at school, perhaps earlier,
                    and carries it through with entire consistency to the end. The man is
                    unnaturally bad, and the incidents are badly unnatural; and such a book at
                    present would only find a place in some third-rate penny paper, if even there.
                    <hi rend="italic">Julia de Roubigηe,</hi> his only other novelette, was meant to
                    depict the misfortunes of a number of quite blameless people—to be, in short, a
                    tragedy without a villain, an <hi rend="italic">Othello</hi> without an Iago.
                    But, as it has no insight, and does not even try to have any insight, into the
                    mystery of such’ calamities, the result is insipid and tedious. All these works
                    had great popularity in their day; but that day is long past, and what life they
                    now have is only a tradition.</p>
                <p>Mackenzie also wrote several dramas, mostly of the tragic sort, for in that tone
                    he had won his successes, such <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n176/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0176-0159"/> as they were. But one who had no conception of
                    distinct character, of human individuality, was not likely to succeed in the
                    drama, which depends more on that than on anything; and hence it was not our
                    author’s good fortune to deliver his country from the stigma of never having
                    produced a genuine tragedy. Of <hi rend="italic">The Spanish Father, The Prince
                    of Tunis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Shipwreck,</hi> the second was brought
                    on the stage, and managed to live for six nights; the other two were stillborn,
                    and probably no man living·has ever read them, unless for purely critical
                    purposes.</p>
                <p>But Mackenzie, if nowise a great writer, but quite otherwise essentially a small
                    writer, with a knack of making sentences indeed, but having nothing particular
                    of his own to say, was not therefore altogether a useless man in his day. That
                    he did well for himself, and perhaps for the exchequer too, is quite likely,
                    even though he toiled in the high-Tory service of Dundas, and wrote tracts meant
                    to “broom” out of the country the tide of French Revolutionary notions. At any
                    rate he became in his old age a kind of literary centre and social power in
                    Edinburgh, when that was really needed and useful. He had known John Home and
                    blind Dr Blacklock, and wrote lives of them; but, what is of more consequence,
                    he was among the first to recognize the genius of Robert Burns, as editor of <hi
                    rend="italic">The Lounger,</hi> which he and a group of young men with some
                    literary tastes wrote and printed for some years. Yet, though he once
                    breakfasted with Johnson, and certainly met Burns more than once, he has told us
                    nothing about either of them, though a page of Burns’s talk would have been
                    worth all <hi rend="italic">The Man of Feeling</hi> twice told. It was so far
                    good, however, that he hailed the peasant poet cordially, which we could hardly
                    have hoped so artificial a writer would do, and even better that he noticed the
                    dawn of German literature when Lessing and Schiller rose above the horizon, and
                    not only wrote some account of them, taken from French sources, but boldly set
                    to the study of German that he might really know them at first hand. How far he
                    went in that study we do not know, only he set young Walter Scott on the scent,
                    with results such as he himself could never have imagined. So he lived on, a
                    kind of small king in the Edinburgh literary world, till 1831, dying in his
                    eighty-sixth year, with a wonderful new world around him, which had not yet
                    begun to criticize, but only to admire and honour him.</p>
