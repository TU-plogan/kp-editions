                    rend="italic">Chelidon urbica</hi> of modern ornithologists, a bird very well
                    known throughout Europe, including even Lapland, where it is abundant, retiring
                    in winter to the south of Africa.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Since the publication of the account of this species in
                    YarrelΓs <hi rend="italic">British Birds</hi> (ed. 4, ii. p. 354), Mr Gurney has
                    informed the writer of a specimen obtained out of a migratory flock flying very
                    high on the Qua'qua’ river, lat. 19° 10' S., by the expedition of Messrs Jameson
                    and Ayres, 23d October 1880.</p></note> It also inhabits the western part of
                    Asia, and appears from time to time in large flocks in India; but the boundaries
                    of its range and those of at least one of its Eastern congeners cannot as yet be
                    laid down. The Martin (or House-Martin, as it is often called, to distinguish it
                    from the Sand-Martin presently to be mentioned) commonly reaches its
                    summer-quarters a few days later than the <hi rend="smallcaps">Swallow</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> whose habits its own so much resemble that heedless
                    persons often disregard the very perceptible differences between them, the
                    Martin’s white rump and lower parts being conspicuous as it flies or clings to
                    its “loved mansionry” attached to our houses, for, as Shakespeare wrote—</p>
                <p>“No jutty, frieze, Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird Hath made his
                    pendent bed and procreant cradle.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">—Macbeth,</hi> act i. sc. 6.</p>
                <p>This nest, made of the same material as the Swallow’s, is, however, a far more
                    difficult structure to rear, and a week or more is often occupied in laying its
                    foundations— the builders clinging to the wall while depositing the mud of which
                    it is composed. But, the base once securely fixed, the superstructure is often
                    quickly added till the whole takes the shape of the half or quarter of a
                    hemisphere, and a lining of soft feathers, mixed with a few bents or straws,
                    fits it for its purpose. The Martin sets about building very soon after its
                    return, and a nest that has outlasted the winter’s storms is almost at once
                    reoccupied; though if a new nest be needed its construction often involves great
                    delay, for any excess of wet or drought retards the operation, and the work is
                    generally placed in such an exposed situation that heavy driving rains will
                    frequently wash away the half-dried walls. However, the bird mostly perseveres
                    against these and other untowardnesses, contriving in the course of the summer
                    to raise a second or, rarely, a third brood of offspring—though it is certain
                    that the latest broods often die in the nest—apparently through failure of food.
                    Yet what seem to be adults of this species are observed in England every year so
                    late as November, and there are several instances of its appearance within a few
                    days of the winter solstice; but it is to be remarked that these late birds are
                    almost certainly strangers, and not natives of the locality in which they are
                    seen.</p>
                <p>The Sand-Martin, <hi rend="italic">Hirundo</hi><hi rend="italic">riparia</hi> of
                    Linnaeus and <hi rend="italic">Cotile riparia</hi> of modern writers, differs
                    much in appearance and habits from the former. Its smaller size, mousecoloured
                    upper surface, and jerking flight ought to render it easily recognizable from
                    the other British <hi rend="italic">Hirundinidx;</hi> but through carelessness
                    it is seldom discriminated, and, being the first of the Family to return to its
                    northern home, the “early Swallow” of newspaper-writers would seem to be nearly
                    always of this species. Instead of the clay-built nest of the House-Martin, this
                    bird bores, with a degree of regularity and an amount of labour rarely excelled
                    in its Class, horizontal galleries in a natural or artificial escarpment. When
                    beginning its excavation, it clings to the face of the bank, and with its bill
                    loosens the earth, working from the centre outwards, assuming all sorts of
                    positions—as often as not hanging head downwards. The form of the boring and its
                    length depend much on the nature of the soil; but the tunnel may extend to 4, G,
                    or even 9 feet. The gallery seems intended to be straight, but inequalities of
                    the ground, and especially the meeting with stones, often cause it to take a
                    sinuous course. At the end is formed a convenient chamber lined with a few grass
                    stalks and feathers, the latter always beautifully arranged, and upon them the
                    eggs are laid. The Sand-Martin has several broods in the year, and is much more
                    regular than other <hi rend="italic">Hirundinidae</hi> in its departure for the
                    south. The kind of soil needed for its nestinghabits makes it a somewhat local
                    bird; but no species of the Order <hi rend="italic">Passeres</hi> has a
                    geographical range that can compare with this. In Europe it is found nearly to
                    the North Cape, and thence to the Sea of Okhotsk. In winter it visits many parts
                    of India, and South Africa to the Transvaal territory. In America its range is
                    even more extraordinary, extending (due regard being of course had to the season
                    of the year) from Melville Island to Caiçara in Brazil, and from Newfoundland to
                    Alaska.</p>
                <p>The Purple Martin of America,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In 1840 an example is said to have been killed at Kingstown
                    in Ireland, the skin of which is in the Dublin Museum of Science and
                    Art.</p></note><hi rend="italic">Hirundo</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Progne</hi><hi rend="italic">purpurea,</hi> requires some remarks as being such
                    a favourite bird in Canada and in the United States. Naturally breeding in
                    hollow trees, it readily adapts itself to the nest-boxes which are very commonly
                    set up for its accommodation; but its numbers are in some years and places
                    subject to diminution in a manner which has not yet been satisfactorily
                    explained. The limits of its range in winter are not determined, chiefly owing
                    to the differences of opinion as to the validity of certain supposed kindred
                    species found in South America; but according to some authorities it reaches the
                    border of Patagonia, while in summer it is known to inhabit lands within the
                    Arctic Circle. The male is almost wholly of a glossy steel-blue, while the
                    female is much duller in colour above, and beneath of a brownish-grey.</p>
