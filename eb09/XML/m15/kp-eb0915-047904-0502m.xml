                    Ilmenau and Elgersburg, Thuringia; near Giessen, North Hesse; near
                    Mährisch-Trübau, Moravia; and in Spain. Almost all pyrolusite is contaminated

                    distinguished from it by their greater hardness and other physical properties.
                    Closely allied to psilomelan are those earthy, massive, or reniform mineral
                    mixtures known as “bog-manganese,” “cupreous manganese,” “earthy cobalt.” In the
                    two last-named the RO is chiefly CuO and CoO respectively. We must here mention
                    those curious formations known as “manganese nodules” which were so frequently
                    dredged up by the “Challenger” expedition, and with which, it seems, large areas
                    of the ocean’s bed are thickly covered. The writer found in one of these, which
                    seemed exceptionally rich in manganese, 20 ’ 12 per cent, of binoxide of
                    manganese (fully oxidized), 0 ’ 4 of oxide of nickel, 0∙25 of cobalt, and 0 ’ 27
                    of copper,—a total of 21Ό4 per cent, of the psilomelanic part, not reckoning the
                    CaO, MgO, &amp;c., belonging to it. All the manganese ores named are available
                    for the manufacture of chlorine, and indeed are so used, as components of what
                    goes in the arts as “manganese.”</p>
                <p>The industrial value of a “manganese” depends, of course, on its actual or
                    virtual percentage of binoxide. A convenient method for its determination was
                    worked out by Fresenius and Will, on the basis of a reaction long before
                    discovered by Turner. When MnO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is brought in
                    contact with aqueous sulphuric and oxalic acids, it is reduced to MnO (-salt)
                    with formation of carbonic acid; thus: MnO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + C <hi

                <p>For the making of manganese preparations, high class-pyrolusite is the most
                    convenient raw material.</p>
                <p>Metallic manganese may be prepared by intimately mixing it with lamp-black and
                    heating the mixture to whiteness in a blast furnace. But the regulus thus
                    obtained contains a large percentage of combined carbon. A purer metal was
                    obtained by Deville, who started with perfectly pure “red oxide,” Mn <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, and heated it along
                    with a proportion of sugar-charcoal insufficient for complete reduction in a
                    double crucible made of quicklime. The unreduced oxide (MnO) and part of the
                    lime fuse together into a violet slag, from which the regulus is easily
                    separated. Brunner’s manganese (obtained by the reduction<pb break="no"

                    is not manganese at all, but a silicide of the metal.</p>
                <p>Hugo Tamm, who endeavoured to work out a process for the manufacture of the
                    metal, gives the following process 11 parts of good pyrolusite is mixed with 1
                    part of lamp-black and 6 parts of a flux consisting of 20 parts of lead-free
                    bottle-glass, 7 parts of quicklime, and 7 of fluor-spar; and the mixture is
                    strongly heated, in a graphite crucible coated over with a mixture of 3 parts of
                    graphite and 1 part of clay, by means of a blast-furnace. There is formed a
                    regulus covered by a green silicious slag containing much protoxide of
                    mapganese. The “raw” manganese thus produced is contaminated with about 1 per
                    cent, each of iron, silicon, and carbon, and traces of sulphur, phosphorus,
                    calcium, and aluminium. The green slag in subsequent operations is substituted
                    for part of the white flux. The raw metal, when re-fused with about one-third of
                    its weight of manganous carbonate, yielded a regulus which contained 99'9 per
                    cent, of the metal,—the remaining <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛ per cent,
                    consisting of carbon, silicon, and iron.</p>
                <p>Manganese metal is grey, like cast iron (Deville’s had a reddish hue like
                    bismuth); its specific gravity is about 8; it is hard and brittle, and about as
                    difficult to fuse as wrought iron. It readily tarnishes in ordinary air; even
                    pure water, and much more dilute acid, attack it with evolution of hydrogen and
                    formation of manganous (MnO) hydrate or salt. It is worth stating that neither
                    MnO nor MnCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is reducible at a red heat by hydrogen
                    gas; yet Bunsen succeeded in obtaining metallic manganese by the electrolysis of
                    a concentrated solution of the chloride, using a strong current and a negative
                    electrode of very small area.</p>

                    keeping the pure nitrate at 200° C. But really pure nitrate is hard to procure.
                    Perhaps the only method for obtaining a really pure preparation is Volhard’s: 10
                    grammes of “pure” (iron-and cobalt-free) manganous sulphate is dissolved in
                    half, a litre of water and 100 cm. of nitric acid of 1 ’ 2 specific gravity; the
                    solution is heated to boiling, and strong solution of permanganate of potash
                    added until the MnO is nearly but not quite down, and the mixture kept for a
                    while on a water-bath. The precipitate of binoxide formed (according to equation
                    Mn <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> + 3MnO = 5MnO <hi

                    water, and dried (when it retains some combined water).</p>
                <p>When binoxide of manganese is heated to redness—in vacuum, air, oxygen,
                    nitrogen—it loses oxygen with formation of lower oxides. This phenomenon was
                    investigated by W. Dittmar, who found that, when the binoxide is heated in a
                    constantly renewed atmosphere, the result, for a given temperature, depends only
                    on the partial tension of the oxygen in that atmosphere. Pure (brown-red) Mn <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> remains when this
                    tension is less, while (black) Mn <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi

                    limit value <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> In Dittmar’s experiments (which were all
                    made at a temperature somewhat above the melting point of sterling silver), the
                    value <hi rend="italic">p</hi> was found to lie close to 26 cm. of mercury. An
                    exact determination of this critical point was not possible, because the

                    equivalent to a diminution in the partial tension of the·oxygen. Hence,

                <p>The protoxide, MnO, is most readily obtained by heating any higher oxide to
                    redness in a current of hydrogen gas, as a dull green powder which gets readily
                    discoloured by oxidation in ordinary air. It is not acted on by water, but
                    readily dissolves in aqueous acids, with formation of manganous salts.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sulphate,</hi> MnSO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, is
                    prepared by making pyrolusite into a paste with concentrated sulphuric acid and
                    then heating in a crucible to dull redness until vapours of the acid cease to
                    come off. The ferric and aluminic sulphates (originally present) are now, at
                    least mostly, decomposed and reduced to insoluble basic salts, so that the
                    residue when treated with water and filtered may yield a solution free of these
                    impurities, and, of course, of baryta.</p>
                <p>Should any iron or alumina be left it is easily eliminated by digestion with a
                    little carbonate of manganese (prepared from a small portion of the solution by
                    precipitation with carbonate of soda) and filtration. Cobalt and nickel, if
                    present, can be removed by fractional precipitation with sulphide of sodium (or

                    MnS afterwards. But lime, magnesia, and alkalies (which are frequently present)
                    are very difficult to get rid of. Compare the section on binoxide. The salt,
                    according to the temperature at which it crystallizes, takes up 7 or 5 or 4 or
                    even 3 or 1 H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. Crystallized sulphate of manganese
                    generally exhibits a rose-red tint; but this is owing to the presence of a trace
                    of manganic salt (if not to cobalt salt). The pure salt is colourless.</p>

                    atmosphere with formation of a brown precipitate of a higher oxide. If,
                    immediately after addition of the ammonia, the excess of volatile alkali is
                    chased away by boiling, the resulting (neutral or slightly acid) liquor remains
                    clear, even in air. Hereupon is founded a method for the separation of ferric

                    green solution, when the whole of the manganese assumes the permanganate form: K

                <p>From the purple liquid crystals of permanganate are easily obtained by
                    evaporation. The crystals (long prisms) are isomorphous with perchlorate of
                    potash, KC10 <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. They are soluble in 16 parts of cold
                    and far less of hot water. They are almost black, and endowed with a peculiar
                    greenish or bluish metallic lustre. Their powder is red. Their aqueous solution
                    is most intensely purple, one milligramme of the salt giving a perceptible
                    colour to a whole litre and more of water. On addition of acid the solution,
                    through liberation of Mn <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">
                    7</hi>, becomes pink.</p>
                <p>Of all wet-way reagents, manganates and permanganates are the most powerful
                    oxidizing agents, especially when they are employed in conjunction with free
                    alkali, or (the permanganates) along with free mineral acid. By one or the other
                    of the two combinations most oxidizable inorganic and almost all organic
                    substances are promptly oxidized. Hence both manganates and permanganates are
                    extensively employed as disinfectants, and, in chemical laboratories, as
                    oxidizing agents. For the former purpose impure forms of the soda salts are
                    generally used, while pure permanganate of potash, nowadays, is exclusively
                    employed for scientific or analytical laboratory work.</p>
                <p>The ultimate fate of the reagent depends on whether alkali or acid was used as an
                    auxiliary agent. In the former case the salt passes successively into (green)
                    manganate and (insoluble brown) hydrated binoxide of manganese,—three-sevenths
                    of the oxygen in the Mn <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript">
                    7</hi> being utilized. In the presence of free acid (sulphuric works best) the
                    Mn <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> loses
                    five-sevenths of its oxygen with formation of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >colourless</hi> solution of manganous (Mnθj salt. Hence, supposing such a
                    change to take place promptly, and the reagent to be added gradually, the exact
                    point of completed oxidation is reached when the liquid, by the addition of
                    another drop of the permanganate, assumes a permanent pink colour. This is the
                    principle of a number of processes for the determination of certain reducing
                    agents by means of a standard solution of permanganate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Analysis.—</hi> A manganiferous substance when fused up with
                    carbonate of soda on platinum in the presence of air yields a green mass
                    (manganate), the colour being more distinct after cooling. Manganese oxides,
                    when fused up with a borax bead in the oxidizing flame, impart to it an intense
                    amethyst colour, which disappears in the reducing flame. To detect manganese in
                    a solution of mineral salts, we first eliminate what can be precipitated by
                    sulphuretted hydrogen in the presence of mineral acid. In the filtrate the iron
                    (if present) is oxidized by boiling with a granule of chlorate of potash, and
                    the ferric oxide precipitated along with the alumina by addition of sal-ammoniac
                    and excess of ammonia, and boiling off the free volatile alkali. From the
                    filtrate the manganese is precipitated by sulphide of ammonium, as a sulphide
                    which, when pure, exhibits a delicate flesh-red colour but is readily
                    discoloured, by oxidation, when in contact with air. Cobalt, nickel, and zinc,
                    if present, go down with the manganese, but can be eliminated by treatment of
                    the washed sulphides with acetic acid, which dissolves the manganese only. (W.
