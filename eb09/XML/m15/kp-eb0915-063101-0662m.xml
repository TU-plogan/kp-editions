                    was the most learned and widely known of a family which through four generations
                    enjoyed singular consideration, and exercised commanding influence upon New
                    England in its first century. Richard, son of Thomas Mather of Lowton (Winwick),
                    Lancashire, England, after studying for a time at Brasenose, Oxford, and
                    teaching and subsequently preaching at Toxteth Park, went to New England, for
                    nonconformity’s sake, in the summer of 1635, where, till his death in 1669, at
                    seventy-three, he was pastor of the Congregational church in Dorchester (now a
                    part of Boston),—acquiring large repute, writing three or four instructive and
                    constructive treatises upon polity, and being much trusted as to the foundations
                    of both church and state. His youngest son Increase took his first degree at
                    Harvard College in 1656, at seventeen,—returning, after a visit to the old
                    country, in which he served several pulpits, to take at twenty-five the
                    pastorate of the second (or North) church in Boston, which place he held till
                    his death in 1723 at eighty-five, while, in addition, he had been acting, or
                    actual, president of the college most of the time from 1681 to 1701, the author
                    of one hundred and sixty books or tracts, and for four of its most perilous
                    years the choice of all its citizens to represent the Massachusetts colony
                    before the English Government. His wife Maria was daughter of the famous John
                    Cotton, and their first-born received both family names, and when he took his
                    B.A. degree at less than sixteen, at Harvard, in 1678, his promise tempted
                    President Oakes to say in his presence, referring to his two distinguished
                    grandfathers: “Cottonus atque Matherus tam re quam nomine coalescant et
                    reviviscant.” After a short time spent as tutor, and a period of diligent toil
                    ending in the conquest of an impediment of speech which endangered success in
                    the family profession, he became assistant to his father, in two years being
                    ordained copastor, and holding the pulpit for nearly three and forty years, till
                    his death at sixty-five. As a private Christian, from his frank diaries, it is
                    clear that he laboured much with himself, in a single year devoting more than
                    sixty days to fasting and twenty nights to vigil. As a preacher he was
                    conscientious and successful,—always diligently studying his discourses, in one
                    year delivering more than seventy public sermons, with nearly half as many in
                    private houses, sometimes thus “pressing a glorious Christ” through eleven
                    successive days, and, with six competitors by his side, maintaining to the last
                    his hold upon the largest congregation in New England, having about four hundred
                    gifted communicants. As a pastor he was exceptionally laborious,—systematically
                    exhorting and praying with his people at their homes, making conscience of
                    spiritualizing every casual interview, and now and then spending days upon his
                    knees with the names of his flock before him to prompt his intercessions for
                    them, and for himself that he might better reach their peculiar need. As a
                    philanthropist, while abundant in personal benefactions, he originated more than
                    twenty societies for public charity, bore the cost of a school for
                    Christianizing the negroes, and, at the risk of life, in the face of popular
                    opposition medically led, advocated and vindicated the introduction of
                    inoculation as a protection against the then terrible ravages of the small-pox.
                    As an author he was learned—publishing in French, Spanish, and Algonkin as well
                    as English—and voluminous, three hundred and eighty-two of his printed works
                    having been catalogued, several of which are elaborate books, and one a folio of
                    800 pages; while his <hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Americana,</hi> by him considered the great work of his life, remains in six
                    huge volumes of manuscript to this day. As a scholar he was better known across
                    the sea than any other American of his time, once contemporaneously
                    corresponding with more than fifty learned Europeans, in his forty-seventh year
                    being made doctor of divinity at Glasgow, and receiving election as a Fellow of
                    the Royal Society—in those days eminent distinctions for a colonist. With all
                    this it must be confessed that he had some grave defects. His common sense was
                    not uniformly equal to his need. Always ambitious and self-opinioned, he was
                    occasionally irritable and conceited. He lacked good taste, and it was his
                    unconcealed grief that he was never elected to preside over Harvard College. His
                    enormous knowledge did not digest well, and his use of learning tended to be
                    crude. He was superstitious, and it was his misfortune that, as to witchcraft,
                    he was not, as with vaccination, in advance of his generation, any more than
                    such men as Richard Baxter and Sir Matthew Hale. Of his works, the <hi
