                    do justice in the present day. His faults are of the most glaring kind; they are
                    exhibited without the least concealment; and they are of the sort of which
                    modern feeling is most intolerant. Living as he did under perhaps the worst of
                    the many bad emperors who ruled the world in the 1st century, he addresses him
                    and his favourites with the most servile flattery in his lifetime, reviles him
                    immediately after his death (xii. 6), and offers equally fulsome incense at the
                    shrine of his successor. No writer of equal genius has ever shown such an
                    absence of dignity and independence of character in his relation to his richer
                    friends and patrons. He is not ashamed <pb break="no"

                    his dinner, and even for his dress. We cannot feel sure that even what seem his
                    sincerest tributes of regard may not be prompted by the hope of payment.
                    Further, there is no book in any literature which, both in expression and in the
                    things treated of, sins so flagrantly against all instincts of propriety. A
                    certain proportion of the epigrams in every book—perhaps one-fifth or one-sixth
                    (in some books the proportion is much larger)—can be read by no class of readers
                    with any other feelings than those of extreme distaste.</p>
                <p>These faults are so unmistakable and undeniable that many readers of ancient
                    literature have formed their whole estimate of Martial from them, and have
                    declined to make any further acquaintance with him. Even those who greatly
                    admire his genius, who find the freshest interest in his representation of Roman
                    life and his sketches of manners and character, and who, after admitting the
                    unfavourable first impression which he is bound to make, believe that they still
                    can discern sufficient indications of the better nature which made him a popular
                    and likeable man in his day, do not attempt to palliate his faults, though they
                    may partially account for them by reference to the morals of his age and the
                    circumstances of his life. The time when “the last of the Flavian line was
                    tearing in pieces the half-lifeless world, and Rome was a bondslave to a bald
                    Nero,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cum iam
                    semianimum laceraret Flavius orbem Ultimus, et calvo serviret Roma Neroni.—Juv.,
                    iv. 37.</p></note> was one when literature had either to be silent or to be
                    servile. Martial was essentially a man of letters; there was no other métier for
                    which he was fitted; he was bound either to gain favour by his writings or to
                    starve. Tacitus and Juvenal might have chosen the latter alternative, but they
                    were fortunately spared the necessity of making the choice by the possession of
                    independent means. Even Statius, the contemporary of Martial, whose writings are
                    in other respects irreproachable, is nearly as fulsome in his adulation as
                    Martial. The relation of client to patron had been recognized as an honourable
                    one by the best Roman traditions. No blame had attached to Virgil or Horace on
                    account of the favours which they received from Augustus and Maecenas, or of the
                    return which they made for these favours in their verse. That old honourable
                    relationship had, however, greatly changed its character between the era of
                    Augustus and that of Domitian. Men of good birth and education, and sometimes
                    even of high official position (Juv., i. 117), were not ashamed to gain or
                    increase their living by the acceptance of money doles to provide their daily
                    meal. “Atria magna colam” is the resource of a man who was too lazy or too
                    incompetent to become an advocate, and who thought himself too much of a
                    gentleman to adopt any mechanical trade. Martial was merely following a general
                    fashion in paying his court to “a lord.” “Rex” is.the common term used for a
                    patron. He made the best of the custom. In his earlier career he used to
                    accompany his patrons to their villas at Baiae or Tibur, and to attend their
                    morning levées. Later on he went to his own small country house, near Nomentum,
                    and sent a poem, or a small volume of his poems, as his representative, at the
                    early visit. If his patron was courteous and liberal, he became his friend and
                    entertained him with his wit and social vivacity. If he was mean and exacting,
                    he found in him a subject for his epigrams. The fault of grossness Martial
                    shares with nearly all ancient and many modern writers who treat of life from
                    the baser or more ridiculous side. That he offends worse than perhaps any of
                    them is to be explained, not, apparently, on the ground that he was more of a
                    libertine in his life, but on the ground that he had to amuse a public which had
                    become more corrupt than in any other civilized era. Although there is the most
                    cynical effrontery and want of self-respect in Martial’s use of language, there
                    is not much trace of the satyr in him,—much less, many readers will think, than
                    in Juvenal. Neither is it at all true, as is said by historians of Roman
                    literature (W. S. Teuffel, vol. ii. 317, 5), that his epigrams mostly deal with
                    this side of life. At least four-fifths of them are unexceptionable in subject
                    and treatment.</p>
                <p>Our knowledge of Martial’s life is derived almost entirely from himself. His
                    writings do not, like those of Horace, supply materials for a continuous
                    biography, nor do they lay bare every secret of his heart with the
                    self-absorption of Catullus. But, as he writes frankly about everything that
                    interested him, he has not only painted a very lifelike picture, or rather drawn
                    a multitude of very life-like sketches of Roman society in his time, but he has
                    clearly marked his own position in and his own relation to that society. His
                    criticism of men and manners enables us to judge of the standard which he
                    applied to life, of the things which he liked and disliked, and of his own
                    temper and disposition. Reference to public events enables us approximately to
                    fix the date of the publication of the different books of epigrams, and from
                    these dates to determine those of various important events in his life. Thus, as
                    in book x., which was published in 97 or perhaps 98 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> he is found celebrating his fifty-seventh birthday (x. 24), the date
                    of his birth may be assigned to the year 40 or 41. The place of his birth was
                    Bilbilis, or Augusta Bilbilis, in Spain, in a “barren and rugged country” near
                    the sources of the Tagus. His name seems to imply that he was born with the
                    rights of Roman citizenship, but he speaks of himself as “sprung from the Celts
                    and Iberians, and a countryman of the Tagus ”; and, in contrasting his own
                    masculine appearance with that of an effeminate Greek, he draws especial
                    attention to “his stiff Spanish hair ”—</p>
                <p>“Hispanis ego contumax capillis” (x. 65).</p>
                <p>In an epigram written nearly thirty years after his removal to Rome he piously
                    commends the soul of a little child, Erotion, to whom he was much attached, to
                    his parents Fronto and Flaccilla, who had gone before to the world of shades (v.
                    34). Their position in life seems to be indicated by such references to his
                    former home as the phrase “saturae sordida rura casae” (x. 96). His home was
                    evidently one of rude comfort and plenty, sufficiently in the country to afford
                    him the amusements of hunting and fishing, which he often recalls with a keen
                    sense of pleasure, and sufficiently near the town to afford him the
                    companionship of many comrades, the few survivors of whom he looks forward to
                    meet again after his five and thirty years absence (x. 104). The memories of
                    this old home, of Bilbilis on its mountain site, of the shallow, rapid Salo
                    flowing round the base of the hill (“fluctu tenui sed inquieto ”), of “Gaius
                    hoary with snow and sacred Vadavero with its broken cliffs,” of the ilex-grove
                    of Burado (iv. 55) “which even the laziest traveller walks through,” and of
                    other spots the rough names and local associations of which he delights to
                    introduce into his verse, attest the enjoyment which he had in his early life,
                    and were among the influences which kept his spirit thoroughly alive in the
                    midst of the deadening routine of social life in Rome. But his Spanish home
                    could impart, not only the vigorous vitality which was one condition of his
                    success as a wit and poet, but the education which made him so accomplished a
                    writer. The literary distinction obtained by the Senecas, by Lucan, by
                    Quintilian, who belonged to a somewhat older generation, and by his friends and
                    contemporaries Licinianus of Bilbilis, Decianus of Emerita, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n606/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0606-0579"/> Canius of Gades, proves how eagerly the novel
                    impulse of letters was received in Spain in the first century of the empire,
                    just as a similar impulse had been received in Cisalpine Gaul in the first half
                    of the first century before our era. The success of his countrymen may have been
                    the motive which induced Martial’s parents to prepare him for a literary
                    career,—</p>
                <p>“At me litterulas stulti docuere parentes” (ix. 73, 7), and which induced Martial
                    himself to remove to Rome when he had completed his education. This he must have
                    done some time before the fall, in 65 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> of Seneca
                    and Lucan, who were probably his earliest patrons. He speaks of the halls of the
                    Pisos and of Seneca as having been opened to him when he first went to Rome (iv.
                    40); and in epigrams, addressed to his widow nearly thirty years after the death
                    of Lucan, he speaks of him with grateful admiration, and applies to her the word
                    <hi rend="superscript"> ιr,</hi> Regina,” “his lady patroness.”</p>
                <p>Of the details of his life for the first twenty years or so after he came to Rome
                    we do not know much. He published some juvenile poems of which he thought very
                    little in his maturer years, and he laughs at a foolish bookseller who would not
                    allow them to die a natural death (i. 113). Martial had neither youthful passion
                    nor youthful enthusiasm to make him precociously a poet. His faculty ripened
                    with experience and with the knowledge of that social life which was both his
                    theme and his inspiration; and many of his best epigrams are among those written
                    in his last years. From many answers which he makes to the remonstrances of
                    friends,—among others to those of Quintilian,—it may be inferred that he was
                    urged to practise at the bar, but that he preferred his own lazy Bohemian kind
                    of life to more settled and remunerative modes of industry. He made many
                    influential friends and patrons, and secured the favour both of Titus and
                    Domitian. From them he obtained various privileges, among others the“semestris
                    tribunatus,” which conferred on him equestrian rank. He failed, however, in his
                    application to the latter for more substantial advantages, although he
                    commemorates the glory of having been invited to dinner by him, and also the
                    fact that he procured the privilege of citizenship for many persons in whose
                    behalf he appealed to him. The earliest of his extant works, that known by the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi><hi rend="italic">Spectaculorum,</hi> was
                    first published at the opening of the Colosseum in the reign of Titus; but the
                    book as it now stands was given to the world in or about the first year of
                    Domitian, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> about 81 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    The favour of the emperor procured him the countenance of some of the worst
                    creatures at the imperial court,—among them of the notorious Crispinus, of
                    Parthenius, Earinus, Regulus, and probably of Paris, the supposed author of
                    Juvenal’s exile, on whose death Martial afterwards wrote a eulogistic epitaph.
                    The two books numbered xiii. and xiv., and known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Xenia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Apophoreta,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> inscriptions of two lines for presents,—were published between 81 and 86
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> In that last year he gave to the world the first
                    two of the twelve books on which his reputation rests. From that time till his
                    return to Spain in 98 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> he published a volume
                    almost every year. The first nine books and the first edition of book x.
                    appeared in the reign of Domitian; and book xi..at the end of 96 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> shortly after the accession of Nerva. <hi
                    rend="italic">A.</hi> revised edition of book x., that which we now possess,
                    appeared in 98 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> about the time of the entrance of
                    Trajan into Rome. The last book was written after three years’ absence in Spain,
                    shortly before his death, which happened about the year 102 or 103 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi></p>
                <p>These twelve books bring Martial’s ordinary mode of life between the age of
                    five-and-forty and sixty very fully before us. His regular home for
                    five-and-thirty years was Rome. He lived at first up three pair of stairs (“et
                    scalis habito tribus sed altis,” i. 117), and his rooms overlooked the laurels
                    in front of the portico of Agrippa. He had a small and not very valuable country
                    house near Nomentum, in the Sabine territory, to which he occasionally retired
                    as a refuge from the bores and noises of the city (ii. 38, xii. 57). In his
                    later years he had a small house on the Quirinal, near the temple of Quirinus.
                    At the time when his third book was brought out he had retired for a short time
                    to Cisalpine Gaul, in weariness, as he tells us, of his unremunerative
                    attendance on the levées of the great—</p>
                <p>“Non poterat vanae taedia ferre togae” (iii. 4).</p>
                <p>For a time he seems to have felt the charm of the new scenes which he visited,
                    and in a later book (iv. 25) he contemplates, probably with a reminiscence of
                    Horace <hi rend="italic">(fid.</hi> ii. 6), the prospect of retiring to the
                    neighbourhood of Aquileia and the Timavus in his old age. But the spell
                    exercised over him by Rome and Roman society was too great to permit of a
                    prolonged absence; and even the epigrams sent from Forum Corneli and thβ
                    Aemilian Way ring much more erf the Roman Forum, and of the streets, baths,
                    porticos, and clubs of Rome, than of the places from which they are dated. So
                    too his motive for his final departure from Rome in 98 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> was a weariness of the burdens imposed on him by his social position,
                    and, apparently, the difficulties of meeting the ordinary expenses of living in
                    the metropolis (x. 96); and he looks forward, with a kind of “nostalgia,” to a
                    return to the scenes familiar to his youth. The well-known epigram addressed to
                    Juvenal (xii. 18) shows that for a time his ideal was realized; but the more
                    trustworthy evidence of the prose epistle prefixed to book xii. proves that his
                    contentment was of very short duration, and that he could not live happily away
                    from the literary and social pleasures of Rome (“bibliothecas, theatra,
                    convictus”), which supplied both the impulse to his genius and the material on
                    which it could exercise itself. The one consolation of his exile was the society
                    of a lady, Marcella, of whom he writes rather as if she were his patroness,—and
                    it seems to have been a necessity of his being to have always a patron or
                    patroness,—than his wife or mistress. His delight in her society arose from his
                    finding in her one who, though born and bred in this remote province, yet by her
                    natural grace and accomplishment revived for him the charm of Rome.</p>
                <p>During his life there, although he never rose to a position of real independence,
                    and had always a hard struggle with poverty, he seems to have known everybody,
                    especially every one of any eminence at the bar or in literature. In addition to
                    Lucan and Quintilian, he numbered among his friends or more intimate
                    acquaintances Silius Italicus, Juvenal, the younger Pliny; and we find a number
                    of other names, such as those of Julius Martialis, Faustinus, Bassus, Decianus,
                    Melior, Stella, &amp;c., of men holding a high social, legal, or literary
                    position, whose society and patronage he enjoyed. The silence which he and
                    Statius, although authors writing at the same time, having common friends, and
                    treating sometimes of the same subjects, maintain in regard to one another may
                    be explained by mutual dislike or want of sympathy. Martial, in many places,
                    shows an undisguised contempt for. the artificial kind of epic on which
                    Statius’s reputation chiefly rests; and it seems quite natural that the
                    respectable author of the <hi rend="italic">Tlιebaid</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Silvae</hi> should feel little admiration for either the life or
                    the works of the Bohemian epigrammatist.</p>

                    and brilliancy, a place among the best poetry of antiquity, have been
                    sufficiently indicated. It remains to ask, What were those qualities of nature
                    and intellect which enable us to read his best work—even the great body of his
                    work— with the freshest sense of pleasure in the present day <hi rend="italic"
                    >1</hi></p>
                <p>He had the keenest capacity for enjoyment, the keenest curiosity and power of
                    observation. The ordinary spectacle of Boman life, as it passed before his eyes,
                    was thus vividly apprehended and reproduced by him in all its details; and the
                    many varieties of character which an over-ripe and decaying civilization
                    produces were quickly seized and graphically sketched. He had also a very just
                    discernment. It is rare to find any one endowed with so quick a perception of
                    the ridiculous who is so little of a caricaturist. He was himself singularly
                    free from cant, pedantry, or affectation of any kind. Though tolerant of most
                    vices, he has a hearty scorn of hypocrisy,—of the combination of outward
                    austerity with secret profligacy,—of the man who, while he wears</p>
                <p>“Fuscos colores, galbinos habet mores.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“Whose dress is of a dull colour, his morals a pale
                    green.”</p></note></p>
                <p>There are few better satirists of social and literary pretenders either in
                    ancient or modern times. Living in a very artificial age, he was quite natural,
                    hating pomp and show, and desiring to secure in life only what really gave him
                    pleasure. To live one’s own life heartily from day to day without looking before
                    or after, and to be one’s self without trying to be that for which nature did
                    not intend him, is the sum of his philosophy. It is the philosophy of a man who
                    has passed the middle of life, who has outlived any illusions he may ever have
                    had, and who is quite content that whatever remains to him in the future should
                    be like his present. Further, while tolerant of much that is bad and base,—the
                    characters of Crispinus and Regulus, for instance,—he shows himself genuinely
                    grateful for kindness and appreciative of excellence. He has no bitterness,
                    malice, or envy in his composition. He professes to avoid personalities in his
                    satire;—“Ludimus innocui” is the character he claims for it. Pliny, in ths
                    elιort tribute which he pays to him on hearing of his death, says, “He had as
                    much candour as wit and pungency in his writings <hi rend="italic">” (Ep.</hi>
                    iii. 21).</p>
                <p>Honour and sincerity <hi rend="italic">(fides</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >simplicitas}</hi> are the qualities which he most admires in his friends.
                    Though many of his epigrams indicate a cynical disbelief in the character of
                    women, yet others prove that he could respect and almost reverence a refined and
                    courteous lady. His own life in Rome afforded him no experience of domestic
                    virtue; but his epigrams show that, even in the age which is known to modern
                    readers chiefly from the <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi> of Juvenal, that virtue
                    was recognized as the purest source of happiness. The tenderest element in
                    Martial’s nature seems, however, to have been his affection for children and for
                    his dependants. The pathos with which he has recorded their premature death,
                    combined with his fresh enjoyment of outward nature, give to many of his pieces
                    a rank among the serious poetry of the world—“inter sanctiora carmina,”—to use a
                    phrase of his own.</p>
                <p>The permanent literary interest of Martial’s epigrams arises not so much from
                    their verbal point or brilliancy, though in these respects they are unsurpassed,
                    as from the amount of human life and character which they contain. There is no
                    truer painter of social manners in antiquity. He enables us better than any
                    other writer to revive the outward spectacle of the imperial Rome which we see
                    in its ruins, and to repeople its streets, shops, porticos, baths, and
                    amphitheatres. If Juvenal enforces the lesson of that time, and has penetrated
                    more deeply into the heart of society,</p>
                <p>Martial has sketched its external aspect with a much fairer pencil and from a
                    much more intimate contact with it. It is from the immediate impressions and
                    comments of the epigrammatist that the satirist has taken the suggestion of many
                    of his more elaborate pictures and more stern denunciations. But it is not only
                    the peculiarities of Roman customs that live in the writings of Martial. His
                    page, to use his own phrase, “has the true relish of human life” in every
                    age—“hominem pagina nostra sapit.” He was to Rome in the decay of its ancient
                    virtue and patriotism what Menander was to Athens in its decline. They were both
                    men of cosmopolitan rather than of a national type, and had a closer affinity to
                    the life of Paris or London in the 18th century than to that of Rome in the days
                    of the Scipios or of Athens in the age of Pericles. The form of epigram was
                    fitted to the critical temper of Rome as the comedy of manners was fitted to the
                    dramatic genius of Greece. Martial professes to be of the school of Catullus,
                    Pedo, and Marsus, and admits his inferiority only to the first. But, though he
                    is a poet of a less pure and genuine inspiration, he is a greater epigrammatist
                    even than his master. He has indeed made that form of art peculiarly his own. He
                    has applied it to the representation of a very much greater number of
                    situations, incidents, and characters, and he has done this with the greatest
                    clearness, terseness, and vivacity of style, and with a masterly command over
                    all his metres, except the pure hexameter, in which no other writer has been
                    able to treat the familiar matters of the day with the light touch of Horace.
                    Martial, except where he is flattering the emperor,—and then we may sometimes
                    suspect an undercurrent of irony, —is one of the most natural and sensible as he
                    is one of the wittiest and most brilliant of writers. He fails, perhaps, more
                    often in his wit than in his sense. He is full of the happiest phrases, which
                    express admirably for all times, without over-subtlety and without triteness,
                    the judgment and impressions of life formed by direct contact with it, and taken
                    neither from books nor from the opinions of other men, of a thorough man of the
                    world, who had yet some feelings and sensibilities to which men of the world are
                    generally strangers. He wrote naturally because he was completely in harmony
                    with the life of his age. As this is the explanation of his grave offences, it
                    should also be recognized as contributing to his merits as a writer.</p>
                <p>Owing probably to the reasons which have excluded his writings from sclιool
                    education, little has been done for the criticism or explanation of Martial for
                    about two centuries. There is a good edition of the text by Schneidewin in the
                    Teubner series of classics. For English readers the <hi rend="italic">Selected
                    Epigrams of Martial,</hi> by H. H. Stephenson, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Martialis Epigrammata Selecta,</hi> by Messrs Paley and Stone, may be
                    recommended as a good introduction to the study of this poet. An edition of book
                    i., with a Latin commentary by J. Flach, has lately appeared at Tübingen.
                    Further information about him may be obtained in a work by A. Brandt, <hi

                    Doms</hi>; and an excellent criticism on his writings is to be found among the
                    prose works of Lessing. (W. Y. S.)</p>
