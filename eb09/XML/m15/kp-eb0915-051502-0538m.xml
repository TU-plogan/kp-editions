                    horizon and the portion of the earth’s surface which lies within his range of
                    vision has the appearance of a disk, the whole world was in ancient times
                    conceived as a disk surrounded by the sea. It was consequently not uncommon for
                    a people to imagine—as was the case we know with the Chinese, the Hindus, the
                    Chaldaeans, the Jews, the Arabs, and even the ancient Peruvians—that it occupied
                    the middle part of the world. The wider a people’s range of vision, the wider
                    was the disk of the world represented. A circular surface is thus the simplest
                    form for a <hi rend="italic">mappa mundi</hi> or map of the world; and it is met
                    with both in antiquity and in the Middle Ages. The extent of the circle of
                    vision depends among uncivilized peoples on their way of life. Wandering tribes
                    have seen more of the world than settled tribes; and hunters, fishers, and
                    seamen make the widest excursions. Among them consequently we find the
                    beginnings of mapmaking; and Eskimo, Indians, and Polynesians, for example, show
                    in this matter astonishing quickness of apprehension, while among the settled
                    Negro tribes, on the other hand, there are no maps. A map drawn by an Eskimo
                    woman enabled Sir Edward Parry to discover Fury and Hecla Strait; M <hi

                    of the Franklin expedition repeatedly got the Eskimo to draw coast-maps of the
                    Arctic lands; and many similar instances are given by Andree, “Beginnings of
                    Cartography,” <hi rend="italic">Globus,</hi> xxxi. pp. 24-27, 37-43.</p>
                <p>Turning to civilized peoples, it is among the Egyptians that we find the earliest
                    recorded examples of cartographic representation. Apollonius of Rhodes (born 230
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) reports in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Argonautica</hi> (iv. 279) that the Egyptians of Colchis, a colony dating from
                    the time of Ramses II. (?), had preserved as heirlooms certain wooden tablets
                    <hi rend="italic">(κυpβeιs)</hi> on which land and sea, roads and highways, were
                    accurately indicated; Eustathius, in his commentary <pb break="no"

                    the Egyptian king caused route-maps to be prepared; and Strabo also refers to
                    certain old maps in the library of Eratosthenes in which Meroe and the south end
                    of the peninsula of India were placed on the same parallel of latitude. These
                    statements have been confirmed by the actual discovery of such maps and plans on
                    old Egyptian papyrus-rolls. Birch has, for instance, identified a drawing on a
                    papyrus in the, Turin Museum as the topographical map of a gold-mining district
                    in Nubia. The perspective in this case is very childish: in order to show that
                    the road leads between two mountain-chains, the mountains on one side of the
                    road are inverted (comp. Lepsius, <hi rend="italic">Urkundenbuch,</hi> pl.
                    xxii.). This map is one thousand years older than that of Anaximander, who was
                    considered by the Greeks as the inventor of cartography. On another sheet
                    appears a representation of the victorious return of Sethos I. (1443-1392 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> from Asia, showing the road from Pelusium by
                    Leontopolis to Heroopolis, Lake Timsah with fish in it, the canal from the Nile
                    with crocodiles, and at Heroopolis a bridge over the canal. Similar picturemaps
                    were discovered by Layard in Assyria <hi rend="italic">(Nineveh and
                    Babylon,</hi> p. 231 <hi rend="italic">sg.,</hi> 1867). The ancient Babylonians
                    have also the high distinction of having divided space and time in a way that
                    allowed scientific measurements to be made after the still customary method. It
                    was they who originated the division of’the ecliptic into twelve signs and later
                    into 360 degrees; and the division of the circle into 360 degrees with 60
                    minutes to the degree and 60 seconds to the minute, as well as the corresponding
                    division of the hour, was the outcome of their sexagesimal system of numeration.
                    This method of division was introduced among the Greeks by Hipparchus (150 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> and obtained general currency through the
                    geographer Ptolemy (150 A.D.). By this means were provided the elements
                    necessary for the astronomical determination of geographical position. Among the
                    Egyptians and Babylonians map-making remained in its first infantile stage; its
                    scientific development was received at the hands of the Greeks.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Development of Map-making among the Greeks.—</hi> In Homer
                    the “circumfluent ocean” represents the horizon which bounds the disk of the
                    world; the scientific treatment of geography and map-making has its origin among
                    the Ionic Greeks of Asia Minor. Anaximander, a pupil of Thales (about 560 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> sketched the first map (γεωγραφικός τrivα⅛), and
                    was the first who sought to determine the compass of the earth (the world-disk)
                    and the sea. As the Greeks gradually extended their journeys as far as India in
                    the East and the Atlantic in the West, the conviction gained ground that the w
                    0rld-disk could not be bounded by a regular circular outline. About one hundred
                    years after Anaximander, Democritus of Abdera ventured to draw a new map on the
                    basis of his own observations (for in his extensive wanderings he had been as
                    far as Persia and perhaps even India); and in opposition to the circular form of
                    the Ionians he gave the world an oblong shape, and taught that from east to west
                    it was half as long again as from north to south. Although after the time of
                    Aristotle the tabular or flat-surface theory of the figure of the earth was
                    expelled by the spherical or globe theory, the portion of the earth’s surface
                    which was really known retained the same oblong shape which it had with
                    Democritus; and hence we still speak of longitude and latitude, that is, length
                    and breadth. It was on this basis also that the far-travelled Hecataeus of
                    Miletus, who wrote his Γi)ς 7r∈ptbδoς between 520 and 500 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> drew up his map; for the representation of the world on a brazen
                    tablet, which was shown by Aristagoras, tyrant of Miletus, to King Cleomenes of
                    Sparta, was probably nothing else than the world-map of Hecataeus. Tne first
                    application of astronomy to geography was made by the famous Arctic navigator
                    Pytheas of Marseilles, about 326 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.;</hi> it is from him
                    that we obtain the first observation of latitude, and, what is of some
                    importance, this is for Marseilles. His voyage to the extreme North (Thule) was
                    undertaken partly for the purpose of satisfying himself in regard to the figure
                    and size of the earth. Dicaearchus of Messana in Sicily, a pupil of Aristotle’s
                    (310 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> made the first approach to a projection.
                    He divided the inhabited <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the known) world, which
                    he reckoned to be one and a half times as long as it was broad, into a northern
                    and a southern half by means of what he considered a straight line drawn from
                    the pillars of Hercules, through Sicily, the Peloponnesus, Caria, Lycia,
                    Pamphylia, Cilicia, and across the Taurus to the Imaus (Himalaya). He thus drew
                    the first parallel of latitude, and upon this basis he prepared maps which were
                    to be publicly exhibited in a hall (Agathem., § 5; Strabo, p. 105). The name <hi
                    rend="italic">διάφραγμα της οικουμένης,</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    partition of the inhabited world, was given to the base-line. For the next
                    material improvement we are indebted to the famous astronomer and geographer
                    Eratosthenes of Cyrene, the keeper of the Alexandrian library (276-196 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> He was the first to make a rational geodetic
                    measurement for the purpose of determining the size of the earth, and he
                    collected in his Γεωγραφικά the whole geographical learning of his time. This
                    work has unfortunately been lost, but from the numerous fragments that have been
                    preserved, especially by Strabo, it is possible to form an idea of this the
                    first systematic geography. Starting with the spherical form and the size of the
                    world, it gave a description of the <hi rend="italic">οικουμένη,</hi> discussed
                    the space relations of the world-island, and estimated its extent in longitude
                    and latitude. On the basis of the diaphragm of Dicaearchus, the course of which
                    was more precisely indicated, a series of seven parallels and as many meridians
                    cutting the diaphragm at right angles were drawn, and by this means the
                    inhabited world was divided to the north and the south of the diaphragm into a
                    certain number of regular divisions to which the name of sphragidia or seals was
                    given. Then follows a description of the countries in the several “seals,”
                    beginning with India. Iu this arrangement we may recognize the first attempt to
                    construct a network or system of degrees. As numerous data in regard to
                    distances were already at his command, Eratosthenes greatly improved on the old
                    maps in the matter of correctness; but, as the number of astronomical
                    determinations of latitude was still small, and the intervals between the
                    parallels and the meridians were unequal and conditioned by the available data
                    in regard to distance, his network of lines was far from being an exact
                    mathematical system. Hipparchus of Nicaea in Bithynia, the greatest astronomer
                    of the ancient world (about 150 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> consequently
                    rejected the geography of Eratosthenes because it only partially utilized the
                    abundant resources provided by the high development of contemporary mathematics
                    and astronomy. Instead of the uncertain estimates of distance and direction
                    furnished by travellers, only astronomical determinations of latitude and
                    longitude should, he maintained, have been employed. He does not appear,
                    however, to have himself written a geography or constructed a map. About the
                    same time Crates of Mallus made the first globe. On this he extended the
                    Atlantic Ocean southward to the south pole, placed a corresponding ocean on the
                    other hemisphere, and, in the belief that the torrid zone could be occupied by
                    nothing but water, ran an Oceanic belt along the line of the equator (fig. 1).
                    In the four segments thus produced he set four semicircular land-areas, only one
                    of which was known to the ancient world. This systematic figure maintained its
                    place down into the Middle Ages, as <pb break="no"

                    forms part of the insignia of royalty.</p>
                <p>Marinus of Tyre (about 150 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>) was the first who
                    •sought to give effect to the demand made by Hipparchus for a trustworthy
                    representation of the countries of the world. His work unfortunately has been
                    lost; and we know of its existence only from his successor Claudius Ptolemy.
                    Without Marinus, however, Ptolemy’s work would have been impossible; and neither
                    of them was able really to carry out Hipparchus’s idea of determining the
                    latitude and longitude for every place; for observations of latitude were known
                    only for Marseilles, Syene, Alexandria, Rhodes, and perhaps a few other places,
                    and all other positions were obtained by reducing distances to degrees. The
                    determination of longitudes was even more difficult. Ptolemy possessed only the
                    contemporary observation of the lunar eclipse in Arbela and Carthage of the year
                    331 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> from which he calculated a difference of
                    meridian of 45° 10' instead of 34° 2'. The longer axis of the Mediterranean was
                    consequently a third too great, 62 degrees of the meridian being assumed instead
                    of 41∣, and from this there resulted an exaggeration of all the Mediterranean
                    countries, which was corrected only by the compass-maps of the later Middle
                    Ages. Ptolemy, however (availing himself of the stereographic projection devised
                    by Hipparchus), corrected an important blunder which Marinus had committed
                    through neglecting to take account of the sphericity of the earth and
                    constructing a rectangular system of degrees. Like Marinus, he counted his
                    meridians from the Canaries (the Fortunate Islands). No maps appear to have been
                    drawn by Ptolemy himself; those to be found in the oldest editions of his work
                    are by Agathodaemon (a mathematician of the 5th (?) century after Christ),
                    though accurately based, it is true, on Ptolemy’s data. The oldest MS. of
                    Ptolemy is that found in the Vatopedi monastery of Mount Athos, and published by
                    Victor Langlois in 1867 along with careful reproductions -of the maps. It dates
                    from the 12th or 13th century. Resides the exaggeration of the Mediterranean,
                    the greatest blunders of Ptolemy are the following :—the European continent
                    between the Black Sea and the Baltic is too narrow; India is not represented as
                    a peninsula; Ceylon (Taprobane) is made much too large; and the Indian Ocean is
                    bounded by lands towards the south (Plate VII.). But in spite of all this the
                    scientific method pursued in the representation was perfectly correct. It was
                    not till the Renaissance that a return was made to the rational treatment of
                    cartography inaugurated by Ptolemy; and he then became the teacher of the modern
                    world.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Map-making among the Romans.—</hi> The Romans contributed
                    nothing to the development of the scientific method of the Greeks, and did not
                    apply astronomy to the purposes •of cartography. They valued maps according to
                    their practical utility as implements of political administration; and they
                    accordingly attached most importance to the routemap, from which they could
                    learn the roads, the stations, and the distances. If we may judge by the few
                    examples which have been preserved, these sketches may, distortions apart, be
                    compared with our railway maps. Cicero and Seneca mention general and
                    topographical maps. In their •time the military routes were already divided into
                    stages, furnished with milestones, and consequently measured. During the reign
                    of Augustus a survey of the whole Roman empire was carried out. The routes were
                    marked on parchment rolls for the purposes of military and civil administration.
                    A map of the world was painted in a portico at Rome; a map of Italy was to be
                    seen in the temple of Tellus. Particularly celebrated was Agrippa’s map. Pliny
                    must plainly have been in possession of maps to keep himself right in regard to
                    the great number of names which he records. A map of the Roman empire was drawn
                    up under Domitian. The emperors of the 2d, 3d, and 4th centuries caused maps to
                    be constructed and painted on the walls of public buildings in the cities of
                    Gaul, as for example in Augustodunum (Autun); but of this class unfortunately
                    none has been preserved. The only Roman map, indeed, of the imperial epoch which
                    has come down to us is the <hi rend="italic">Tabula Renting er ian a,</hi> which
                    takes its modern name from Conrad Peutinger of Augsburg, who possessed it in the
                    16th century. It is now preserved in the Imperial Library of Λ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> τ</hi> ienna. Its origin as a map goes back at least to the
                    3d century of the Christian era,— to the time, that is, of Alexander Severus;
                    but the actual copy is not older than the 13th century. It consists of twelve
                    folio sheets of parchment, which originally formed one long strip. It has been

                    Desjardins (1869, &amp;c.). That the original of this remarkable map was of a
                    circular shape has been satisfactorily proved, the pattern followed being that
                    of the map of the world in the portico of the Campus Agrippae, which for
                    centuries retained the rank of a model. Probably, however, such an <hi

                    construction effect was also given to the opinion current from the time of
                    Herodotus that the extent of the inhabited world was greater from east to west
                    than from north to south. From this it is clear that the Romans had not advanced
                    beyond the earlier Greek conception, and were ignorant of the
                    astronomico-mathematical method inaugurated by Hipparchus.</p>

                    Ages confined themselves to imitation of the Roman <hi rend="italic">orbes.</hi>
                    Fulness of detail, moreover, was gradually lost, meagreness and crudity
                    appearing in its place. Cartography in fact fell back to a second childhood.
                    Fanatical exponents of the orthodox faith, like Lactantius, looked with disdain
                    on all scientific culture. Geographical questions were of no interest to him
                    because he regarded them as mere matters of opinion. Astronomy was a piece of
                    fantastic folly, the knowledge of distant lands mere learned lumber. “Quae
                    beatitude,” he exclaims, “erit mihi proposita si sciero unde Nilus oriatur vel
                    quicquid de coelo physici delirant ?” As this narrow conception of things became
                    on the whole the dominant one, geography and map-making practically ceased to
                    exist. The doctrine of the sphericity of the earth was placed under the ban of
                    the church, and people went back to the Homeric idea of a disk surrounded by the
                    ocean. Isidore of Seville <hi rend="italic">(ob.</hi> 636) taught: “Orbis a
                    rotunditate circuli dictus quia sicut rota est. Undique enim Oceanus
                    circumfluens ejus in circulo ambit fines. Divisus est autem trifarie; e quibus
                    una pars Asia, altera Europa, tertia Africa, quae et Libya nuncupatur.” Isidore
                    is a master of false etymological inferences. Deriving <hi rend="italic"
                    >rotunditas</hi> from <hi rend="italic">rota,</hi> a wheel, he declares that
                    consequently the earth has the appearance of a wheel. Hence the name wheel-maps
                    has been given to all those maps of the earlier Middle Ages. The three-fold
                    division which he gives of the world-disk kept its ground for centuries, and the
                    figure of the earth put on the miserable guise shown in fig. 2. It was only by
                    the Greek fathers that the doctrine of the earth’s sphericity continued to be
                    taught; and, as the knowledge of Greek rapidly died out in western Europe, the
                    fountain was dried up from which a better science might have been derived. Many
                    minor modifications were introduced into the map of the world, but the
                    fundamental type remained as given in fig. 2. Jerusalem lay in the centre,
                    Paradise in the extreme east. Clever artists gave life to the disk of the world
                    by turreted pictures of towns—Jerusalem, Troy, Babylon, Rome, &lt;fcc., and drew
                    Adam and Eve in the midst of a Paradise which <pb break="no"

                    and, being considered the highest place in the world, was always introduced at
                    the top of the map! The positions of Jerusalem and Paradise served to fix the
                    other points. How long this conception remained in vogue appears from the fact
                    that in 1422 Leonardo Dati, in a poem on the sphere <hi rend="italic">{Della

                    θ. In this way the whole science of cartography sank back below the level

                    of geographical science among the Arabs took place at Baghdad about 772 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> in the reign of the caliph Mansûr, and under the
                    influence of an Indian astronomer and mathematician; and, not long after the
                    works of Euclid, Archimedes, Aristotle, and Ptolemy were translated into Arabic,
                    by orders of the caliph Mamιιn (813-833), a degree was measured in Mesopotamia
                    in the plain of Sinjar, and a system of the world (Rasm el-ard) was constructed
                    by his librarian Mohammed ben Musa of Khiva (Alcharesmius), in which every place
                    was to be determined by longitude and latitude in the style of Ptolemy. But the
                    science split up only too soon into a practical and a theoretical (astronomical)
                    section—the one treating geography (ja'rafiyâ) as the doctrine of routes and
                    provinces, the other as the doctrine of latitudes and longitudes. Astronomy
                    contented itself with the astronomical determination of the position of places
                    without drawing maps or exerting any influence on their projection; travellers
                    and topographers on the other hand did not trouble themselves about astronomy,
                    but like Istakhri (c. 750) or Ibn Haukal <hi rend="italic">(c. 750)</hi> added
                    maps to their descriptions which were destitute of any system of degrees, and
                    betrayed by the roughness of their outlines the clumsiness of the draughtsman.
                    Ultimately, like Dimishki(1327), they left mathematical geography completely out
                    of their works, Ibn Haukal having already declared that mathematical division
                    only brought confusion into geography. Only Edrisi’s map, engraved for King
                    Roger II. of Sicily upon a silver plate (1164), forms an exception; but, as it
                    was not drawn according to the Ptolemaic projection, but simply indicated the
                    seven climates, it was after all but an unsuccessful copy of Ptolemy.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Nautical Maps.—</hi> The nautical (loxodromic or compass)
                    maps, which make their first appearance in Italy in the 13th century, indicate a
                    gratifying improvement in cartography after a long period of stagnation. These
                    maps were constructed with the aid of the compass, and took the name of
                    compass-maps because they are covered with the figure of a compass from which
                    numerous straight lines radiate out in all directions over the sheet. The fact
                    that the magnet turns towards the north is first mentioned in 1187. Flavio Gioja
                    of Amalfi was perhaps the first to make a mariner’s compass and to teach seamen
                    the use of that important instrument. The Italians divided the compass into
                    eight parts (venti), assigning 45° to each— Tramontane (N.), Greco (N.E.),
                    Levante (E.), Sirocco (S.E.), Ostro (S.), Libeccio or Garbino (S.W.), Ponente
                    (W.), Maestro (N.W.). Every division had four quarters (quarte di vento), each
                    of 11∣ degrees. The maps were produced as follows. The courses of individual
                    ships were first of all inserted as straight lines, calculated according to the
                    distances traversed, from particular ports, as Genoa or Venice, to other ports,
                    and when a good supply of such material had been collected and a series of
                    diagonals drawn in accordance therewith, the most important points on the coast
                    and in the islands were fixed. The lines by which the meridians were cut at the
                    same angle were called loxodromes; they gave a correct indication when they cut
                    the true astronomical meridian, a false one when they cut the magnetic meridian.
                    On the Italian charts the loxodromes were drawn as straight lines. The numerous
                    radii of the compass shown on the maps enabled the seaman to find the direction
                    which he had to take to reach his goal. Hence the title loxodromic maps.</p>
                <p>Charts on which the degrees were marked became necessary only when navigation
                    extended to the ocean; they were introduced by the Portuguese, probably at the
                    suggestion of Prince Henry the Navigator. They are “plane charts” with lines of
                    longitude and latitude.</p>
                <p>The oldest loxodromic charts which have been preserved come from Pisa, Genoa, and
                    Venice. The earliest, the so-called Pisan chart, belongs probably to the middle
                    of the 13th century, and already comprises the whole Mediterranean. As this
                    representation of the whole must of necessity have been preceded by surveys of
                    the several portions, the beginning of the chart may be placed at least as far
                    back as the first part of the 13th century. Next in point of age comes (2) the
                    Luxoro Atlas in Genoa about the year 1300, in the possession of the Cavaliere

                    maps developed into maps of countries with trade routes, pictorial figures, and
                    numerous inscriptions. Maps preserved from the 15th century are still more

                    flourished in Genoa between 1511 and 1648. Visconte Maggiolo, the founder of the
                    family, is known to have produced nineteen atlases between 1511 and 1587. A map
                    by Giacomo Maggiolo, of date 1562, is in the British Museum. (37) Battista
                    Agnese laboured between 1527 and 1554 in Venice, and the thirteen atlases he has
                    left behind him are pieces of fine artistic work adorned with charming
                    miniatures. Two of these atlases, of date 1527 and 1536, are in the British
                    Museum.</p>
                <p>In the 15th century and the beginning of the 16th Spanish, Portuguese, Greek, and
                    French cartographers appear as competitors with the Italian, Catalonian, and
                    Balearic artists. We name only the most important. Juan de la Casa, a Basque,
                    and a companion of Columbus, drew in 1500 a map of the world in which for the
                    first time the hitherto discovered coasts and islands of</p>
                <p>America were introduced. A map of the world by Garcia de Torero, 1522, is
                    preserved at Turin; and two general maps, the one dating 1527 (probably by
                    Fernando Colon, son of Columbus) and the other 1529 (by Diego Ribero), exist at
                    Weimar. Between 1558 and 1569 Diego Homem produced several beautiful atlases; of
                    these four are in Italy, and one, of date 1568, at Dresden. Among the French
                    world-maps a special place is due to that drawn up by order of King Henry II. It
                    is published by Jomard in his <hi rend="italic">Monumens de</hi><hi

                <p>As far as Italian navigation extended, and especially within the limits of the
                    Mediterranean, a very correct representation of the coasts and of the contours
                    of the several countries was secured at an early date. The interior of the
                    countries, on the other hand, remained confused and inexact. These defects were
                    first supplied in the 15th century, when recourse was again had to the
                    contributions of the Greeks, and especially of Ptolemy.</p>
                <p>Before proceeding to discuss this new development, it may be as well to mention
                    the various names by which the representations of the earth’s surface have been
                    designated. The Greeks employed the expression πivαξ (picture), the Romans in
                    like manner said <hi rend="italic">talmla.</hi> The word map came into use in
                    the Middle Ages, the nam&lt; <hi rend="italic">mappa-mundi,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mappemonde</hi> (“world-napkin”), proving that maps were
                    originally painted on cloth. In English map is applied only to a land-map, the
                    sea-map being known as a chart. . The Romance languages had the expressions <hi
                    rend="italic">disegno,</hi><hi rend="italic">figura,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pintura, padron.</hi> When the loxodromic maps came into existence, hand-books
                    with sailing directions were written to accompany them, hence the titles
                    “sailing directions,” “sea-books,” portulani (by which word actual maps were
                    afterwards meant), or cartas da marear. The Latin word <hi rend="italic"
                    >charta</hi> signifies originally a letter, a written document; and in like
                    manner the Portuguese and Spanish form <hi rend="italic">carta.</hi> But as
                    early as the 14th century this expression was (as appears from the inscription
                    quoted under No. 3 above) used to distinguish a sea-map. In the same sense Paolo
                    Toscanelli speaks of his <hi rend="italic">carta,</hi> which he sen o the king
                    of Portugal. But the expression did not become general till the 16th century; in
                    1513 we find it in Germany in a Strasburg <pb break="no"

                    Lock).</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">The Revival of Ptolemy.—</hi> This produced in the 15 th
                    century a revolution in the construction of maps, and laid the foundations of
                    modern cartography. Ptolemy’s great work again became generally well known in
                    western Europe only after it was translated into Latin by Jacobus Angelus de
                    Scarparia in 1409; and this version was first printed in 1475 at Vicenza without
                    maps. The first edition with maps (to wit, a map of the world, ten maps of
                    Europe, four of Africa, and twelve of Asia) appeared at Rome in 1478. Afterwards
                    there were editions at Bologna (1482), Ulm (1482, by Nicolaus Donis with five
                    modern maps), Ulm (I486), Rome (1490, 1507, and 1508, the last with seven modern
                    maps, among which the famous map of the world by Job. Ruysch), Strasburg (1513,
                    with forty-seven maps); and in the course of the same century twenty-five other
                    editions might be mentioned at Strasburg, Basel, Lyons, Cologne, Venice, and
                    Paris. From this long series, which if prolonged to the beginning of the Thirty
                    Years’ War would be further increased by five, it is evident that Ptolemy was
                    the great master of the modern time. At first maps were drawn according to
                    Ptolemy’s determinations of geographical position; but, in proportion as the
                    study of mathematics, astronomy, and cosmography excited the interest of men of
                    culture, opportunities were afforded of correcting Ptolemy’s astronomical
                    positions, especially in the case of central and northern Europe, where the
                    range of the great cosmographer’s knowledge had hardly enabled him to collect
                    original material. The new arts of wood and copper engraving supplied the means
                    for a rapid diffusion of <hi rend="italic">printed</hi> maps. The oldest map
                    printed from a wooden block (in the National Library at Paris), dating from
                    1460, and thus belonging to the earliest period of wood engraving, was produced
                    in Germany, and represents Germany and western Europe. It is considered to be a
                    copy from an old Roman map.</p>
                <p>After the foundations of trigonometry had been laid by Purbach, Regiomontanus,
                    and others, attempts of a rather rude kind were made in thebeginning of the 16th
                    century to execute geographical triangulations and delineations. The towns
                    formed the central points of the system, their direction and position from the
                    post of observation being fixed as precisely as possible, and their distance
                    estimated in miles according to the best available data without being accurately
                    measured. It was considered sufficient to assign in this way the relative
                    positions of inhabited places, and die representation of the physical relations
                    was very superficial; the course of rivers, for instance, was not measured, but
                    carried past the towns on their banks in conventional lines.</p>
                <p>In the Ptolemy of 1513 we already find three topographical maps, viz., one of
                    Switzerland, one of the district of the upper Rhine from Basel to Mainz and
                    Lorraine, and a large one of Crete, which it has been conjectured was taken from
                    a Venetian original. The number of maps of smaller districts rapidly increased.
                    In 1528 Aventinus drew the duchy of Bavaria, in 1533 Sebastian of Rotenhain m
                    produced a map of East Franconia. Map drawing became a favourite occupation with
                    the Germans. The best geographical survey of this period was the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chorographia</hi><hi rend="italic">Bavariae,</hi> by the famous
                    Philip Apianus (twenty-four sheets, at Ingolstadt, 1568). The number of
                    cartographers increased so rapidly that Abraham Ortelius, in the first edition
                    of his collection of maps <hi rend="italic">{Theatrum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mundi,</hi> 1570), was able to give the names of ninety-three. The first
                    attempts to improve and to increase the methods of projection known to the
                    Greeks were made by Germans,—namely, Johann Stöffler (1452-1536), Johann Werner
                    of Nuremberg (1468-1528), Peter Apianus (1495-1552). The last-mentioned
                    introduced the favourite method of representing both hemispheres together in an
                    elliptical form with lines of latitude. Maps of the world were compiled by Peter
                    Apianus, Oronee Finé (1494-1555), Sebastian Cabot (1544), Giacomo Gastaldo
                    (1546-48), Giov. Batt. Guicciardini (1549), Giov. Dornin. Methoni at Venice,
                    Heinrich Pontanus of Arnhem (1556, a map of the world in the shape of an
                    imperial eagle), Guill. Postel at Paris (1581), Ac.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Mercator and his Successors.—</hi> Gerhard Kramer, usually
                    called Mercator (born of German parents at Rupelmonde in Flanders in 1512), has
                    the honourable place of a reformer of cartography. We possess his map of
                    Palestine (1537), a map of Flanders (Louvain, 1540) in nine sheets, phototyped
                    in 1882, a globe (1541), and the first critical map of Europe (1554), by which
                    he laid the foundation of his fame as the first cartographer of his age. The
                    exclusive use of Latin letters for maps in Germany was due to his example.
                    Especially famous is his map of the world (fig. 4) dating from 1569: “Nova et
                    aucta orbis terrae descriptio ad usum navigantium emendate accommodata” (one
                    copy in the National Library at Paris). This map is drawn in the projection of
                    increasing latitudes with lines of latitude and parallel meridians, the basis of
                    which was furnished by Edward Wright in 1599 in <hi rend="italic">Certain Errors
                    in Navigation.</hi> It is the first chart on which true rhumb lines could be
                    drawn as straight lines. By 1601 Mercator’s projection was in use for all sea
                    charts. In 1578 Mercator drew up maps for Ptolemy exactly in accordance with his
                    determinations; and these were followed by maps of Germany, the Low Countries,
                    and France (1585), and of Italy (1590). It was his purpose to produce a complete
                    collection of new maps, to which he gave the name <hi rend="italic">Atlas
                    ∙,</hi> but he died in 1594, and the publication of this first atlas (1595) was
                    left to his son. The title took the place of the designations previously in
                    fashion— <hi rend="italic">Theatrum Orbis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Speculum
                    Mundi,</hi> &amp;c. The second edition of the <hi rend="italic">Atlas</hi>
                    appeared in 1602. The later editions were issued by Jυdocus Hondius in
                    Amsterdam.</p>
                <p>Before Mercator collections of maps, including various countries, and independent
                    of Ptolemy, had begun to be published. Thus Christoffel Froschover in Zurich
                    issued various “Landtaflen” in 1562 —a map of the world (Universalis
                    Cosmographia, in the shape of a heart, dated <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >md.xl.vi.),</hi> Europe, Germania, Gallia, “die gantze Eydgnoschafft,” and
                    eight topographical maps of Swiss districts. Of much greater importance and
                    influence was the collection published by Abraham Ortelius of Antwerp (1527-98),
                    <hi rend="italic">Theatrum Orbis Terrarum</hi> (1570), in which the best maps
                    from all countries were reengraved. The first edition with a Latin text
                    contained fifty-three sheets; the seventh (1573) had sixty-nine maps, the
                    twelfth (1579) ninety-two. Editions appeared with the text in German, French.
                    Dutch, and after 1600 in English and Italian, and obtained the widest diffusion.
                    Through this work the centre of cartographic activity was transferred to
                    Holland. There too laboured the successors of Mercator, Jodocus Hondius
                    (1563—1611) and his son Henricus Hondius (1580—1644). Their maps, in several
                    folio volumes, were numbered by hundreds. To the school of Mercator belonged
                    also Petrus Plancius and Lucas Janszoon Waghenaer of Enkhuyzen (Aurigarius), who
                    by his <hi rend="italic">Sρieghcl</hi><hi rend="italic">der</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Zcevacrdt</hi> (Leyden, 1583) became the founder of nautical
                    map-collections. In 1588 a reproduction of this atlas appeared in London as the
                    first “Waggoner.” In the beginning of the 17th century the town of Dieppe also
                    produced excellent charts,—Guill. Levasseur (1601), Jean Dupont(1625), and Jean
                    Guerard (1631) being at work there. About the same time another famous
                    cartographic family arose in Holland. William Jansz. Blaeu (1571-1638) and his
                    sons Jan ami Cornelis turned out about four hundred maps previous to 1655.
                    William Blaeu was in 1633 appointed by public decree cartographer to the
                    States-General; and it was his duty to examine the ships’ logs and so amend the
                    maps. He had a rival in the person of Jan Janszoon (Jansonius), who, working
                    with the material inherited by him from his father-in-law Jodocus Hondius,
                    produced a Dutch atlas in six volumes, a French in six folios, a German in nine
                    folios, and a Latin in two. Cartography became a lucrative business, but the
                    scientific value of the work grew less and less in the hands of Nicolaus Vischer
                    (Piscator) from 1621 to 1670 and his son of the same name <hi rend="italic"
                    >{ob.</hi> 1709), of Friedrich de Witt and his sons, and of Peter Schenck. The
                    influence of the Dutch school, which had previously been so great, disappeared
                    with the close of the 17th century.</p>
                <p>In the 16th century the Italians were still active competitors with the Germans
                    and Dutch. In engraved maps Venice held a specially high rank up to 1570, the
                    Piedmontese Giacomo Gastaldo and Paolo Forlani of Verona being settled there.
                    Their publications comprised well-nigh all parts of the earth. The progress of
                    discovery can be followed on their general <hi rend="italic">{universale)</hi>
                    and topographical maps. Gastaldo’s period of activity lay between 1546 and 1569,
                    Forlani’s between 1560 and 1570. They had a successor in Antonio <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0548-0521"/> Magini (1555-1617) of Padua, who in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Novae gcogr. tabulae,</hi> published in 1596, gave greater
                    precision to the determinations of position. Giovanni Battista Nicolosi
                    (1610-70) of Sicily issued at Rome a series of huge maps of the hemispheres and
                    continents. Among the French map-makers of this period must be mentioned Oronce
                    Finé (Finaeus) from Dauphiné (1494-1555), who published in 1531 his <hi
                    rend="italic">Planisphaerium</hi><hi rend="italic">geographicum</hi> in the
                    shape of a heart according to the projection of Apianus; Jolivet (about 1560);
                    Guillaume Postel (1505-81), who in 1570 drew a new map of France; the Franciscan
                    André Thevet (1502-90), who in 1575 edited a <hi rend="italic">Cosmographie
                    universelle</hi> (2 vols, in folio), and finally Melchior Tavernier, a pupil of
                    Ortelius (o&amp;. 1641), who published manymaps of European countries. In
                    England there appeared in 1544 the great map of the world by Sebastian Cabot.
                    The first modern map of England was produced by Humphrey Lhuyd in 1569 <hi

                    different parts of the country with several engineers, and in 1575 gave to the
                    world his British atlas of thirty-six sheets, which Philip Lea afterwards
                    reduced to twelve sheets. John Speed’s atlas <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Theatrum)</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> Great Britain was published at
                    Amsterdam in 1610 by Jodocus Hondius. The first map of Scandinavia <hi

                    of Upsala. Much more accurate was the map drawn by Adrian Veno in 1613, and
                    engraved by Jodocus Hondius, but the real reformer of northern cartography was
                    Anders Buré (Buraeus, 1571-1646), who surveyed the several parts of the country.
                    His maps were afterwards published in the atlas of the brothers Blaeu between
                    1650 and 1660.</p>
                <p>The first new map of Spain and the first of Portugal both appeared in the same
                    year, 1560, the former being due to Pedro de Medina, the latter to Fernando
                    Alvarez Secco.</p>
                <p>During all this period there prevailed a remarkable variety in the determination
                    of the first meridian. Whilst the Spaniards and Portuguese reckoned from the
                    line of demarcation (370 leagues west of the Cape Verds) sanctioned by the pope,
                    the Protestant Dutch, Germans, and English at first went back to Ptolemy, who
                    began at the Canaries. Mercator, on his globe of the year 1541, chose the island
                    Forteventura in the Canaries as his starting-point, but he afterwards adopted
                    Corvo in the Azores, because he there approached the true indication of the
                    magnetic needle. For the same reason Ortelius, the younger Mercator, Jansonius,
                    and at first also William Blaeu fixed on the Isla del Fuego in the Cape Verd
                    group. Blaeu afterwards proposed the Peak of Teneriffe, and in this he was
                    followed by all Dutchmen. In the year 1634 Richelieu consulted</p>
                <p>∣the astronomers Gassendi (1592-1655) and Morin (1583-1656), and in accordance
                    with their decision Louis XIII. commanded, under penalty, that all French ships
                    should calculate their longitudes from the meridian of Ferro, though it was not
                    till the close of the 17th century that a French expedition determined with
                    accuracy the relation of the position of Ferro to that of the observatory of
                    Paris. 11 was in this way that the Ferro meridian obtained almost universal
                    currency down to the 19th century. As in this period it was still practically
                    impossible to secure precise determinations of longitude, all cartographic
                    representations were naturally subject to con- *iderable distortions, especially
                    in countries outside of Europe.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Period of Transition.—</hi> A series of important dis-
                    •coveries and inventions in mathematics, physics, and astronomy having provided
                    the means of making much more accurate observation« and calculations, there
                    followed as a matter of course a substantial improvement in cartography. Of
                    chief moment were the invention of the telescope ( 1606), Galileo’s discovery of
                    Jupiter’s moons (1610) and Cassini’s calculation of their periods of rotation,
                    so important for determinations of longitude (1666), the first application of
                    trigonometry to geodesy by Snellius (1615), Picard’s measurement of a degree
                    between Paris and Amiens (1669 and 1670), the French measurement of a degree
                    between Dunkirk and Perpignan by Cassini and Lahire( 1683-1718), Hadley’s
                    mirror-sextant (1731; according to Newton’s idea, 1699), the improvements made
                    on the lunar tables by Tobias Mayer (1753), and John Harrison’s chronometer
                    (1761). In this way there set in a period of transition in cartography which
                    lasted till somewhere about 1750; the results of new investigations and
                    measurements were gradually turned to account, but, while here and there
                    traditional blunders were corrected and expunged, nothing essentially new was as
                    yet created.</p>
                <p>To this epoch in Germany belong Johann Baptist Homann, (1664-1724), whose
                    elegantly engraved maps, published in Nuremberg, continued to have a wide sale

                    1743), and the famous Tobias Mayer (1723-86), who published in Nuremberg a
                    critical map of Germany. In France eminence was obtained by Nicolas Sanson
                    (1600-67) of Abbeville, who from 1627 worked at Paris as royal geographer, and
                    issued more than three hundred maps; and the . reputation of the house was
                    maintained by his sons Nicolas, Adrien, and <pb break="no"

                    Jaillot (1681-1717), Pierre du Vai (1619-83), and Jean Baptiste Nolin (1692) at

                    determinations were turned to account. Greater critical acumen was shown by the
                    royal geographer Guill. de ΓIsle (1675-1726), and especially by the talented
                    Jean Baptiste Bourgignon d’Anville (1697-1782) and his younger contemporary
                    Philippe Buache (1700-1773). In this period France was <hi rend="italic"
                    >facile</hi><hi rend="italic">princeps</hi> in cartographic achievements, and
                    led the way to the next and latest epoch. In England Dowet’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Atlas</hi> was published at the cost of the duke of Argyll, and in the same
                    year Aaron Arrowsmith was bôrn (o'&gt;. 1828). A beginning of geodetic labour
                    was at this time made in Sweden under Charles XI.,— the proceedings being
                    carried on first under the Baron Karl Griep-enhielm (oi&gt;. 1684) and
                    afterwards under Count Dahlberg.. For political reasons, however, the king did
                    not allow the publication of the map of Sweden; but, the French ambassador
                    D’Avaux having in 1704 got possession of copies, it was engraved at Paris by De
                    Γlsle. In Italy P. Vincent Coronelli <hi rend="italic">(ob.</hi> 1718) deserves
                    to be mentioned.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">The Period of Triangulations and Geodetic Surveys.</hi> —Up
                    to this point the whole art of map-making had been treated as a matter of
                    private speculation. It was France that gave the first example of carrying out
                    the cartographic survey of the country at the cost of the state. Such surveys
                    had a double object, one military, to provide the army with satisfactory maps,
                    and the other administrative, to furnish a cadastre for the land tax. The
                    military interest predominated; consequently the surveys have in almost all
                    countries been carried out by officers of the general staff, and the maps are
                    briefly designated as general staff or ordnance maps. For such a survey the
                    whole country is covered with a network of triangles, and, in order to secure
                    the most trustworthy basis for the representation, numerous points are
                    astronomically fixed. In comparison with those of earlier date the maps thus
                    produced are distinguished by correctness of detail. In the century between 1750
                    and 1850 attention was mainly directed to the accurate rendering of the
                    horizontal development of the face of the country; but during the last thirty
                    years the vertical configuration has also been faithfully represented on
                    topographical maps of large scale by the introduction of contour lines. The
                    first example of this also was given by France, when at Laplace’s suggestion
                    (1816) it was determined to publish a new map of France with curves of altitude.
                    But owing to the great extent of the country, and the consequent difficulty and
                    slowness of the undertaking, only four sheets of this kind were published by
                    1833. Hanover, however, followed suit in 1829, Baden in 1833, Hesse in 1840, and
                    so on. Since the middle of last century nearly all the states of Europe have
                    been active in map-making; and prolonged effort has produced rich results.
                    Surveying and mapping have been followed by the publication of topographic maps.
                    The states of the Balkan peninsula alone lag behind; there no comprehensive
                    survey.has been undertaken at public expense. As a summary of these great
                    achievements in the larger part of Europe, we append a chronological<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For convenience of comparison
                    the different series for the British Isles are grouped together in the table in
                    the place of the earliest date.</p></note> table of the most important surveys,
                    with the date of the publication of the first sheet, the name of the country,
                    the title of the map, the scale, and the number of sheets. Outside of Europe
                    there are but few countries in which a survey based on exact triangulation has
                    been carried out. The largest areas thus measured are the United States of North
                    America and British India, where great activity has been shown; and to these may
                    be added Asiatic Russia, portions of Australia, portions of the Dutch
                    possessions in the East Indies, and Algeria. In the whole of South America there
                    is only one country, Chili, of which we possess a map based upon a careful
                    survey. In the second portion of the table consequently some maps are included
                    which are merely the work of private cartographers, and the list must be
                    regarded as tentative.</p>
