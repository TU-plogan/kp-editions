                    (“utriusque gentis sanguinem traho ”) that he was the son of a Norman father and
                    an English mother; he undoubtedly represents the fusion of the two races,
                    although his sympathies as a writer are unmistakably on the side of the
                    conquerors. He received his early education at the ancient Benedictine abbey at
                    Malmesbury, and he speaks of Aldhelm, bishop of Sherborne, the great benefactor
                    and second founder of that house, who died in 709, as his “lord and patron,” to
                    whom he was indebted both for his life and his learning <hi rend="italic"

                    The earliest known incident in his personal history is the fact, which he
                    himself records, that he assisted the abbot Godefrey in collecting books to form
                    the first library of the abbey. William himself subsequently became the
                    librarian, and was also precentor of the abbey; in 1140 he received the offer of
                    the abbacy, an honour which he declined, probably from a desire to secure as
                    much leisure as possible for study. In his later life he was honoured by the
                    particular friendship of Robert, earl of Gloucester, a natural son of Henry I.,
                    and a distinguished patron of learned men and letters. In politics he was a warm
                    partisan of the empress Matilda against Stephen, and he was present at the
                    council of Winchester convened by her supporters in 1141. His death is supposed
                    to have occurred in or after 1142.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Printed Works.—</hi> William’s earliest important work was the
                    <hi rend="italic">Gesta</hi><hi rend="italic">Regum Anglorum,</hi> which he
                    dedicated to his patron, the earl of Gloucester. It was originally completed in
                    1120, but subsequently brought down to 1128. It extends from 449 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> to the twentyeighth year of the reign of Henry I.,
                    and is a record of the highest value, preserving from unknown sources numerous
                    facts which would otherwise be lost to us. In 1125 William completed his <hi
                    rend="italic">Gesta Pontificum</hi><hi rend="italic">Anglorum.</hi> He himself
                    tells us that the production of this work cost him especial pains, but that the
                    material for its composition was neither so abundant nor so easily reducible <pb

                    >Gesta</hi><hi rend="italic">Regum.</hi> The work may be regarded as the main
                    source for our early ecclesiastical history, and constitutes the basis of later
                    productions relating to the same subject at the same period. It is divided into
                    five books, the bishops being grouped under their respective sees, and the chief
                    monasteries under their jurisdiction being also noticed, sometimes at
                    considerable length. The fifth book is mainly occupied by the life of St
                    Aldhelm, and includes numerous details of interest not given in the earlier life
                    by Faricius. The <hi rend="italic">Gesta Pontificum</hi> is likewise brought by
                    further additions down to the year 1140. William’s last work was a continuation
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Gesta</hi><hi rend="italic">Regum</hi> under the title
                    of <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">Novella.</hi> It concludes
                    abruptly with the escape of Matilda from Oxford when besieged there by Stephen
                    in 1142, and the manner of its termination suggests that the narrative was
                    broken off by the death of the writer. Like the <hi rend="italic">Gesta</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Regum,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> is dedicated to
                    the duke of Gloucester, whose doings in behalf of his sister Matilda are
                    described in such a way äs to make him in a great measure the central figure of
                    the narrative. Other printed writings of William are an account of the church of
                    Glastonbury (included along with the life of St Aldhelm in Gale’s <hi

                    Savile’s <hi rend="italic">Scriptores</hi> is faulty in the extreme. The <hi

                    Mr N. E. S. A. Hamilton, from a manuscript which he was the first to identify as
                    the autograph of William himself.</p>

                    in 1140. This was written by William from the oral account which he received
                    from Peter Baldwin, John’s companion. A few extracts are given by Leland in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Collectanea,</hi> iii. 272.</p>
                <p>Malmesbury’s merits as an historian are of a very high order. He labours, it is
                    true, under the defect of being but imperfectly acquainted with English
                    institutions, and having but little sympathy with the English race, while he
                    occasionally evinces a Norman contempt for the English language. His habitual
                    carelessness in chronology is also at times extremely perplexing, and his
                    narrative of facts is alloyed with romantic details which serve to excite
                    distrust with respect to his general credibility. But, notwithstanding these
                    faults, he is entitled to rank as an authority (in relation to the period of
                    which he treats) with Bede and Matthew Paris. He is again the first of our
                    historical writers in whom the critical faculty is to any extent discernible,
                    and the comparisons which he occasionally institutes between two different and
                    discrepant accounts of the same events form a noteworthy feature in his mode of
                    treatment. The pains and judgment which he employs in the arrangement of his
                    materials are also often no less conspicuous than his industry in collecting
                    them.</p>
