                    single names, is used.</p></note> This John Mark went with Barnabas and Paul on
                    their missionary journey, as far as Perga in Pamphylia, and then, “departing
                    from them, returned to Jerusalem” (Acts xii. 25; xiii. 13). His departure was
                    afterwards the occasion of a “sharp contention” between Paul and Barnabas; the
                    former “thought not good to take with them him who withdrew from them from
                    Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work”; the latter “took Mark, and
                    sailed away into Cyprus” (Acts xv. 38, 39). On the subsequent history of Mark
                    the Acts of the Apostles are silent.</p>
                <p>The same name Mark occurs in three Pauline epistles. (1) In Col. iv. 10 the
                    writer enumerates Mark among his fellow-workers, mentioning also that he was a
                    nephew (some translate “cousin ”) of Barnabas, and implying that he was a Jew
                    (“of the circumcision ”), He is evidently about to send him, in accordance with
                    a previous intimation, on a special mission to the Cυlossians; but there is no
                    evidence, except the statement of the Coptic subscription to the epistle, to
                    show whether the contemplated journey took place. (2) In Philemon 24 the writer
                    also mentions Mark as one of his fellow-workers, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    probably in preaching the gospel during his imprisonment at Rome. (3) In 2 Tim.
                    iv. 11 the writer gives the charge to Timothy, “Take Mark and bring him with
                    thee, for he is useful to me for ministering.” It is a plausible conjecture that
                    this is a request that Mark might be brought back to Rome after his mission to
                    Colossae.</p>
                <p>The same name also occurs in 1 Peter v. 13, “Mark, my son.” This expression has
                    sometimes been taken literally; but it is more usually understood in a
                    metaphorical sense, as meaning that Peter had converted Mark. Those who take
                    “Babylon” in the same passage to mean Rome necessarily infer that Mark was with
                    Peter at Rome; a tradition to the same effect is mentioned in fragments of
                    Clement of Alexandria, preserved in Eusebius, <hi rend="italic">II. E.,</hi> ii.
                    15; vi. 14.</p>
                <p>The preponderance of patristic and mediaeval tradition is in favour of the
                    hypothesis that the same person is designated in all these passages of the New
                    Testament. But other hypotheses have found favour, especially among those
                    writers of various schools who have felt a difficulty in understanding how the
                    same person should be an intimate companion at once of St Paul and of St Peter.
                    It has been supposed (1) that the John Mark of the Acts is the Mark of the
                    Pauline epistles, but not the Mark of 1 Peter; (2) that the John Mark of the
                    Acts, the Mark of the Pauline epistles, and the Mark of 1 Peter are all
                    different; (3) that the John Mark of the Acts is the Mark of 1 Peter, but not
                    the Mark of the Pauline epistles. Into the arguments for these several
                    hypotheses it is unnecessary to enter here; they are of course complicated by
                    the prior question of the authenticity and date of the books of the New
                    Testament in which the name occurs. The most elaborate modern discussion of the
                    question, which arrives at the conclusion that the first of the three hypotheses
                    just mentioned is the true one, is contained in the work of Molini, whose title
                    is given below. But, whether there was only one Mark or more than one, there is
                    a general belief, which rests ultimately on the testimony of the presbyter
                    (John) who is quoted by Papias (ap. Euseb., <hi rend="italic">II. E.,</hi> iii.
                    39, 15), that the second canonical Gospel, or its original, is to be ascribed to
                    the Mark who was the disciple of St Peter.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    are prominent in the New Testament, there is a large mass of traditional
                    biography, in which possible fact and obvious fiction are so closely interwoven
                    as not to be easily disentangled, and which would not be worth recording were it
                    not for the later historical associations which have clustered round it.</p>
                <p>Of Mark’s birth and country nothing is positively known; the m ιjority of
                    mediaeval writers state that he was a Levite; but this is probably no more than
                    an inference from his supposed relationship to Barnabas. The Alexandrian
                    tradition seems to have been that he was of Cyrenaean origin; and Severus, a
                    writer of the 10th century, adds to this the statement that his father’s name
                    was Aristobulus, who, with his wife Mary, was driven from the Pentapolis to
                    Jerusalem by an invasion of barbarians (Severus Aschimon, ap. Renaudot, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist. Patriarch. Alex.,</hi> p. 2). In the apocryphal Acts of
                    Barnabas, which profess to be written by him, he speaks of himself as having
                    been formerly a servant of Cyrillus, the high priest of Zeus, and as having been
                    baptized at Iconium. The presbyter John, whom Papias quotes, says distinctly
                    that “he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him” (ap. Eusebius, Z.c.); and
                    this positive statement is fatal to the tradition, which does not appear until
                    about two hundred and fifty years afterwards, that he was one of the seventy
                    disciples (Epiphanius, pseudo-Origen <hi rend="italic">De recta in
                    Deuτnfide,</hi> and the author of the <hi rend="italic">Paschal Chronicle).</hi>
                    Various other results of the tendency to fill up blank names in the gospel
                    history must be set aside on the same ground; it was, for example, believed that
                    Mark was one of the disciples who “went back” because of the “hard saying”
                    (pseudo-Hippolyt., <hi rend="italic">De LXX.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Apostolis</hi> in Cod. B.u ’ occ. ap. Migne, <hi rend="italic">Patrol.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Graec.,</hi> vol. x. 955); there was an Alexandrian tradition that
                    he was one of the servants at the miracle of Cana of Galilee, that he was the
                    “man bearing a pitcher of water” in whose house the last supper was prepared,
                    and that he was also the owner of the house in which the disciples met on the
                    evening of the resurrection (Renaudot, <hi rend="italic">l.c.)</hi>; and even in
                    modern times there has been the conjecture that he was the “certain young man”
                    who “fled naked” from Gethsemane, Mark xiv. 51, 52 (Olshausen).</p>
                <p>A tradition which was widely diffused, and which is not in itself improbable, was
                    that he afterwards preached the gospel and presided over the church at
                    Alexandria (the earliest extant testimony is that of Eusebius, <hi rend="italic"
                    >H. E.,</hi> ii. 16, 1; ii. 24; for the fully-developed legend of later times
                    see Symeon Metaphrastes, <hi rend="italic">Pita 8.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Marci,</hi> and Eutychius, <hi rend="italic">Origines</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ècclesiae</hi><hi rend="italic">Alexandrinae).</hi> There was another, though
                    perhaps not incompatible, tradition that he preached the ≡el and presided over
                    the church at Aquileia in North Italy. The est testimony in favour of this
                    tradition is the vague statement of Gregory of Nazianzus that Mark preached in
                    Italy, but its existence in the 7th century is shown by the fact that in 629
                    A.ι&gt;. Heraclius sent the patriarchal chair from Alexandria to Grado, to which
                    city the patriarchate of Aquileia had been then transferred <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Chron. Patriarch. Gradens.,</hi> ap. Ughelli, <hi rend="italic">Italia
                    Sacra,</hi> tom. v. p. 1086; for other references to the general tradition see
                    De Rubeis, <hi rend="italic">Monum. Eccles. Aquileien.,</hi> c. 1; <hi
                    rend="italic">Acta Sanctorum,</hi> ad April, xxv. ). It was through this
                    tradition that Mark became connected with Venice, whither the patriarchate was
                    further transferred from Grado; an early Venetian legend, which is represented
                    in the Cappella Zen in the basilica of St Mark, antedates this connexion by
                    picturing the evangelist as having been stranded on the Rialto, while it was
                    still an uninhabited island, and as having had the future greatness of the city
                    revealed to him (Danduli, <hi rend="italic">Chron.,</hi> iv. 1, ap. Muratori,
                    <hi rend="italic">Per. Ital. Script.,</hi> vol. xii. 14).</p>
                <p>The earliest traditions appear to imply that he died a natural death (Eusebius,
                    Jerome, and even Isidore of Seville); but the Martyrologies claim him as a
                    martyr, though they do not agree as to. the manner of his martyrdom. According
                    to the pseudo-Hippolytus he was burned; but Symeon Metaphrastes and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Paschal Chronicle</hi> represent him to have been dragged over
                    rough stones until he died. But, however that may be, his tomb appears to have
                    been venerated at Alexandria, and there was a firm belief at.Venice in the
                    Middle Ages that his remains had been translated thither in the 9th century (the
                    fact of the translation is denied even by Tillemont; the weakness of the
                    evidence in support of the tradition is apparent even in Molini’s vigorous
                    defence of it, lib. ii., c. 2; the minute account which the same writer gives,
                    lib. ii. c. 11, of the discovery of the supposed actual bones of the evangelist
                    in 1811 A.n., is interesting). There was another though less” widely accepted
                    tradition, that the remains soon after their translation to Venice were
                    retranslated to the abbey of Reichenau on Lake Constance; a circumstantial
                    account of this retranslation is given in the treatise <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ex</hi><hi rend="italic">Miraculis</hi><hi rend="italic">S.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Marci,</hi> ap. Pertz, <hi rend="italic">Mon. Hist.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">German. Script.,</hi> tom. iv. p. 449. It may be added that the
                    Venetians prided themselves on possessing, not only the body of St Mark, but
                    also the autograph of his Gospel; this autograph, however, proved on examination
                    to be only part of a 6th-century book of the Gospels, the remainder of which was
                    published by Bianchini as the <hi rend="italic">Evangcliarium Forojuliense</hi>;
                    the Venetian part of this MS. was found some years ago to have been wholly
                    destroyed by damp.</p>
                <p>It has been at various times supposed that Mark wrote other works besides the
                    Gospel. Several books of the New Testament have been attributed to him: viz.,
                    the Epistle to the Hebrews (Spanheim, <hi rend="italic">Op. Miscell.,</hi> vol.
                    ii. p. 240), the Epistle of Jude <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Holtzmann, <hi
                    rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Synoptische Evangelien,</hi> p. 373),
                    the Apocalypse (Hitzig, <hi rend="italic">Ueber Johannes Marcus,</hi> Zurich,
                    1843). The apocryphal <hi rend="italic">A eta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Barnabae</hi> purport to have been written by him. There is a liturgy which
                    bears his name, and which exists in two forms; the one form was found in a MS.
                    of the 12th century in Calabria, and is, according to Renaudot, the foundation
                    of the three liturgies of St Basil, St Gregory Nazianzen, and St Cyril; the
                    other is that which is used by the Maronite and Jacobite Syrians. Both forms
                    have been published by Renaudot, <hi rend="italic">Liturg. Oriental.
                    Collect,</hi> vol. i. p. 127, and vol. ii. p. 176, and in Neale’s <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Holy Eastern Church·,</hi> but neither has any
                    substantial claim to belong to the ante-Nicene period of Christian
                    literature.</p>
                <p>The symbol by which Mark is designated in Christian art is usually that of a
                    lion. Each of the “four living creatures” of Ezekiel and the Apocalypse has been
                    attributed to each of the four evangelists in turn; Augustine and Bede think
                    that Mark is designated by the “man”; Theophylact and others think that he is
                    designated by the eagle; Anastasius Sinaita makes his symbol the ox; but
                    mediaeval art acquiesced in the opinion of Jerome that he was indicated by the
                    lion. Most of the martyrologies and calendars assign April 25 as the day on
                    which he should be commemorated; but the <hi rend="italic">Martyr. Hieron.</hi>
                    gives September 23, and some Greek martyrologies give January 11. This unusual
                    variation probably arises from early differences of opinion as to whether there
                    was one Mark or more than one.</p>
