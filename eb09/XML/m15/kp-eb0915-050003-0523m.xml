                    Mohammedan princes. Among the personages commonly referred to by this title the
                    following may be noticed.</p>
                <p>1. Abu Ja'far ibn Mohammed, second caliph of the house of 'Abbas, who reigned
                    754-775 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Mohammedan
                    Empire.</hi></p>
                <p>2. Abù Tâhir Isma'il ibn Al-Kâim, third Fatimite caliph of Africa (946-953).
                    Under Al-Kâim, his father, the Fatimites, already weakened by their conflict
                    with the Omayyads of Spain, were threatened with utter ruin by a Berber rising
                    under Abù Yezid, a poor nonconformist (Tbâdi) schoolmaster, who appeared as a
                    religious reformer, and gathered round him the Sunnites, who detested the
                    Fatimites. In 944 Abιi Yezid conquered the capital Kairawân, and recognized the
                    spiritual headship of the Spanish caliph. While the Spanish caliph and his
                    vassals stripped the Fatimite of his remoter possessions, Abd Yezid pressed him
                    at home, and during the siege of Susa Al-Kâim died, and was succeeded by
                    Al-Mansdr. Then the fortunes of war rapidly turned. Abd Yezid alienated many of
                    his followers by lapsing into habits of arrogant luxury and by treachery towards
                    the Sunnites. At length he lost all he had won, fell into the hands of
                    Al-Mansdr, and was put to death (947). The caliph built the city of Man-sdriyah
                    on the field of the decisive battle and made it hi.s residence; the empire was
                    rapidly restored, and the Spanish vassals driven from Africa. Al-Mansdr died at
                    Mansdri-yah, and was succeeded by Al-Mo'izz, the conqueror of Egypt (see vol.
                    vii. p. 750 sg ’.).</p>
                <p>3. Ibn Abi 'Amir Mohammed, commonly called Almanzor by European writers, of an
                    ancient but not illustrious Arab family, which had its seat at Torroχ near
                    Algeciras, was born 939 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and began life as a
                    lawyer at Cordova. In 967 he obtained a place at the court of Hakam II., the
                    Andalusian caliph, and by an unusual combination of the talents of a courtier
                    with administrative ability and address in dealing with men, rapidly rose to
                    distinction, enjoying in particular the powerful support of Subh, the favourite
                    of the caliph and mother of his heir Hisliâm. On the death of Hakam (976) the
                    accession of a minor gave fresh scope to the genius of Ibn Abi 'Amir, who
                    threaded his way with consummate but unscrupulous talent through the intrigues
                    of the court, and in 978 became prime minister. He now aimed at absolute
                    dominion. The weak young caliph, absorbed in exercises of piety, was easily
                    reduced to a cipher, but at first Ibn Abi 'Amir had to share the power with his
                    father-in-law Ghâlib, the best general of Andalusia, and his chief aid, along
                    with the mother of Hishâm, in the steps that had raised him to power. At last a
                    rupture took place between the two ministers, and ended in a war in which Ghâlib
                    professed himself the champion of the caliph and called in the aid of the
                    Christians of Leon. But his rival had anticipated the struggle; he had long
                    before found means to add military to administrative reputation, and since he
                    rose to the direction of affairs had remodelled the army so as to make it more
                    formidable and more devoted to his cause. Ghâlib fell in battle (981); a
                    victorious campaign chastised the Leonese; and on his return to Cordova the
                    victor assumed the regal surname of Λl-Mansûr billah, and became practically
                    sovereign of Andalusia. The caliph was a mere prisoner of state, holding a
                    nominal dignity, and Al-Mansxrr ultimately assumed the title as well as the
                    prerogatives of king (996). Unscrupulous in the means by which he rose to power,
                    he wielded the sovereignty nobly. His strict justice and the enlightened
                    excellence of his internal administration were not less notable than his
                    military prowess. But it is by the latter that he is best known. His arms were
                    the terror of the Christians, and raised the Moslem power in Spain to a pitch it
                    had never before attained. He fought more than <pb break="no"

                    cities, including the three capitals of Leon, Pampeluna, and Barcelona, and the
                    sacred shrine of Santiago de Compostella. In Africa his armies were for a time
                    hard pressed by the revolt of Ziri, viceroy of Mauretania, but before his death
                    this enemy had also fallen. Al-Mansür died at Medinaceli 10th August 1002, and
                    was succeeded by his son Modaffar.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
