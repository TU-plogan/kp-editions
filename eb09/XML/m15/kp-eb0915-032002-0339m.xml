                    position as one of the great islands of Malaysia. In a wider sense the
                    peninsular formation begins properly at the head of the Gulf of Siam, about the
                    parallel of Bangkok. But this northern section between 10° and 13° 30' N. being
                    comprised within the limits of Siam proper and British Burmah, is not usually
                    included in Malacca, whose political frontier towards the north-west is thus
                    traced by the lower course of the river Pakshan, which there separates it from
                    Tenasserim, the southernmost division of British Burmah. But east of that river
                    there is no natural or political frontier towards Lower Siam, which embraces all
                    the land as far south as the river Muda on the west coast in 5° 33' N., and on
                    the east side as far as the state of Pahang in 4° N. The seaboard, which is
                    generally flat and overgrown with mangroves for 5 or 6 miles inland, is fringed
                    with numerous islands and insular groups, of which the chief are Salunga (Junk
                    Ceylon), Langkawi, and Pulo Penang on the west side; Singapore, Batang, and
                    Bintang at the southern extremity; Tantalem and Bardia on the east coast. All
                    these islands, which may have a total area of some 5000 square miles, seem to
                    have originally formed part of the mainland, of which they may be regarded as
                    scattered geological fragments.</p>
                <p>Although known to Europeans since the beginning of the 16th century, and nowhere
                    more than 100 miles from the sea, the interior still remains one of the least
                    known lιnds in Asia. D’Souza’s large map, prepared in 1879 for the British
                    Government, is still in many places almost a complete blank; the mountain ranges
                    are traced only for short distances, chiefly on the west side below Kedah; the
                    river courses and political boundaries are often merely conjectured, while the
                    elevation of some of the highest peaks is absolutely unknown. Accurate surveys,
                    however, have since then been made, especially by II. S. Deane in the Perak and
                    Selângor states, by D. D. Daly in most of the British native states,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A detailed account of Mr

                    extreme north, and by others in the extreme south about the Endau river basin
                    and at several other points, from which a rough idea may be formed of the
                    general orographic and geological features and hydrographic systems. The surface
                    seems to be everywhere essentially mountainous, and considerably more elevated
                    than had till recently been supposed. The land is traversed in its entire length
                    by a somewhat irregular and ill-defined backbone, forming a southern
                    continuation of the Arakan and Tenasserim ranges, but here falling to a mean
                    elevation of perhaps 3000 feet, and constituting a distinct water-parting
                    between the streams flowing east and west to the surrounding seas. The surface
                    is further varied by numerous spurs and detached ridges running mainly north and
                    south, besides isolated masses often vying in elevation with the central ranges.
                    Little space is thus left for upland plateaus, broad valleys, or lowland
                    alluvial plains of any extent, except about Tringgânu and Pahang on the east,
                    and Selângor on the west side. The highest ascertained altitudes are the Titi
                    Bangsa range (7000 feet), between Kedah and Perak; the Gunong Inas (5000)
                    ascended in 1881 by Deane; the Gunong Bubu (5650), and Gunong Ulu Tumulang
                    (6435), near the right and left banks of the Perak river; the</p>
                <p>Slim range (6000 to 7000) in south-east Perak; the Gunong Rajah (6500), in the
                    main range; a peak (7000) in the Endau river basin, nearly double the height of
                    Gunong Ledang, or Mount Ophir (3849), hitherto supposed to be the highest point
                    in the extreme south. But an unexplored ridge towards the west frontier of
                    Kelantan, with a probable elevation of 8500 or 9000 feet, is taken by Miklucho
                    Maclay as the culminating land of the whole peninsula. These mountains are
                    scarcely any where traversed by recognized beaten tracks, the natural passes
                    between the eastern and western watersheds being still mostly overgrown by dense
                    jungle. Deane, however, came upon a forest path across the main water-parting
                    from Kedah to Patâni, and a route is said to lead from the Bernam river basin
                    across the main axis to Pahang on the east side.</p>
                <p>Owing to the formation of the land, the rivers, although numerous, are
                    necessarily of short length, and, as their mouths are generally obstructed by
                    bars and coral reefs, they are on the whole more useful for irrigation than as
                    water highways. Nevertheless some are navigable by light craft for considerable
                    distances, and in 1881 Deane steamed up the Bernam between Perak and Selângor to
                    Kampong Chankat Bertiham, 76 miles from the coast. He proceeded by boat thence
                    for 9 miles to Simpang, where the stream divides and shallows. For about 80
                    miles it is 10 to 17 feet deep, while the Perak, with its chief tributaries, the
                    Plus, Kinta, and Batang Padang, presents a total navigable waterway of perhaps
                    200 miles. The Perak on the west and the Pahang on the east slope are by far the
                    largest river basins in the peninsula, each draining an area of 5000 to 6000
                    square miles. The other chief streams are the Selângor and Klang on the
                    southwest coast, the Johôr facing Singapore, and on the east side the Endau,
                    Kelantan, and Patâni.</p>
                <p>As far as has been ascertained, the main geological formations would appear to be
                    Lower Devonian sandstones and unfossilized clay slates, with a basis of grey
                    stanniferous granite everywhere cropping out. Although no trace has been found
                    of recent volcanic action, there are several isolated and unstratified limestone
                    masses from 500 to 2000 feet high, of a highly crystallized character, with no
                    fossils of any kind. Earthquakes also are frequent, while numerous hot springs
                    attest the presence of still active igneous forces beneath the surface. In the
                    south porphyry occurs, associated with granite and clay ironstone; and laterite,
                    resembling that of the Malabar coast, abounds, especially along the west slope.
                    The rich stanniferous granites forming the backbone of the peninsula render this
                    region the most extensive storehouse of tin in the world, λ <hi

                    has amounted in some years to 25,000 and 30,000 ounces. Iron ores abound
                    especially in the south, and coal has recently been found in the isthmus of Krâ

                    banks of the coast streams. Higher up, although cooler, it is not always more
                    healthy, and the uplands, especially about Mount Ophir, have the reputation of
                    being extremely dangerous to Europeans (Wallace). Yet the mean temperature,
                    thanks to the general elevation of the land and the prevailing sea-breezes, is
                    much lower than that of many Asiatic lands lying much farther from the equator.
                    While the glass rises normally on the Makrân coast and in the Persian Gulf to
                    110°, 120°, and even 125° Fahr., the mean summer range in the peninsula scarcely
                    exceeds 90°, while at an altitude of 2500 feet it is under 70° for the whole
                    year. There is strictly speaking no winter, nor a distinctly marked rainy
                    season, the alternate north-east and south-west monsoons distributing the
                    moisture over the east and west slopes throughout most of the year. The average
                    number of rainy days is about one hundred and ninety, and the mean rainfall from
                    100 to 130 inches. The west coast is exposed to sudden squalls of short
                    duration, known as “Sumatras” from the direction whence they blow, while the
                    opposite side is often visited by tornadoes during the monsoons.</p>
                <p>Except in some limestone tracts, especially in Perak and Kedah, the soil is
                    generally poor, and the country, which may be described as of comparatively
                    recent formation slowly undergoing decomposition, is incapable of growing
                    sufficient rice even for the local demand (D. D. Daly). The land, however, is
                    almost everywhere clothed with a magnificent tropical vegetation, in which the
                    most conspicuous and useful plants are the gutta-percha (here first discovered),
                    the camphor tree, ebony, sapan, ratan, eagle wood, bamboo, nibung, and nipa
                    palm. Unfortunately the work of reckless destruction has already commenced, and
                    the Chinese miners have in many places cleared extensive tracts, cutting down
                    the finest trees to serve as fuel for smelting the tin ores. Of fruits the most
                    characteristic are the durian and mangosteen; and of cultivated plants the most
                    common are rice, the sugar cane, cotton, tobacco, yams, batata, cocoa and areca
                    palms. Tea and coffee might be successfully cultivated along the slopes of the
                    Perak and Selângor rivers (Deane). A species of climbing indigo and the wild
                    nutmeg are indigenous, and the true nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves have long been
                    introduced, and thrive well (Newbold).</p>
                <p>The fauna of the peninsula, which is unusually rich, is allied, like the flora
                    and the inhabitants, rather to that of the Eastern Archipelago than the
                    mainland. Here are the one-horned rhinoceros, Malay tapir (tânau), elephant, and
                    hog, all of the same species as those of Sumatra. Here is also a small bear
                    (bruangh), found elsewhere only in Borneo, as well as the Sundaox of Java,
                    besides two kinds of bison said to be peculiar to the peninsula (Crawfurd). On
                    the other hand, the Asiatic tiger has extended his range throughout the whole
                    region, even crossing over to Singapore and other adjacent islands. Of
                    quadrumanes there are no less than nine species, including the chimpanzee <hi

                    side as far as the southern frontier of Tringgânu in 4° 35' N. A line drawn from

                <p>Ligor, Sengora. These two provinces of Lower Siam proper comprise the isthmus of
                    Krâ between 7° and 10° N., with a coast-line of 240 miles on the east and 260 on
                    the west side; area perhaps 17,000 square miles; population, 50,000 (?).</p>
                <p>Kedah, between Ligor and Perak, 7° to 5° 35' N., with 120 miles on west coast;

                <p>Patâni or Raman, between Sengora and Kelantan, 7° to 5° 30' N., with coast-line
                    on east side 50 miles; area, 5000 square miles; population, 30,000.</p>
                <p>Kelantan, between Patâni and Tringgânu, 6° to 4° N., 60 miles coast on east side;
                    area, 7000 square miles; population, 20,000.</p>
                <p>Tringgânu with Kemâman, between Kelantan and Pahang, 5° 30' to 4° N., with 80

                <p>Perak, between Kedah and Selangor, 5° 30' to 4° N., with 80 miles coast-line on
                    vest side; area, 6500 square miles; population, 30,000.</p>

                <p>Johor, southern extremity of the peninsula from 2° 40' N. to Cape Romania; area,
                    10,000 square miles; population, 20,000.</p>
                <p>Pahang, between Johor and Tringgânu, 3° to 5° N., 90 miles coast on east side;
                    area, 3500 square miles; population, 20,000.</p>
                <p>Jelébu, Sungei Ujong, Sri Menanti, Jumpol, Johol, Rambau, Jelai, Segâmat or Moar.
                    These inland states, lying between 2° and 4° N., formerly constituted with
                    Naning (Malacca territory) the so-called Negri Sambilan, or “Nine Lands,”
                    governed by pan-glmlus or chiefs, feudatory first to the sultans of Malacca and
                    then to those of Johor. It is now proposed again to consolidate them in one
                    state under the suzerainty of or in alliance with Great Britain. They lie
                    surrounding Malacca territory, between Johor on the east, Pahang on the north,
                    and Selângor on the west and northwest. Total area probably not more than 5000
                    square miles; population, 50,000 (?). The more important are Rambau (Linggi
                    river basin), Segâmat (Moar river basin), Johol (north from Mount Ophir), and
                    Sungei Ujong (Lângat river basin).</p>
                <p>Straits Settlements: parts of Perak, Malacca, Pulo Penang, and Singapore; total
                    area, 1445 square miles; population (1881), 314,000.</p>
                <p>Excluding the Chinese, Klings, Bugis, and other more recent arrivals, the
                    inhabitants of all these states belong to three distinct stocks—the Tai
                    (Siamese), Malay, and Negrito. The Siamese of pure blood occupy the extreme
                    north with scattered communities as far south as the town of Sengora (7° 10'
                    N.). A mixed Malayo-Siamese people, commonly known as Samsams, form the bulk of
                    the population in the lower parts of Ligor and Sengora, and in the north of
                    Kedah. Although entirely assimilated to the Siamese in speech, customs, and
                    religion, these Samsams appear to be allied physically much more to the Malay
                    than to the Tai stock. Yet their national sympathies seem to be altogether with
                    the dominant race, and the people, especially of Ligor, have during the present
                    century <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n344/mode/1up"

                    reduction of Kedah in 1821 were caused chiefly by the ferocity of the Samsams of

                <p>All the rest of the peninsula, from about 7° N. to Cape Romania, may be regarded
                    as essentially “Malay land,” as it is in fact called by the people themselves.
                    But whether the Malays are here indigenous, or intruders from Sumatra, is a
                    question still warmly discussed by ethnologists. Those, however, who support the
                    latter view by appealing to the undoubted historic migrations of civilized
                    Malays from Menangkabo or Palembang in the 12th century, or even to still
                    earlier arrivals from Java, do not understand the point at issue. For the
                    peninsula is occupied, not only by these civilized Orang Malâyu of cultured
                    speech, Mohammedans and mostly no doubt originally from Sumatra, but also by the
                    Orang Benua, that is, “men of the soil,” or aborigines, of Malay stock and of
                    rude Malay speech, nature worshippers, and settled here from prehistoric times.
                    Similar uncultured Malay tribes, such as the Orang Kubu of Palembang, are no
                    doubt also found in Sumatra. But it is unlikely that any of these people ever
                    crossed the shallow intervening Straits of Malacca, which were probably dry land
                    when the race was gradually diffused over the common area. Whether the migration
                    proceeded eastwards or westwards is therefore a point which cannot be determined
                    pending the settlement of the further and broader question of the origin and
                    dispersion of the Malay race itself. If the Malays are a branch of the Mongol
                    stock, as many hold, then the Orang Benua must have passed through the peninsula
                    southwards to the archipelago at a time when most of it still formed part of the
                    Asiatic mainland. But if they originated in the archipelago itself, as others
                    maintain, then the stream of migration must have been reversed.</p>
                <p>in any case the Orang Benua are not the only aborigines in the peninsula. For the
                    most recent research has fully confirmed the somewhat vague statements of
                    earlier writers regarding the presence in this region of a Negroid element
                    differing fundamentally from the Malay type, and apparently to be affiliated to
                    the Negrito of the Andaman Islands and Philippines. “Purely anthropological
                    observations and considerations lead me to accept the supposition of a *
                    Melanesian’ element (a remnant of the original race), which through intermixture
                    with the Malays is being more and more supplanted In the mountains of Pahang and

                    respectively, although much confusion seems to have arisen in the use of these
                    terms, nor is this surprising, seeing that the two races themselves, who have
                    been in contact for ages, have become largely intermingled and assimilated in
                    customs, and even in speech. The original Negrito dialects, which Maclay has
                    compared with those of the Philippines, are everywhere yielding to the Malay,
                    which is spoken throughout the peninsula with little dialectic variety as far as
                    6’ and 7° N., where it is replaced by Siamese. The aborigines, who are said not
                    to number altogether more than some 10,000, are divided into a great many
                    tribes, of which the best known are the Jakuns, widespread in the south, the
                    Udai, Bâsisi, Sabimba, Mintira (Mantra), and Hala. All are in a very low state
                    of culture, holding aloof from the settled populations, living entirely on the
                    chase, and pursuing the game with poisoned arrows. It is noteworthy that even
                    the more or less civilized Malays, especially of Rambau and other inland states,
                    still hold to the tribal organization, the very names of many of theiι <hi

                    and Sri Lummah Menangkabau, betraying their comparatively recent migration from
                    Sumatra.</p>
                <p>Other ethnical elements in the peninsula are the Bugis from Celébes, formerly
                    powerful on the west coast; the “Moors” (Arabs), now mostly absorbed by the

                    the Topas (Topazio), half-caste Portuguese Christians, still numerous especially
                    in Malacca territory, a few Europeans, Battas, and African slaves; and, lastly,
                    the Chinese, by far the most numerous of all, who are gradually converting the
                    Malay peninsula into a second China. They have already monopolized the mining
                    and agricultural industries, as well as the retail trade and local shipping.</p>
                <p>Although vaguely known to the ancients as the Aurea Chersonesus, and even by them
                    already described as a “Regio Latronum,” or piratical land, the Malay peninsula
                    possesses no historic traditions carlier than the 13th century. According to the
                    native writers the first settlement was madeat Singa-pura, or the “Lion City,”
                    about 1250 by emigrants from the banks of a river Malâyu in Sumatra. Expelled
                    from Singapore by the Javanese king Majapâhit, the colonists founded the city of
                    Malacca on the south-west coast of the mainland in 1253. From this point the
                    cultured and Mohammedan Malays of Sumatra are supposed to have rapidly spread
                    over the whole peninsula, where they had already established a number of petty
                    piratical states, when the Portuguese under Albuquerque reached Malaysia and
                    reduced Malacca in 1511. Being thus, so to say, taken on the flank by the
                    Europeans, while their progress northwards was barred by the Siamese continually
                    pressing forward from Indo-China, the Malays of the peninsula, ever prone to
                    piracy and lawlessness, have remained in a more or less unsettled state almost
                    down to the present time. The Portuguese held Malacca for one hundred and thirty
                    years, when they were supplanted in 1641 by the Dutch, who yielded in 1795 to
                    the English, and finally in 1824 surrendered all their possessions on the
                    mainland to Great Britain in exchange for Bencoolen in Java. Penang and
                    Singapore had already been occupied by the British, who, by the suppression of
                    piracy and the old monopolies, the proclamation of free trade principles, the
                    example of a wise administration and treaties with the surrounding states, have
                    gradually laid a solid foundation for the future prosperity of this distracted
                    land. (A. H. K.).</p>
