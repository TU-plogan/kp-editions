                    employed in its widest sense, denotes that bare and monotonous elevated plateau
                    of central Spain which stretches between the mountains of Toledo and the western
                    spurs of the hills of Cuenca, being bounded on the S. by the Sierra Morena and
                    on the N. by the Alcarria, which skirts the upper course of the Tagus. It thus
                    comprises portions of the modern provinces of Toledo, Albacete, apd Cuenca, and
                    almost the whole of Ciudad Real. Down to the 16th century the eastern portion
                    was known as La Mancha de Montearagon or de Aragon, and the western simply as La
                    Mancha; afterward,“the north-eastern and south-western sections respectively
                    were distinguished by the epithets “Alta” and “Baja” (upper and lower). La
                    Mancha was created a province in 1691; its officially recognized boundaries have
                    since that time varied considerably, and in common parlance it is often now
                    identified with the modern province of Ciudad Real. Ciudad Real, which is
                    bounded on the N. by Toledo and Cuenca, on the E. by Albacete, on the S. by Jaen
                    and Cordova, and on the W. by Badajoz, ranks next to. Badajoz and Caceres in
                    point of extent, containing an area of 7840 square miles. The population in 1877
                    was 260,641. From the scarcity of water and the absence of trees and fences, as
                    also from the circumstance of the rural population being concentrated only at
                    certain points, it as a whole presents to the traveller the arid and cheerless
                    aspect of a desert. The principal river is the Guadiana, which rises in the
                    so-called Ojos (“Eyes ”) del Guadiana in the north-east, and is joined by the
                    Azuer and the Jabalon on the left, and by the united waters of the Zancara and
                    Giguela on the right. No advantage, unfortunately, is taken of these or any of
                    the other streams in the province for irrigation, the inhabitants depending
                    entirely on the meagre and precarious rainfall. A peculiarity of the province is
                    the facility with which water can be reached by digging; but neither has this
                    resource been turned to much account. The mineral wealth of the province (lead,
                    copper, iron, antimony, coal) is great, the cinnabar mines of Almaden, in
                    particular, which were known to the ancients, being the chief European source
                    for the supply of quicksilver. Saltpetre is obtained in several places,
                    especially in the north (Herencia and Alcazar de San Juan), and there are
                    quarries of fine stone at Santa Cruz and elsewhere. The crops, when not
                    interfered with by drought and locusts, the two scourges of La Mancha, are very
                    large; they include wheat, barley, rye, chick pease, wine (that of Valdepenas
                    being especially famous), vinegar, and brandy, some oil, saffron, esparto, flax,
                    and silk. The mules reared in the province are considered the best in or out of
                    Spain. There are manufactures of woollen fabrics, lace, earthenware, cutlery,
                    saltpetre, gunpowder, and soap. The lace of Almagro is much appreciated
                    throughout the peninsula. The province is traversed by the Madrid and Cordova
                    Railway, which enters near Alcazar de San Juan and passes through Manzanares and
                    Valdepenas, entering Jaen at the Venta de Cardenas in the Sierra Morena. The
                    Madrid and Badajoz line passes through Ciudad Real, the capital of the province,
                    which is connected by rail with Manzanares. There are ten judicial
                    partidos,—those of Alcâzar de San Juan, Almaden, Almagro, Almodôvar del Campo,
                    Ciudad Real, Daimiel, Infantes, ‘Manzanares, Piedrabuena, and Valdepenas. The
                    only towns having a population above 10,000 in 1877 were Almodôvar del Campo,
                    Ciudad Real, and Valdepenas.</p>
