                    Triumphator. In the actual worship of the Romans Mars bears a very different
                    character, which, however, had almost disappeared from the mind of the people
                    before Augustus built in the Forum his temple to-Mars Ultor, the avenger of the
                    murder of Julius Caesar.</p>
                <p>Father Mars, Marspiter, Maspiter, Mavors, ∙or Maurs, was the great god of one of
                    the races that composed the Roman state. He is the god of heaven, the giver of
                    light, the opener of the new year; he hurls the thunder and sends <pb break="no"

                    Way, was carried through the city by the <hi rend="italic">pontifices.</hi> The
                    first month of the old Roman year was the month of Mars, still called March. On
                    the first day the god had been born; and on the same day various annual
                    ceremonies both political and religious took place; and the holy fire was
                    renewed in the temple of Vesta. When Mamurius Veturius, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> Mars of the Year <hi rend="italic">(vetus,</hi> Greek ∕ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> ∈τos), was beaten out of the city on March 14, the
                    intention'was originally to symbolize the driving away of the old year. The
                    spear sacred to Mars was in its original sense doubtless the lightning, and his
                    sacred shield was, like the aegis of Zeus and Athene, the storm shield, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the thundercloud. The Sabine words Marmar and Mamers
                    (akin to <hi rend="italic">μαρμαίρω)</hi> are evidently names of the heaven-god.
                    The wolf which was sacred to Mars may be compared with the-wolves of Zeus
                    Lycaios, and the horse, the sacrifice of Mars, is the horse of the sun, which
                    the Greeks also sacrificed to Helios.</p>
                <p>As heaven-god and sender of rain, Mars is the giver of fertility and increase.
                    Hence in some of the oldest cults he is the god of the land,, of agriculture,
                    and of the flocks. As he was powerful to send fertility, so he could cause also
                    drought, sterility, and all evil; and propitiatory ceremonies, such as the
                    Ambarvalia, were consecrated to him. The Arvai brothers invoked Mars to assist
                    them and to avert pestilence. In the Robigalia a sheep and a reddish dog were
                    sacrificed by the flamen of Mars to avert mildew from the crops. The sacrifice
                    of the “October horse” in the Campus Martius, whose head the people of the
                    Subura and the Sacra Via struggled for in order to hang it up in their own
                    precincts, had also a naturalistic and apotropaic character. In times of
                    calamity there was an old Italian custom of dedicating to Mars a <hi
                    rend="italic">ver sacrum.</hi> Everything born in this spring was the property
                    of the god; the animals were sacrificed, the young men when they grew up were
                    sent out of the country. Mars seems also to have had some relation to the
                    religious ceremony of marriage. Along with Juno, the goddess of women and of
                    childbirth, he was worshipped by the Roman matrons on June 1 and at the
                    Matronalia on March 1. As god of the land and giver of increase, Mars was also
                    the god of death and the dead; he was one of the deities invoked by Decius when
                    devoting himself to death. He was likewise the giver of oracles: like Zeus he
                    révealed his will to men by certain signs. His ancient oracle at Tiora Matiene
                    near Caere resembled in character the oracle of Zeus at Dodona, in so far as
                    revelation took place by the medium of sacred birds and trees. Woodpeckers were
                    the sacred birds of Mars, and the noise which they made tapping on the trees was
                    one of the simplest methods of revelation. Picus, the woodpecker, was a name or
                    form of Mars, and was ultimately individualized as a local hero, an early king
                    of Latium, and son of the god. Faunus, the favouring deity, son of Picus, is
                    pre-eminently the god of prophecy; he also is closely related to the original
                    Italian character of Mars, which he retained far more truly than the great Roman
                    god.</p>
                <p>Although the worship of Mars was known both in Latium and in Etruria, it was
                    probably of Sabine origin. Quirinus, an undoubtedly Sabine word, is merely a
                    name of Mars, which never acquired complete individuality; the feeling always
                    remained alive in Rome that Mars and Quirinus were one, although they had
                    separate priests. It is in accordance with the Sabine character that the warlike
                    element should have been very strong in their conception of deity; ¾pd thus the
                    Sabine Mars became in the Roman pantheon the deity of war. Besides the
                    ceremonies round the altar of Mars in the Campus Martius, the oldest cults of
                    the god in Rome are the Sabine worship of Quirinus on the Quirinal and the Latin
                    worship of the holy spear of Mars in the temple of Vesta. There likewise grew at
                    an early time a cultus of the god on the Palatine, said to have been founded by
                    Numa, and twelve Salii of the Palatine existed alongside of the twelve Quirinal
                    Salii. The Palatine Salii performed one of the most remarkable ceremonies in the
                    Roman worship of Mars. For many days, beginning from March 1, they danced in
                    armour through certain parts of the city, clashing their lances on their
                    shields, and repeated the prescribed song. The shields which they carried were
                    the twelve sacred <hi rend="italic">ancilia</hi> preserved on the Palatine. One
                    of these, it was said, fell from heaven in the time of Numa, and the king, in
                    order to preserve safely this pledge of victory for the state, had eleven others
                    exactly like it made by Mamurius Veturius. The song of the Salii, besides
                    mentioning all the gods of the city, referred to Mamurius, whose name is only a
                    form of Mamers</p>
                <p>Next to Jupiter, Mars was the chief protecting god oι the Roman state. Quirinus
                    Mars was the father of the twin-founders of the city, and his sacred wolf was
                    the emblem of the city and the foster-mother of the twins. The Campus Martius
                    outside the city was dedicated to the god from a very early time; there the
                    young men practised their warlike exercises; there the horse races, <hi
                    rend="italic">equiria,</hi> in honour of Mars (February 27) and the sacrifice of
                    the “October horse” took place. There also was held the census every fifth year,
                    followed by the purificatory ceremonial for the whole city, which was dedicated
                    to Mars. When w ar broke out, the Roman general clashed the shield and spear in
                    the temple of Mars and invoked the god; the spoils of victory belonged to him
                    after Jupiter Feretrius.</p>
                <p>There was an ancient temple of Mars outside the Porta Capena on the Appian Way;
                    and on the ides of July, in commemoration of the battle of Lake Regillus, the
                    knights had a procession</p>
                <p>“From Castor in the Forum, To Mars without the wall.”</p>
                <p>As the god of war, who marched with his people to battle, Mars was Gradivus; such
                    at least was the later explanation of an old religious name. Inuus Lupercus, the
                    averter, to whom the Lupercalia was dedicated, was.probably a local form of
                    Mars; his character as protector of the Palatine city, and the warlike element
                    in him, resemble Mars (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Lupercalia).</hi> Silvanus is
                    also closely related to the agricultural god Mars, who is sometimes called Mars
                    Silvanus. A goddess named Nerio or Neriene is sometimes mentioned as wife of
                    Mars. There was also a goddess Bellona, whose name marks her strictly as the
                    goddess of wai’; she is called the sister or daughter or wife of Mars. Quirinus,
                    on the Quirinal, had a festival called Quirinalia, on the 17th of February.</p>
