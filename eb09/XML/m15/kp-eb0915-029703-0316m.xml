                <p><label type="entry">MAINE</label>, the most north-easterly of the United States,
                    lies between 43° 4' and 47° 27' 33" N. lat., and between 66° 56' 48" and 71° 6'
                    41" W. long. It is 302 miles in extreme length and 285 in width, with a total
                    area of 33,040 square miles (of which 29,895 square miles are land), being
                    nearly, as large as all the other New England States combined. Its figure
                    resembles that of a mountain peak, broken at the top. Its S.E. base rests on the
                    Atlantic Ocean. On the E. and N. it has the province of New Brunswick, and on
                    the N.W, the province of Quebec, while its southern half is bounded on the W. by
                    the State of New Hampshire.</p>
                <p>The coast-line measured direct is about 225 miles in extent; but the numerous
                    river mouths and indentations of the sea make an actual tide-water line of not
                    less than 2500 miles. The headlands and far-stretching narrow points, together
                    with innumerable outlying islands, give to the whole ocean front the appearance
                    of a fringed and tasselled border. This striking feature, which gives peculiar
                    interest in many ways to the coast of Maine, is chiefly the result of a
                    southward glacial movement, which, coinciding with the trend of the rocks
                    produced by a remote geologic upheaval, cut these fiord valleys far out into the
                    sea, the prolongation of their edges being marked by islands, reefs, and
                    scattered knobs of rock. In these deep bays and river mouths, and behind these
                    outlying islands, are numerous harbours, convenient, safe, and capacious, and
                    the poet is well within the truth who sings of “hundred-harboured Maine.” There
                    are no better harbours on the Atlantic coast than those of Portland and
                    Wiscasset. The beaches and marshes and low grassy islands common in the west are
                    scarcely found east of the Kennebec river, beyond which the shore becomes more
                    and more bold, rising in the precipitous cliffs and rounded summits of Mount
                    Desert and Quoddy Head to a height of from 1000 to 1500 feet. The general slope
                    of the land surface falls from an extreme elevation of 2000 feet on the west, in
                    the neighbourhood of the white Mountains, to 600 feet on the east. Two principal
                    drainage slopes stretch respectively southward and northward from a watershed
                    which crosses the State in a general easterly and westerly direction, at a
                    distance of about 140 miles from the coast, while the northward slope has an
                    extreme <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n317/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0317-0298"/> breadth of about 80 miles. The general direction
                    of the rivers, as determined by these slopes, is about south-southeast for the
                    southern slope and north-north-east for the northern. It is a noteworthy fact
                    that the course of the principal rivers is at right angles to the general trend
                    of the stratified rocks, throughout the large section where these are exhibited.
                    The surface is hilly and rolling rather than mountainous. The Appalachian range,
                    which becomes so prominent in the White Mountain group just westward of the
                    State, seems to have broken its force there and to have strewn only a few
                    scattered mountain masses across middle Maine and into New Brunswick. These all
                    have a peculiar aspect, rising in conical peaks, heavily wooded at the base and
                    bare at the summit. The most noteworthy is Mount Katahdin, with a height of 5385
                    feet (a little less than Mount Washington), and in its isolation and crater-like
                    formation the most remarkable mountain in New England.</p>
                <p>The lakes of Maine, situated for the most part among these mountain regions, are
                    among its characteristic and most attractive features. They number more than
                    1570, with an aggregate area of 2300 square miles, about one-fifteenth part of
                    the entire area of the State. The largest is Moosehead Lake, 35 miles long by 10
                    miles wide; but many others of less size are more picturesque. Their height
                    above the sea-level is noticeable. Rangely Lake, at the head of the Androscoggin
                    river, is 1511 feet high, this altitude being very nearly that of Lake Itasca at
                    the head of the Mississippi; Moosehead, on the Kennebec waters, is 1023 feet in
                    height, or nearly two-thirds as high again as Lake Superior at the source of the
                    St Lawrence; Chamberlain Lake, on the headwaters of the St John, 926 feet, and
                    Chesuncook, on the Penobscot, 900 feet high, are 400 or 500 feet above the level
                    of Lake Winnepesaukee in New Hampshire. Most of the lakes of Maine lie within
                    regions as yet unsettled, where nature’s wild luxuriance and grandeur are still
                    undisturbed by man. Few similarly habitable regions possess lakes in such
                    numbers and of such size, variety of situation, and beauty of aspect and
                    surroundings. They are, moreover, nearly all connected with the river systems of
                    the State, and constitute vast reservoirs for evaporation, irrigation, and
                    mechanical power.</p>
                <p>All the principal rivers rise at great elevations—the Saco at an altitude of 1890
                    feet, the Androscoggin 3000, the Kennebec 2000, the Penobscot 2500, the St John
                    1980. The general drainage areas, however, fall off in height and increase in
                    breadth in proportion as their location is easterly. The principal features of
                    the water systems of Maine are the great amount of fall, the control of steady
                    volume by the storage capacity of the lakes, and tfie situation of the best
                    falls in the lower sections of the rivers where the volume is largest, and in
                    many instances at the head of tide-waters where vessels may come to their very
                    feet. The waterpower of the State available for industrial purposes has been
                    estimated by Walter Wells, in his valuable report on that subject, to amount to
                    1,229,200,000,000 cubic feet, with gross power of 4427 horse for each foot of
                    fall, making a total of 2,656,200 horse-power.</p>
                <p>The important geological features are connected with the highly crystalline
                    metamorphic condition of the strata, which rarely lie in horizontal position,
                    but are upturned, bent, folded, and fractured. Fossiliferous rocks occur only in
                    limited localities in the interior. In various places veins of silver-bearing
                    galena and of copper are exposed. Granite of every variety and quality abounds
                    in veins and in eruptive masses. The western portion of the State is largely
                    granitic in its features, and a belt of the same rocks extends along the entire
                    sea-coast. There are also beautiful varieties of syenite. In many places the
                    granite is very coarse, so that the constituents can be separated, and each
                    utilized for industrial purposes. The felspar, quartz, and mica often lie in
                    large contiguous veins. Valuable beds of crystalline limestone are found in many
                    places along the coast, and in the Aroostook region. Argillaceous slates as well
                    as limestone occur in the interior and in the north. On the Piscataquis, a
                    tributary of the Penobscot, the slate is suitable for writing-slates and
                    pencils, blackboards, and tables, while large quantities of roofing slate are
                    found throughout the whole region between the Kennebec and Penobscot. There are
                    also some beds of marble well suited for building purposes. Some surface iron is
                    found, especially in one locality in the interior known as the Katahdin
                    iron-works, where the iron is remarkably pure owing to its freedom from sulphur
                    and phosphorus. A bed of haematite is found in Aroostook county.</p>
                <p>The soil is mostly of glacial origin, derived largely from boulders and a mixture
                    of rocks transported from various and often distant localities. This drift is
                    spread everywhere over the surface. Along the lake-beds and rivers are some
                    alluvial soils and old flood-planes. Deposits of Quaternary marine clays occur
                    along the south border, rising to the height of 200 feet above the sea. These
                    clays were deposited during the Champlain epoch, at a time when the temperature
                    of the water was much lower than at present, as is indicated by the fossil
                    remains which abound in them. In the lower strata these remains of life are of
                    the same species as are now found living in the Arctic seas. Skeletons of the
                    walrus have been found in Portland and elsewhere. In the upper strata the
                    remains of life indicate the same species as now exist on the coast. Isolated
                    forms of life not elsewhere found north of Massachusetts occur in the north part
                    of Quohaug Bay (northeast of Casco Bay), composed of various species which seem
                    to be a remnant of former life on this coast. A family of living oysters is
                    still found among the debris of giant progenitors in the Damariscotta river,
                    east of the Kennebec; and remains of the oyster, quohaug, and scallop are
                    abundant in the numerous and extensive shell-heaps found all along the
                    coast.</p>
                <p>In general it may be said that animal life in this State shows a mixture of
                    northern and southern forms, and but little that is peculiar as compared with
                    surrounding regions. The moose, caribou, and deer still roam in the vast forests
                    in the north. The bear, wolf, catamount, wolverene, wild cat, fox, beaver,
                    raccoon, marten, sable, woodchuck, rabbit, and squirrel keep at a due distance
                    from man, and so still exist. Seals are found in many of the bays. Wild geese
                    and ducks and other sea fowl frequent the lakes and bays in the migratory
                    season, and eagles, ospreys, gulls, hawks, kingfishers, owls, plover, woodcock,
                    partridges, pigeons, quails, blackbirds, robins, orioles, bobolinks, blue birds,
                    swallows and sparrows in all variety, yellow birds, and humming birds are
                    common. The inland waters teem with fish of various kinds—pickerel, togue, and
                    bream, and, chief of all, the trout, whose beauty and size attract numbers of
                    sportsmen; while in the rivers the sturgeon, bass, and salmon are still
                    plentiful. Game laws protect several species of the fish, birds, and other
                    animals. Along the coast the clam, mussel, and lobster are abundant, and in some
                    places the horse-shoe crab is found. Of shore-fish the cunner, flounder,
                    rock-cod, and sculpin are most common, while off shore cod, haddock, hake,
                    herring, pollack, menhaden, porgy, and mackerel abound. The black fish and
                    porpoise are not uncommon. Gigantic cuttle-fishes, measuring 4.0 feet and
                    upwards in the long tentacles, and thus not inaptly termed sea-serpents, have
                    sometimes been seen in these waters.</p>
                <p>The forests of Maine consist chiefly of pine, spruce, <pb break="no"

                    along the coast, and other hard wood growth in the highlands of the Aroostook.
                    The white cedar is common, especially in the low lands in the east and
                    north-east. The hackmatack or black larch appears in the same localities. White
                    and red oak, rock (or sugar) maple, white maple, white and yellow birch, white
                    and brown ash, beech, cherry, basswood (linden), and poplar are the common
                    deciduous trees. Chestnut and walnut are rare, and are found only near the
                    south-west border. The majestic mast pine—the heraldic emblem of Maine, which
                    has given it the sobriquet the “Pine Tree State ”—is fast receding before the
                    demands of commerce. Of fruit trees the chief is the apple. The plum, cherry,
                    and pear are also natural. The peach thrives only in the south-west border.
                    Species of grape, gooseberry, and currant are native, and others are cultivated
                    with advantage. The blackberry, raspberry, and strawberry grow wild in profusion
                    throughout the State.</p>
                <p>The climate of Maine, while on the whole cooler than might be expected from its
                    mean latitude of 45° N., cannot be considered severe or unfavourable to health.
                    The summer heats are tempered by the sea and the cool north winds. The winter
                    cold has a constancy which makes it less severely felt than the changing
                    temperature of more southern places. The air is also more dry and pure owing to
                    the snow surface. The average winter temperature is about 20°, and remains
                    pretty steadily below the freezing-point throughout the State for at least three
                    months. By reason of the tides and the prevailing off-shore winds, which break
                    up and drive off the ice, many of the harbours are unobstructed the winter
                    through. The summers are short, giving something less than five months between
                    frosts, even in the southern portion, but the heat sometimes rises for a few
                    days to 100° Fahr. The average summer heat is 62 <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi>
                    5 Fahr. The lakes and forests of Maine attract great numbers of summer tourists,
                    and the sea-coast is fast becoming lined with the cottages of summer residents
                    from all parts of the country.</p>
                <p>The soil is well-drained, and the surface swept by sea breezes and winds from the
                    forests and mountains of the north-west, which tend to banish malarious disease.
                    The principal form of disease is phthisis or disease of' the respiratory organs,
                    the ratio of deaths therefrom being a little over 27 per cent, of the entire
                    mortality. This has been called the “scourge of New England”; but in Old England
                    the death-rate from this class of diseases is only a fraction less—26 ∙6 per
                    cent.</p>
                <p>The old United States district court for Maine, constituted in 1779, remains; and
                    Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island constitute the first
                    district of the United States circuit court. The officers of these courts are a
                    judge, district attorney, marshal, clerk, and reporter; Maine is also a district
                    for the collection of United States internal revenue. There are seven United
                    States forts in Maine, only one of which, Fort Preble, Portland, is fully
                    garrisoned; and the United States navy yard, often called Portsmouth navy yard,
                    is in Kittery, Maine.</p>
                <p>Maine has two senators and four representatives in Congress, and six votes in the
                    electoral college for choosing the president. The government of Maine rests on a
                    constitution adopted in 1820, which closely resembles that of the other New
                    England States. It is most liberal in respect to suffrage, every male citizen
                    twenty-one years of age and upwards resident in the State for three months,
                    except paupers, persons under guardianship, and Indians not taxed, being allowed
                    to vote. The governor and legislature are chosen every two years, and the
                    legislative sessions are also biennial. A council chosen by the legislature on
                    joint ballot advises and assists the governor in the appointment of State
                    officers, management of State institutions and lands, granting pardons, and
                    other duties with which they may be charged by the legislature. The judiciary
                    consists of a supreme court of eight members at a salary of $3000, with a
                    reporter of decisions, appointed by the governor and council for seven years;
                    the superior courts for Cumberland and Kennebec counties, whose judges are
                    appointed in the same way; as also trial justices for the several counties with
                    jurisdiction in minor cases; justices of the peace for the county, who are
                    authorized to solemnize marriage, with other prescribed duties; and municipal
                    and police judges. Each county elects judges of probate and insolvency, and
                    registers of the same, a county attorney, clerk of court, sheriff, and county
                    commissioners.</p>
                <p>The enrolled militia numbers 97,320. The present system keeps up an élite corps
                    consisting of two regiments of volunteer infantry and one battery of light
                    artillery, with two regiments of reserve infantry. Much pains is taken in the
                    discipline and character of this small corps, and membership in it is regarded
                    as honourable. The entire State militia is by existing orders constituted into
                    one division under the command of a major-general, who is elected by concurrent
                    ballot of the two houses of the legislature.</p>
                <p>Various reformatory, sanitary, and benevolent institutions are supported wholly
                    or in part by the State. The State prison, with an average of one hundred and
                    forty-six convicts, is managed on the “hard labour” and the “silent” system, at
                    an annual expense of $30,000, which in some years is cancelled by the proceeds
                    of the convicts’ labour, chiefly employed in carriage and harness making.</p>
                <p>The hospital for the insane is an extensive establishment, with upwards of four
                    hundred inmates and an increasing demand for more accommodation. The annual
                    appropriation for State beneficiaries here is $40,000. An annual appropriation
                    ($14,000) is made for the education of the deaf and dumb and the blind, and also
                    ($1200) for the care of idiotic and feeble-minded persons in institutions out of
                    the State.</p>
                <p>The remnants of two tribes of Indians still exist in Maine, with which the State
                    is in public relations, the Penobscots, numbering about six hundred, and the
                    Passamaquoddies, numbering five hundred. The former have their chief gathering
                    place on the islands in the Penobscot river, and the latter on the shores of
                    Passamaquoddy Bay and the St Croix river. Though classed usually as civilized,
                    they are still virtually in tribal relations. Their status is determined by a
                    series of treaties from early times, which are a curious mixture of notions of
                    international rights and of wardship.</p>
                <p>The public policy which has culminated in the well-known prohibitory ‘ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Maine Law” began with the ‘ ‘ Act to restrict the
                    sale of intoxicating liquors,” passed in August 1846. This was followed in 1851
                    by an “Act for the suppression of drinking houses and tippling shops,” and by
                    thirty-nine other statutes directed against liquor selling, drunkenness, and the
                    habit of drinking in the community. The manufacture for sale of any intoxicating
                    liquors, except cider, is forbidden. The sale of such liquor by the manufacturer
                    is punished by imprisonment for two months and a fine of $100. Unadulterated
                    cider in quantities of 5 gallons and upwards may lawfully be sold. No person is
                    allowed to sell any intoxicating liquors, including wine, ale, porter, strong
                    beer, lager beer, and all other malt liquors, also cider for tippling purposes,
                    on a penalty for a first offence of $30 and costs, or imprisonment for thirty
                    days; for a second offence $20 and costs and imprisonment for thirty days; third
                    offence $20 and costs and imprisonment for ninety days. A common seller on
                    conviction is punished for a first offence by fine of $100 and costs, or
                    imprisonment for three months; for a second and subsequent offences $200 and
                    costs, and four months’ imprisonment. A person convicted of keeping a drinking
                    house or tippling shop is punished by fine of $100 and costs, or imprisonment
                    for three months, for a first offence, and the same with six months’ additional
                    imprisonment for every subsequent conviction. Any one injured in person,
                    property, means of support, or otherwise by an intoxicated person may bring an
                    action for damages against the person who sold the liquor; and the owner or
                    lessee of the building where it was sold is jointly liable if cognizant of such
                    use. Any person convicted of being intoxicated in the streets or in any house,
                    or of disturbing the public peace or that of his own or any family, is punished
                    by a fine of $10, or thirty days’ imprisonment, and for the second offence $20
                    or ninety days. All intoxicating liquors kept for sale and the vessels
                    containing them are contraband, and forfeited to the towns where seized, and are
                    there to be destroyed To provide for the necessary sale of such liquors a State
                    commissioner is appointed by the governor and council to furnish to the
                    municipal officers of towns pure, unadulterated intoxicating liquors to be sold
                    for medicinal, mechanical, and manufacturing purposes. He is put under $10,000
                    bond, and is allowed 7 per cent, commission on his sales. Municipal officers may
                    purchase what they deem necessary of such liquors, and appoint an agent to sell
                    them for such purposes as have been named, and no other. This agent is forbidden
                    to sell to any minor, soldier, Indian, or intoxicated person, or to any person
                    of whose intemperate habits he has been notified by such person’s relations or
                    by the municipal officers. It is made the special duty of sheriffs and county
                    attorneys to enforce the provisions of the laws relating to the sale of
                    intoxicating liquors.</p>
                <p>The history of this legislation is that of laws generally which are enacted
                    rather from the high moral ends which they propose than from the sincere and
                    settled judgment of the legislators, and which do not represent the average
                    moral sentiment actually prevailing among the people in whose name they are
                    enacted and are to be enforced. It was inevitable that towards an issue like
                    this political parties should take an attitude not always sincere. The Maine law
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n319/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0319-0300"/> has not entirely suppressed drunkenness, or even
                    liquor selling, but it has had a decided influence in that direction. It has
                    also tended to make drinking disgraceful, and has removed much temptation from
                    young mem The people would be reluctant to abolish it until they could see
                    something better to put in its place.</p>
                <p>The population of Maine has not increased at an equal ratio with the other States
                    of the Union, as will be observed from the subjoined table. There is a constant
                    emigration from the State of native-born people to other parts of the country,
                    which is only about half made up for by immigration from the adjoining provinces
                    and the Old World.</p>

                <p>In 1880 the number of native-born was 590,053, and of foreign-born 58,883.</p>
                <p>The following cities had in 1880 a population of 5000 and upwards :—Portland,
                    Lewiston, Bangor, Biddeford, Auburn, Augusta, Bath, Rockland, Saco, Calais,
                    Brunswick, Belfast, Ellsworth.</p>
                <p>Divorces in Maine reach the highest ratio to the marriages, or to the population,
                    of any State of which statistics are reported. The privilege of a jury trial
                    favours the plaintiffs, and it is not easy to find a jury who will withhold a
                    verdict for divorce.</p>
                <p>The birth-rate of the native or oldest and typical families of Maine has greatly
                    fallen off, and the number of children of school age is diminishing, not only
                    proportionately to the population but in positive numbers, the diminution for
                    the last eleven years being 14,200.</p>
                <p>The latest reports as to the religious societies of Maine show that there are 242
                    Congregationalist churches, with a membership of 21,340; 261 Baptist churches,
                    membership 20,954; Methodist 228, membership 20,774; Freewill Baptist 286, and
                    membership 15,822; Christian 60, membership 6000; Universalist 41, membership
                    4500; Unitarian 21, membership (estimated) 2500; Episcopal 32, membership 2115;
                    New Jerusalem 5, membership 341; others 9500;—total Protestant membership
                    103,846. There are 42 Roman Catholic churches, with a membership of 40,000. The
                    tendency seems to be to a decrease of the Congregationalists, and a
                    corresponding increase of the Free Baptists and Methodists.</p>
                <p>Common school education in the State is widespread. In the number of citizens
                    able to read and write it stands in the very front rank of States. Instruction
                    in the public schools is not under ecclesiastical control, and is free to all
                    between the ages of four and twenty-one, and compulsory upon all between the
                    ages of nine and fifteen years for twelve weeks each year. Every city and town
                    is required to raise and expend annually for schools not less than 80 cents for
                    each inhabitant. The State meets this on its part "by distributing, in
                    proportion to the number of children of school age in each town, the income of a
                    permanent school fund ($44,275,791), and by a State tax of 1 mill per dollar of
                    valuation on the property in the State, and a tax of one per cent, on the
                    average annual deposits in savings banks. The average cost of supporting the
                    public schools is $1,240,000 a year. In the larger towns the schools are graded
                    into primary, intermediate, and grammar schools. A system of free high’ schools
                    was established in 1878, for which the State contributes a sum equal to that
                    paid by the town, not exceeding $250. The whole sum appropriated in 1881 was
                    $26,000. There are three normal schools, intended for the training of teachers
                    in the common schools. For these tuition is free, and the annual appropriation
                    required is $19,000. The State college of agriculture and mechanic arts may in
                    some respects be considered the culmination of the public school system. A large
                    farm and various workshops are here provided, and every facility afforded at the
                    least possible expense for a good education, chiefly directed to the industrial
                    arts, but still liberal in scope. There are three colleges, with the usual
                    course of study leading to the degrees of bachelor and master of arts :—Bowdoin,
                    founded by the old State of Massachusetts in 1794, and since liberally endowed
                    by private benefactions, from which Hawthorne and Longfellow graduated; Colby
                    University, founded as Waterville College in 1820, and under the control of the
                    Baptist denomination; and Bates College, founded in 1863, in the interest of the
                    Free Baptist denomination, with a fitting school and a theological seminary
                    attached. The theological seminary at Bangor, under the care of the
                    Congregationalists, is open to all denominations, and attracts many students
                    from the adjacent provinces of Canada. The medical department of Bowdoin College
                    is known as the medical school of Maine. It has an annual attendance of more
                    than 100. and has graduated 1300. There are various societies which are of a
                    nature to" afford instruction. The Maine Historical Society is making
                    interesting investigations, and preserving memorials and records of historical
                    matters, and its publications are of much value.</p>
                <p>The bonded debt of the State is $5,801,900, which matures on: or before 1889.
                    Deducting the sinking fund of $1,436,367, the. actual balance of indebtedness is
                    now (1882) $4,365,533. The local and municipal debt for all purposes, including
                    aid to railroads, is $17,722,109.</p>
                <p>The total settled area of Maine is 17,900 square miles, of which 6000 have a
                    population of 2 to 6 to the square mile, 3500 have 6 to 18, 5600 have 18 to 45,
                    and 2800 have 43 to 90. Agriculture is still the most extensive occupation,
                    engaging 83,000 of the people. There are 64,310 farms, with 1,864,136 acres of
                    tillage. Of these 61,530 farms are occupied by their owners; 24,640 contain over
                    100 acres each, and nearly as many have between 50 and 100 acres. The chief farm
                    products are annually:—potatoes, 8,000,000 bushels; hay, 1,200,000 tons; butter,
                    14,103.960 lb; cheese, 1,167,770 1b; oats, 2,265,575 bushels; maize, 960,633
                    bushels; wheat, 665,714 bushels; buckwheat, 382,701 bushels; barley, 242,185
                    bushels; rye, 26,398 bushels; wool, 2,776,404 lb; milk sold, 3,720,783
                    gallons.</p>
                <p>The remaining unsettled area is mostly unbroken forest. At i&gt;resent this
                    region only furnishes material for lumbering. The pine ιas been cut back to the
                    headwaters of the rivers, and the chief material is spruce and hemlock, with
                    some cedar. The principal shipping port is Bangor on the Penobscot, where the
                    amount surveyed has been 200,000,000 feet a year.</p>
                <p>In fisheries the State stands second in the Union. There are 12,662 persons
                    directly employed in fisheries, but it is estimated that 48,000 people are
                    dependent chiefly on this business. The sea fish taken are cod, hake, haddock,
                    pollack, herring, mackerel, and holibut. The amount taken is 206,778,693 lb
                    annually. There are establishments for preparing oil from the menhaden, &amp;c.,
                    where 168,732 gallons a year are produced. The canning of fish is a considerable
                    industry; and in the lobster canning business this State has a monopoly. The
                    catch in 1879 was for Maine 14,234,182 lb, and that bought of British fishermen
                    10,588,578 lb. In the home establishments 1,830,200 cans were put up, and in
                    those worked in the British Provinces on account of Maine owners 2,198,024 cans.
                    A recent but rapidly growing interest is that of sardine canning, chiefly
                    carried on at Eastport. In 1880 there were 1328 persons employed in this
                    industry, with an annual product of 7,550,868 cans and 8365 barrels. The river
                    fish chiefly taken are salmon, shad, alewives, and smelts. Much interest is
                    taken in restocking the lower rivers, especially with salmon, shad, and bass.
                    The Penobscot is the only river on the Atlantic coast ot the United States from
                    which a supply of sea salmon eggs can be obtained for propagation. An
                    association of the United States with the States of Maine, New Hampshire,
                    Massachusetts, and Connecticut appoints agents for procuring these eggs, which
                    are distributed in proportion to the respective contribution of funds. The great
                    hatchery is at Orland, where also there is one for the eggs of the land-locked
                    salmon; there is another at Grand Lake Stream, owned by the same association.
                    The black bass and alewives have also been distributed in the lower ponds and
                    streams.</p>
                <p>The other native products are lime, quarried stone,—both for building and for
                    monumental purposes—slate, iron, and copper. Ice is cut and shipped to various
                    parts of the world, to the amount annually of 350,000 tons, and the value, when
                    ready for transportation, of $600,000. Maine was long distinguished for her
                    shipbuilding; and, though of late years this industry has greatly fallen off,
                    yet in the building of wooden ships the State probably holds her old rank. The
                    shipping owned in Maine is mostly engaged in foreign commerce, or in coasting to
                    and from distant States. There are 12,000 sailors in this service. There are
                    1022 miles of railroad in Maine. Of manufactories there are 24 cotton-mills,
                    running 696,564 spindles, and employing 11,844 persons, of whom 7010 are women;
                    and 97 woollen-mills of all kinds, employing 3265 persons, of whom 1160 are
                    women. The other chief industries are flouring mills, leather tanneries, boot
                    and shoe making, paper making, and iron working of various kinds.</p>
                <p>The shores of what is now sometimes called the Gulf of Maine, whose waters
                    stretch between Cape Sable and Cape Cod, attracted much attention from the early
                    voyagers and explorers, as many glowing accounts remain to testify. The Cabots,
                    under English auspices, visited this region in 1497; Verrazano, representing the
                    French, in 1524; Gomez in the name of Spain in 1525, giving his name to
                    Penobscot river and bay. In 1526 the Frenchman Thevet followed; he states that
                    before that time the French had a fort 30 miles up the river, named Norumbega.
                    The enterprise of Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Humphrey Gilbert first reveals a
                    purpose on the part of Englishmen to colonize these shores. Gosnold (1602),
                    Pring (1603), and Weymouth (1605) had made some explorations, but a century had
                    passed and no European power had gained a foothold on the Atlantic coast north
                    of Florida. But in 1603 Henry IV. of France granted a charter to De Monts, a
                    Protestant gentleman<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n320/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0320-0301"/> of his household, of all North America between
                    40° and 46° N. lat. In 1604 De Monts established a settlement on what is now
                    Neutral Island, in the St Croix river. In 1605 James I. of England granted to
                    some English gentlemen all the territory between 34° and 45° N. lat. The portion
                    between 40° and 45° was thus the subject of a double grant, to parties naturally
                    antagonistic. The latter parallel, striking nearly at the mouth of the St Croix,
                    includes almost all the southern half of Maine, and brought what was practically
                    at that time the whole of Maine to be the theatre of the disputed jurisdiction.
                    The French did not indeed claim further west than the Kennebec river, the limit
                    of their actual occupation; but the English endeavoured by sporadic and violent
                    sallies to hold, if not by occupation at least by desolation, to the St Croix
                    river, the extreme north-east boundary of their claim. The Indians, already
                    exasperated by the wrongs received from roving English shipmasters and traders,
                    were easily persuaded to make alliance with the French, and this double frontier
                    was a scene of strife for the space of one hundred years. The English with much
                    earnestness of purpose proceeded to plant a colony in 1607, under the guidance
                    of George Popham, brother of the chief-justice of England, and Captain Gilbert
                    Raleigh, whose name indicates his lineage and spirit. This colony they planted
                    with solemn ceremonies on a point at the mouth of the Kennebec. The little town
                    rose rapidly, with its fort and its church in due order. They also built a
                    vessel, the “Virginia of Sagadahock,” the first vessel built by Europeans in
                    America. The colony grew discouraged by their winter experiences, and the next
                    year broke up, most of the colonists returning to England. It appears, however,
                    that they did not utterly forsake their object, for scattered settlements still
                    remained and increased about the Point and Bay of Pemaquid and the island of
                    Monhegan, midway between the Kennebec and Penobscot. This region became a centre
                    of trade and a base of operations, being the headquarters of the famous Captain
                    John Smith, where he built a fleet of boats in 1614, and explored the adjacent
                    coast, which he named New England. In 1620 a new impulse found expression in the
                    great charter of New England, given to Sir Ferdinand© Gorges and others, who
                    proceeded to lay out their plans on a large scale. Two years afterwards a patent
                    under this charter conveyed to Gorges and Captain John Mason the country between
                    the Merrimac and Kennebec and 60 miles inland, which they proposed to call the
                    province of Maine. In 1629 they divided their possession, Gorges taking the
                    portion between the Piscataqua and the Kennebec.</p>
                <p>The great council of New England surrendered their charter in 1635, and in the
                    division of its territory Gorges retained his portion previously granted, while
                    the region between the Kennebec and the St Croix and the St Lawrence rivers,
                    though still claimed by the French as part of Acadia, was given to Sir William
                    Alexander, earl of Stirling, and this was to be called the county of Canada.
                    Gorges named his tract the county of New Somersetshire, and immediately
                    commenced the administration of government, setting up a court at Saco (1636)
                    under direction of his kinsman, William Gorges. In 1639 he obtained from Charles
                    I. a new and extraordinary charter, confirming to him his province of Maine
                    under that name, and under the feudal tenure of a county palatine, Gorges, as
                    lord palatine, being invested with vice-regal powers. In 1641 he established a
                    capital and court at Georgiana (now York), the first chartered city in America.
                    But it was no easy task to administer government or hold a jurisdiction in his
                    palatinate. The great council of New England, before breaking up, had granted
                    not less than nine patents, conveying territory already included in Gorges’s
                    thrice-granted jurisdiction, to various parties, who had made vigorous
                    beginnings to improve their holdings and confirm their claims. In like manner
                    the council had made two important grants within the jurisdiction of Sir William
                    Alexander, so that difficulties arose in that quarter also. In this confusion of
                    jurisdiction Massachusetts, under a new construction of the extent of her
                    chartered rights, laid claim to a line which included nearly all the settled
                    portion of Gorges’s territory, and by a farther extension she claimed the coast
                    as far east as Penobscot Bay. This latter she named the county of Devonshire,
                    and set up a court at Pemaquid (1674). This latter territory had been conveyed
                    by the earl of Stirling to the duke of York, afterwards James II. of England.
                    This was organized by James as the county of Cornwall, and was afterwards
                    represented in the general assembly in New York (1683). In 1677, however, the
                    claim of Massachusetts in Maine being contested and decided adversely to her,
                    she took the occasion to buy of the heirs of Sir Ferdinand Gorges all his right,
                    title, and interest in Maine for £1250. Matters were still more complicated by
                    the persistent efforts of the Dutch to gain possession of the east coast, who
                    had now (1676) effected a lodgment on the shores of Penobscot Bay; but they were
                    finally driven off. The troubled state of things in England prevented
                    Massachusetts from profiting very much by her purchase in Maine, and at last the
                    new charter of William and Mary (1691) merged all the provinces of Plymouth,
                    Massachusetts, Maine, Sagadahock, and Acadia under one title and jurisdiction,
                    “the province of Massachusetts Bay.”</p>
                <p>That part of Acadia east of the St Croix was five years afterwards ceded back to
                    the Crown. Thus Maine, with the St Croix for its eastern boundary, became an
                    integral part of the Province, afterwards the State, of Massachusetts Bay. From
                    that time for over one hundred years the history of Maine is merged in that of
                    Massachusetts. Although its people were not of the religious or political faith
                    of the Puritan colony, and for that reason had been shut out of the famous New
                    England confederacy of 1643, yet they were true Englishmen, and stood manfully
                    for the common cause. Not only was Maine an exposed frontier and battleground,
                    during the long struggle of the English against the Indians and the French, but
                    its citizens bore a conspicuous part in the expeditions beyond its borders. Two
                    of these were commanded and largely manned by men of Maine. Port Royal was taken
                    by Sir William Phipps and Louisburg by Sir William Pepperell. In fact these
                    expeditions were such a drain on Maine population that Massachusetts was called
                    upon to send men to garrison the little forts that protected the homes left
                    defenceless by the men who had gone to the front. The great losses and
                    destruction of these wars kept this portion of the province back from its
                    natural increase.</p>
                <p>In the stand made for the rights of Englishmen, which led to revolution and
                    independence, Maine was behind none. Two years before the battles of Lexington
                    and Concord its towns had offered themselves “as a sacrifice if need be to the
                    glorious cause of liberty.” Some, it is true, were deep-rooted in sympathy with
                    the mother country, and these retired eastward, first beyond the Penobscot and
                    afterwards beyond the St Croix. This war made Maine again an outpost and
                    frontier. That same picturesque and commanding promontory of Castine in
                    Penobscot Bay, which had been once the most eastern post held by the Pilgrims of
                    Plymouth and afterwards the western advanced post of the French in Acadia, was
                    now the stronghold of the English in this region, as against the Americans.
                    Early in the war (1775) the chief town, Falmouth (now Portland), was bombarded
                    and nearly destroyed. Some patriots the same year attacked a king’s ship off
                    Machias, and after a desperate struggle the British flag was struck to Americans
                    for the first time on sea or land. Maine was fully and honourably represented in
                    the war by a division of the Massachusetts line. It had also representatives in
                    Congress, and some eminent officers and patriots of the Revolution resided
                    within its borders. In fact, to all intents and purposes except in name, Maine
                    was one of the original States of the Union.</p>
                <p>At the close of the war, the old spirit of independent personality and
                    self-government made a forcible expression. The people sought to be separated
                    from Massachusetts, and to make their laws and their history in their own name.
                    There were two parties, however, and the troubles which agitated the whole
                    country at that time, postponed action on this issue, and Maine continued almost
                    forty years longer an integral part of Massachusetts, but was at no time a
                    dependent province of that State. At the conclusion of peace there was a large
                    immigration into Maine, chiefly of soldiers of the Revolution, who strengthened
                    the already vigorous character of the people. Everything prospered until the
                    Embargo Act of 1808, cutting off commerce and the coast trade, struck Maine in a
                    vital point. Its shipping at this time amounted to 150,000 tons, its exports to
                    a million dollars a year. The war with England, which soon followed, almost
                    destroyed these interests. Other industries, however, were stimulated.
                    Manufactories of woollen, cotton, glass, of iron and other metals were set on
                    foot, only to be ruined by the influx of British goods, which followed the new
                    peace. It was a discouraging time, and one or two unusually severe winters
                    threatened the only industries which the war and peace had spared, while in
                    1815-16 not less than 15,000 people emigrated to Ohio. In 1820 Maine was
                    recognized as a separate State of the Union. Its population was then about
                    300,000, and its chief industries, agriculture, lumbering, and shipbuilding,
                    were in prosperous course. Its encouragement of manufactures was slow. A
                    prejudice against great corporations long kept Maine from entering largely at
                    the auspicious time into those industrial enterprises which have built up
                    neighbouring States. It is only within recent years that the State has begun to
                    take proper advantage of its unsurpassed facilities for manufacturing. The
                    difficulties about the northeastern boundary had increased with each year since
                    the treaty in 1783. Great Britain had gradually obtained possession of
                    considerable territory within the line claimed by the States under the treaty,
                    and after the war of 1812 laid claim to territory which had long been under the
                    actual jurisdiction of Massachusetts. The question assumed national and
                    international importance. The Government of the United States, apparently
                    desirous of gratifying Great Britain, offered Maine 1,200,000 acres of land in
                    Michigan to yield its claim, but the proposition only roused indignant protest
                    in the State, which culminated in the sending of a military force to defend its
                    territory. Finally, however, considerations of national policy urged at
                    Washington induced Maine to acquiesce in a treaty, which took away a large
                    &lt;,rea additional to that already silently yielded, amounting in all to 5500
                    square miles,—an area greater by 600 square miles than the State of Connecticut,
                    and by <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n321/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0321-0302"/> 1680 square miles than the States of Rhode Island
                    and Delaware combined.</p>
                <p>In the war against secession the service of the State was prompt and efficient.
                    Maine sent to the front 72,000 men, of whom not less than 20,000 gave their
                    lives for the cause. These volunteers were distributed in thirty-two regiments
                    of infantry, two regiments of cavalry, one regiment of artillery, one battalion
                    of sharpshooters, and 6764 enlistments in the navy. The whole amount of State
                    and municipal debt incurred in raising and equipping these troops was about
                    $12,000,000. The United States afterwards reimbursed the State to the amount of
                    $668,284, most of which was applied to form a sinking fund for extinguishing the
                    war debt at maturity. The State also provided pensions for its disabled soldiers
                    and their families. (J. I.. C.)</p>
