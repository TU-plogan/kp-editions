                    the third largest city of France, and the chief commercial port of the
                    Mediterranean, in 43° 17' N. lat. and 5° 22' E. long., is the chief town of the
                    department of Bouches du Rhone, headquarters of the 15th army corps, the seat of
                    a bishop, and of numerous commercial and scientific institutions. The population
                    (1881) is 360,099.</p>
                <p>The old harbour of Marseilles opens on the west to the Gulf of Lyons; and the
                    famous Rue de la Cannebière, leading east-north-east from the inner end of the
                    harbour, and continued by the Rue de Noailles, the Allees de Meilhan, and the
                    Boulevard de Longchamps, to the Palais des Arts, forms the first main artery of
                    the town. A second great artery, at right angles to the first, connects the Aix
                    gate and its triumphal arch with the grand Promenade du Prado, by the Cours
                    Belsunce and the Rue de Rome. North of the old harbour, between the Aix gate and
                    the sea, lies the old town of Marseilles. The finest streets, the Rue St
                    Ferréol, the Rue Paradis, and the Rue de Breteuil, are to the south of the Rue
                    Cannebière, running parallel with the Rue de Rome, between it and the foot of
                    the hill upon which is Notre Dame delà Garde. From La Cannebière to La Joliette,
                    the centre of the new docks, runs the broad Rue de la République, lined with
                    fine buildings, and opening a line through the oldest part of the town. The
                    entrance to the old harbour is defended by Fort St Jean on the north and Fort St
                    Nicolas on the south. Behind the latter is the Anse (Creek) de la Réserve.
                    Beyond this again, situated in succession along the shore, come the old imperial
                    palace, the Anse du Pharo, the military exercising ground, and the Anse des
                    Catalans. The new parts of the town extend in this direction to the 'Vallon
                    d’Endoume behind Fort St Nicolas. To the old harbour, which covered only 70
                    acres, the basin of La <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n599/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0599-0572"/> Joliette (55 acres) was added in 1853.
                    Communicating with the old harbour by a channel which passes behind Fort St
                    Jean, this dock opens on the south into the outer harbour, opposite the palace
                    and the Anse du Pharo; it is separated from the roadstead on the west by a
                    simple jetty. A series of similar basins have since been added along the shore
                    to the north, viz., the Lazaret or “Bassin des Docks” (37 acres), that of Arene
                    (59 acres), the “Bassin National,” twice as large as the preceding, and the
                    graving dock of 2Ö acres; a fine revolving bridge, worked by· steam, separates
                    the graving dock from the rest. Farther out, the Chateau d’lf and the islets of
                    Pomègue and Ratonneau, where vessels formerly did quarantine, have 45 acres of
                    harbour accommodation. The port of Marseilles has in all an area of 422 acres,
                    but there are only 41 miles of quays, an amount of accommodation quite
                    inadequate for the enormous traffic, now amounting to more than 3,400,000 tons.
                    Protected on the east by Cape Croisette, and on the west by Cape Couronne, the
                    roadstead of Marseilles and its approaches are lighted by six lighthouses, of
                    which the most distant (130 feet high) is 8 miles south-west of the town, on the
                    Planier rock. The docks along the Lazaret basin cover an area of 45 acres, and
                    the company to which they belong also holds a large area of ground for their
                    enlargement, and has exclusive rights over 1 j to 2 miles of quays. The
                    warehouses occupy 27 acres of floor space on their several stories, and the
                    200,000 tons of goods for which they afford storage are easily manipulated by
                    powerful hydraulic machinery wrought by steam. From the harbour station at the
                    docks the railway is carried up to the principal station, “Gare St Charles,”
                    which commands the town. The Toulon line goes round the zoological gardens, and
                    the whole upper part of Marseilles, and sends a branch to the Prado station.
                    There is a fourth station to the south of the old harbour near the custom-house,
                    and at the foot of the steps of St Victor; it is proposed to join it by a tunnel
                    to the Marseille-Prado station. The large steam vessels for trading with
                    Algiers, the Levant, and the further East lie in La Joliette, but the old
                    harbour still displays the ancient characteristics of Marseilles. The
                    old-fashioned Mediterranean traders with their lateen sails are crowded together
                    in the Rive Neuve Canal to the south, while the sailing vessels of heavy tonnage
                    are moored to the quay by their sterns. At the end of the old harbour opens out
                    La Cannebière, so called from former rope-walks, of which it occupies the site;
                    it is now the liveliest part of the town, where the principal cafés, shops,
                    hotels, naval and commercial agencies, as well as the Bourse, are found.</p>
                <p>Despite its antiquity, Marseilles has no ancient monuments. The old cathedral,
                    which superseded a ’ temple of Diana, itself preceded, it is said, by an altar
                    of Baal, has given place to a modern structure, of which the exterior only is
                    completely finished. It is a Byzantine basilica, in the form of a Latin cross,
                    460 feet long, built in grey Florentine stone blended with white stone from the
                    neighbourhood of Arles. Near the cathedral stands the bishop’s palace. The
                    cathedral is situated at the entrance of the harbours, but a more distant church
                    has superior attractions for the sailors,—the celebrated Notre Dame de la Garde,
                    the steeple of which, surmounted by a gilded statue of the Virgin, 30 feet in
                    height, rises 150 feet above the summit of the hill on which it stands,
                    commanding a view of the whole port and town, as well as of the surrounding
                    mountains and the neighbouring sea. The present chapel of Notre Dame de la Garde
                    occupies the site of one built in 1214. Like the new cathedral it is in the
                    Byzantine style, and constructed of the richest materials.</p>
                <p>Descending from Notre Dame by steps, with shops ori both sides containing objects
                    of devotion, such as medals and chaplets, and passing the Promenade Pierre
                    Puget, which affords another fine view of the sea, we reach the church of St
                    Victor, close by Fort St Nicolas. Originally an abbey founded about 410 by St
                    Cassian, it was afterwards destroyed by the Saracens, but rebuilt in the 11th
                    century; destroyed a second time, it was finally restored by Pope Urban V., a
                    former abbot, who surrounded it in 1350with high square crenellated towers.
                    Tradition relates that St Lazarus inhabited the catacombs under St Victor; and
                    the black Virgin, still preserved there, is popularly attributed to St Luke. The
                    spire of the ancient church des Accoules marks the centre of Old Marseilles. At
                    its foot are a “Calvary” and a curious chapel of modern construction in rock
                    work. Notre Dame du Mont Carmel, also in the old town, occupies the place of
                    what was the citadel of the Massaliots when they were besieged by Julius Caesar.
                    The new Hôtel de la Préfecture, at the end of the Rue St Ferréol, the Palais de
                    Justice, and the Bourse, are all buildings of the last twenty years. The first
                    is a palatial edifice 300 feet long and 260 wide, adorned with statues and bas
                    reliefs; it has a fine staircase and large reception rooms, decorated with
                    paintings. Before the Palais de Justice stands a statue of Berryer. The pediment
                    and peristyle are decorated with bas reliefs by Guillaume. The outer hall is
                    surrounded by beautiful pillars of red marble. The Bourse has in the vestibule a
                    bas relief representing Marseilles receiving the productions of ’all parts of
                    the world, and allegorical statues of Marseilles and France. The hall is larger
                    than even that of the Bourse at Paris. The hall of the Chamber of Commerce, at
                    whose cost the whole edifice was built, is remarkable for the magnificence of
                    its mural paintings and gildings. The Hôtel de Ville, an old and unimportant
                    building, stands on the quay to the north of the old harbour. The Palais des
                    Arts de Longchamps^ completed in 1870, is a work of consummate taste; it is
                    built at the terminus of the Canal de Marseille, that great work which has
                    metamorphosed the town and its surroundings by bringing into it the waters of
                    the Durance. This canal, which leaves the river opposite Pertuis, has a length
                    of 94 miles, of which more than 15 are underground. It crosses the valley of the
                    Arc, between Aix and Rognac <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> by the magnificent
                    aqueduct of Roquefavour, comparable with the noblest works of ancient or modern
                    times. The canal then purifies its waters, charged with ooze, in the basins of
                    Réaltort, sets in motion seventy-two mills, which it supplies with upwards of
                    1200 horse-power, carrying about 200 cubic feet of water per second to the
                    district of Marseilles. Right and left of the Château d’Eau, which occupies the
                    centre of the Palais de Longchamps, and is 128 feet in height, are the picture
                    gallery, a fine collection of ancient and modern works, and the natural· history
                    museum, remarkable for its conchological department and the interesting
                    collection of ammonites. Behind are extensive zoological gardens, with the
                    astronomical observatory, one of the most important in France. The museum of
                    antiquities is established in the Palais Borély, in a fine park, recently
                    purchased by the town, at the end of the Prado, and approached by the two finest
                    promenades of the city. It includes a Phoenician collection (containing the
                    remains that support the hypothesis of the Phoenician origin of Marseilles), an
                    Egyptian collection, numerous Greek, Latin, and Christian inscriptions in stone,
                    &amp;c. A building within the city, recently finished, 177 feet by 64, with an
                    imposing façade, contains the school of art and a valuable library. The
                    triumphal arch of Aix, originally dedicated to the victors of the Trocadero, was
                    in 1830 appropriated t∏ the conquests of the empire.</p>
                <p>Marseilles contains large hospitals. The Hôtel Dieu in the old town was founded
                    in 1188, and rebuilt in 1593; it has 450 beds. The Hospice de la Charité, in the
                    same neighbourhood, accommo-liâtes<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n600/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0600-0573"/> 600 patients, while at the opposite extremity of
                    the town, near the Prado station, are the modern Hôpital de la Conception (with
                    S00 beds), the military hospital, and the lunatic asylum.</p>
                <p>The scientific institutions of the town are also numerous, including a faculty of
                    science, an astronomical observatory, a preparatory school of medicine and
                    pharmacy, a musical conservatoire, a school of ait, a lyceuιn, and many private
                    institutions. The principal learned societies are the academy of science,
                    letters, and art, the medical association, and the geographical, statistical,
                    agricultural, and horticultural societies.</p>
                <p>The mean temperature of Marseilles is 58° Fahr.; frost is rare, and snow almost
                    unknown. The heat of summer is tempered during the day by the cooling sea
                    breeze. The most disagreeable wind is the mistral, a violent and cold north-west
                    wind, which blows on an average one hundred and thirty-eight times a year, but
                    has at least the advantage of restoring salubrity to the frequently unhealthy
                    shores of the Mediterranean. The sirocco, a south-east wind, blows some sixty
                    times a year; though hot and parching in summer, it softens the winter climate.
                    The cast-south-east wind is cold and damp, and brings rain. The Canal de la
                    Durance lias greatly modified the climate of Marseilles and its neighbourhood,
                    for by restoring vegetation it has increased the fogs and rains; there is now an
                    annual rainfall of nearly 24 inches.</p>
                <p>Marseilles is at once the largest commercial port of France and a manufacturing
                    town, working up the raw materials brought in by sea from every part of the
                    world. The leading industry is that of soap-making, which occupies sixty
                    factories with 1200 artisans, and annually produces 65,000 tons, valued at
                    £2,000,000 sterling. With this manufacture are connected oil and chemical works;
                    in the former, which employ 2000 to 2500 workmen, 55,000 tons of different oils
                    are produced yearly. The chemical works comprise a dozen mills, manufacturing
                    chiefly the salts of soda and concentrated acids. Two thousand operatives are
                    there employed, and the value of their annual production is estimated at
                    £320,000. There are also three sugar-refineries, producing 65,000 tons of
                    loaf-sugar^ of which more than half is re-exported. Sulphur from Sicily too is
                    refined and converted into sticks or flowers of sulphur, to the value of
                    £80,000. Petroleum refining occupies 100 workmen. Metallurgy is another great
                    industry; a large quantity of ore, imported from Elba, Spain, and Algeria, is
                    smelted in the blast furnaces of St Louis in the suburbs. The Mediterranean
                    iron-works and yards, together with other private companies, have large
                    workshops for the construction or repair of marine steam-engines and every
                    branch of iron shipbuilding, employing several thousand workmen. Marseilles is a
                    great centre for the extraction of silver from lead ore; 16,000 tons of lead and
                    25 tons of fine silver are separated annually. There are 64 flour-mills with 300
                    sets of stones, and 100 factories prepare semolina and other cereal pastes,
                    while 34 tanyards dress 500,000 sheep skins and 335,000 goat skins. To this list
                    of industries must be added the manufactories of matches, candles, and
                    waxlights, with brass foundries, glass-works, and manufactures of coral, and of
                    Oriental hosiery.</p>
                <p>The port of Marseilles is the centre of numerous lines of steamers. The French
                    company of mail steam packets <hi rend="italic">{Messageries</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Maritimes)</hi> despatch their boats regularly to Italy, Egypt,
                    Réunion, India, China, and the far East, as well as to Greece, Turkey, the Black
                    Sea, Smyrna, and Syria. The Transatlantic Company runs its vessels to Algiers,
                    Tunis, Malta, and the coast of Italy, and has also a regular line between
                    Marseilles and New York. Many private companies have services to Corsica,
                    Algiers, the coast of Languedoc and of Spain, and the Italian Riviera. Other
                    lines connect Marseilles with Brazil and La Plata, Havre, and London. Landward
                    there are two lines of railway to Aix, and a third to Toulon. A navigable canal
                    is greatly needed to connect the port directly with the Rhone, in order to avoid
                    the difficulties of egress from the river and to make Marseilles the natural
                    outlet of the rich Rhone basin. The countries with which the greatest traffic is
                    maintained are Algeria, Spain, Italy, Turkey, and· the Russian ports on the
                    Black Sea; next in order come England, Austria, the western coast of Africa,
                    Réunion, the Cape, British India, Brazil, the Antilles, China, and Sencgambia.
                    From the Black Sea, Turkey, and Algeria come the cereals which form the chief
                    imports in point of bulk; from Italy, Spain, the Levant, China, and Japan the
                    silk, which is the import of greatest value (£4,000,000 yearly). Then follow
                    ores and metals, iron, cast iron, lead, and copper; also wood, raw material for
                    oil manufacture, raw sugar, cattle, wool and cotton, rice, and various dry
                    vegetable foods, petroleum, cocoa, gums, pepper, and other spices, wines and
                    brandies, coal, skins, cod-fish, cheese, and sponges. The principal exports in
                    respect of value are silk, woollen, and cotton fabrics, refined sugars, wines
                    and spirits; those of greatest bulk are cereals in the form of grain or flour,
                    coal, building materials, oil-cakes, iron and other manufactures in metal, wines
                    and spirits, oils, glass and crystal, lead, and coffee.</p>
                <p>Of the seagoing tonnage, one-third is under the French flag, but the coasting
                    trade, carried on by French sailors alone, is almost half as large as the ocean
                    trade. The shipowners of the port possess almost seven hundred vessels, without
                    counting the hundreds of fishing boats which ply along the coast.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The Greek colony of Massalia (in Latin, <hi
                    rend="italic">Massilia)</hi> was founded by the enterprising mariners of Phocaea
                    in Asia Minor, about 600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The settlement of the
                    Greeks in waters which the Carthaginians jealously reserved for their own
                    commerce was not effected without a naval conflict; it is, indeed, not
                    improbable that the Phoenicians were settled at Marseilles before the Greek
                    period, and that the very name of the town is the Phoenician ∕∙J0, “settlement.”
                    Whether the judges (□'tθεt√*, “suffetes”) of the Phoenician sacrificial tablet
                    of Marseilles were the rulers of a city older than the advent of the
                    Phoenicians, or were a sort of consuls for Punic residents in the Greek period,
                    is disputed. The fall of the Ionic cities before the Persians probably sent new
                    settlers to the Ligurian coast and cut off the remote city of Massalia from
                    close connexion with the mother country. Isolated amidst alien populations, the
                    Massaliots made their way by great prudence in dealing with the inland tribes,
                    by the vigilant administration of their oligarchical government, and by
                    frugality and temperance united to remarkable commercial and naval enterprise.
                    Their colonies spread east and west along the coast from Monaco to Cape St
                    Martin in Spain, carrying with them the worship of Artemis; the inland trade, in
                    which wine was an important element, can be traced by finds of Massalian coins
                    right across Gaul and through the Alps as far as Tyrol. The Massaliot Pytheas
                    (330-320 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> passed the pillars of Hercules and
                    visited the coasts of Gaul, Britain, and Germany. The great rival of Massalian
                    trade was Carthage, and in the Punic wars the city took the side of Romq, and
                    was rewarded by Roman assistance in the subjugation of the native tribes of the
                    Ligurian mountains. In the war of Caesar and Pompey the aristocratic town took
                    the side of the latter, and made a courageous but vain resistance to Caesar. In
                    memory of its ancient services the city, “without which,” as Cicero says, “Rome
                    had never triumphed over the Transalpine nations,” was still left as a <hi
                    rend="italic">civitas</hi><hi rend="italic">libera,</hi> but her power was
                    broken and most of her dependencies taken from her. From this time Massalia has
                    little place in Roman history; it became for a time an important school of
                    letters and medicine, but its commercial and intellectual importance gradually
                    declined into insignificance. The town appears to have been Christianized before
                    the end of the 3d century, and its reputation partly revived through the names
                    of Gennadius and Cassian, which give it prominence in the history of
                    Semi-Pelagianism and the foundation of Western monachism.</p>
                <p>After the ravages of successive streams of invaders, Marseilles was repeopled in
                    the 10th century under the protection of its viscounts. In 1112 the town bought
                    up their rights, and was formed into a republic, governed by a podestat, who was
                    appointed for life, and exercised his office in conjunction with 3 notables, and
                    a municipal council, composed of 80 citizens, 3 clerics, and 6 principal
                    tradesmen. During the rest of the Middle Ages, however, the higher town was
                    governed by the bishop, and had its harbour at the creek of La Joliette. The
                    southern suburb was governed by the abbot of St Victor, and owned the Port des
                    Catalans. Situated between the two, the lower town, the republic, retained the
                    old harbour, and was the most powerful of the three divisions. The period of the
                    crusades brought great prosperity to Marseilles. The activity of its
                    shipbuilding,, the magnitude of its fleet, the importance of its commerce and
                    manufactures, all increased at once. The count of Provence, Raymond Bérenger,
                    Charles of Anjou, and afterwards Alphonso of Aragon, successively attempted to
                    make themselves masters of the town; it suffered at different times from
                    incendiarism, pillage, and massacre during the 13th and 14th centuries, and in
                    the beginning of the 15th. King René, who had made it his winter residence,
                    however, caused trade, arts, and manufactures again to flourish. Under Francis
                    I., the disaffected constable de Bourbon vainly besieged the town with the
                    imperial forces in 1524. During the wars of religion, Marseilles took an active
                    part against the Protestants, and long refused to acknowledge Henry IV. The loss
                    of the ancient liberties of the town brought on new disturbances under the
                    Fronde, which Louis XIV. came in person to suppress. He took the town by storm,
                    and had Fort St Nicolas constructed. Marseilles repeatedly suffered from the
                    plague, and an epidemic raged from May 1720 to May 1721 with a severity for
                    which it is almost impossible to find a parallel; Bishop Belsunce, Chevalier
                    Rose, and others immortalized themselves by their courage and devotion.</p>
                <p>During the Revolution the people rose against the aristocracy, who up to that
                    time had governed the commune. In the Terror they rebelled against the
                    convention, but were promptly subdued by General Carteaux. The wars of the
                    empire, by dealing a severe blow to their maritime commerce, excited the hatred
                    of the inhabitants against Napoleon, who accordingly hailed with enthusiasm the
                    return of the Bourbons and the defeat of Waterloo. The news of the latter
                    provoked a bloody reaction in the town against those suspected of imperialism.
                    Since 1815 the prosperity of the city <pb break="no"

                    conquest of Algeria and the opening of the Suez Canal. The completion of the
                    canal of the Durance has covered with verdure the formerly arid country
                    surrounding the town, and the openings made in the old part of Marseilles have
                    improved its sanitary condition. (G. ME.)</p>
