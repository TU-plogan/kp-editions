                    life, except that his father, as appears from the dedication of one of his plays
                    (7‰ <hi rend="italic">Bondman),</hi> was in the service of the Herberts. That
                    his father’s service was not menial is proved by his having once been the bearer
                    of letters from the earl of Pembroke to the queen. The industry of antiquaries
                    has discovered only one little fact about Massinger between his leaving Oxford
                    in 1606 and his having a comedy performed at court in 1621. This fact is that he
                    joined with two dramatists, Field and Daborne, in asking an advance of <hi
                    rend="italic">£5</hi> from the theatrical capitalist, Henslowe. This painful
                    request, the date of which is conjectured to be about 1614, sets forth that the
                    three petitioners were “in unfortunate extremitie.” In his part of the document
                    Massinger says that he has “ever found” Henslowe “a true loving friend.” The
                    expression seems to point to his having been connected with plays and players
                    for some considerable time. After 1621 many of his plays were acted and
                    published; but from the tone of his dedications it is to be inferred that he was
                    often in straits. The entry in the parish register·of St Saviour’s—“March 20,
                    1639—40—buried Philip Massinger, a stranger”—may mean only that Massinger was
                    not a resident in the parish; but it is sadly out of keeping with the
                    dramatist’s place in the respect of posterity.</p>
                <p>In the barrenness of authentic fact, conjecture has been busy with Massinger’s
                    life and character. One of the questions that have been raised about
                    him,—whether or not he was a Roman Catholic,—leads to other questions that have
                    more than a personal interest. Attempts to fix the political or the religious
                    creed of a dramatist are generally fanciful; as a rule, when a critic finds an
                    opinion expressed by one of a dramatist’s personages with exceptional and
                    striking force, he jumps to the conclusion that the dramatist must have held
                    this opinion himself as a ruling conviction. The evidence that Massinger was a
                    Roman Catholic at a time when the creed was held under pains and penalties is of
                    a more serious kind, though not conclusive. It rests upon three of his plays,
                    <hi rend="italic">The Virgin Martyr</hi> (printed in 1622, acted before 1620),
                    <hi rend="italic">The Benegado</hi> (acted in 1624), and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Maid of Honour</hi> (printed in 1632, but probably acted earlier). In the first
                    of these Massinger was assisted by Dekker. Whether or not the author was a Roman
                    Catholic, it is certain that only a Roman Catholic audience could be expected to
                    enter into the spirit of these plays and applaud at the end; and they are very
                    remarkable theatrical phenomena to have appeared in the reign of James.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Virgin Martyr,</hi> founded on the martyrdom of Dorothea in
                    the time of Diocletian, is, in effect, an old miracle play in five acts. The
                    devil himself appears on the stage,—first in human shape as the servant of a
                    persecutor, hunting out victims and instigating the most cruel tortures;
                    afterwards in “a fearful shape” with fire flashing round him. The page of the
                    martyr Dorothea is an angel in disguise, who also appears in his own proper
                    shape before the end of the play. Dorothea is tortured on the stage in the most
                    revolting fashion, dragged about by the hair, kicked, beaten with cudgels, but
                    her page Angelo stands by, and she is miraculously preserved from hurt. Other
                    miracles are performed on the stage. A persecutor falls down in a fit when about
                    to proceed to subject the martyr’s constancy to the foulest trials. In the last
                    act a basket of fruit from paradise is brought on, and the chief persecutor
                    eating of it is wholly changed in spirit, and drives away his diabolic servant
                    by holding up a cross of flowers. At the close the martyrs appeal’ in white
                    robes, transfigured. The <hi rend="italic">Virgin Martyr</hi> further resembles
                    the miracle play in the coarseness of the comic scenes intended to illustrate
                    the power of the devil over the most base and grovelling natures. The tone of
                    the play throughout is serious and lofty; the passions of the persecutorsand the
                    heroic devotion of the martyrs are given with great dramatic force. This is a
                    very <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n650/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0650-0619"/> remarkable play to have appeared suddenly amidst
                    the run of secular pieces. It seems to have been popular, and was several times
                    reprinted before the Restoration. That the <hi rend="italic">Rencgado</hi>
                    should have found favour is still more remarkable. In itself it is a powerfully
                    constructed play, strong in character and incident. Massinger’s leaning to Roman
                    doctrine is supposed to be shown by his making one of his heroines—a converted
                    Turk, a sultan’s sister—experience complete spiritual transformation after
                    receiving the rite of baptism. But there is a more suggestive and stranger fact
                    than this. The hero of the piece, Francisco, is a Jesuit priest, treated with
                    profound respect throughout, a man of noble unselfish aims, running all risks to
                    save and gain souls, exercising the strongest moral influence for the wisest and
                    most benevolent purposes. Francisco’s influence pervades the play, and is
                    crowned with triumph at the end. He sails back to Venice with a noble lady
                    rescued from the infidel, her virtue protected by an amulet during her
                    captivity, a renegade military hero restored to his country and the church, a
                    noble Venetian rescued from spiritual and physical perils, the beautiful sister
                    of the sultan converted to Christianity. That a London audience should have
                    tolerated this glorification of a Jesuit within twenty years of the Gunpowder
                    Plot is an extraordinary fact, of which the explanation is still to seek. In the
                    <hi rend="italic">Maid of Honour</hi> the heroine relieves a highly complicated
                    situation at the end by taking the veil, giving a third of her property to
                    anunnery, a third for pious uses, and a third to an honest, faithful, but to her
                    unattractive lover. For this she is held up as “to all posterity a fair example
                    for noble maids to imitate.” Only an audience of very pious Catholics could have
                    sympathized with such a conclusion.</p>
                <p>Such plays show that Massinger, if not a Roman Catholic, was at least not blinded
                    by the popular hatred of them, but could dwell in rapt admiration on what was
                    noble and lofty in the motives supplied by the Roman Church. The strange thing
                    is that he found a manager to produce these plays, or an audience to tolerate
                    them. It may be doubted whether Massinger was ever a popular dramatist. His
                    poverty is not indeed conclusive on this point, for the prices paid for plays
                    were so small that a dramatist could hard!y make a livelihood by play writing,
                    unless he was also an actor or a theatrical manager. But the best qualities of
                    his plays appeal rather to thoughtful politicians, moralists, and students of
                    character than to the simple feelings of the ordinary playgoer Only one of them,
                    <hi rend="italic">A New JFay to Pay Old Debts</hi> (printed 1633), has kept the
                    stage, and that chiefly because the leading character, Sir Giles Overreach, a
                    sort of commercial Richard HL, a compound of “the lion and the fox,” provides
                    many opportunities for a great actor. Like all Massinger’s plays, it is most
                    ingenious and effective in construction, but in this as in others he has been
                    more intent upon the elaboration of a plot and the exhibition of a ruling
                    passion than upon winning the love and admiration of his audience for heroes and
                    heroines. The other personages besides Sir Giles are either conventional comic
                    figures, or dim, feebly outlined, uninteresting characters. The reformed
                    prodigal and the two pairs of lovers who outwit the cunning diplomatist by
                    simple means seem poor, joyless, bloodless phantoms when put side by side with
                    the rich life of Shakespeare’s youthful lovers and reckless scapegraces , they
                    are mere foils to Overreach; their life is not displayed, it is only indicated
                    in the dialogue. With the exception of this play, all Massinger’s have been
                    relegated to the study since his own time. The <hi rend="italic">Fatal
                    Dowry</hi> (printed 1632), in which Massinger had the assistance of Field, was
                    partially resuscitated by Rowe, being made the basis of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fair Penitent.</hi> In Massinger’s own judgment, the <hi rend="italic">Doman
                    Actor</hi> was “the most perfect birth of his Minerva.” It is in effect a study
                    of the tyrant Domitian, and of the results of despotic rule on the despot
                    himself and his court; the intrigues and counter intrigues, the rise of
                    sycophancy, the fall of honesty, the growth of the appetite for blood, the
                    growth and final triumph of the spirit of revenge, are exhibited with great
                    power. Among the dramatists of that great period, Massinger comes next to
                    Shakespeare in the art of opening and developing a plot. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bondman,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Duke of Milan,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Great Duke of Florence</hi> are also favourable specimens of
                    Massinger’s power. But what was said by one of his admirers in the dedication of
                    the <hi rend="italic">City Madam</hi> is perfectly true, that, “though he
                    composed many plays, he wrote none amiss.” The manners and the characters are
                    always clearly conceived, although the dramatist’s strength is put forth in the
                    portrayal of some one ruling passion. The action always marches forward
                    steadily, with as little as possible of irrelevant digression; so steadily in
                    fact is the main purpose pursued as to produce a certain air of labour and
                    constraint. The language is never mean, and never turgid; in impassioned
                    situations it wants fire and directness. If the stage were ever deliberately
                    employed as an historical school, frequented by audiences anxious to get a clear
                    and vivid impression of important situations, going to the theatre not to be
                    interested against their will but willing to be interested, the dramas of
                    Massinger would furnish excellent models.</p>
                <p>Several of Massinger’s plays are no longer extant. Eight of them were among those
                    destroyed by Warburton’s cook. The most recent edition of those remaining,
                    nineteen in number, is Cunningham’s (1870). Gifford edited Massinger with great
                    care.. (W. Μ.)</p>
