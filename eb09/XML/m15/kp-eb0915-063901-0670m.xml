                <p><label type="entry">MAURITIUS</label>, formerly called the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Isle of France,</hi> an island in the south-western portion of the Indian
                    Ocean, between 57° 18'and 57° 48' E. long., and 19° 58' and 20° 31' S. lat., 550
                    miles east of Madagascar, and 115 miles north-east of the island of Réunion, 940
                    miles south-east of the Seychelles, 2300 miles from the Cape of Good Hope, and
                    9500 miles from England <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Aden and Suez. The island is
                    irregularly elliptical—somewhat triangular—in shape, and is 36 miles long from
                    north-north-east to southsouth-west, and about 23 miles broad. It is 130 miles
                    in circumference, and its total area is about 713 square miles. The island is
                    surrounded by coral reefs, so that the ports are difficult bf access.</p>
                <p>From its mountainous character Mauritius is a most picturesque island, and its
                    scenery is very varied and beautiful. The most level portions of the coast
                    districts are the north and north-east, all the rest being broken by hills,
                    which vary from 500 to 2700 feet in height. There are three principal masses of
                    mountain: the north-western or Pouce range, in the district of Port Louis; the
                    south-western, in the districts of Rivière Noire and Savanne; and the
                    southeastern range, in the Grand Port district. In the first of these, which
                    consists of one principal ridge with several lateral spurs, overlooking Port
                    Louis, are the singular peaks of the Pouce (2650 feet), so called from
                    its.supposed resemblance to the human thumb; and the still loftier Pieter Botte
                    (2676 feet), a tall obelisk of bare rock, crowned with a globular mass of stone.
                    The highest summit in the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0671-0640"/> island is in the south-western mass of hills, the
                    Montagne de la Rivière Noire, which is 2711 feet above the sea. The principal
                    ranges in this mountain mass are three in number, arranged in a triangular form,
                    and are called respectively the mountains of La Pierre Rouge, La Rivière Noire,
                    and Savanne. The south-eastern group of hills consists of one chief range, the
                    Montagne du Bambou, with several spurs running down to the sea. In the interior
                    are extensive fertile plains, some 1200 feet in height, and forming the
                    districts of Moka, Vacois, and Plaines Wilhelms; and from nearly the centre of
                    the island rises an abrupt peak, the Piton du Milieu de l’île, to a height of
                    1932 feet above the sea-level. Other prominent summits are the Trois Mamelles,
                    the Montagne du Corps de Garde, the Signal Mountain, near Port Louis, and the
                    Morne Brabant, at the south-west corner of the island.</p>
                <p>The rivers are of course small, and none of them are navigable beyond a few
                    hundred yards from the sea. In the dry season most of them are little more than
                    brooks, although they soon become raging torrents when swollen by the heavy
                    rains of the wet period of the year. The principal stream is the Grande Rivière,
                    with a course of about 10 miles. A remarkable and very deep lake, called Grand
                    Bassin, is found in the south of the island, and is probably the extinct crater
                    of an ancient volcano; other similar lakes are the Mare aux Vacois and the Mare
                    aux Jones, and there are some other deep hollows which have a like origin.</p>
                <p>The geological structure of Mauritius is undoubtedly a result of volcanic action,
                    all the rocks being of basalt and greyish-tinted lavas, excepting some beds of
                    upraised coral. Columnar basalt is seen in several places. There are many
                    caverns and steep ravines, and from the character of the rocks the ascents are
                    rugged and precipitous. The island has few mineral productions, although iron,
                    lead, and copper in very small quantities have in former times been
                    obtained.</p>
                <p>The climate is pleasant during the cool season of the year, but oppressively hot
                    in summer (December to April), except in the interior plains, where the
                    thermometer ranges from 70° to 80°, while in Port Louis and the coast generally
                    it ranges from 90° to 96°. The mean temperature for the year at Port Louis is 78
                    <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 6. During the last thirty years the island has
                    been subject to severe epidemics, which have been extremely fatal. In 1854 a
                    visitation of Asiatic cholera swept off 17,000 people; and in 1867 a still more
                    destructive inroad of malarial fever, of an unusually fatal type, almost
                    paralysed the whole community for many weeks, carrying off 30,000 people, and
                    greatly affecting the finances of the colony. The seasons are divisible into
                    two, the cocl and comparatively dry season, from· April to November, and the
                    hotter season, during the rest of the year. From the month of January to the
                    middle of April, Mauritius, in common with the neighbouring islands and the
                    surrounding ocean from 8° to 30° of S. lat., is subject to severe and
                    destructive cyclones, accompanied by torrents of rain, which often cause great
                    destruction to houses and plantations. These hurricanes generally last about
                    eight hours, but they appear to be now less frequent and violent than in former
                    times, owing, it is thought, to the destruction of the ancient forests and the
                    consequent drier condition of the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>The soil of the island is of considerable fertility; it is a ferruginous red
                    clay, but so largely mingled with stones of all sizes that no plough can be
                    used, and the hoe has to be employed to prepare the ground for cultivation. The
                    woods with which the island was largely clothed when first discovered have been
                    to a great extent cut down, and the greater portion of the plains is now a vast
                    sugar plantation. The bright green of the sugar fields is a striking feature in
                    a view of Mauritius from the sea, and gives a peculiar beauty and freshness to
                    the prospect. The soil is suitable for the cultivation of almost all kinds of
                    tropical produce, and it is to be regretted that the prosperity of the colony
                    depends entirely on one article of production, for the consequences are serious
                    when there happens to be a failure, more or less, of the sugar crop. Guano is
                    extensively imported as a manure, and by its use the natural fertility of the
                    soil has been increased to a wonderful extent.</p>
                <p>For purposes of law and government Mauritius is divided into nine districts,
                    named respectively Port Louis, Pamplemousses, Rivière du Rempart, Flacq, Grand
                    Port, Savanne, Moka, Plaines Wilhelms, and Rivière Noire. The capital and seat
                    of government, the city of Port Louis, is situated on the north-western side of
                    the island, at the head of an excellent harbour, a deep inlet about a mile long.
                    This is protected by two forts,—Fort William and Fort George,—as well as by the
                    citadel in the city, and its value is further increased by three graving docks
                    connected with the inner harbour. Lighthouses have been erected on Flat Island
                    and at Cannonier’s Point. Port Louis has a population of about 70,000, but from
                    the lofty mountains by which it is enclosed its situation is hot, and from the
                    small amount of tide in the harbour effectual drainage is difficult, so that it
                    is not a very healthy town. The public buildings are of no great architectural
                    beauty, the government house being a three-storied structure with broad
                    verandas, of no particular style of architecture, while the Protestant cathedral
                    was formerly a powder magazine, to which a tower and spire has been added. The
                    Roman Catholic cathedral is more pretentious in style, but is tawdry in its
                    interior. In the city are large barracks and military stores. A maximum
                    contribution of &lt;£45,000 is paid to the imperial government by the colony
                    towards the expenses of the troops stationed in the island, but this sum is
                    reduced when the garrison is below a certain standard. In 1880 the amount paid
                    was &lt;£29,972. The governor and chief officers of government reside out of
                    Port Louis in the cooler uplands of the interior, as do also a large number of
                    the principal inhabitants, especially since the completion of the railways has
                    made access easy to many portions of the island. The most favourite place of
                    residence is at Curepipe, a place situated about 1800 feet above the sea; here
                    the climate resembles that of the south of France, and it has been so much
                    resorted to of late years that it is rapidly becoming a large town. The
                    construction of the Mauritian railways has given a great impetus to the trade of
                    the colony; the system embraces two lines, of a total length of 87 miles. The
                    main roads of the island are kept in good order, but much yet remains to be done
                    before the road system can be said to be complete throughout all the
                    districts.</p>
                <p>The prosperity of Mauritius, as already mentioned, depends almost entirely upon
                    its sugar-crop, and the export trade of the island has greatly increased during
                    the last twenty years, as will be seen by the following statistics:—</p>

                <p>Of the imports the principal items are rice (about a fifth of the whole), wheat,
                    and other grains, plain and coloured cottons, and haberdashery. Madagascar
                    supplies cattle to the colony, and also rice, although the greater portion of
                    the latter import comes from India. Horses are imported from the Cape, ponies
                    from Burmah and Pegu, mules from Spain, and sheep from Bombay and the Cape, Of
                    the exports, sugar forms of course the great item, amounting, on an average, to
                    nearly nineteen-twentieths of the whole; the increase in its production is shown

                <p>In 1877 the quantity of sugar exported was 189,164 tons; while in 1854 the
                    quantity was 102,000 tons. The next item is rum, which was exported to the value
                    of .£45,386 in 1878; and the production of cocoa-nut oil has increased from 7569
                    gallons in 1864 to 253,263 gallons in 1878, the latter quantity being worth
                    £37,263. The value of the coffee exported in 1879 was £25,064. The currency
                    consists of rupees and cents; and on the 1st of May 1878, the metric system of
                    weights and measures came into use iu the island.</p>
                <p>Mauritius being an oceanic island of small size, its present fauna is very
                    limited in extent, and does not contain much that is interesting. When first
                    seen by Europeans it contained no mammals except a large fruit-eating bat <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ptcropus vulgaris),</hi> which is plentiful in*the woods; but
                    several animals of this class have been introduced, and are now numerous in the
                    uncultivated region. Among these are two monkeys of the genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Macacus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cerco-pithccus,</hi> a stag <hi
                    rend="italic">(Cervus</hi><hi rend="italic">hippelaphus),</hi> a small hare, a
                    shrew-mouse, and the ubiquitous rat. A lemur and one of the curious hedgehoglike
                    <hi rend="italic">Insectivora</hi> of Madagascar <hi rend="italic">(Centetcs
                    ecaudatus)</hi> have probably both been brought from the larger island. The
                    avifauna resembles that of Madagascar; there are species of a peculiar genus of
                    caterpillar shrikes <hi rend="italic">(Campcphagidae),</hi> as well as of the
                    genera <hi rend="italic">Praiincola, Hypsipctcs, Phcdina, Tchitrea, Zostcrops,
                    Foudia, Collocalia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Coracσpsis,</hi> and peculiar
                    forms of doves and parroquets. The living reptiles are small and few in number,
                    but in the surrounding seas are great numbers of fish; the coral reefs abound
                    with a great variety of molluscs; and there are numerous land-shells. The
                    extinct fauna of Mauritius has considerable interest. In common with the other
                    Mascarene islands, it was the home of the Dodo <hi rend="italic">(Didus
                    ineptus'),</hi> one of a group of birds incapable of flight; there were also <hi
                    rend="italic">Aphanapteryx,</hi> a species of rail, and a short-winged heron <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ardea</hi><hi rend="italic">megacephala),</hi> which probably
                    seldom flew. The defenceless condition of these birds has led to their
                    extinction since the island was colonized. Several species of large fossil
                    tortoises have been discovered; but, strange to say, they are quite different
                    from the living ones of Aldabra, in the same zoological region.</p>
                <p>Owing to the extensive destruction of the primeval forests of the island for the
                    formation of sugar plantations, the indigenous flora of Mauritius is only seen
                    in parts of the interior plains, in the river valleys, and on the hills; and it
                    is so much mingled with trees and plants introduced from other parts of the
                    world that it is not very easy to distinguish between what is native and what
                    has come from abroad. The principal timber tree is the ebony <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Diospyros ebeneum),</hi> which grows to a considerable size. Besides this
                    there are bois de cannelle, olive-tree, benzoin <hi rend="italic">(Croton
                    Denzoe),</hi> colophane <hi rend="italic">(Colophonia),</hi> and iron-wood, all
                    of which are useful in carpentry; the cocoa-nut palm, an importation, but a tree
                    which has been so extensively planted during the last hundred years that it is
                    extremely plentiful; the palmiste <hi rend="italic">(Palma dactylifera</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">latifolia'),</hi> the latanier <hi rend="italic">(Coryplιa
                    umbraculifera),</hi> and the date-palm. The vacoa or vacois, a species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pandanus,</hi> is largely grown, the long tough leaves being
                    manufactured into bags for the export of sugar, and the roots being also made of
                    use’; and in the few remnants of the original forests the tree which is such a
                    prominent one in the coast flora of Madagascar, the traveller’s tree (<hi
                    rend="italic">Urania</hi><hi rend="italic">speciosa),</hi> grows abundantly. A
                    species of bamboo is very plentiful in the river valleys and in marshy
                    situations. A large variety of fruit is produced, including the tamarind, mango,
                    banana, pineapple, guava, shaddock, fig, avocado-pear, litchi, custard-apple,
                    and the mabolo <hi rend="italic">(Diospyros discolor),</hi> a fruit of exquisite
                    flavour, but very disagreeable odour. Many of the roots and vegetables of Europe
                    have been introduced, as well as some of those peculiar to the tropics,
                    including maize, millet, yams, manioc, dhol, gram, &amp;c. Small quantities of
                    tea, rice, and sago have been grown, as well as many of the spices (cloves,
                    nutmeg, ginger, pepper, and allspice), and also cotton, indigo, betel, camphor,
                    turmeric, and vanilla.</p>
                <p>Mauritius appears to have been unknown to European nations, if not to all other
                    peoples, until the year 1507, when it was discovered by the Portuguese. It had
                    then no inhabitants, and there seem to be no traces of its previous occupation
                    by any people, either savage or civilized. The island was retained for most of
                    the 16th century by its discoverers, but they made no colonies in it. In 1598
                    the Dutch took possession, and named the island “Mauritius,” in honour of their
                    prince Maurice. It had been previously called by the Portuguese “Ilha do Cerné,”
                    from the belief that it was the island so named by Pliny. But, although the
                    Dutch built a fort at Grand Port, they made no permanent settlement in
                    Mauritius, finally abandoning the island in 1710. Five years afterwards the
                    French, in their turn, took possession of what had seemed so worthless to two
                    European powers, but it was half a century before the Government of France
                    appreciated the value of their colony, since from 1715 to 1767 it was held by
                    agents of the French I⅛st India Company, by whom its name was again changed to
                    “lie de France.” The Company was fortunate in having several able men as
                    governors of its colony, especially the celebrated Mahé de Labourdonnais
                    (1735-46), “a man of eminent talents and virtue,” who introduced the culture of
                    the sugar-cane, and thus laid a firm foundation for the future prosperity of the
                    island. Under his direction roads were made, forts built, and considerable
                    portions of the forest were cleared, and the present capital, Port Louis, was
                    founded. Labourdonnais also promoted the planting of cotton and indigo, and is
                    justly remembered as the most enlightened and best of all the French governors.
                    The colony continued to rise in value during the time it was held by the French
                    crown, and to one of the later governors, De Poivre, was due the introduction of
                    the clove, nutmeg, and other spices. Another governor was D’Entrecasteaux, whose
                    name is kept in remembrance by a group of islands east of New Guinea.</p>
                <p>During the long war between France and England, at the commencement of this
                    century, Mauritius was a continual source of much mischief to English Indiamen
                    and other merchant vessels; and at length the British Government determined upon
                    an expedition for its capture. This was effected in 1810; and upon the
                    restoration of peace in 1814 the possession of the island was confirmed to
                    England by one of the provisions of the treaty of Paris. By the eighth article
                    of capitulation it was agreed that the inhabitants should retain their own laws,
                    customs, and religion; and so it happens that, although a British colony, the
                    island is still largely French in language, habits, and predilections; but its
                    name has again been changed to that given by the Dutch. Perhaps the most
                    distinguished of the English governors of the island was Sir Robert Farquhar
                    (1810-23), who did so much to abolish the Malagasy slave trade and to establish
                    friendly relations with the rising power of the IIova sovereign of
                    Madagascar.</p>
                <p>Mauritius is one of the crown colonies of Great Britain, and at the head of its
                    administration is a governor, who is assisted by an executive council of seven
                    members, holding the most important Government posts. There is also a
                    legislative council, which consists of the same members as the foregoing, with
                    three others, together with eight of the chief landed proprietors of the island,
                    who are nominated by the crown. The average annual revenue of the colony for the
                    ten years from 1871 to 1880 was £723,876, the average annual expenditure during
                    the same period being £710,261. Up to 1854 there was a surplus in hand, but
                    since that time expenditure has exceeded income, and the public debt is now
                    about £700,000.</p>
                <p>The island has largely retained the old French laws, the Codes Civile, de
                    Procédure, du Commerce, and d'Instruction Criminelle being still in force,
                    except so far as altered by the later laws for the administration of justice of
                    April 13, 1831. By these the court of appeal was reconstituted, and a supreme
                    court of civil and criminal justice was established, under a chief judge and
                    three puisne judges. The police force in 1880 included 689 men.</p>
                <p>During the last few years great improvements have been effected in the
                    educational system of the colony. The department of public instruction has two
                    branches, the Royal College, for higher education, and the school department,
                    for primary instruction. In 1880 the number of Government schools was 38, with
                    5077 scholars, and of schools aided by grants 54, with 4316 scholars, the total
                    teaching staff numbering 178. The annual education vote is about £13,000; and of
                    the scholars 73 per cent, are Roman Catholic, 14 per cent. Hindu, 8 per cent.
                    Protestant, and 5 per cent. Mohammedan. It will be seen from the above figures
                    that the Roman Catholic religion is that professed by the large majority of the
                    white population of Mauritius. The clergy supported by the state include the
                    Protestant bishop of Mauritius, with an archdeacon and seven clergymen of the
                    Church of England, and three clergymen of the Church of Scotland; and the Roman
                    Catholic bishop of Port Louis, with a vicar-general and thirty-four priests.</p>
                <p>The population of the Island Is a very varied one, and consists of two great
                    divisions:—those of European blood, chiefly French and English, as well as
                    numerous half-caste people; and a large coloured population, chiefly Hindu
                    coolies, but with representatives from various African and Asiatic regions,
                    Negroes, Malagasy, Parsees, Singhalese, Chinamen, Malays, &amp;c. The Hindu
                    immigrants now form more than two-thirds of the inhabitants of Mauritius, as
                    will be seen from the following figures for the year 1881 :—</p>

                    laws have been so unjust to the coloured people, and so much to the advantage of
                    the planters, that gross evils and abuses have arisen. And, unjust as the laws
                    are, their administration has often been still more unfair. The evil grew at
                    length so glaring that in 1871 a royal commission was appointed, which sat for a
                    long time investigating the subject. Various reforms were recommended, and since
                    then some improvements have been effected. But many of the creole planters aie
                    not remarkable for their respect for the rights of coloured people, and the
                    system is liable to gross abuse unless under vigilant control by higher
                    authority. Much yet remains to be done for the moral and religious instruction
                    of the labourers; and the presence of a large heathen population, and the
                    prevalence of crime, has been at times a very serious consideration for the
                    colony. The number of coolies arriving in and leaving the island varies very
                    largely, from a few hundreds annually to several thousands.</p>
                <p>The dependencies of Mauritius are the Seychelles group, the islands of Rodriguez
                    and Diego Garcia, the Chagos group, and seventy other smaller islands scattered
                    over a large extent of the Indian Ocean, and having a total population of about
                    16,000 souls. Rodriguez is situated 300 miles east of Mauritius and is
                    cultivated chiefly by colonists from that island.</p>
