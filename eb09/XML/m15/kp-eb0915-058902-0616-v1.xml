                            by the later hostile Judaism (a view supposed by some to be alluded to
                            even in John viii. 41). We learn from Origen that the story about the
                            soldier Panthera (∏αy0ηpα) was already upheld by Celsus. The Ebionites
                            and other heretical sects, as is well known, maintained the paternity of
                            Joseph.</p></note>); that she afterwards had other children is a natural
                    inference from Matt. i. 25, which the evangelists, who frequently allude to “the
                    brethren of the Lord,” are at no pains to obviate. The few incidents mentioned
                    in Scripture regarding her show that she followed our Lord to the very close of
                    His earthly career with unfailing motherliness, but the “Magnificat” assigned to
                    her in Luke i. is the only passage which would distinctly imply on her part a
                    high prophetic appreciation of His divine mission. She was present at the
                    crucifixion, where she was commended by Jesus to the care of the apostle John,
                    (John xix. 26, 27), Joseph having apparently died before this time. (It would be
                    idle to inquire why “the brethren of the Lord,” who, whatever their relationship
                    to Mary, must at least have been nearer than John, were ignored in this
                    arrangement.) Mary is mentioned in Acts i. 14 as having been among those who
                    continued in prayer along with the apostles at Jerusalem during the interval
                    between the ascension and pentecost. There is no allusion in the New Testament
                    to the time or place of her death.</p>
                <p>The subsequent growth of ecclesiastical tradition and belief regarding Mary will
                    be traced most conveniently under the separate heads of (1) her perpetual
                    virginity, (2) her absolute sinlessness, (3) her peculiar relation to the
                    Godhead, which specially fits her for successful intercession on behalf of
                    mankind.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Iler Perpetual Virginity. —</hi> This doctrine, as has already
                    been pointed out, was, to say the least, of no importance in the eyes of the
                    evangelists, and so far as extant writings go there is no evidence of its having
                    been anywhere taught within the pale of the catholic church of the first three
                    centuries. On the contrary, to Tertullian the fact of Mary’s marriage after the
                    birth of Christ is a useful argument for the reality of the Incarnation against
                    Gnostic notions, and Origen relies upon the references to the Lord’s brethren as
                    disproving the Docetism with which he had to contend. The ct∈ιτrαp0mα, though
                    very ancient, is in reality a doctrine of non-catbolic origin, and first occurs

                    tribe of Judah, living in Jerusalem); he had long been married to Anna her
                    mother, whose continued childlessness had become a cause of much humiliation and
                    sorrow to them both. The birth of a daughter was at last angelically predicted
                    to each parent separately. From her third to her twelfth year “Mary was in the
                    temple as if she were a dove that dwelt there, and she received food from the
                    hand of an angel.” When she became of nubile age a guardian was sought for her
                    by the priests among the widowers of Israel “lest she should defile the
                    sanctuary of the Lord”; and Joseph, an elderly man with a family, was indicated
                    for this charge by a miraculous token. Some time afterwards the annunciation
                    took place; when the</p>
                <p>Virgin’s pregnancy was discovered, Joseph and she were brought before the high
                    priest, and, though asserting their innocence in all sincerity, were acquitted
                    only after they had been tried with “the water of the ordeal of the Lord” (Numb.
                    v. 11). Numerous details regarding the birth at Bethlehem are then given. The
                    perpetual physical virginity of Mary, naively insisted upon in thia apocryphon,
                    is alluded to only with a half belief and a “some say” by Clement of Alexandria
                        <hi rend="italic">(Strom.,</hi> vii. 16), but became of much importance to
                    the leaders of the church in the 4th century, as for example to Ambrose, who
                    sees in Ezek. xliv. 1-3 a prophetic indication of so great a mystery.<note

                    continued to believe that Mary, after the miraculous birth of Jesus, had become
                    the mother of other children by Joseph came accordingly to be spoken of as her
                    enemies,—Antidicoma-rianitae (Epiphanius) or Antidicomaritae (Augustine),— and
                    the first-mentioned author devotes a whole chapter (chap. 78) of his great work
                    upon heresies to their confutation. For holding the same view Bonosus of Sardica
                    was condemned by the synod of Capua in 391. To Jerome the perpetual virginity
                    not only of Mary but even of Joseph appeared of so much consequence that while a
                    young man he wrote (387) the long and vehement tract <hi rend="italic"
                        >Against</hi><hi rend="italic">Helvidius,</hi> in which he was the first to
                    broach the theory (which has since gained wide currency) that the brethren of
                    our Lord were children neither of Mary by her husband, nor of Joseph by a former
                    marriage, but of another Mary, sister to the Virgin and wife of Cloρas or
                    Alphaeus. At last the epithet of det <hi rend="italic">παρθένος</hi> was
                    authoritatively applied to the Virgin by the council of Chalcedon in 451, and
                    the doctrine implied has ever since been an undisputed point of orthodoxy both
                    in the Eastern and in the Western church, some even seeking to hold the Anglican
                    Church committed to it on account of the general declaration (in the <hi

                    from the acknowledged fathers of the church could be cited to show that it was
                    originally quite unknown to Catholicism. Even Augustine repeatedly asserts that

                    assertion of Pelagius that many had lived free from sin, he wishes exception to
                    be made in favour of “the holy Virgin Mary, of whom out of honour to the Lord I
                    wish no question to be made where sins are treated of,—for how do we know what
                    mode of grace wholly to conquer sin may have been bestowed upon her who was
                    found meet to conceive and bear Him of whom it is certain that He had no sin.” A
                    writer so late as Anselm <hi rend="italic">(Cur Deus Homo,</hi> ii. 16) declares
                    that “the Virgin herself whence He (Christ) was assumed was conceived in
                    iniquity, and in sin did her mother conceive her, and with original sin was she
                    born, because she too sinned in Adam in whom all sinned,” and the same view was
                    expressed by Damian. The growth of the modern Roman doctrine of the immaculate
                    conception from the time in the 12th century when the canons of Lyons sought to
                    institute a festival in honour of her “holy conception,” and were remonstrated
                    with by Bernard, has been already sketched elsewhere (see <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    latterly the expression came to be valued as directly honourable to Mary herself
                    and as corresponding to the greatly increased esteem in which she personally was
                    held throughout the catholic world, so that, when Nestorius and others began to
                    dispute its propriety in the following century, their temerity was resented, not
                    as an attack upon the established orthodox doctrine of the Nicene creed, but as
                    threatening a more vulnerable and more tender part of the popular faith. It is
                    sufficient in illustration of the drift of theological opinion to refer to the
                    first sermon of Proclus, preached on a certain festival of the Virgin <hi

                    she is saluted as the “mother and virgin,” “through whom (δι ’ <hi rend="italic"
                        >η&lt;s)</hi> the Trinity is glorified and worshipped, the cross of the
                    Saviour exalted and honoured, through whom heaven triumphs, the angels are made
                    glad, devils driven forth, the tempter overcome, and the fallen creature raised
                    up even to heaven.” The response which such language found in the popular heart
                    was sufficiently shown by the shouts of joy with which the Ephesian mob heard of
                    the deposition of Nestorius, escorting his judges with torches and incense to
                    their homes, and celebrating the occasion by a general illumination. The causes
                    which in the course of the preceding century had led to this exaltation of the
                    Mother of God in the esteem of the catholic world are not far to seek. On the
                    one hand the solution of the Arian controversy, however correct it may have been
                    theoretically, undoubtedly had the practical effect of relegating the God-man
                    redeemer for ordinary minds into a far away region of “remote and awful
                    Godhead,” so that the need for a mediator to deal with the very Mediator could
                    not fail to be felt. On the other hand, it must be accepted as a fact abundantly
                    proved by history that the religious instincts of mankind are very ready to pay
                    worship, in grosser or more refined forms, to the idea of womanhood; at all
                    events many of those who became professing Christians at the political fall of
                    paganism entered the church with such instincts (derived from the
                    nature-religions in which they had been brought up) very fully developed.
                    Probably it ought to be added that the comparative colourlessness with which the
                    character of Mary is presented not only in the canonical gospels but even in the
                    most copious of the apocrypha left greater scope for the untrammelled exercise
                    of devout imagination than was possible in the case of Christ, in the
                    circumstances of whose humiliation and in whose recorded utterances there were
                    many things which the religious consciousness found difficulty in understanding
                    or in adapting itself to. At all events, from the time of the council of
                    Ephesus, to exhibit figures of the Virgin and Child became the approved
                    expression of orthodoxy, and the relationship of motherhood in which Mary had

                            by a virgin,” takes occasion to speak of Mary as the “advocata” of Eve;
                            but it seems certain that this word is a translation of the Greek <hi
                                rend="italic">συνήγορος,</hi> and implies hostility and rebuke
                            rather than advocacy.</p></note> There we read of Mary’s prayer to
                    Christ: “Do Thou bestow Thine aid upon every man calling upon, or praying to, or
                    napιing the name of Thine handmaid”; to which His answer is, “Every soul that
                    calls upon thy name shall not be ashamed, but shall find mercy and support and
                    confidence both in the world that now is and in that which is to come in the
                    presence of My Father in the heavens.” But Gregory of Nazianzus also, in his
                    panegyric upon Justina, mentions with incidental approval that in her hour of
                    peril she “implored Mary the Virgin .to come to the aid of a virgin in her
                        danger.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is
                            probable that the commemorations and invocations of the Virgin which
                            occur in the present texts of the ancient liturgies of “St James” and
                            “St Mark” are due to interpolation. In this connexion ought also to be
                            noted the chapter in Epiphanius <hi rend="italic">{Haer.,</hi> 79)
                            against the “Collyridians,” certain women in Thrace, Scythia, and
                            Arabia, who were in the habit of worshipping the Virgin (α∈l <hi
                                rend="italic">παρθΙνο1)</hi> as a goddess, the offering of a cake
                            (κoλλιφ(δα <hi rend="italic">τιva)</hi> being one of the features of
                            their worship. He rebukes them for offering the worship which was due to
                            the Trinity alone; “let Mary be held in honour, but by no means
                            worshipped.” The cultus was probably a relic of heathenism; compare
                            Jerem. xliv. 19.</p></note> Of the growth of the Marian cultus, alike in
                    the East and in the West, after the decision at Ephesus it would be impossible
                    to trace the history, however slightly, within the limits of the present
                    article. Justinian in one of his laws bespeaks her advocacy for the empire, and
                    he inscribes the high altar in the new church of St Sophia with her name. Narses
                    looks to her for directions on the field of battle. Heraclius bears her image on
                    his banner. John of Damascus speaks of her as the sovereign lady to whom the
                    whole creation has been made subject by her son. Peter Damian recognizes her as
                    the most exalted of all creatures, and apostrophizes her as deified and endowed
                    with all power in heaven and in earth, yet not forgetful of our race.<note

                    degree of “dulia” which is vaguely described as “hyperdulia.” On the other hand,
                    it must be remembered that the comparative reserve shown by the council of Trent
                    in its decrees, and even in its catechism,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>The points taught in the catechism are—that she is truly
                            the Mother of God, and the second Eve, by whose means we have received

                            our advocate; that her merits are highly exalted, and that her
                            dispositions towards us are extremely gracious; that her images are of

                            intercessions (though alluded to in the canon and elsewhere) are seldom

                            offices such as those for September 8, and for the Festival of the Seven
                            Sorrows (decreed by Benedict XIII. in 1727). Noteworthy are the
                            versicles in the office for December 8 (The Feast of the Immaculate
                            Conception), “Tota pulchra es, Maria, et macula originalis non est in
                            te,” and ‘ ‘ Gloriosa dicta sunt de te, Maria, quia fecit tibi magna qui

                    individual theologians, and in view of the fact of the canonization of some of
                    these (such as Liguori),—a fact guaranteeing the absence of erroneous teaching
                    from their writings,—it does not seem unfair to hold the Roman Church
                    responsible for the natural interpretations and just inferences which may be
                    drawn even from apparently exaggerated expressions in such works as the

                    in controversial literature. A good résumé of recent Catholic developments of

                <p>The following are the principal feasts of the Virgin in the order in which they
                    occur in the ecclesiastical year. (1) That of the Presentation <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Praesentatio</hi><hi rend="italic">B.</hi><hi rend="italic">V. Μ.,</hi> τα

                    commemorate the beginning of her stay in the temple, as recorded in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Protevangelium Jacobi</hi> (see above). It is believed to have
                    originated in the East sometime in the 8th century, the earliest allusion to it
                    being made by George of Nicomedia (9th century); Manuel Comnenus made it
                    universal for the Eastern empire, and in the modern Greek Church it is one of
                    the five great festivals in honour of the Deipara. It was introduced into the
                    Western Church late in the 14th century, and, after having been withdrawn from
                    the calendar by Pius V., was restored by Sixtus V., the day observed both in
                    East and West being November 21. It is not mentioned in the English calendar.
                    (2) The Feast of the Conception <hi rend="italic">(Conceptio</hi><hi

                        rend="smallcaps">Immaculate Conception)</hi>; in the Greek Church it only
                    ranks as one of the middle festivals of Mary. (3) The Feast of the Purification

                    of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary <hi rend="italic">(Annunciatio,
                        ι.υayyελισμ6s)',</hi> see <hi rend="smallcaps">Annunciation.</hi> It may be
                    mentioned that at the Toledan council in 656 it was decreed that this festival
                    should be observed on December 18, in order to keep clear of Lent. (5) The Feast
                    of the Visitation (<hi rend="italic">Visitatio</hi><hi rend="italic">B.</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">V. Μ.)</hi> was instituted by Urban VI., promulgated in 1389
                    by Boniface IX., and reappointed by the council of Basel in 1441 in
                    commemoration of the visit paid by Mary to Elizabeth. It is observed on July 2,
                    and has been retained in the English calendar. (6) The Feast of the Assumption
                        <hi rend="italic">(Dormitio, Pausatio, Transitus, Depositio, Migratio,
                        Assumptio,</hi><hi rend="italic">κolμησιs, μετaστaσιs,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >άνάληψα)</hi> has reference to the apocryphal story related in several
                    forms in various documents of the 4th century condemned by Pope Gelasius. Their
                    general purport is that as the time drew nigh for “the most blessed Virgin” (who
                    is also spoken of as “Holy Mary,” “the queen of all the saints,” “the holy
                    spotless Mother of God ”) to leave the world, the apostles were miraculously
                    assembled round her deathbed at Bethlehem on the Lord’s day, whereupon Christ
                    descended with a multitude of angels and received her soul. After ‘ ‘ the
                    spotless and precious body” had been laid in the tomb, “suddenly there shone
                    round them (the apostles) a miraculous light,” and it was taken up into heaven.
                    The first Catholic writer who relates this story is Gregory of Tours (<hi
                        rend="italic">c.</hi> 590); Epiphanius two centuries earlier had declared
                    that nothing was known as to the circumstances of Mary’s death and burial; and
                    one of the documents of the council of Ephesus implies a belief that she was
                    buried in that city. The Sleep of the Theotokos is observed in the Greek Church
                    as a great festival on August 15; the Armenian Church also commemoratesit, but
                    the Ethiopie Church celebrates her death and burial on two separate days. The
                    earliest allusion to the existence of such a festival in the Western Church
                    seems to be that found in the proceedings of the synod of Salzburg in 800; it is
                    also spoken of in the thirty-sixth canon of the reforming synod of Mainz, held
                    in 813. It was not, however, at that time universal, being mentioned as doubtful
                    in the capitularies of Charlemagne. It ought to be observed that the doctrine of
                    the bodily assumption of the Virgin into heaven, although extensively believed,
                    and indeed flowing as natural theological consequence from that of her
                    sinlessness, has never been declared to be “de fide” by the Church of Pome, and
                    is still merely a “pia sententia.” (7) The Nativity of Mary <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Nativitas,</hi><hi rend="italic">ytveθKιov</hi><hi rend="italic">τής
                        Θεοτόκου),</hi> observed on September 8, is first mentioned in one of the
                    homilies of Andrew of Crete (<hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 750), and along with the
                    feasts of the Purification, the Annunciation, and the Assumption, it was
                    appointed to be observed by the synod of Salzburg in 800, but seems to have been
                    quite unknown at that time in the Gallican Church, and even two centuries later
                    it was by no means general in Italy. In the Roman Church a large number of minor
                    festivals in honour of the Virgin are locally celebrated; and all the Saturdays
                    of the year as well as the entire month of May are also regarded as sacred to
                    her. (J. S. BL.)</p>
