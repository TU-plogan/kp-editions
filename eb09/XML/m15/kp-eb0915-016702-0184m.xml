                    the beginning of the 5th century after Christ. He is described in the
                    superscription of the best MSS. as <hi rend="italic">vir clarissimus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">illustris</hi>; hence it has been
                    supposed that he is the Macrobius who was <hi rend="italic">praefectus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">prκioriιιs Hispaniarum</hi> in 399 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi>
                    proconsul of Africa in 410, and chamberlain <hi rend="italic">(praepositus sacri
                    cubiculi)</hi> in 422. But the tenure of high office at that date was limited to
                    Christians, and there is no evidence in the writings of Macrobius that he was a
                    Christian. On the contrary, he shows great interest in the deities of paganism;
                    his friends seem to have belonged wholly to the pagan party; and his
                    philosophical views are those of the Neo-Platonists. Hence the identification is
                    more than doubtful. It is possible, but by no means certain, that he was the
                    Theodosius to whom Avianus dedicates his fables. From the date of the persons
                    who are mentioned by him as contemporaries, he appears to have flourished in the
                    time of Honorius.</p>
                <p>The most important of his works is the <hi rend="italic">Conviviorum
                    Saturnaliorum-Libri Septem,</hi> containing an account of the discussions held
                    at the house of Vettius Praetextatus during the holiday of the Saturnalia. The
                    latter part of the second book and the beginning of the third, the second half
                    of the fourth book, and the end of the seventh havebeen lost; otherwise the work
                    is in fairly good preservation. It was written by the author for the benefit of
                    his son Eustachius, and contains a great variety of curious historical,
                    mythological, critical, and grammatical disquisitions, the value of which is
                    much increased by the frequent quotations from earlier writers. The machinery is
                    somewhat cumbrous; for, as in some of Plato’s dialogues, the discussions are not
                    .directly reported, but a certain Postumianus reproduces, for his friend Decius,
                    the account which he had received from a rhetorician Eusebius, who had been
                    present at them. There is but little attempt to give any dramatic character to
                    the dialogue; in each book some one of the personages takes the leading part,
                    and the remarks of the others serve only as occasions for calling forth fresh
                    displays of erudition. The first book is devoted to an inquiry as to the origin
                    of the Saturnalia and the festivals of Janus, which leads to a history and
                    discussion of the Roman calendar, and to an attempt to derive all forms of
                    worship from that of the sun. The second book begins with a collection of <hi
                    rend="italic">bons</hi><hi rend="italic">mots,</hi> to which all present make
                    their contributions, many of them being ascribed to Cicero and Augustus; it then
                    appears to have passed into a discussion of various pleasures, especially of the
                    senses; but almost the whole of this is lost. The third, fourth, fifth, and
                    sixth books are devoted to Virgil, dwelling respectively on his learning in
                    religious matters, his rhetorical skill, his debt to Homer (with a comparison of
                    the art of the two) and to other Greek writers, and the nature and extent of his
                    borrowings from the earlier Latin poets. The latter part of the third book is
                    taken up with a dissertation upon luxury and the sumptuary laws intended to
                    check it, which is probably a dislocated portion of the second book, being
                    entirely out of place where it stands. The seventh book is of a more
                    miscellaneous character, consisting largely of the discussion of various
                    physiological questions. The value of the work consists solely in the facts and
                    opinions quoted from earlier writers, for it is purely a compilation, and has
                    little in its literary form to recommend it.</p>
                <p>We have also two books of a commentary on the <hi rend="italic">Somnium
                    Scipionis</hi> narrated by Cicero in his <hi rend="italic">De RepubUca.</hi> The
                    nature of the dream, in which the elder Scipio appears to his (adopted)
                    grandson, and describes the life of the good after death and the constitution of
                    the universe from the Stoic point of view, gives occasion for Macrobius to
                    discourse upon many points of physics in a series of essays interesting as
                    showing the astronomical notions then current. The moral elevation of the
                    fragment of Cicero thus preserved to us gave the work a popularity in the Middle
                    Ages to which its own merits have little claim.</p>
                <p>There is a good critical edition of Macrobius, with a commentary by I.. van Jan
                    (2 vols., Leipsic, 1848-52), and a convenient and excellent edition of the text
                    by F. Eyssenhardt (Leipsic, 1868).</p>
