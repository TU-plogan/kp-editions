                    A deep wet moat, 100 feet broad, with its escarp 60 feet from the walls, extends
                    along all four sides; it is crossed by five bridges. The palace of the king
                    occupies the central space of the city; the walls of its enclosure are laid
                    symmetrically with those of the city, and each face is about 370 yards in
                    length. The outer fence consists of a stockade of teak-wood posts 20 feet high,
                    and within it are three successive enclosures, bounded by brick walls. The
                    palace is built within the inner enclosure; and its front, which faces the east,
                    contains the great hall of audience, 260 feet long, composed of teak timber,
                    elaborately carved and gilded, erected on a terrace of brickwork 10 feet high.
                    It is in the form of a colonnade, the central part running back, forming a nave
                    with two side aisles. At the extremity of this nave is a space like a chancel
                    (said to be the exact centre of the city) where stands the throne, over which
                    rises a graceful gilded spire, visible from all parts of the city and
                    surrounding country. Another feature of the complex palace buildings is the
                    lofty campanile. Around the palace walls a wide space has been laid out as an
                    esplanade, on the further margin of which are situated most of the houses of the
                    princes, ministers of state, and court officials. The city may be said to
                    consist of two parts, intramural and extramural; the streets in the former run
                    parallel with the walls, dividing the building sites into rectangular blocks.
                    The majority of the houses are constructed of bamboos and bamboo matting,
                    slightly raised from the ground on posts, with here and there a few brick and
                    wooden buildings. The streets inside the city are very wide, the principal ones
                    being lined with tamarind trees. In the suburbs the roads are laid out with
                    something of the same regularity as in the city, but are of less width, with the
                    exception of the principal road, the Kuladan or foreign quarter, inhabited
                    chiefly by Armenians, Mughals, and the few European residents. The number of
                    houses in the city and suburbs is said to be, in round numbers, 12,000; and the
                    population is roughly estimated at 65,000. Monasteries and pagodas are dotted
                    about in open spaces, both within and without the walls. Silkweaving is the
                    principal manufacture.</p>
