                    years at Leyden, and took his degree in medicine in 1691, his inaugural thesis
                    being <hi rend="italic">De Chylosi</hi><hi rend="italic">Vitiata.</hi>
                    Immediately afterwards he came over to England “to learn the language,” which he
                    did to some purpose, writing it with such mastery as to throw doubts upon his
                    foreign extraction. He settled in London as a physician. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fable of the Bees</hi> is the general title of the miscellaneous work by which
                    he is known to fame. This work includes the fable proper, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Grumbling Hive, or Knaves Turned Honest</hi> (some two hundred doggerel
                    couplets, published as a sixpenny pamphlet and pirated as a halfpenny sheet in
                    1705); <hi rend="italic">Remarks</hi> on the fable and <hi rend="italic">An
                    Inquiry into, the Origin of Moral Virtue,</hi> added to the edition of 1714; <hi

                    into the Origin of Society,</hi> added to the edition of 1723. Owing to a
                    curious misprint in an edition published after Mandeville’s death, a wrong date
                    is commonly assigned to the <hi rend="italic">Grumbling Hive,</hi> and the
                    contemporary point of it consequently missed. It appeared during the heat of the
                    bitterly contested elections of 1705, when the question before the country was
                    whether Marlborough’s war with France should be continued. The cry of the high
                    Tory advocates of peace was that the war was carried on purely in the interests
                    of the general and the men in office; charges of bribery, peculation, hypocrisy,
                    every form of fraud and dishonesty, were freely cast about among the electors.
                    It was amidst this excitement that Mandeville sought and found an audience for
                    his grimly humorous paradox that “private vices are public benefits,”— that
                    individual self-seeking, ambition, greed, vanity, luxury, are indispensable to
                    the prosperity and greatness of a nation. “Fools only strive to make a great an
                    honest hive.” The bees of his fable grumbled as many Englishmen were disposed to
                    do,—“cursed politicians, armies, fleets,” whenever there came a reverse, and
                    cried, “Had we but honesty !” Jove at last in a passion swore that he would “rid
                    the bawling hive of fraud,” and filled the hearts of the bees with honesty and
                    all the virtues, strict justice, frugal living, contentment with little,
                    acquiescence in the insults of enemies. Straightway the flourishing hive
                    declined, till in time only a small remnant was left; this took refuge in a
                    hollow tree, “blest with content and honesty,” but destitute of arts and
                    manufactures. The <hi rend="italic">Grumbling Hive</hi> was in fact a political
                    <hi rend="italic">jeτι &lt;1esprit,</hi> full of the impartial mockery that
                    might be expected from a humorous foreigner, and with as much ethical theory
                    underlying it as might be expected from a highly educated man in an age of
                    active ethical speculation. The underlying theory was made explicit in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Remarks</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Inquiry into the Origin of
                    Moral Virtue,</hi> published in 1714. But his purpose in dwelling on the text
                    that private vices are public benefits was still rather the invention of
                    humorous paradoxes than the elaboration of serious theory. Dr Johnson, who owned
                    that Mandeville “opened his views into real life very much,” considered that the
                    fallacy of his argument lay in his defining neither vices nor benefits. But such
                    a criticism as this overlooks the hinge on which all Mandeville’s paradoxes
                    turn. He does define virtue and vice very precisely, in accordance with the
                    current orthodoxy of the time. He “gives the name of virtue to every performance
                    by which man, contrary to the impulse of nature, should endeavour the benefit of
                    others, or the conquest of his own passions, out of a rational ambition of being
                    good”; while “everything which, without regard to the public, man should commit
                    to gratify any of his appetites” is vice. His paradoxical humour has ample scope
                    in tracing how much vice and how little virtue there is in the world, when the
                    terms are thus strictly defined. He finds self-love (a vice by the definition)
                    masquerading in many virtuous disguises, lying at the root of asceticism,
                    heroism, public spirit, decorous conduct,—at the root, in short, of all the
                    actions that pass current as virtuous. These actions are not virtuous by the
                    definition, because not performed solely “out of a rational ambition of being
                    good.” “This is the way,” Dr Johnson says, “to try what is vicious, by
                    ascertaining whether more evil than good is produced by it on the whole.”
                    Mandeville would at once have admitted this, but his definition compelled him,
                    in determining virtue and vice, to consider also the motive. And having regard
                    to the motive, “the nearer we search into human nature, the more we shall be
                    convinced that the moral virtues are the political offspring which flattery
                    begot upon pride.” Man, “an extraordinary selfish and headstrong as well as a
                    cunning animal,” has been induced to subordinate his own appetites to the good
                    of others, by the dexterous management of politicians and moralists, who have
                    worked upon his pride to persuade him that self-indulgence is worthy only of the
                    brutes, and altogether “unbecoming the dignity of such a sublime creature as
                    himself.” When Mandeville, in the 1723 edition of the fable, applied his
                    analysis of self-regarding motives to the institution of charity schools, at
                    that time a highly fashionable form of munificence, a great outcry was made
                    against his doctrines; his book was presented to the justices by the grand jury
                    of Middlesex as being of an immoral and pernicious tendency, and a copy was
                    condemned to be burnt by the common hangman. Mandeville’s defence of himself was
                    that his remarks were “designed for the entertainment of people of knowledge and
                    education,” and that his inquiry could hardly be intelligible except to those
                    accustomed to matters of speculation; and he claimed that he had “diverted
                    persons of great probity and virtue and unquestionable good sense.” The truth is
                    that, to be rightly understood, the prose part of Mandeville’s fable must be
                    read in connexion with Lord Shaftesbury’s ethical writings; the intention to
                    ridicule the amiable but somewhat feebly reasoned theories of that moralist is
                    most apparent in the <hi rend="italic">Search into the Origin of Society,</hi>
                    but many lurking references may be detected elsewhere. If Mandeville were taken
                    seriously, he would certainly be open to the charge of conveying the impression
                    that those who restrain their appetites and sacrifice personal interests for the
                    public good make fools of themselves, and are the dupes of a designing society.
                    But his main purpose seems to have been to entertain himself and others at the
                    expense of more serious but less quick-witted theorizers.</p>

                <p>Besides his political and philosophical parerga, Mandeville wrote, in 1711, a
                    medical treatise, <hi rend="italic">Of the Hypochoridriack and Hysterick
                    Passions—</hi> their symptoms, causes, and cures. The treatise is in the form of
                    a dialogu¾ and is “interspersed with instructive discourses on the real art of
                    physic itself, and entertaining remarks on the modern practice of physicians and
                    apothecaries.” In this, with the same entertaining style and clear and subtle
                    judgment, he protests against and ridicules speculative therapeutics, and pleads
                    for patient diagnosis and careful observation and record of facts. His own
                    theories about the animal spirits and their connexion with “the stomachic
                    ferment” are fanciful enough, but he shows an intimate acquaintance with the
                    scientific methods of Locke, and a warm admiration for Sydenham. <hi
