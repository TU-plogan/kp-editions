                    “dog-mouse”); and the pouched marmots, or sousliks, comprising the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Spermophilus,</hi> or seed-lovers, so named from the character of
                    their food. These three genera are all closely allied to each other, and
                    together form the subfamily <hi rend="italic">Arctomyinae</hi> of the great
                    squirrel family, the <hi rend="italic">Sciuridae,</hi> of which the only other
                    subfamily, the <hi rend="italic">Sciurinae,</hi> consists of the true squirrels
                    <hi rend="italic">(^Sciurus')</hi> and the flying-squirrels <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pteromys).</hi> The members of the marmot subfamily are confined to the
                    northern hemisphere, and in fact are almost entirely limited to the north
                    temperate zone, in marked contrast to the genera of the subfamily <hi
                    rend="italic">Sciurinae,</hi> which attain their greatest development in
                    tropical or semitropical countries.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Arctomyinae</hi> agree in the possession of somewhat short,
                    stumpy bodies, comparatively short tails (except in certain sousliks), and long
                    and powerful claws suitable for burrowing. They all have broad, strong, and
                    ungrooved incisors or cutting teeth, two pairs of premolars above and one below,
                    and three pairs of true molars in each jaw. The grinding teeth are all on the
                    whole very similar, the first upper premolar much smaller than the others, and
                    nearly round, the next three teeth triangular in outline, and each with either
                    two or three transverse grooves upon the crown; the last molar is rather broader
                    and more complicated than the others, as is shown in fig. 2. The general form of
                    the skeleton is very similar to that of the true squirrels, but the bones as a
                    rule are stouter and heavier.</p>
                <p>1. The following are the generic characters of <hi rend="italic">Arctomys.</hi>
                    External form stout and heavy, ears short, tail short and hairy, cheek-pouches
                    rudimentary or absent. Fore feet with four well-developed toes, and a
                    rudimentary thumb provided with a flat nail; skull (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia,</hi> p. 417, fig. 92) similar in general form to that of the other
                    genera, but very much larger and heavier, the post-orbital processes <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n587/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0587-0560"/> stouter, and at right angles to the axis of the
                    skull. Incisors broad and powerful. First upper premolar nearly as large as the
                    second. Molar series? nearly parallel, scarcely converging behind at all.</p>
                <p>The various species of marmot, about ten in number, are all much alike in general
                    appearance, ranging in size from about 15 to 25 inches in length, with tails
                    from 3 to G inches long. The following are the species now generally recognized,
                    though the Central-Asiatic forms are still very imperfectly known :— ∙'</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Arctomys</hi><hi rend="italic">marmotta,</hi> Linn., southern
                    Europe, the Alps, Pyrenees, and Carpathians; <hi rend="italic">A. bobac,</hi>
                    Schreb., eastern Europe and Siberia; <hi rend="italic">A. himalayanus,</hi>
                    Hodgs., south-west Tibet; <hi rend="italic">A. hemachalamιs,</hi> Hodgs., Nepal;
                    <hi rend="italic">A. caudatus,</hi> Jacquemont, Cashmere; <hi rend="italic">A.
                    dichrous,</hi> Anderson, Afghanistan; <hi rend="italic">A. aureus,</hi>
                    Blanford, Turkestan; <hi rend="italic">A. monax,</hi> Linn., eastern North
                    America; <hi rend="italic">A. flaviventer,</hi> Aud. and Bach, western United
                    States; <hi rend="italic">A. pruinosus,</hi> Gmel., north-western North
                    America.</p>
                <p>It will thus be seen that one species only is peculiar to Europe, and three to
                    North America, while at least six, and perhaps more, are found in various parts
                    of Central Asia,— one of these, <hi rend="italic">A. bobac,</hi> occurring also
                    as far west as Russia and eastern Germany.</p>
                <p>The following account of the habits of the Alpine marmot, <hi rend="italic">A.
                    marmotta,</hi> extracted from Professor Blasius’s well-known work on the mammals
                    of Germany, applies, with but little variation, to all the members of the
                    genus.</p>
                <p>Marmots live high up in the snowy regions of the mountains, generally preferring
                    exposed cliffs, whence they may have a clear view of any approaching danger, for
                    which, while quietly basking in the sun or actively running about in search of
                    food, a constant watch is kept. When one of them raises the cry of warning, the
                    loud piercing whistle so well known to travellers in the Alps, they all
                    instantly take to flight and hide themselves in holes and crannies among the
                    rocks, often not reappearing at the entrance of their hiding-places until
                    several hours have elapsed, and then frequently standing motionless on the
                    look-out for a still longer period. Their food consists of the roots and leaves
                    of various Alpine plants, which, like squirrels, they lift to their mouths with
                    their fore paws.</p>
                <p>For their winter quarters they make a large round burrow, with but one entrance,
                    and ending in a sleeping-place thickly padded with hay. Here often from ten to
                    fifteen marmots pass the winter, all lying closely packed together fast asleep
                    until the spring. On awaking, hungry with their long fast, they remove the hay
                    with which they stuff up the doors of their burrows, and resume their life of
                    activity and watchfulness. The breeding season is in the early summer, when they
                    bring forth from fouι ’ to six young ones. Their flesh, although coarse and
                    rank, is eaten by the peasants, and their fur, though of but little value, is
                    also made use of.</p>
                <p>2. Our second genus is <hi rend="italic">Cynomys,</hi> containing only the
                    well-known “prairie dogs,” or more correctly <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi>
                    prairie marmots,” of the United States. The genus may be characterized as
                    follows. Size and form intermediate between <hi rend="italic">Arctomys</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">S})ermophilus.</hi> Ears and tail short. Cheek-pouches
                    shallow. Fore feet with five claws, that on the thumb as large as that on the
                    fifth toe. Skull heavily built, the post-orbital processes directed outwards.
                    Dentition, as shown in fig. 2, remarkably heavy, the molar teeth differing from
                    those of <hi rend="italic">Arctomys</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Spermophilus</hi>
                    by having three instead of two transverse grooves on their crowns. First
                    premolar nearly as large as the second. Molar series strongly convergent
                    behind.</p>
                <p>Of this genus two species have been described, very closely allied to each other,
                    but separable by their slightly different size and coloration. The larger and
                    better-known of the two is the eastern prairie marmot, <hi rend="italic">C.
                    ludovician∕us,</hi> Ord., inhabiting the open prairies of the central United
                    States, while the smaller species, <hi rend="italic">C. columbianus,</hi> Ord.,
                    is found to the westward as far as the Rocky Mountains.</p>
                <p>The habits of the prairie marmots have been so often described that every one is
                    familiar with their custom of forming their burrows in groups or “towns,” of
                    sitting outside to watch intruders, and of making the peculiar barking sound
                    from which they have derived their erroneous popular name of prairie dogs. In
                    the burrows made by them there are commonly found three strange and,
                    notwithstanding the earlier travellers’ tales, certainly unwelcome visitors,
                    namely, rattlesnakes, owls, and weasels, all of which at times probably prey
                    upon the young marmots. Prairie marmots do not truly hibernate, although in the
                    more northern and colder parts of their range they retire to their burrows
                    during the very severest weather. They feed on grasses and roots, for whose
                    mastication, however, their grinding teeth appear to be unnecessarily
                    powerful.</p>
                <p>3. The last genus to which the name marmot may be applied is that of the sousliks
                    or pouched marmots <hi rend="italic">(Spermophilus),</hi> of which the following
                    are the characters. Size much smaller than that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arctomys</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Cynomys,</hi> and form more slender and
                    squirrel-like. Tail very variable, from 1 to 8 or 9 inches in length.
                    Cheek-pouches always present. Fore feet with four well-developed toes and a
                    rudimentary thumb, of which the claw may be either present or absent. Skull much
                    more lightly built than that of either of the preceding genera, and the
                    postorbital processes slender and directed backwards. Molar series nearly
                    parallel, as in <hi rend="italic">Arctomys,</hi> but all much smaller and
                    lighter; the first premolar simply rounded, never more than about one-third of
                    the size of the second.</p>
                <p>The members of this large genus present a far greater range of variation than is
                    found among the true marmots, some of them, such as the European souslik, being
                    scarcely as large as a common squirrel, almost entirely without external ears,
                    and with the tail reduced to a mere stump, barely an inch long, while others
                    again are more than three times this size, with long and often tufted ears and
                    long bushy squirrel-like tails. These differences, and other corresponding
                    cranial ones, have caused the genus <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n588/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0588-0561"/> to be divided into the three following
                    subgenera:— <hi rend="italic">Spermophilus</hi> proper, containing thirteen or
                    fourteen species, of small size, with rudimentary ear-conches, short stumpy
                    tails, and comparatively large teeth; <hi rend="italic">Otospermophιlus,</hi>
                    two species, of squirrel-like build, with large and tufted ears, and long bushy
                    tails; and <hi rend="italic">Ictidomys,</hi> with four species, of very slender,
                    weasel-like form, with short ears, long but slender tails, and comparatively
                    small teeth. The last two subgenera are confined to North America, while the
                    range of the first is extremely similar to that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arctomys,</hi> although certain species penetrate somewhat farther south in the
                    New World, and none are found so far west in Europe. Professor Blasius gives the
                    following details of the habits of the common European souslik (N. <hi
                    rend="italic">citillus,</hi> I..).</p>
                <p>It lives in dry treeless plains, especially on a sandy or clayey soil, and is
                    never found either in forests or on swampy ground. It forms burrows, often 6 or
                    8 feet deep, in which food is stored up and the winter sleep takes place. Each
                    burrow has but one entrance, which is closed up when winter approaches,—a second
                    hole, however, being previously formed from the sleeping-place to just below the
                    surface of the ground. This second hole is opened the next year, and used as the
                    ordinary entrance, so that the number of closed up holes round a burrow gives an
                    indication of the length of time that it has been occupied. Sousliks ordinarily
                    feed on roots, seeds, berries, &amp;c., but occasionally also on animal food,
                    preying readily on eggs, small birds, and mice, the remains of these latter
                    being often found in their burrows. They bring forth in the spring from four to
                    eight young ones, which, if taken early, may be easily tamed. They are often
                    eaten by the peasants, the inhabitants of the Russian steppes considering their
                    flesh an especial delicacy. (0. T.)</p>
