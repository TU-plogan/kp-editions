                    the 25th of October 1800. His father, Zachary Macaulay, had been governor of
                    Sierra Leone, and was in 1800 secretary to the chartered company who had founded
                    that colony. Happy in his home, the boy at a very early age gave proof of a
                    determined bent towards literature. Before he was eight years of age he had
                    written a <hi rend="italic">Compendium of Universal History,</hi> which gave a
                    tolerably connected view of the leading events from the creation to 1800, and a
                    romance in the style of Scott, in three cantos, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Battle of Cheviot.</hi> Ata little later time the child composed a long poem on
                    the history of Olaus Magnus, and a vast pile of blank verse entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Fingal, a Poem in Twelve Books.</hi></p>
                <p>The question between a private and a public school was anxiously debated by his
                    parents, and decided in favour of the former. The choice of school, though
                    dictated by theological considerations, was a fortunate one. Mr Preston of
                    Little Shelford enjoyed the confidence of Mr Simeon, but was himself a judicious
                    tutor; and at his table, where master and pupil dined in common, not only the
                    latest Cambridge topics were mooted, but university ambitions and ways of
                    thought were brought home to the boys.</p>

                <p>In October 1818 young Macaulay went into residence at Trinity College, Cambridge.
                    Here he revelled in the possession of leisure and liberty, which he could not
                    forego for the sake of those university honours which at that day were only to
                    be obtained by a severely exclusive course of mathematical study. But he
                    succeeded in obtaining the prize which in his eyes was the most desirable that
                    Cambridge had to give, viz., a fellowship at Trinity. A trifling college prize
                    for an essay on the character of William HI. was awarded to an ess ιy by young
                    Macaulay, which may be regarded as the first suggestion and the earnest of his
                    future <hi rend="italic">History.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1826 Macaulay was called to the bar and joined the northern circuit. But after
                    the first year or two, during which he got no business worth mention, he gave up
                    even the pretence of reading law, and spent many more hours under the gallery of
                    the House of Commons than in the court. His first attempt at a public speech,
                    made at an anti-slavery meeting in 1824, was described by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edinburgh Review</hi> as “a display of eloquence of rare and matured
                    excellence.” His first considerable appearance in print was in No. 1 of Knight’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Magazine,</hi> a periodical which enjoyed a short
                    but brilliant existence, and which was largely supported by Eton and Cambridge.
                    In August 1825 began Macaulay’s connexion with the periodical which was to prove
                    the field of his literary reputation. The <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh
                    Review</hi> was at this time at its height of power, not only as an organ of the
                    growing opinion which leant towards reform, but as a literary tribunal from
                    which there was no appeal. The essay on Milton, though so crude that the author
                    said of it that “it contained scarcely a paragraph such as his matured judgment
                    approved,” created for him at once a literary reputation which suffered no
                    diminution to the last, a reputation which he established and confirmed, but
                    which it would have been hardly possible to make more conspicuous. Murray
                    declared that it would be worth the copyright of <hi rend="italic">Childe
                    Harold</hi> to have Macaulay on the staff of the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly
                    Review.</hi> Robert Hall, writhing with pain, and well-nigh worn out with
                    disease, was discovered lying on the floor employed in learning by aid of
                    grammar and dictionary enough Italian to enable him to verify the parallel
                    between Milton and Dante. The family breakfast table was covered with cards of
                    invitation to dinner from every quarter of London.</p>
                <p>The sudden blaze of popularity kindled by a single essay, such as are now
                    produced every month without attracting any notice, is partly to be explained by
                    the dearth of literary criticism in England at that epoch. For, though a higher
                    note had already been sounded by Hazlitt and Coleridge, it had not yet taken
                    hold of the public mind, which was still satisfied with the feeble appreciations
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Retrospective,</hi> or the dashing and damnatory
                    improvisation of Wilson in <hi rend="italic">Blackwood</hi> or Jeffrey in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh.</hi> Still, after allowance made for the barbarous
                    partisanship of the established critical tribunals of the period, it seems
                    surprising that a social success so signal should have been the consequence of a
                    single article. The explanation is to be found in the fact that it had been
                    discovered at the same time that the writer of the article on Milton was, unlike
                    most authors, also a brilliant converser. There has never been a period when an
                    amusing talker has not been in great demand at London tables; but at the date at
                    which Macaulay made his début witty conversation was studied and cultivated as
                    it has ceased to be in the more busy age which has succeeded. At the university
                    Macaulay had been recognized as pre-eminent for talk and companionship among a
                    circle of young men of talents so brilliant as were Charles Austin, Romilly,
                    Praed, Villiers, and others. He now displayed these gifts on a wider theatre.
                    Crabb Robinson’s diary, under date 1826, records the judgment of one who had
                    been in the· constant habit of hearing the best talk of the London of his day.
                    Such as he was in 1826 Macaulay continued to be to the end. In Lord Carlisle’s
                    journal, under date 27th June 1843, we read—“Breakfasted with Hallam, John
                    Russell, Macaulay, Everett, Van de Weyer, Hamilton, Mahon. Never were such
                    torrents of good talk as burst and sputtered over from Macaulay and Hallam.”
                    Again, 11th October 1849, “the evening went off very pleasantly, as must almost
                    always happen with Macaulay. He was rather paradoxical, as is apt to be his
                    manner, and almost his only social fault. The greatest marvel about him is the
                    quantity of trash he remembers.” In March 1850 Lord Carlisle records—“Macaulay’s
                    flow never ceased once during the four hours, but it is never overbearing.”</p>
                <p>Thus launched (1825) on the best that London had to give in the way of society,
                    Macaulay accepted and enjoyed with all the zest of youth and a vigorous nature
                    the opportunities opened fcr him. He was courted and admired by the most
                    distinguished personages of the day. He was admitted at Holland House, where
                    Lady Holland listened to him with deference, and scolded him with a
                    circumspection which was in itself a compliment. Rogers spoke of him with
                    friendliness, and to him with affection, and ended by asking him to name the
                    morning for a breakfast party. He was treated with almost fatherly kindness by
                    “Conversation” Sharp.</p>
                <p>Thus distinguished, and justifiably conscious of his great powers, it was not
                    unnatural that Macaulay’s thoughts should take the direction of politics, and
                    his ambition aspire to a political career. But the shadow of pecuniary trouble
                    early began to fall upon his path. When he went to college his father believed
                    himself to be worth £100,000, and declared his intention of making him, in a
                    modest way, an eldest son. But commercial disaster overtook the house of
                    Babington and Macaulay, and the son now saw himself compelled to work for his
                    livelihood. His Trinity fellowship of £300 a year became of great consequence to
                    him, but it expired in 1831; he could make at most £200 a year by writing; and a
                    commissionership of bankruptcy, which was given him by Lord Lyndhurst in 1828,
                    and which brought him in about £400 a year, was swept away, without
                    compensation, by the ministry which came into power in 1830. Macaulay now found
                    himself a poor man, and was reduced to such straits that he had to sell his
                    Cambridge gold medal.</p>
                <p>In February 1830 the doors of the House of Commons were opened to him in the only
                    way in which a man without fortune could enter them, through what was then
                    called a “pocket borough.” Lord Lansdowne, who had been struck by two articles
                    on Mill (James) and the Utilitarians, which appeared in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edinburgh Review</hi> in 1829, offered the author the seat at Caine. The offer
                    was accompanied by the express assurance that the noble patron had no wish to
                    interfere with his freedom of voting. He thus entered parliament at one of the
                    most exciting moments of English domestic history, when the compact phalanx of
                    reactionary administration which for nearly fifty years had commanded a crushing
                    majority in the Commons was on the point of being broken by the growing strength
                    of the party of reform. Macaulay made his maiden speech on 5th April 1830, on
                    the second reading of the bill for the removal of Jewish disabilities. In July
                    the king died and parliament was dissolved; the revolution took place in Paris.
                    Macaulay, who was again returned for Caine, visited Paris, eagerly enjoying a
                    first taste of Continental travel. On 1st March 1831 the Reform Bill was
                    introduced, and on the second night of the debate Macaulay made the first of his
                    reform speeches. It was a <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0142-0127"/> signal success. Sir Robert Peel said of it that
                    “portions were as beautiful as anything I have ever heard or read.”</p>
                <p>Encouraged by this first success, Macaulay now threw himself with ardour into the
                    life of the House of Commons, while at the same time he continued to enjoy to
                    the full the social opportunities which his literary and political celebrity had
                    placed within his reach. For these reasons he dined out almost nightly, and
                    spent many of his Sundays at the suburban villas of the Whig leaders, while he
                    continued to supply the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> with a steady
                    series of his most elaborate articles. On the triumph of Earl Grey’s cabinet,
                    and the passing of the Reform Act in June 1832, Macaulay, whose eloquence had
                    signalized every stage of the conflict, became one of the commissioners of the
                    Board of Control, and applied himself to the study of Indian affairs. His
                    industry was untiring, and the amount of intellectual product which he threw off
                    very great. Giving his days to India and his nights to the House of Commons, he
                    could only devote a few hours to literary composition by rising at five when the
                    business of the House had allowed of his getting to bed in time on the previous
                    evening. Between September 1831 and December 1833 he furnished the <hi
                    rend="italic">Review</hi> with the following articles :—“Boswell’s Life of
                    Johnson”; “Lord Nugent’s Hampden”; “Burleigh and his Times”; “Mirabeau”; “Horace
                    Walpole”; “Lord Chatham”; besides writing his ballad on the Armada for one of
                    the Albums, annual publications of miscellanies then in fashion.</p>
                <p>In the first reform parliament, January 1833, Macaulay took his seat as one of
                    the two first members for Leeds, which up to that date had been unrepresented in
                    the House of Commons. He replied to O’Connell in the debate on the address,
                    meeting the great agitator face to face, with high, but not intemperate,
                    defiance. In July he defended the Government India Bill in a speech of great
                    power, and to his aid was greatly due the getting the bill through committee
                    without unnecessary friction. When the abolition of slavery came before the
                    House as a practical question, Macaulay had the prospect of being placed in the
                    dilemma of having to surrender office or to vote for a modified abolition, viz.,
                    twelve years’ apprenticeship, which was proposed by the ministry, but condemned
                    by the abolitionists. He was prepared to make the sacrifice of place rather than
                    be unfaithful to the cause to which his father had devoted his life. He placed
                    his resignation in Lord Althorp’s hands, and spoke against the ministerial
                    proposal. But the sense of the House was so strongly expressed as unfavourable
                    that, finding they would be beaten if they persisted, the ministry gave way, and
                    reduced apprenticeship to seven years, a compromise which the abolition party
                    accepted; and Macaulay remained at the Board of Control.</p>
                <p>While he was thus growing in reputation, and advancing his public credit, the
                    fortunes of the family were sinking, and it became evident that his sisters
                    would have no provision except such as their brother might be enabled to make
                    for them. Macaulay had but two sources of income, both of them precarious—office
                    and his pen. As to office, the Whigs could not have expected at that time to
                    retain power for a whole generation; and, even while they did so, Macaulay’s
                    resolution that he would always give an independent vote made it possible that
                    he might at any moment find himself in disagreement with his colleagues, and
                    have to quit his place. As to literature, he wrote himself to Lord Lansdowne
                    (1833), “it has been hitherto merely my relaxation; I have never considered it
                    as the means of support. I have chosen my own topics, taken my own time, and
                    dictated my own terms. The thought of becoming a bookseller’s hack, of spurring
                    a jaded fancy to reluctant exertion, of filling sheets with trash merely that
                    sheets may be filled, of bearing from publishers and editors what Dryden bore
                    from Tonson and what Mackintosh bore from Lardner, is horrible to me.” Though
                    pennyless, Macaulay could never be accused of playing the game of politics from
                    selfish considerations. But it was impossible that, circumstanced as he was, he
                    should not look with anxiety upon his own future and that of his sisters,—
                    sisters who had been, and who had deserved to be, the intimate confidants of all
                    his thoughts and doings, and to whom he was attached by the tenderest affection.
                    He was therefore prepared to accept the offer which was made him of a seat in
                    the supreme council of India, a body which had been created by the India Act he
                    had himself been instrumental in passing. The salary of the office was fixed at
                    £10,000, an income out of which he calculated to be able to save in five years a
                    capital of £30,000. His sister Hannah accepted his proposal to accompany him,
                    and in February 1834 the brother and sister sailed for Calcutta.</p>
                <p>Macaulay’s appointment to India occurred at the critical moment when the
                    government of the company was being superseded by government by the crown. His
                    knowledge of India was, when he landed, but superficial. But at this juncture
                    there was more need of statesmanship directed by general liberal principles than
                    of a practical knowledge of the details of Indian administration. Macaulay’s
                    presence in the council *was of great value; his minutes are models of good
                    judgment and practical sagacity. The part he took in India has been described as
                    “the application of sound liberal principles to a government which had till then
                    been jealous, close, and repressive.” He vindicated the liberty of the press; he
                    maintained the equality of Europeans and natives before the law; and as
                    president of the committee of public instruction he inaugurated that system of
                    national education which has since spread over the whole of the Indian
                    peninsula.</p>
                <p>A clause in the Indian Act of 1833 occasioned the appointment of a commission to
                    inquire into the jurisprudence of our Eastern empire. Macaulay was appointed
                    president of that commission. The draft of a penal code which he submitted
                    became, after a revision of many years, and by the labour of many experienced
                    lawyers, that criminal code under which law is now administered throughout the
                    empire. Of this code Sir James Stephen says that “it reproduces in a concise and
                    even beautiful form the spirit of the law of England, in a compass which by
                    comparison with the original may be regarded as almost absurdly small. The
                    Indian penal code is to the English criminal law what a manufactured article
                    ready for use is to the materials out of which it is made. It is to the French
                    Code Pénal, and to the German code of 1871, what a finished picture is to a
                    sketch. It is simpler and better expressed than Livingston’s code for Louisiana;
                    and its practical success has been complete.”</p>
                <p>As might be expected, Macaulay’s enlightened views and measures drew down on him
                    the abuse and ill-will of Anglo-Indian society in Calcutta and the Mofussil.
                    Fortunately for himself he was enabled to maintain a tranquil indifference to
                    political detraction by withdrawing his thoughts into a sphere remote from the
                    opposition and enmity by which he was surrounded. Even amid the excitement of
                    his early parliamentary successes literature had balanced politics in his
                    thoughts and interests. Now in his exile, for such he felt it to be, he began to
                    feel more strongly each year the attraction of European letters and European
                    history. He writes to his friend Ellis, “I have gone back to Greek literature
                    with a passion astonishing to myself. I have never felt anything like it. I was
                    enraptured with Italian during the six months which I gave up to it; and I was
                    little less pleased with Spanish. But when I went back to the Greek I felt as if
                    I had never <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n143/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0143-0128"/> known before what intellectual enjoyment was.” In
                    thirteen months he read through, some of them twice, a large part of the Greek
                    and Latin classics. The attention with which he read is proved by the pencil
                    marks and corrections of press errors which he left on the margin of the volumes
                    he used.</p>
                <p>The fascination of these studies produced their inevitable effect upon his view
                    of political life. He began to wonder what strange infatuation leads men who can
                    do something better,to squander their intellect, their health, and energy on
                    such subjects as those which most statesmen are engaged in pursuing. He was
                    already, he says, “more than half determined to abandon politics and give myself
                    wholly to letters, to undertake some great historical work, which may be at once
                    the business and the amusement of my life, and to leave the pleasures of
                    pestiferous rooms, sleepless nights, and diseased stomachs to Roebuck and to
                    Praed.”</p>
                <p>In 1838 Macaulay and his sister Hannah, who had now become Lady Trevelyan,
                    returned to England. He at once entered parliament as member for Edinburgh. In
                    1839 he became secretary at war, with a seat in the cabinet in Lord Melbourne’s
                    ministry. His acceptance of office diverted him for a time from prosecuting the
                    plan he had already formed of a great historical work. But only for a time. In
                    less than two years the Melbourne ministry fell, and Macaulay was liberated from
                    having to support a Government wretchedly weak, and maintaining its struggle for
                    bare existence.</p>
                <p>He returned to office in 1846, in Lord John Russell’s administration. But it was
                    in an office which gave him leisure and quiet rather than salary and power—that
                    of paymaster-general. His duties were very light, and the contact with official
                    life and the obligations of parliamentary attendance were even of benefit to him
                    while he was engaged upon his <hi rend="italic">History.</hi> In the sessions of
                    1846-47 he spoke only five times, and at the general election of July 1847 he
                    lost his seat for Edinburgh upon issues which did not reflect credit upon that
                    constituency. Over and above any political disagreement with the constituency,
                    there was the fact that the balance of Macaulay’s faculties had now passed to
                    the side of literature. Lord Cockburn wrote in 1846, “the truth is, Macaulay,
                    with all his knowledge, talent, eloquence, and worth, is not popular. He cares
                    more for his <hi rend="italic">History</hi> than for the jobs of constituents,
                    and answers letters irregularly and with a brevity deemed contemptuous.” At an
                    earlier date he had relished crowds and the excitement of ever new faces; as
                    years went forward and absorption in the work of composition took off the edge
                    of his spirits, he recoiled from publicity. He began to regard the prospect of
                    business as worry, and had no longer the nerve to brace himself to the social
                    efforts required of one who represents a large constituency.</p>
                <p>Macaulay retired into private life, not only without regret, but with a sense of
                    relief. He gradually withdrew from general society, feeling the bore of big
                    dinners, and countryhouse visits, but he still enjoyed close and constant
                    intercourse with a circle of the most eminent men that London then contained. At
                    that time social breakfasts were in vogue. Macaulay himself preferred this to
                    any other form of entertainment. Of these brilliant reunions nothing has been
                    preserved beyond the names of the men who formed them,—Rogers, Hallam, Sydney
                    Smith, Lord Carlisle, Lord Stanhope, Nassau Senior, Charles Greville, Milman,
                    Panizzi, Lewis, Van de Weyer. His biographer thus describes Macaulay’s
                    appearance and bearing in conversation: “Sitting bolt upright, his hands resting
                    on the arms of his chair, or folded over the handle of his walking-stick,
                    knitting his eyebrows if the subject was one which had to be thought out as he
                    went along, or brightening from the forehead downwards when a burst of humour
                    was coming, his massive features and honest glance suited well with the manly
                    sagacious sentiments which he set forth in his sonorous voice and in his racy
                    and intelligible language. To get at his meaning people had never the need to
                    think twice, and they certainly had seldom the time.”</p>
                <p>But, great as was his enjoyment of literary society and books, they only formed
                    his recreation. In these years he was working with unflagging industry at the
                    composition of his <hi rend="italic">History.</hi> His composition was slow, his
                    corrections both of matter and style endless; he spared no research to ascertain
                    the facts. He sacrificed to the prosecution of his task a political career,
                    House of Commons fame, the allurements of society. The first two volumes of the
                    <hi rend="italic">History of England</hi> appeared in December 1848. The success
                    was in every way complete beyond expectation. The sale of edition after edition,
                    both in England and the United States, was enormous.</p>
                <p>In 1852, when his party returned to office, he refused a seat in the cabinet, but
                    he could not bring himself to decline accepting the compliment of a voluntary
                    amende which the city of Edinburgh paid him in returning him at the head of the
                    poll at the general election in July of that year. He had hardly accepted the
                    summons to return to parliamentary life before he was struck down by the malady
                    which in the end proved fatal. This first betrayed itself in deranged action of
                    the heart; from this time forward till his death his strength continued steadily
                    to sink. The process carried with it dejection of spirits as its inevitable
                    attendant. The thought oppressed him that the great work to which he had devoted
                    himself would remain a fragment. Once again, in June 1853, he spoke in
                    parliament, and with effect, against the exclusion of the Master of the Rolls
                    from the House of Commons, and at a later date in defence of competition for the
                    Indian civil service. But he was aware that it was a grievous waste of his small
                    stock of force, and that he made these efforts at the cost of more valuable
                    work.</p>
                <p>In November 1855 vols. iii. and iv. of the <hi rend="italic">History</hi>
                    appeared. No work, not being one of amusement, has in our day reached a
                    circulation so vast. During the nine years ending with the 25th June 1857 the
                    publishers (Longmans) sent out more than 30,000 copies of vol. i.; in the next
                    nine years more than 50,000 copies of the same volume; and in the nine years
                    ending with June 1875 more than 52,000 copies. Within a generation of its first
                    appearance upwards of 140,000 copies of the <hi rend="italic">History</hi> will
                    have been printed and sold in the United Kingdom alone. In the United States no
                    book except the Bible ever had such a sale. On the Continent of Europe, the sale
                    of Tauchnitz editions was very large, a sale which did not prevent six rival
                    translations in German. The <hi rend="italic">History</hi> has been published in
                    the Polish, Danish, Swedish, Hungarian, Russian, Bohemian, Italian, French,
                    Dutch, Spanish languages. Flattering marks of respect were heaped upon the
                    author by the foreign Academies. His pecuniary profits were on a scale
                    commensurate with the reputation of the book: the cheque for £20,000 has become
                    a landmark in literary history.</p>
                <p>In May 1856 he quitted the Albany, in which he had passed fifteen happy years,
                    and went to live at Holly Lodge, then, before it was enlarged, a tiny bachelor’s
                    dwelling, but with a lawn whose unbroken slope of verdure gave it the air of a
                    considerable country house. In the following year (1857) he was raised to the
                    peerage by the title of Baron Macaulay of Rothley. “It was,” says Lady
                    Trevelyan, “one of the few things that everybody approved; he enjoyed it
                    himself, as he did everything, simply and cordially.” It was a novelty in
                    English life to see eminence which was neither that of territorial opulence nor
                    of political or military<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n144/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0144-0129"/> services recognized and rewarded by elevation to
                    the peerage.</p>
                <p>The distinction came just not too late. Macaulay’s health, which had begun to
                    give way in 1852, was every year visibly failing; in May 1858 he went to
                    Cambridge for the purpose of being sworn in as high steward of the borough, to
                    which office he had been elected on the death of Earl Fitzwilliam. When his
                    health was given at a public breakfast in the town-hall, he was obliged to
                    excuse himself from speaking on the ground of inability. His nephew, who was in
                    attendance upon him on the occasion, records that “it was already apparent that
                    a journey across Clare Bridge and along the edge of the great lawn at King’s,
                    performed at the rate of ⅜ mile in the hour, was an exertion too severe for his
                    feeble frame.” In the Upper House he never spoke. Absorbed in the prosecution of
                    his historical work, he had grown indifferent to the party politics of his own
                    day. Gradually he had to acquiesce in the conviction that, though his
                    intellectual powers remained to him unimpaired, his physical energies would not
                    carry him through the reign of Anne; and, though he brought down the narrative
                    to the death of William III., the last half volume wants the finish and
                    completeness of the earlier portions.</p>
                <p>The winter of 1859 was very severe, and hastened the end. He died on 28th
                    December, and on 9th January 1860 was buried in Westminster Abbey, in Poet’s
                    Corner, near the statue of Addison.</p>
                <p>Lord Macaulay was never married. A man of warm domestic affections, he found
                    their satisfaction in the attachment and close sympathy of his sister Hannah,
                    the wife of Sir Charles Trevelyan. Her children were to him as his own. Macaulay
                    was a steadfast friend, and a generous enemy. No act inconsistent with the
                    strictest honour and integrity has ever been imputed to him. When a poor man,
                    and when salary was of consequence to him, he twice resigned office rather than
                    make compliances for making which he would not have been severely blamed. In
                    1847, when his seat in parliament was at stake, he would not be persuaded to
                    humour, to temporize, even to conciliate. He took a lofty tone, and haughtily
                    rebuked the Edinburgh constituency for their bigotry. He had a keen relish for
                    the good things of life, and desired fortune as the means of obtaining them; but
                    there was nothing mercenary or selfish in his nature. When he had raised himself
                    to opulence, he gave away with an open hand, not seldom rashly. His very last
                    act was to write a letter to a poor curate, enclosing a cheque for X25. The
                    purity of his morals was not associated, as it not unfrequently is, with a
                    tendency to cant, or parade of religious phrases.</p>
                <p>The lives of men of letters are often records of sorrow or suffering. The life of
                    Macaulay was eminently happy. Till the closing years 1857-59, when his malady
                    had begun to tell upon his strength, he enjoyed life with the full zest of
                    healthy faculty, happy in social intercourse, happy in the solitude of his
                    study, and equally divided between the two. For the last fifteen years of his
                    life he lived for literature, as none of our eminent men since Gibbon have done.
                    His writings were remunerative to him far beyond the ordinary measure, yet he
                    never wrote as the professional author writes. He lived in his historical
                    researches; his whole heart and interest were unreservedly given to the men and
                    the times of whom he read and wrote. His command of literature was imperial.
                    Beginning with a good classical foundation, he made himself familiar with the
                    imaginative, and then with the historical, remains of Greece and Rome. He went
                    on to add the literature of his own country, of France, of Italy, of Spain. He
                    learnt Dutch enough for the purposes of his history. He read German, but for the
                    literature of the northern nations he had no taste, and of the erudite labours
                    of the Germans he had little knowledge and formed an inadequate estimate. The
                    range of his survey of human things had other limitations more considerable
                    still. All philosophical speculation was alien to his mind; nor does he seem
                    aware of the degree in which such speculation has influenced the progress of
                    humanity. A large —the largest—part of ecclesiastical history lay outside his
                    historical view. Of art he confessed himself ignorant, and even refused a
                    request which had been made him to furnish a critique on Swift’s poetry to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review.</hi> Lessing’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Laocoon,</hi> or Goethe’s criticism on Hamlet, “filled” him “with wonder and
                    despair.”</p>
                <p>Of the marvellous discoveries of science which were succeeding each other day by
                    day he took no note; his pages contain no reference to them. It has been told
                    already how he recoiled from the mathematical studies of his university. These
                    deductions made, the circuit of his knowledge still remains very wide,—as
                    extensive perhaps as any human brain is competent to embrace. His literary
                    outfit was as complete as has ever been possessed by any English writer; and, if
                    it wants the illumination of philosophy, it has an equivalent resource in a
                    practical acquaintance with affairs, with administration, with the interior of
                    cabinets, and the humour of popular assemblies. Nor was the knowledge merely
                    stored in his memory; it .was always at his command. Whatever his subject, he
                    pours over it his stream of illustration, drawn from the records of all ages and
                    countries. ‘ ‘ Figures from history, ancient and modern, sacred and secular;
                    characters from plays and novels, from Plautus down to Walter Scott and Jane
                    Austen; images and similes from poets of every age and every nation; shrewd
                    thrusts from satirists, wise saws from sages, pleasantries caustic or pathetic
                    from humorists,—all these fill Macaulay’s pages with the bustle and variety of
                    some glittering masque and cosmoramic revel of great books and heroical men. His
                    style is before all else the style of great literary knowledge.” His <hi
                    rend="italic">Essays</hi> are not merely instructive as history; they are, like
                    Milton’s blank verse, freighted with the spoils of all the ages. They are
                    literature as well as history. In their diversified contents the <hi
                    rend="italic">Essays</hi> are a library by themselves; for those who, having
                    little time for study, want one book which may be a substitute for many, we
                    should recommend the <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> in preference to anything
                    else.</p>
                <p>As an historian Macaulay has not escaped the charge of partisanship. He was a
                    Whig; an⅛ in writing the history of the rise and triumph of Whig principles in
                    the latter half of the 17th century he identified himself with the cause. But
                    the charge of partiality, as urged against Macaulay, means more than that he
                    wrote the history of the Whig revolution from the point of view of those who
                    made it. When he is describing the merits of friends and the faults of enemies,
                    his pen knows no moderation. He has a constant tendency to glaring colours, to
                    strong effects, and will always be striking violent blows. He is not merely
                    exuberant, but excessive. There is an overweening confidence about his tone; he
                    expresses himself in trenchant phrases, which are like challenges to an opponent
                    to stand up and deny them. His propositions have no qualifications. Uninstructed
                    readers like this assurance, as they like a physician who has no doubt about
                    their case. But a sense of distrust grows upon the more circumspect reader as he
                    follows page after page of Macaulay’s categorical affirmations about matters
                    which our own experience of life teaches us to be of a contingent nature. We
                    inevitably think of a saying attributed to Lord Melbourne, “I wish I were as
                    cock-sure of any one thing as Macaulay is of everything.” Macaulay’s was the
                    mind of the advocate, not of the philosopher; it was the mind of Bossuet, which
                    admits no doubts or reserves itself and tolerates none in others, and as such
                    was disqualified from that equitable balancing of evidence which is the primary
                    function of the historian. It was a fortunate circumstance that rhetoric so
                    powerful was enlisted in the constitutional cause,—that Macaulay was, as he
                    himself has said of Bishop Burnet, “a strong party man on the right side.”</p>
                <p>Macaulay, the historian no less than the politician, is always on the side of
                    justice, fairness for the weak against the strong, the oppressed against the
                    oppressor. But though a Liberal in practical politics, he had not the reformer’s
                    temperament. The world as it is was good enough for him. The glories of wealth,
                    rank, honours, literary fame, the elements of a vulgar happiness, made up his
                    ideal of life. A successful man himself, every personage and every cause is
                    judged by its success. “The brilliant Macaulay,” says Emerson, ‘ ‘ who expresses
                    the tone of the English governing classes of the day, explicitly teaches that ‘
                    good ’ means good to eat, good to wear, material commodity.” Macaulay is in
                    accord with the average sentiment of orthodox and stereotyped humanity on the
                    relative values of the objects and motives of human endeavour. And this
                    commonplace materialism is one of the secrets of his popularity, and one of the
                    qualities which guarantee that that popularity will be enduring.</p>
                <p>Macaulay’s whole works have been collected by his sister, Lady Charles Trevelyan,
                    in eight volumes. The first four volumes are occupied by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >History·,</hi> the next three contain the <hi rend="italic">Essays,</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Lives</hi> which he contributed to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopaedia Britannica.</hi> In vol. viii. are collected his <hi
                    rend="italic">Speeches,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Lays of Ancient Rome,</hi>
                    and some miscellaneous pieces. His life has been written by his nephew, George
                    Otto Trevelyan (2 vols., London, 1878), and is one of the best biographies in
                    the language. His diary remains in MS. in the hands of his family. It is to be
                    hoped that measures will be taken to secure this valuable record from the fate
                    that has overtaken so many private diaries, and thus impoverished the sources of
                    English history. (Μ. P.) <pb break="no"
