                    July 1789. On account of his early interest in art he was apprenticed by his
                    father to a coachbuilder to learn heraldic painting, but owing to a quarrel the
                    indentures were cancelled, and he was placed under Bonifacio Musso, an Italian
                    artist, father of the well-known enamel painter Charles Musso. With his master
                    Martin removed to London in 1806, where he married at the age of nineteen, and
                    led a struggling life, supporting himself by giving drawing lessons, and by

                    leisure was occupied in the study of perspective and architecture. His first
                    picture, Sadak in Search of the Waters of Oblivion, was executed in a month. It
                    was exhibited in the Royal Academy of 1812, and sold for fifty guineas. It was
                    followed by the Expulsion (1813), Paradise (1813), Clytie (1814), and Joshua
                    (1815). In 1821 appeared the famous Belshazzar’s Feast, which excited much
                    favourable and hostile comment, and was awarded a prize of £200 at the British
                    Institution, where the Joshua had previously carried off a premium of £100. Then
                    came the Destruction of Herculaneum (1822), the Creation (1824), the Eve of the
                    Deluge (1841), and a long series of other Biblical and imaginative subjects,
                    many of which are widely known through engravings. In 1832-33 Martin received
                    £2000 for drawing and engraving a fine series of designs to Milton, and along
                    with Westall he produced a set of Bible illustrations. He was also much occupied
                    with schemes for the improvement of London, and published various pamphlets and
                    plans dealing with the metropolitan water supply, sewage, dock, and railway
                    systems. During the last four years of his life he was engaged upon his large
                    subjects of the Judgment, the Day of Wrath, and the Plains of Heaven. He was
                    attacked with paralysis while painting, and died in the Isle of Man on the 17th
                    of February 1854.</p>
                <p>The bold originality of Martin’s productions startled and attracted the public,
                    but they are without the qualities of solid execution and truth to nature upon
                    which a lasting fame in the arts must be built. His figures are badly drawn, his
                    colouring is hot and unpleasant. To most of his professional brethren his works
                    seemed theatrical and tricky; and the best lay critics of his time, like Charles
                    Lamb, were disposed to deny that they evinced true imaginative power. His
                    popularity may be said to have culminated in 1828, the year of his Fall of
                    Nineveh; since then it has been gradually declining.</p>
