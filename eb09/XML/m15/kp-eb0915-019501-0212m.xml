                    where the Romans erected a military post on the road between Bagacum (Bavay)and
                    Colonia Agrippina (Cologne). Aix-la-Chapelle is 18 miles east-south-east, and
                    Liége 18 miles south by west. The baths discovered in 1840 io the Groote
                    Stokstraat show that the settlement at Trajectum ad Mosam became a place of some
                    considerable importance. The town is divided by the river into two parts—the
                    larger portion, or Maestricht proper, on the left bank, and the smaller portion,
                    distinguished as Wijk, on the right. A stone bridge of eight arches connecting
                    the two took the place of a wooden structure as early as 1280, and was greatly
                    improved in 1828 and 1836. Formerly a fortress, Maestricht is still a
                    considerable garrison town, but its ramparts were dismantled 1871—78; formerly
                    the seat of a bishop, it still bears a strongly Roman Catholic impress; and, in
                    modern times more especially, it has developed into a great centre of commerce
                    and industry. The churches and religious foundations are almost the only
                    buildings of note, the chief exceptions being the town-house, completed in 1683,
                    and the solitary Protestant church, Janskerk (13th century). The church of St
                    Servatius was, according to one account, rebuilt and enlarged as early as the
                    time of Charles the Great. It is now 260 feet in length, and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0213-0196"/> in the varied character of its Gothic
                    architecture bears evidence of the frequency with which it has been restored and
                    altered. The high altar has a Descent from the Cross by Anthony Vandyck. The
                    saint whose name it preserves obtained great reputation in Maestricht by
                    transferring his bishopric thither from Tongres, and his miracle-working relics
                    became the occasion of a great septennial fair which was formerly of great
                    service to the city. The Church of Our Lady (Lieve-Vrouwe-kerk), possibly
                    founded in the 6th century, has two very ancient crypts and an 11th century
                    choir of exceptional beauty, but in the nave has suffered severely from a
                    restoration in 1764. St Matthyskerk was founded by the cloth-weavers’ guild in
                    the 13th century; and, though the present Gothic building of St Martin’s (in
                    Wijk) was erected so late as 1859, the original church was one of the oldest in
                    the city, and is said by tradition to have occupied the site of one of the old
                    heathen temples. The twelve hospitals, the poorhouse, the orphanage, and most of
                    the other charitable foundations are Roman Catholic institutions, and neither
                    the administrative bodies nor the educational establishments are free from
                    ecclesiastical influence. Though Maestricht is no doubt mainly indebted for its
                    commercial prosperity to its position on the river, it did not begin to reap the
                    full advantages of the situation till the removal of the fortifications and the
                    opening of the railways (Aix-la-Chapelle, 1853; Hasselt, 1856; Liège, 1861;
                    Vanlo, 1865, &amp;c.). At first a trade was carried on in wine, colonial wares,
                    alcoholic liquors, and salt; but now, besides Regout’s well-known earthenware,
                    glass, and crystal factory, there are establishments for the making of arms,
                    tools, lead, copper, and zinc work, &amp;c., as well as tobacco and cigar
                    factories. The Maestricht beer also is highly esteemed. The population, which
                    was 18,000 in the beginning of the century, was 28,917 on January 1, 1882.</p>
                <p>Maestrichtwas taken and plundered by the Normans(881 and 884), by Bishop Henry of
                    Guelders (1267), by Adolph de la Marek (1334), and by the people of Liège (1407
                    and 1408). In the war with Spain it was successively besieged by the Spaniards,
                    the prince of Orange, Prince Maurice, and Frederick Henry (1579, 1580, 1594,
                    1632); and in the struggle between Louis XIV. of France and William III., and
                    again during the French Revolution and the Napoleonic period, it paid the
                    penalty of its frontier position—witness the sieges of 1673, 1676, 1701, and
                    1793. During the revolution of 1830 it was invested by the Belgians. Among the
                    more peaceful memories of the place is the marriage of Otto IV. with Mary of
                    Brabant. The people of Maestricht have a special dialect of their own; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> but French and Dutch are in use among the upper
                    classes. In the neighbourhood of the town are the great sandstone quarries of
                    Petersberg, one of the most extraordinary labyrinths of subterranean excavation
                    in the world.</p>
