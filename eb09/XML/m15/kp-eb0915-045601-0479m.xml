                    rend="italic">Sirenia,</hi> for the general characters and position of which see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> (p. 389). The name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Manati</hi> was apparently first applied to it by the early Spanish colonists
                    of the West Indies, in allusion to the hand-like use which it frequently makes
                    of its fore limbs; by English writers from the time of Dampier (who gives a good
                    account of its habits) downwards it has been generally spelt “Manatee.” It was
                    placed by Linnseus in his heterogeneous genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Triclιechus,</hi> but Storr’s name <hi rend="italic">Manatus</hi> is now
                    generally accepted for it by zoologists. The question of the specific
                    distinction of the African and American Manatees will be treated of further on,
                    but it will be chiefly to the latter and better known form that the following
                    description applies.</p>
                <p>The size of the Manatee has been much exaggerated, as there is no trustworthy
                    evidence of its attaining a greater length than 8 or perhaps 9 feet. Its general
                    external form may be seen in the figure at p. 390 of the present volume, taken
                    from a living example in the Brighton Aquarium. The body is somewhat fish-like,
                    but depressed and ending posteriorly in a broad flat shovel-like horizontal
                    tail, with rounded edges. The head is of moderate size, oblong, with a blunt,
                    truncated muzzle, and divided from the body by a very slight constriction or
                    neck. The fore limbs are flattened oval paddles, placed rather low on the sides
                    of the body, and showing externally no signs of division into fingers, but with
                    a tolerably free motion at the shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints, and with three
                    diminutive flat nails near their extremities. No traces of hind limbs are
                    discernible either externally oι internally; and there is no dorsal fin. The
                    mouth is very peculiar, the tumid upper lip being cleft in the middle line into
                    two lobes, each of which is separately movable, as will be described in speaking
                    of its manner of feeding. The nostrils are two semilunar valve-like slits, at
                    the apex of the muzzle. The eyes are very minute, placed at the sides of the
                    head, and with a nearly circular aperture with wrinkled margins. The external
                    ear is a minute orifice situated behind the eye, without any trace of pinna. The
                    skin generally is of a dark greyish colour, not smooth or glistening, like that
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> but finely wrinkled. At a little distance
                    it appears naked, but a close inspection, at all events in young animals, shows
                    a scanty covering of very delicate hairs, and both upper and under lips are well
                    supplied with short, stiff bristles.</p>
                <p>The skeleton is remarkable for the massiveness and extreme density of most of the
                    bones of which it is composed, especially the skull and ribs, The cervical
                    region of the vertebral column is short, and presents the great peculiarity of
                    containing only six bones instead of seven, the number usual in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mammalia, —</hi> the only other case being that of one species of
                    Sloth <hi rend="italic">(Choloepus hoffimanni).</hi> Another great peculiarity
                    (which, however, seems to be characteristic of all the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sirenia)</hi> is that the flat ends of the bodies of the vertebrae do not
                    ossify separately, so as to form disk-like epiphyses in the young state. None of
                    the vertebrae are united together to form a sacrum, the rudimentary pelvic bones
                    having no direct connexion with the vertebral column. The number of rib-bearing
                    vertebrae appears to vary in different individuals from fifteen to eighteen, and
                    those of the lumbar and caudal region from twenty-five to twenty-nine. The skull
                    (fig. 2) is exceedingly different from that of any of the Whales or Dolphins
                    (order <hi rend="italic">Cetacea),</hi> with which the Manatee was formerly
                    supposed to be allied. The cerebral cavity is rather small as compared with the
                    size of the animal, and of oblong form; its roof is formed of the parietal bones
                    as in ordinary mammals. The squamosal has an extremely large and massive
                    zygomatic process, which joins the largely developed malar bone in front. The
                    orbit is small, but prominent and nearly surrounded by bone. The anterior nares
                    taken together form a lozenge-shaped aperture, which looks upwards and extends
                    backwards considerably behind the orbits. Their sides are formed by the
                    ascending processes of the premaxillae below, and by the supraorbital processes
                    of the frontale above, no traces of nasals being found in most skulls, though
                    these bones are occasionally present in a most rudimentary condition, attached
                    to the edges of the frontale, far away from the middle line, a position quite
                    unique among the mammalia. In front of the narial aperture the face is prolonged
                    into a narrow rostrum, formed by the premaxillae, supported below and at the
                    sides by the maxillae. The under surface of this is very rugous, and in life
                    covered by a horny plate. The rami of the mandible are firmly united together at
                    the -symphysis, which is compressed laterally, deflected, and has a rugous upper
                    surface; to this another horny plate is attached, which with that of the upper
                    jaw functionally supplies the place of teeth in the anterior part of the mouth.
                    In the young state there are rudimentary teeth concealed beneath these horny
                    plates, which never penetrate through them, and must therefore be quite <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n480/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0480-0457"/> functionless, and altogether disappear before the
                    animal is full-grown. There is besides, on each side of the hinder part of both
                    upper and lower jaws, a parallel row of molar teeth, similar in characters from
                    the beginning to the end of the series, with square enamelled crowns raised into
                    tuberculated transverse ridges, something like those of the Tapir and Kangaroo.
                    The upper teeth have two ridges and three roots; the lower teeth have an
                    additional posterior small ridge or talon, and but two roots. These teeth
                    succeed each other from before backwards, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proboscidea,</hi> those at the front of the mouth being worn out and shed
                    before those at the back are fully developed. There are altogether about eleven
                    on each side of each jaw, but rarely more than six are present at one time. The
                    brain is remarkably simple in structure, its hemispheres exhibiting none of the
                    richness of convolution so characteristic of the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea.</hi>
                    The stomach is compound, being divided by a valvular constriction into two
                    principal cavities, the first of which is provided with a singular glandular
                    pouch near the cardiac end, and the second with a pair of elongated, conical
                    caecal sacs or diverticula, the use of which is by no means obvious. The caecum
                    is bifid. The kidneys are simple. The heart is broad and flat, with the apex
                    deeply cleft between the ventricles. The principal blood-vessels form very
                    extensive and complex <hi rend="italic">retia mirabilia.</hi> The lungs are
                    remarkably long and narrow, as owing to the very oblique position of the
                    diaphragm the thoracic cavity extends very far back over the abdomen. The
                    mammary glands of the female are two in number, situated just behind and to the
                    inner side of the origin of the pectoral limb. The red corpuscles of the blood
                    are among the largest of those of any members of the class, averaging in
                    diameter, according, to Gulliver, - <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>- <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> ∙ of an inch.</p>
                <p>Manatees pass the whole of their life in the water, inhabiting bays, lagoons,
                    estuaries, and large rivers, but the open sea, so congenial to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> is quite unsuited to their peculiar mode of life. As
                    a general rule they prefer shallow water, in which, when not feeding, they lie
                    near the bottom, supporting themselves on the extremity of the tail, or slowly
                    moving about by the assistance of the fore limbs, the tips of which are just
                    allowed to touch the ground, and only raising the top of the head above the
                    surface for the purpose of breathing at intervals of two or three minutes. In
                    deeper water they often float, with the body much arched, the rounded back close
                    to the surface, and the head, limbs, and tail hanging downwards. The air in the
                    lungs obviously assists them to maintain this position, acting in the same
                    manner as that in the air-sac of fishes. Their food consists exclusively of
                    aquatic plants, on which they browse beneath the water much as terrestrial
                    Ungulates do on the green pastures on shore. They are extremely slow and
                    inactive in their movements, and perfectly harmless and inoffensive, but are
                    subject to a constant persecution from the inhabitants of the countries in which
                    they dwell for the sake of their oil, skin, and flesh. Frequent attempts have of
                    late been made to keep specimens alive in captivity, and sometimes with
                    considerable success, one having lived in the Brighton Aquarium for upwards of
                    sixteen months. It was fed chiefly on lettuce and endives, but would also eat
                    leaves of the dandelion, sow-thistle, cabbage, turnip, and carrot. From this and
                    other captive specimens some interesting observations upon the mode of life of
                    the animal have been made. One of these is the free use it makes of its
                    forelimbs. From the shoulder-joint they can be moved in all directions, and the
                    elbow and wrist permit of free extension and flexion. In feeding they push the
                    food towards their mouths by means of one of the hands, or both used
                    simultaneously, and any one who has seen these members thus employed can readily
                    believe the stories of their carrying their young about under their arms. Still
                    more interesting and quite unique among Mammals is the action of the peculiar
                    lateral pads formed by the divided upper lip, thus described by Professor
                    Garrod:—“These pads have the power of transversely approaching towards and
                    receding from one another simultaneously (see fig. 1, A and B). When the animal
                    is on the point of seizing (say) a leaf of lettuce, the pads are diverged
                    transversely in such a way as to make a median gap of considerable breadth.
                    Directly the leaf is within grasp the lip-pads are approximated, the leaf is
                    firmly seized between their contiguous bristly surfaces, and then drawn inwards
                    by a backward movement of the lower margin of the lip as a whole.” The animal is
                    thus enabled by the unaided means of the upper lip to introduce food placed
                    before it without the assistance of the comparatively insignificant lower lip,
                    the action greatly recalling to the observer that of the mouth of the silkworm
                    and other caterpillars in which the mandibles diverge and converge laterally
                    during mastication. When out of water the Manatee is an extremely helpless
                    animal; and, although statements are frequently met with in books of its
                    voluntarily leaving the water for the purpose of basking or feeding on shore,
                    all trustworthy observations of those acquainted with it, either in a state of
                    nature or in captivity, indicate that it has not the power of doing so. None of
                    the specimens in confinement have been observed to emit any sound.</p>
                <p>Manatees, though much less numerous than formerly, are still occasionally found
                    in creeks, lagoons, and estuaries in some of the West India Islands, and at
                    various spots on the Atlantic coast of America from Florida as far south as
                    about 20° S. lat., and in the great rivers of Brazil, almost as high as their
                    sources. They are also met with in similar situations on the opposite African
                    coast, from about 16° N. to 10° S. lat., and as far into the interior as Lake
                    Tchad. Its range may even extend, if native reports obtained by Schweinfurth are
                    correctly interpreted, to the river Keebaly, 27° E. long.</p>
                <p>The American Manatee (J∕. <hi rend="italic">australis,</hi> Tilesius) was thought
                    by Dr Harlan to be divisible into two species, one inhabiting Brazil and the
                    other the West Indies and Florida. To the northern form he gave the name of 3/.
                    <hi rend="italic">latirostris,</hi> but the distinction is not now generally
                    recognized. On better grounds the African Manatee was separated by Desmarest,
                    under the name of <hi rend="italic">Μ. senegalensis,</hi> and there are
                    certainly constant although not very important cranial characters by which it
                    can be distinguished from its American congener, among which the following may
                    be cited :—the anterior part of the rostrum is shorter, shallower, and
                    altogether smaller; the orbit is smaller; the zygomatic process is more deep and
                    massive; the malar bone is deeper from above downwards; the upper margin of the
                    anterior nares is narrower and with a smooth and rounded instead of a thin and
                    serrated edge; the upper surface of the frontal is flat, instead of concave; the
                    foramen magnum and occipital condyles are narrower from side to side, and the
                    symphysis of the mandible smaller and shallower.</p>
