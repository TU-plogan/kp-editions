                    which belonged to the pope. His quickness was soon observed by the priests of
                    Avignon, where he was educated and took orders, and he determined to get what he
                    could by it. He tried his fortune by writing <hi rend="italic">éloges</hi> of
                    famous persons, then a favourite practice; and in 1771 his <hi rend="italic"
                    >éloge</hi> on Fénelon was pronounced next best to Laharpe’s by the Academy. The
                    real foundation of his fortunes was the success of a sermon he preached on St
                    Louis before the Academy in 1772, which caused him to be recommended to the king
                    for an abbacy on the spot. In 1772 he published his <hi rend="italic">Essai sur
                    l'éloquence de la chaire,</hi> which, as well as his <hi rend="italic">Principes
                    d'éloquence,</hi> contains much good criticism, and remains a French classic. He
                    became a favourite preacher in Paris, and was Lent preacher at court in 1781,
                    when King Louis XVI. said of his sermon, “If the abbé had only said a few words
                    on religion he would have discussed every possible subject.” In 1781 he obtained
                    the rich abbey of Lions, worth 20,000 livres a year, and in 1785 he was elected
                    to the Academy. His morals were as loose as those of his great rival Mirabeau,
                    but he was famed in Paris for his wit and gaiety as well as for his eloquence
                    and his immorality. In 1789 he was elected a member of the states-general by the
                    clergy of Péronne, and from the first proved to be the most able and persevering
                    defender of the <hi rend="italic">ancien régime.</hi> It is said that he
                    attempted to emigrate both in July and in October 1789; but, whether he did or
                    not, he after that time held firmly to his place, when almost universally
                    deserted by his friends. His life was often in danger among the people, but his
                    ready wit always saved it, and it was said that one <hi rend="italic">bon
                    mot</hi> would preserve him for a month. At last, in 1792, he found it necessary
                    to fly from Paris; the Revolution had gone too far. When he did emigrate he
                    found himself regarded as a kind of martyr to the church and the king, and was
                    at once named cardinal, archbishop <hi rend="italic">in partibus,</hi> and extra
                    nuncio to the diet at Frankfort. He was finally made bishop of Montefiascone,
                    and settled down in that little Italian town,—but not for long, for in 1796 the
                    French drove him from his retreat, and he became ambassador, but with hardly any
                    pay, of the exiled king Louis XVIII. to the pope. Such a life soon wearied a man
                    who had been accustomed to wealth and reputation, and in 1804 he began to
                    prepare his return to France by a well-turned letter to Napoleon, congratulating
                    him on restoring religion to France once more. In 1806 he did return; in 1807 he
                    was again received into the Academy; and in 1810, on the refusal of Cardinal
                    Fesch, was made archbishop of Paris. On the restoration of the Bourbons he was
                    summarily turned out of the Academy, and sent to Rome to answer for his
                    disobedience to the pope. There he was imprisoned in the castle of St Angelo for
                    six months, and died in 1817, a year or two after his release, of disease
                    contracted in prison, and of chagrin.</p>
                <p>There are two sides to Maury’s character to be discussed. As a critic he was a
                    very able writer, and Sainte-Beuve gives him the credit of discovering Bridaine,
                    and giving Bossuet his rightful place as a preacher above Massillon; as a
                    politician, his wit and eloquence make him a worthy rival of Mirabeau, and an
                    interesting character in the early years of the Revolution. If in later years he
                    forsook his old tenets, and joined Napoleon, his punishment was terribly severe,
                    and it would have been a graceful act if Louis XVIII. had remembered the
                    courageous supporter of Louis XVI., and the pope the one intrepid defender of
                    the church in the states-general.</p>
