                <p>STRICTLY speaking, the derivation of this word should have prevented the use of
                    it as the designation of a pure science. It has been, however, employed for a
                    long period in English speech in the identical sense that the French attach to
                    <hi rend="italic">Mécanique</hi><hi rend="italic">pure</hi> or the Germans to
                    <hi rend="italic">Reine</hi><hi rend="italic">Mechanik.</hi> These terms are all
                    employed to denote what we should much prefer to call <hi rend="italic">Abstract
                    Dynamics,—</hi> the pure science which (as the derivation implies) treats of the
                    action of Force upon Matter, but which is, correctly, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Science of Matter and Motion,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">of Matter and
                    Energy.</hi></p>
                <p>With the view of making clear from the outset the reason for the arrangement
                    adopted in this article, we commence by stating in Newton’s own words
                    (accompanied by a paraphrase) the <hi rend="italic">Axiomata, sive</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Leges</hi><hi rend="italic">Motus,</hi> which form the entire
                    basis of our subject. These laws will at once indicate the order in which the
                    subject may most logically be treated. We defer to the end of the article the
                    more close consideration of the idea introduced by the word “force,” as well as
                    general remarks on “energy,” &lt;fcc. For the present we are content to regard
                    force as defined for us by Newton’s Laws.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Newton’s Laws of Motion.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 1. Lex I. Corpus omne perseverare in statu suo quiescendi vel movendi
                    uniformiter in directum, nisi quatenus illud a viribus impressis cogitur statum

                    or of uniform motion in a straight line, except in so far as it is compelled by
                    force to change that state.</hi></p>
                <p>Lex· II. Mutationem motus proportionalem esse vi motrici impressae, et fieri
                    secundum lineam rectam qua vis illa imprimitur.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Change</hi><hi rend="italic">of {quantity of) motion is
                    proportional to force, and takes place in the straight line in which the force
                    acts.</hi></p>
                <p>Lex III. Actioni contrariam semper et aequalem esse reactionem; sive corporum
                    duorum actiones in se mutuo tsemper esse aequales et in partes contrarias

                <p><hi rend="italic">To every action there is always an equal and contrary reaction;
                    or the mutual actions of any two bodies are always equal and oppositely
                    directed.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 2. In 1863 Thomson and Tait (upon whose <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Natural
                    Philosophy</hi> much of what follows is based) called attention to the fact
                    that, as regards Lex III., Newton gives in a scholium a second sense in which
                    the words may be interpreted. In the first sense the action and reaction are
                    mere forces, in the second they are <hi rend="italic">the rates at which forces
                    do work.</hi> Hence, and for another reason which will appear later, the word
                    “activity” has been introduced as the English equivalent of the word <hi
                    rend="italic">actio</hi> in Newton’s second sense. Here is the passage :—</p>
                <p>Si aestimetur agentis actio ex ejus vi et velocitate con-junctim; et similiter
                    resistentis reactio aestimetur con-junctim ex ejus partium singularum
                    velocitatibus et viribus resistendi ab earum attritione, cohaesione, pondere, et
                    acceleratione oriundis; erunt actio et reactio, in omni instrumentorum usu, sibi
                    invicem semper aequales.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">If the activity of an agent be measured by its amount and its
                    velocity conjointly; and if, similarly, the counter-activity of the resistance
                    be measured by the velocities of its several parts and their several amounts
                    conjointly, ιvhether these arise from friction, molecular forces, ιveight, or
                    acceleration; .—activity and counter-activity, in all combinations of machines,
                    will be equal and</hi><hi rend="italic">opposite.</hi></p>
                <p>This may be looked upon as a Fourth Law. But, in strict logic, the First Law is
                    superfluous, because its consequences are all implied (by negation) in the
                    statement of the Second. (See § 8 below.) Hence there are, virtually, only three
                    laws, so far as Newton’s system is concerned.</p>
                <p>§ 3. These laws are to be considered as deductions from observation and
                    experiment, and in no sense as having an α <hi rend="italic">priori</hi>
                    foundation. Their proof, so far as rigorous proof is attainable in physical
                    matters, is commonly looked on as being furnished in the most conclusive form by
                    observational astronomy. The <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac,</hi> published
                    usually about four years in advance, contains the predicted places of the sun,
                    moon, and principal planets from day to day, in some cases from hour to hour,
                    throughout the year. The predictions are entirely based upon the laws of motion
                    (along with the law of gravitation), and could not possibly be accurate unless
                    these laws are true. So thoroughly satisfactory has hitherto been the
                    coincidence between prediction and observation that, when a deviation occurs, no
                    one dreams of a defect in the principles of the reasoning. On the contrary, such
                    deviations are utilized for the purpose of correcting our knowledge of the
                    “elements” of the orbits of the moon and planets, or our estimates of the masses
                    of these bodies; and, as in the brilliant investigations of Adams and Leverrier,
                    they sometimes enable us to discover the existence and even assign the position
                    of a planet never before seen.</p>
                <p>§ 4. It is not clear in what order, or by whom, these laws were first discovered.
                    Galileo was undoubtedly acquainted with the first two; and Huygens, Wren, Hooke,
                    and others were acquainted with the Third Law in some of its many applications.
                    But they were first systematized and, as we have seen, extended in a most
                    important manner by Newton. Though they were sadly disfigured in Britain during
                    the fifty years which elapsed after the revival of mathematics in the early part
                    of this century, they have of late been restored to the form in which Newton
                    gave them. This readoption of Newton’s simple but comprehensive system has of
                    itself aided in no small degree the recent rapid advance of science.</p>
                <p>One peculiarity of Newton’s language must be noticed here, though very briefly,
                    as we will return to the subject towards the end of the article. A force is said
                    to “compel” a change of state in a body; bodies are said mutually to “act” on
                    one another, &amp;c. Such language is, of course, in its literal acceptation, of
                    an anthropomorphic character; but, if one thinks of the habitual use even in
                    scientific books of such expressions as “the sun rises,” “the wind blows,”
                    &amp;c., it cannot be construed into an assertion that force has real objective
                    existence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Comments on the Lares of Motion.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 5. Law I. First of all this law tells us what happens to a piece of matter
                    which is left to itself, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> not acted on by forces. It
                    preserves its “state,” whether of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line.
                    This property (which, as we shall presently show, § 7, is considerably extended
                    by Newton himself) is commonly called the “inertia” of matter, in virtue of
                    which it is incapable of varying in any way its state of rest or motion. It may
                    be the sport of forces for any length of time, but so soon as they cease to act
                    it remains in the state in which it was left until they recommence their action
                    on it. Hence, whenever we find the state of a piece of matter changing, we
                    conclude that it is under the action of a force or forces. Thus, for the
                    present, we have the definition of “force” as part of this First Law :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Force is whatever changes the state of rest or uniform motion
                    of a body.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n708/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0708-0677"/>
                <p>When a body, originally at rest, begins to move, we conclude that force is acting
                    on it. And when a moving body is seen to change <hi rend="italic">either</hi>
                    the speed <hi rend="italic">or</hi> the direction of its motion, we conclude
                    that this is due to force.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The words we have italicized will be seen to have very important bearings on
                    certain old errors which even now crop up, and which have introduced one of the
                    most inappropriate and apparently ineradicable of terms (“centrifugal force”)
                    into the usual vocabulary of our subject.</p></note></p>
                <p>§ 6. But there is much more than this, even in the First Law. What is “rest”? The
                    answer must be that the term is relative. Absolute rest and absolute motion are
                    terms to which we find it impossible to assign a meaning. Maxwell has well said
                    (in his <hi rend="italic">Matter and Motion)’.—</hi></p>
                <p>“All our knowledge, both of time and place, is essentially relative. When a man
                    has acquired the habit of putting words together, without troubling himself to
                    form the thoughts which ought to correspond to them, it is easy for him to frame
                    an antithesis between this relative knowledge and a so-called absolute
                    knowledge, and to point out our ignorance of the absolute position of a point as
                    an instance of the limitation of our faculties. Any one, however, who will try
                    to imagine the state of a mind conscious of knowing the absolute position of a
                    point will ever after be content with our relative knowledge.”</p>
                <p>As will be seen later, the First Law gives us also a physical definition of
                    “time,” and physical modes of measuring it.</p>
                <p>§ 7. Newton’s own comment on this law is as follows :—</p>
                <p>Projectilia perseverant in motibus suis, nisi quatenus a resistentia aeris
                    retardantur, et vi gravitatis impelluntur deorsum. Trochus, cujus partes
                    cohaerendo perpetuo retrahunt sese a motibus rectilineis, non cessat rotari,
                    nisi quatenus ab aere retardatur. Majora autem planetarum et cometarum corpora
                    motus suos et progressivos et circulares, in spatiis minus resistentibus factos,
                    conservant diutius.</p>
                <p>It is particularly worthy of notice that we have here the undisturbed rotation of
                    a body about an axis introduced as another of those “states” in which it will
                    continue, in virtue of the First Law, until force acts to compel it to change
                    that state. Also it is to be noticed that Newton adduces a hoop, whose axis is
                    fixed in direction both in the body and in space, as an example of this new form
                    of state maintained in virtue of inertia. Later, it will be seen that the same
                    thing is true of a body free in space and rotating about the principal axis of
                    greatest or of least moment of inertia through its centre of mass.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is also, in a partial
                    sense, true of a free body of which two principal axes through the centre of
                    mass have equal moments of inertia. In that case, as we will show later, even
                    when couples act upon the body, provided they be in planes passing through the
                    third axis, the rate of rotation about that axis remains unaltered, <hi
                    rend="italic">though its direction in space changes.</hi> This is approximately
                    the case of the earth. The attractions of the sun and moon on the protuberant
                    parts about the equator produce “precession” and “nutation,” but do not
                    influence the length of the day.</p></note></p>
                <p>§ 8. Law II. What Newton designates by the word <hi rend="italic">motus</hi> is,
                    as he has clearly pointed out, the same as is expressed by <hi rend="italic"
                    >quantitas motus,</hi> that for which we now usually employ the term “momentum.”
                    Its numerical value depends not only on the rate of motion, but also on the
                    amount of matter, or “mass,” of the moving body, and is directly proportional to
                    either of these when the other is unaltered. But it is regarded by Newton as
                    having direction as well as magnitude. It is, in fact, what in the language of
                    quaternions is called a “vector.” The change of such a quantity may be either in
                    numerical magnitude, or in direction, alone, or simultaneously in both. We now
                    see what this Second Law enables us to do. For <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> Given
                    the mass of a body, the force acting on it, and the time during which it acts,
                    we can calculate the change of motion. This is the <hi rend="italic">direct</hi>
                    problem of dynamics of a particle.</p>
                <p>(6) Given the mass, and the change of velocity, we can calculate the magnitude
                    and direction of the force acting. This is the <hi rend="italic">inverse</hi>
                    problem.</p>
                <p>(c) We can compare, and so measure, forces by the changes of motion they produce
                    in one and the same body.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(d)</hi> We can compare the masses of different bodies by
                    finding what changes of velocity one and the same force produces in them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(e)</hi> We can find the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> force which
                    is equivalent, in its action, to any given set of forces. For, however many
                    changes of motion may be produced by the separate forces, they must obviously be
                    capable of being compounded into a single change, and we can calculate what
                    force would produce that.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>It is to be observed here that Newton’s silence is as expressive as his
                    speech. When he says “change of motion” we understand that it does not matter
                    what the original motion was; and, when he mentions only one force, he implies
                    that the effect of any one force is the same whether others are also at work or
                    not. In fact, with Newton there can be no balancing of forces, though there may
                    be balancing of the effects of forces, a very different thing.</p></note></p>
                <p>§ 9. Hitherto, we have spoken of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> motion of a body,—
                    thus implying (except, of course, in the case of Newton’s hoop or that of the
                    earth) that all its parts are moving in exactly the same way. From this point of
                    view every body, however large, may be treated as if it were a single particle.
                    But when the parts of a body have different velocities, as when a rigid body is
                    rotating, or as when a non-rigid body is suffering a change of form,
                    the-question becomes much more complex. We cannot at this stage enter into a
                    full explanation, but will take a couple of very simple cases to »show the
                    nature of the new difficulties, and thence the necessity for an additional
                    law.</p>
                <p>Suppose a bullet to be thrown in any direction. If we know with what force the
                    earth attracts it, the calculation of the path it will pursue depends on the
                    Second Law, which gives all the necessary preliminary information. But let two
                    bullets be tied together by a string: we know by trial that each moves, in
                    general, in a manner very different from that in which it would move if free.
                    The path of each is now, usually, a tortuous curve, while its free path would be
                    plane. It is no longer subject to gravity alone but also to what is called the
                    “tension” of the string. If we knew the amount of this tension on either of the
                    bullets and its direction, we could calculate, by the help of the Second Law
                    alone, all the circumstances of the motion of that bullet. But how are we to
                    find this tension <hi rend="italic">Ί</hi> Is it even the same for each bullet?
                    This, if answered in the affirmative, would simplify matters considerably, but
                    we should still require to know the amount and direction of the tension. It is
                    clear that, without a further axiom, we cannot advance to a solution of the
                    question.</p>
                <p>§ 10. Law HI. Furnished with this, in addition to our previous information, we
                    can attack the question with more hope. We see by this law that, whatever force
                    be exerted by the string on one of the bullets, an equal and opposite force,
                    which must therefore be in the direction of the string, is exerted on the other.
                    Still, the magnitude of these equal forces remains to be found. But the string
                    in no way interferes with the motion of either bullet <hi rend="italic">unless
                    it is tight, i.e.,</hi> unless the distance between the bullets is equal to the
                    length of the string. Hence, whenever the unknown force comes into play, at the
                    same time there comes in a geometrical relation of relative position between the
                    two bullets. <hi rend="italic">This supplies the additional equation necessary
                    for the determination of the new unknown quantity.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 11. As an additional illustration, suppose the string to be made of
                    india-rubber. The Third Law tells us that the tensions it exerts on the bullets
                    are still equal and opposite. But we no longer have the geometrical condition we
                    had before. We have, however, what is quite sufficient, a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n709/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0709-0678"/> knowledge of <hi rend="italic">how the tension of
                    the string depends on its length.</hi> Thus the tension can be calculated from
                    the relative position of the bullets.</p>
                <p>§ 12. Scholium to Law III. On this we will, for the present, remark only that it
                    furnishes us with the means of studying directly the transference of energy from
                    one body or system to another. Experiment, however, was required to complete the
                    application of this part of Newton’s systematic treatment of the subject. What
                    was wanted, and how it has been obtainéd, will be treated of later. The first
                    words of the scholium, however, claim for Newton the discovery of the clause we
                    have extracted from it. For they run thus :—Hactenus principia tradidi a
                    mathematicis recepta, et experientia multiplici confirmata.</p>
                <p>§ 13. What has now been said enables us to see the order in which the fundamental
                    ideas should be taken up, so that the necessities of each should be provided for
                    before its turn comes. An indispensable preliminary is the study of motion in
                    the abstract, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> without any reference to <hi
                    rend="italic">what is moving.</hi> This is demanded in order that we may be able
                    to apply the Second Law. The science of pure motion, without reference to matter
                    or force, is an extension of geometry by the introduction of the idea of time
                    and the consequent idea of velocity. Ampère suggested for it the term <hi
                    rend="italic">Cinématique,</hi> or, as we shall write it, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kinematics.</hi> We include under it all changes of form and grouping which can
                    occur in geometrical figures or in groups of points.</p>
                <p>We shall then be prepared to deal with the action of force on a single particle
                    of matter, or on a body which may be treated as if it were a mere particle. Thus
                    we have the Dynamics of a Particle. This, again, splits into two heads, Statics
                    and Kinetics of a Particle. But all this requires the Second Law only. When we
                    have two or more connected particles, or two particles attracting one another or
                    impinging on one another, the Third Law is required. Next in order of simplicity
                    come the Statics and Kinetics of a Rigid Solid. Then we have to deal with bodies
                    whose form, &lt;kc., are altered by forces—flexible bodies, elastic solids,
                    fluids, &lt;fcc. Finally, we must briefly consider the general principles, such
                    as “conservation of energy,” “least action,” &lt;fcc., which are deducible by
                    proper mathematical methods from Newton’s Laws, and of which some at least, if
                    we could more clearly realize their intrinsic nature, would probably be found to
                    express even more simply than do Newton’s Laws the true fundamental principles
                    of abstract dynamics.</p>
                <p>We will not restrict ourselves to one uniform course in the application of
                    mathematical methods. Rather, as considerations of space require to be attended
                    to, we will vary our methods from one part of the subject to another, so as to
                    exhibit, each at least once, all the more usual processes. And we will endeavour
                    to make the large-type portions of the article, in which only the most
                    elementary mathematics will be introduced, a self-contained treatise which may
                    be read by students of very moderate mathematical knowledge.</p>
                <p>KINEMATICS.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Position and the Means of Assigning it.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 14. Motion (or displacement) consists simply in “change of position.” Hence, to
                    describe motion, we must have the means of assigning position. This is, of
                    course, a question of <hi rend="smallcaps">Geometry</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >{q.vf.</hi> See also <hi rend="smallcaps">Quaternions.</hi></p>
                <p>From these articles it appears that the position of one free point with reference
                    to another (all these space relations are relative, as we have already said)
                    depends on <hi rend="italic">three numbers,</hi> of which one at least must
                    involve the unit of length. In Cartesian rectangular coordinates, we denote
                    these by <hi rend="italic">x, y, z,</hi> which indicate respectively the
                    distance of the point from each of three planes at right angles to each other,
                    and all passing through the origin (or reference point). From another point of
                    view they may be called “degrees of freedom.” When the value of one is assigned,
                    say by <hi rend="italic">x=a,</hi> the point is said to have lost one degree of
                    freedom, or to have had imposed upon it one “degree of constraint.” It must now
                    lie in a plane parallel to the first of the reference planes, and at a distance
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> from it. When a second degree of constraint is applied,
                    say by <hi rend="italic">y=b,</hi> another degree of freedom is lost. The
                    point’s position is limited to lie in a second plane in a given position at
                    right angles to the first. It must therefore lie somewhere on the straight line
                    which consists of the series of points common to the two planes. A third degree
                    of constraint <hi rend="italic">z=c</hi> takes away its one remaining degree of
                    freedom; and its position is now definitely assigned as the single point of
                    intersection of three given planes.</p>
                <p>§ 15. But constraint may be applied in other ways. Thus if we assign the
                    condition <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">+ y</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">+

                    rend="italic                     superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> t</hi><hi rend="italic">we</hi> deprive the point of one degree of
                    freedom by compelling it to remain at a distance <hi rend="italic">a</hi> from
                    the origin. It is now limited to the surface of a sphere, but its latitude and
                    longitude on that sphere may be any whatever. Here again the imposition of one
                    degree of constraint has taken away one degree of freedom.</p>
                <p>§ 16 In general, one degree of constraint may be expressed as <hi rend="italic"
                    >fx, y,</hi> *)=f∙</p>
                <p>This, when <hi rend="italic">ξ</hi> has an assigned value, is the equation of a
                    definite surface on which the point must lie. Three such conditions determine
                    the position of the point, and may therefore be looked upon as introducing <hi
                    rend="italic">ξ, η, ζ,</hi> another set of coordinates, which may be used in
                    place of <hi rend="italic">x, y, z.</hi> The number of such systems is, of
                    course, unlimited; but it is often possible to choose one in which the
                    conditions of a problem are much more simply expressed than they were when
                    expressed in <hi rend="italic">x, y, z.</hi> The whole question belongs to what
                    is called “change of variables.” To give an elementary instance of its
                    use,—suppose we take the ordinary simple pendulum, a pellet supported by a fine
                    thread or wire, and oscillating in a vertical plane. If the origin be placed at
                    the point of suspension, and the axis of <hi rend="italic">z</hi> be vertical,
                    we have two conditions :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">+
                    y</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi> + z <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> =
                    α <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi>, where <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is the length
                    of the thread; and y∕as = tanα, where a denotes the azimuth of the plane of
                    oscillation. There is but one degree of freedom left, because two degrees of
                    constraint have been imposed. We may choose for this either <hi rend="italic">x,
                    y, ox z ∙,</hi> but we should in each case be led to complex expressions. If,
                    however, we consider that all the freedom left to the pendulum is to oscillate
                    in a given plane, we may denote its sole remaining degree of freedom by <hi
                    rend="italic">θ,</hi> the angle which the string makes with the vertical; and
                    form our dynamical equation in terms of this. When <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> is
                    found by dynamical considerations, we have ae = a sin 0 cos α , <hi
                    rend="italic">y—a</hi> sin 0 sin a , 2=acos0.</p>
                <p>Here <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> comes in as what is called a “generalized
                    coordinate.”</p>
                <p>If the pendulum be not limited to one plane, the azimuth, as well as the angle,
                    of the displacement from the vertical may be any whatever. Hence there are two
                    degrees of freedom, which are indicated by the generalized coordinates α and <hi

                <p>§ 17. In general, in any system originally with any number <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> of degrees of freedom, and subjected to a number <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> of degrees of constraint, the whole motion can be fully characterized by
                    <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> th -</hi><hi rend="italic">n</hi> independent
                    quantities, called generalized coordinates, and corresponding to the degrees of
                    freedom which remain. The elegance and simplicity of a solution often depend in
                    a marked manner upon the choice of these; and the transformation of the general
                    equations from Cartesian to generalized coordinates forms one of the most
                    powerful and elegant contributions to abstract dynamics which Lagrange made in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique Analytique.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 18. A rigid system has onlys⅛ degrees of freedom:— three translations for any
                    one of its points, and three independent rotations about axes passing through
                    that point.</p>
                <p>When one point is fixed, it loses the three translations, and has only three
                    degrees of freedom. When a second point is fixed, it loses other two; in fact it
                    can no longer move except by turning round the line joining the fixed points.
                    When a third point, not in line with the other two, is fixed, there is no degree
                    of freedom left; the system is fixed.</p>
                <p>§ 19. It may be well to notice here that, in all cases which we shall require to
                    consider, whatever be the relations among two different sets of variables which
                    we employ alternatively to determine the relative positions of the parts of any
                    system, the equations which give the relations between corresponding small
                    increments of these variables are always <hi rend="italic">linear</hi> so far as
                    these increments are concerned. Thus, for instance, if we have as above a
                    condition of the form</p>
                <p>∕G≈, <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> *) = ξ, we deduce from it at once m <hi
                    rend="subscript"> to+</hi> m <hi rend="subscript"> δ</hi>, <hi rend="subscript">
                    +</hi> m <hi rend="subscript"> 8s</hi>. <hi rend="subscript"> δξ</hi>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">∖dx] ∖dy J ∖dz)</hi></p>
                <p>Here the differential coefficients are partial.</p>
                <p>In such cases, any homogeneous function of the second order in δz, δy, <hi
                    rend="italic">δz, &amp;c.,</hi> will be represented by a homogeneous function,
                    also of the second order, in δξ, <hi rend="italic">δη, kx.,</hi> however many be
                    the coordinates in the separate systems. When, however, one or more of the
                    equations of condition involves the element of <hi rend="italic">time</hi>
                    explicitly, the relations among corresponding small increments of the
                    alternative sets of coordinates, though still linear, will not be <hi
                    rend="italic">homogeneous.</hi> Thus a homogeneous function of the second order
                    in one set will be a function of the second order in the other set, but not
                    homogeneous, unless the increments are produced instantaneously.</p>
                <p>To give a single instance, suppose that the string of a simple pendulum (not
                    necessarily oscillating in one plane) <hi rend="italic">contracts</hi>
                    uniformly. We shall now have ae <hi rend="superscript">!</hi> + y <hi

                    instead of the equation in the example § 15, and one of our equations among
                    increments is <hi rend="italic">xδx + yδy + zδz= -e(a-et)δt,</hi> which, though
                    still linear, is no longer homogeneous in the increments of <hi rend="italic"

                <p>§ 20. The one necessary characteristic of the path described by a moving point is
                    its <hi rend="italic">continuity.</hi> There can be no break or gap in it. But,
                    as we study kinematics, at present, solely for its physical applications, we
                    impose a restriction on such complete generality. The path of a moving <hi
                    rend="italic">particle</hi> must be one of <hi rend="italic">continuous
                    curvature,</hi> unless either (1) the motion ceases and commences again in a
                    different direction (in which case we have two separate and successive states of
                    motion to consider), or (2) an infinite force is applied to the particle (a case
                    which we need not consider). A similar remark, we may say in passing, applies to
                    velocity also. So that, for our purpose, we may confine ourselves to the
                    geometrical properties of the motion of a point whose rate and direction of
                    motion change continuously, if at all, and not by fits and starts.</p>
                <p>§ 21. If the point describe a straight line, that line gives the direction of its
                    motion at every instant. If it describe a curve, the direction of its motion is
                    at every instant that of the corresponding tangent to the curve.</p>
                <p>Let A, B, C, D represent four points on the path taken in close succession, in
                    the order in which the moving point reaches them. From A the point moves to B,
                    so that the line joining A and B (the tangent) is the direction of motion at A.
                    Similarly the line joining B and C gives the direction of motion at B. The
                    points A, B, C of course lie in one plane. This is the plane in which, for two
                    successive elements of its path, the point is moving. It is therefore that in
                    which the change of direction of motion takes place, and is called the
                    “osculating plane.” And, just as the straight line through A and B gives the
                    direction of motion at A, so the circle passing through the points A, B, C
                    determines the “curvature” of the path at A. If we apply the same reasoning to
                    the three successive points B, C, D, we see the difference between a “plane” and
                    a “tortuous” curve. For, if D lie in the plane ABC, the osculating plane is the
                    same at A and at B; and if the same holds for other successive points the whole
                    bending takes place in one plane. But if D be not in the plane ABC, BCD is the
                    osculating plane at B, and we thus see that successive positions of the
                    osculating plane of a tortuous curve are produced by its rotation about the
                    tangent BC to the path; for BC is in both planes ABC and BCD. We shall not have
                    space here to deal in detail with cases of tortuosity; but it was necessary to
                    point out their essential nature.</p>
                <p>§ 22. The curvature of ABC obviously depends upon the change of direction from AB
                    to BC, and is directly proportional to it. But it is obviously greater, for the
                    same amount of change of direction, as ABC is less. In a circle the curvature is
                    the same at all points, and, as the radius is everywhere perpendicular to the
                    tangent, the change of its direction is the same as that of the tangent. Hence
                    the curvature, being the change of direction <hi rend="italic">per unit length
                    of the arc,</hi> is measured simply by the reciprocal of the radius.</p>
                <p>Generally, if <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> be the angle between the tangent at A and
                    any fixed line in the osculating plane, and if <hi rend="italic">s</hi>
                    represent the length of the curve measured from any fixed point on it to A, we
                    have, by the fundamental property of infinitesimals, <hi rend="italic subscript"

                    term was introduced by Newton.)</p>
                <p>In a circle we have always (α being the radius) <hi rend="italic">s=aφ,</hi> and

                <p>§ 23. The chief properties connected with the curvature of a plane curve are made
                    very clear by the artifice of regarding it as an “involute.” This idea
                    introduces us to the kinematics of a flexible and inextensible line. Suppose
                    such a line, held tight, to be wrapped round a cylinder of any form, in a plane
                    perpendicular to its axis, each point of it, when it is unwound in its own
                    plane, will describe a curve whose form depends upon that of the transverse
                    section of the cylinder. Let P <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> M'M (fig. I)J <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3e</hi> such a section of the cylinder; MP, MP, two
                    positions of the free part of the cord; P, P ’, the corresponding positions of
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n711/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0711-0680"/> a definite point of the cord; PP'P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi> the path described by that point. Then PP'P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi> is one of the involutes of MM'P <hi rend="subscript">
                    0</hi>; the others are the curves traced by other points of the string. But,
                    with reference to PP'P <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>, the curve MM'P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 0</hi> is <hi rend="italic">the</hi> “evolute.” The evolute of
                    such a curve is, in fact, unique; for it is obvious that the line MP, in any of
                    its positions, is revolving about the point of contact Μ with the evolute; so
                    that P describes an infinitesimal arc of a circle of which Μ is the centre. Thus
                    the evolute of a plane curve is the locus of its centre of curvature. And it is
                    clear from the genesis of the involute that</p>
                <p>PM = P'M' + M'M = P <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> M ’ M .</p>
                <p>For the analytical discussion of evolutes, see vol. xiii. p. 26.</p>
                <p>The subject of evolutes is of importance in various branches of physics,
                    especially in optics. In mechanics its chief use is connected with the theory of
                    the pendulum, as it shows how to cause the bob to move in a cycloid, the only
                    path in which the time of oscillation is the same whatever be the extent of the
                    oscillations.</p>
                <p>§ 24. When the line, curved or straight, in which the motion takes place is
                    given, the position of the moving point is at once assigned in terms of a single
                    numerical quantity. In fact it has only one degree of freedom, and its position
                    is known by the length of the arc of the curve from any fixed point to the given
                    position. In such a case as this we are not concerned with the direction of the
                    motion, for that is already assigned at every point of the path. We are
                    concerned only with what we may call the “speed” of the motion. (We purposely
                    avoid the use of the term “velocity” here, because it properly includes
                    direction as well as speed, as will be seen later.)</p>
                <p>§ 25. Suppose an observer to be watching the motion (as, for instance, a
                    traveller by rail notes the telegraph posts which he passes, referring at each
                    to his watch), and to find that at any time the moving point was at s <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, while at time <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> 2</hi> it was at s <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>Then it is clear that the <hi rend="italic">average</hi> speed during this part
                    of the motion is to be found by dividing the number of units of space passed
                    over by the number of units of time employed. For it must be greater as the
                    former is greater and less as the latter is greater. Hence the average speed is
                    <hi rend="italic strikethrough"> -t ‘</hi> the speed has been <hi rend="italic"
                    >uniform,</hi> during the motion observed, this average value has coincided with
                    the actual value all through; and, if the measures of space and time are
                    accurate, we shall get exactly the same value of this ratio whether the interval
                    of time is small or large. Hence, if <hi rend="italic">v</hi> be the speed of a
                    uniformly moving point, the space it describes in time <hi rend="italic">t</hi>
                    is <hi rend="italic">vt.</hi> But if the speed has been <hi rend="italic"
                    >variable,</hi> it must at some parts of the interval have been greater, at
                    others less, than this average. And the shorter we take the interval the less
                    will be the difference between the greatest and least speeds during its lapse,
                    so that the average speed will coincide more and more nearly with the actual
                    speed. In the language of “fluxions” (which was invented for the sake of this
                    subject) the measure of the speed at any time i <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is
                    when the interval <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">- t</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> x</hi> is shortened
                    indefinitely. The accuracy of the preceding process depends entirely upon the
                    limitations we have introduced for the purpose of confining ourselves to cases
                    which can occur in ordinary physical problems. For the general reasoning on
                    which it is based is obviously inapplicable to cases in which the speed alters
                    by jerks—at least during the interval considered, small as it may be. But we are
                    fortunately not required to discuss here the very delicate questions to which
                    this may give rise. Considerable difficulty is sometimes felt by a student when
                    he is told that at a certain part of its course a point has a speed say of 10
                    miles an hour, while the whole course may be only a few inches. But this arises
                    from the novelty of the conception. It is not meant, when we speak of a speed of
                    10 miles per hour, that the motion necessarily lasts for an hour, or even for a
                    second, but only that, <hi rend="italic">if the then speed were to be maintained
                    constant for an hour, the moving point's path, of τvhatev r form, would be
                    exactly</hi> 10 <hi rend="italic">miles long.</hi> In actual experience in a
                    railway train we can judge the speed (roughly at least), and we find nothing
                    strange in saying “Nowwe are going at twenty miles an hour,” “Now at six,” and
                    so on. And it is clear that, after the steam is put on, the train, however short
                    its run, must go through all rates of speed from zero to its maximum, and then
                    through all of them to zero again, when the steam is cut off and the brake
                    applied.</p>
                <p>In the language of the differential calculus this becomes . _ <hi

                <p>The fluxional notation of Newton, in which the dot over a quantity expresses the
                    rate of its increase, <hi rend="italic">i.c.,</hi> its differential coefficient
                    with regard to time considered as the independent variable, is still very
                    convenient in abstract dynamics, and is, in fact, indispensable when we come to
                    the higher generalizations. We shall, therefore, freely employ it when it is
                    specially useful.</p>
                <p>§ 26. Whether uniform or variable, speed depends for its numerical value upon the
                    units chosen for linear space and for time. Its dimensions are [LT^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi>], and consequently its numerical expression is
                    increased in proportion as the unit of time is increased, and diminished in
                    proportion as that of length is increased. Thus the speed represented by 10 in
                    feet per second becomes</p>
                <p>3600, <hi rend="subscript"> O</hi> _75 5280 ’ ° <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> ll
                    when expressed in miles per hour.</p>
                <p>§ 27. The rate at which the speed (when not uniform) changes is found by a
                    process precisely similar to that employed for the speed itself. Let the speed
                    at time be observed to be v <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                    >»</hi><hi rend="italic">t‘2 &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> v</hi><hi rend="italic">2 &gt;</hi> then the average rate of
                    increase of speed during the interval is <hi rend="italic"> V2~</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> v</hi><hi rend="italic"> 1</hi> ⅛ ~ h</p>
                <p>The dimensions of this quantity are obviously [LT^ <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>]. Thus its numerical value is diminished, like that of speed, in
                    proportion as the unit of length is increased. But it is increased in the
                    duplicate of the proportion in which the unit of time is increased. For instance
                    a rate of increase of speed of 32 ’ 2 feet per second per second (the mere <hi
                    rend="italic">statement</hi> is enough to show the double dependence on the time
                    unit) becomes</p>
                <p>32'2 <hi rend="strikethrough">^θθθ</hi>-= 79,036 nearly, when expressed in terms
                    of miles and hours.</p>
                <p>§ 28. When the rate of increase of speed is uniform, the above average value is
                    its actual value throughout the interval. Hence with uniform rate of increase =
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> a speed V becomes in time <hi rend="italic">t</hi> v =
                    V + αi.</p>
                <p>Also, as it increases uniformly, its average value during time <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi> is half way between its values at the beginning and end of that time;
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it is</p>
                <p>V + Jαi.</p>
                <p>The space described during the interval is at once found (§ 25) as the product of
                    the interval and the average speed during its lapse;— <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> it is <hi rend="italic">s=^Vt + ⅛at</hi><hi rend="italic

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0712-0681"/>
                <p>And it is easy to see from these expressions that υ <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> = V <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + 2αs, which gives the speed acquired
                    in terms of the space traversed.</p>
                <p>§ 29. This is the only case in which the result can be reached without formally
                    using the methods of the integral calculus. These expressions enable us at once
                    to solve a great number of simple questions connected with the motion of a stone
                    or bullet, under the action of gravity, in a vertical line. For it is found by
                    experiment that gravity impresses, in every second, a downward speed of 32 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 2 feet per second on an unsupported body; and, by the
                    Second Law, this is independent of the body’s previous motion.</p>
                <p>Hence, if a stone be let fall, its speed after <hi rend="italic">t</hi> seconds
                    is 32 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 2i, and the space fallen through is 16Η <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. Also, if it fall through s feet, it will acquire a
                    speed whose square is <hi rend="italic">v</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    i</hi> = 64 ’ 4s.</p>
                <p>Again, if a stone be thrown upwards with a speed of 300 feet per second, after
                    <hi rend="italic">t</hi> seconds its speed will be 300 - 32 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 2i, and the height to which it has then ascended is
                    300i-16 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> li <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. Thus
                    it stops, and turns, after g^2 300 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> seconds; and
                    the greatest height it reaches is feet.</p>
                <p>From the statement above, putting s=∙υ, we find <hi rend="italic">„</hi><hi

                    treated later.) We have, by taking the fluxion, s = - αωsinωi, and again <hi

                <p>§ 30. Velocity, as we have already said, involves the ideas of speed and of
                    direction of motion conjointly.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It is, in fact, in the language of quaternions, a “vector,”
                    of which the speed is the “tensor” or length, and of which the “versor” assigns
                    the direction. And the laws of composition of velocities are in all respects the
                    same as those of vectors.</p></note> To compound two velocities (as is required
                    in the application of Newton’s Second Law), we have the following obvious
                    construction. From any fixed point O (fig. 2), draw a line OA representing, in
                    magnitude and direction, one of the two velocities. From its extremity A draw AB
                    representing in the same way, and on the same scale, the other. Complete the
                    triangle OAB. Then OB represents, in magnitude and direction (still on the same
                    scale), the resultant velocity. We have called the construction obvious because
                    one has only to think of <hi rend="italic">how</hi> a point can be said to have
                    simultaneous velocities, in order to see its truth. Thus, if OA represents the
                    velocity of a railway train, AB that of a passenger walking in a saloon
                    carriage, O may be looked upon as the position of the point of the carriage at
                    which he began his walk, at the moment when he did begin it; while B represents
                    the position of the point of the carriage which he has reached at the end of his
                    walk, just at the moment when he did reach it. Here OA is the velocity of the
                    carriage relative to the earth, AB that of the passenger relative to the
                    carriage.</p>
                <p>This proposition may be called the triangle of velocities. Another obvious mode
                    of stating it is to complete the parallelogram of which OB is a diagonal (fig.
                    3); and then we have the same construction in the form :—If the two velocities
                    to be compounded, represented by OA and OC, be taken as contiguous sides of a
                    parallelogram, the conterminous diagonal OB represents their resultant.</p>
                <p>§ 31. From the triangle of velocities we may pass at once to the polygon of
                    velocities, which gives us the resultant of any number of simultaneous
                    velocities. Thus, beginning as above at any point 0 (fig. 4), lay off OA, AB, BC
                    (however many there may be) as successive sides of a polygon <hi rend="italic"
                    >all taken in the same direction round.</hi> The separate velocities may be in
                    one plane or not. When this is done, the final point C is easily seen to be
                    independent of the <hi rend="italic">order</hi> in which the separate velocities
                    were taken, and is thus a perfectly definite point. 00, completing thé polygon,
                    represents the resultant velocity. But it is taken <hi rend="italic">in the
                    opposite direction round.</hi> If C coincide with O, there is no resultant;— <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a point which has, simultaneously, velocities
                    represented by the successive sides of any polygon, all taken the same way
                    round, is at rest.</p>
                <p>In what precedes, we have denoted the position of the moving point in its known
                    path by the single quantity <hi rend="italic">s.</hi> But if λve think of its
                    Cartesian coordinates <hi rend="italic">x, y, z,</hi> we see that in general
                    each of these must vary during the motion. And just as we represented the whole
                    speed by s so we may speak of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> as the speed in the
                    direction of the axis of <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> &amp;c. And now we have a
                    hint of a most important character. For, by the ordinary laws of the
                    differential calculus, we have three equations of the form <hi rend="italic">x
                    dx dx-</hi></p>
                <p>— = -ror <hi rend="italic">x≈-</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> τ</hi><hi

                    >ds</hi> the axis of <hi rend="italic">x.</hi> And so with <hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi> and <hi rend="italic">z.</hi> These give us <hi rend="italic">.,

                <p>Hence we see that a speed in any direction may be resolved into three in any
                    assigned directions at right angles to one another; that the speed in any one of
                    these is determined by multiplying the whole speed by the cosine of the angle
                    between its direction and that of its resolved part; and that the square of the
                    whole speed is the sum of the squares of the speeds in the resolved motions.
                    These results, however, can be obtained more directly, and in a more instructive
                    manner, by the consideration of “velocities,” and not of mere “speeds.” But,
                    before we take this step, let us take the second fluxions of the coordinates,
                    and see to what they lead us. t? „ <hi rend="italic">. dx .</hi></p>

                    These show that the rates of increase of speed, parallel to the three axes
                    respectively, may be considered as made up of the resolved parts of the two

                    cosine of the angle between the two directions concerned. We shall presently
                    recognize these as the components of the acceleration.</p>

                <p>§ 32 To resolve a velocity is of course a perfectly indefinite problem, unless
                    the number of conditions requisite for definiteness be imposed. For, in general,
                    it may be taken as one side of any complete polygon, whether in one plane or
                    not; and the other sides, all taken in the opposite order round, represent its
                    components.</p>
                <p>The only cases which we need consider, in which the conditions are such as to
                    ensure one definite solution, are—(1) when a velocity is to be resolved into
                    components parallel and perpendicular to a given line; and (2) an extension of
                    the same case to components parallel respectively to three lines at right angles
                    to one another. In case (1) the given velocity is to be taken as the hypotenuse
                    of a right-angled triangle of which one of the sides is parallel to the given
                    line. In case (2) it is to be taken as the diagonal of a rectangular
                    parallelepiped of which the edges are parallel to the three lines respectively.
                    In either case the magnitude of each component is found by multiplying the
                    amount of the velocity by the cosine of the angle between its direction and that
                    of the component; and the square of the whole velocity is equal to the sum of
                    the squares of the components. We are now prepared to take up the requisite
                    preliminaries for the application of the Second Law. What, in fact, is “change
                    of velocity” <hi rend="italic">1</hi> The preceding statements at once enable us
                    to give the answer. For let OA (fig. 5) be the velocity of a point at one
                    instant, OB at a succeeding instant. To convert OA into OB, we must compound
                    with it a velocity represented by AB.</p>
                <p>AB represents the change. Hence if, during any motion <hi rend="italic"
                    >whatever</hi> of a point, a line OA be constantly drawn from a fixed point O,
                    so as to represent at every instant the magnitude and direction of the velocity
                    of the moving point, the extremity of OA will describe a curve (plane if the
                    original path be plane, but not otherwise, except in certain special cases)
                    which possesses the following important but obvious properties :— (1) the
                    tangent at A is the direction of the change of velocity in the original path;
                    (2) the rate of motion of A is the rate of change of velocity in the original
                    path. Hence in this auxiliary curve, called the <hi rend="smallcaps">Hodograph
                    (&lt;∕.v.),</hi> the velocity represents, in magnitude and direction, what is
                    called “acceleration” in the original path. And, because the acceleration can
                    thus be represented as a velocity, the laws of composition and resolution of
                    velocities hold good for accelerations also.</p>
                <p>§ 33. Hence, if we desire to know the whole acceleration in any case of motion of
                    a point, we need only-find its components in, and perpendicular to, the tangent
                    to the path. That in the tangent has already been found; it is <hi rend="italic"
                    >V</hi> or s as in § 29. For that perpendicular to the path we may study the
                    simple case of uniform motion in a circle.</p>
                <p>§ 34. If a point move with uniform speed V in a circle, the hodograph is
                    evidently a circle of radius V, and is described uniformly in the same time as
                    the orbit (see fig. 6), Hence the speeds in the two circles are as their radii.
                    Let R be the radius of the orbit. Then the magnitude of the acceleration in the
                    orbit (the speed in the hodograph) is found from</p>
                <p>A:V::V:R; that is, A = V <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∕R∙</p>
                <p>The direction of this acceleration, being that of the tangent to the hodograph,
                    is perpendicular to the corresponding radius of the hodograph, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> to the tangent to the orbit. Hence it is <hi rend="italic">along the
                    radius of the orbit and directed inwards to its centre.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 35. In other words, to <hi rend="italic">compels.</hi> mass to describe an <hi
                    rend="italic">unnatural</hi> (because curved) path, it must be acted on by a
                    force directed towards the centre of curvature of the path. We anticipate so far
                    as to introduce here mass and force, although, strictly, we are dealing with
                    kinematics. But the student cannot be too early warned of the dangerous error
                    into which so many have fallen, who have supposed that a mass has a tendency to
                    fly <hi rend="italic">outwards</hi> from a centre about which it is revolving,
                    and therefore exerts a “centrifugal force/' which requires to be balanced by a
                    “centripetal force.” The centripetal force is required if the path is to be
                    curved; it is required for the purpose of <hi rend="italic">producing the
                    curvature,</hi> and not because there is any tendency to fly out from the
                    centre.</p>
                <p>§ 36. Thus, in any motion of a point, the whole acceleration is the resultant of
                    two parts—the first in the direction of motion and of magnitude equal to the
                    rate of increase of speed, the second directed towards the centre of curvature
                    and of magnitude as the curvature and the square of the speed conjointly. The
                    sole effect of the first component is to alter the <hi rend="italic">speed,</hi>
                    of the second to alter the <hi rend="italic">direction,</hi> of the motion.
                    There is no acceleration perpendicular to the osculating plane, because two
                    successive values of the velocity, and therefore also the corresponding <hi
                    rend="italic">change of velocity,</hi> are in that plane.</p>
                <p>§ 37. A very convenient expression for acceleration which changes the direction
                    of motion is furnished in terms of what is called the “angular velocity,” <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the rate at which direction changes. This also is
                    properly a vector, or directed line, perpendicular to the plane in which the
                    change of direction takes place, and of length proportional to the rate at which
                    the angle assigning the direction changes.</p>
                <p>§ 38. In the case of uniform motion in a circle of radius R, with speed V, the
                    time of describing the complete circumference (2τrR) is 2τrR∕V. Hence the
                    angular velocity is V∕R, usually denoted by ω. Thus the above expression for the
                    acceleration in a direction perpendicular to the path of a point (§ 34) may be
                    written in the form pω <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, where <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> is the radius of curvature of the orbit and ω the angular velocity of
                    that radius. The direction of this acceleration, as we have seen, is always
                    towards the centre of curvature.</p>
                <p>§ 39. The general difficulty of any question concerning acceleration is usually a
                    purely mathematical one, involving only such physical considerations as are
                    required for the formation of the differential equations, and for the
                    determination of the so-called arbitrary constants or arbitrary functions
                    involved in the integrals. We will not now discuss the various forms in which
                    the difficulty may present itself, because in the course of the article many of
                    the more important of these will be fully treated in connexion with motions
                    actually observed among terrestrial or cosmical bodies.</p>
                <p>§ 40. We have sufficiently considered (§§ 27-29) uniform acceleration in the line
                    of motion. Let us now consider uniform acceleration in a fixed direction,
                    whether the motion of the point be in that direction or not. This is the most
                    general case of the motion of an <hi rend="italic">unresisted</hi> projectile,
                    on the supposition that its path is confined to a region throughout which
                    gravity is sensibly constant alike in direction and in intensity. Two well-known
                    properties of the parabola lead to an immediate solution of our problem.</p>
                <p>Let fig. 7 represent a parabola, defined completely by <pb break="no"

                    to be placed with its axis vertical, and vertex upwards. Take any point P, join
                    PS, and draw PM perpendicular to the directrix.</p>
                <p>Then</p>
                <p>(a) If PQ bisect the angle SPM, it is the tangent to the parabola at P.</p>
                <p>Let Q be any point in the tangent, and let QR, drawn parallel to MP, meet the
                    curve in R. Then we have</p>
                <p>(δ) PQ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = 4SP.QR.</p>
                <p>§ 41. Now suppose a point, originally moving along PQ with uniform speed V, to
                    have its motion accelerated in a direction parallel to MP, the acceleration
                    being α, a constant. Then, after <hi rend="italic">t</hi> seconds it would have
                    moved along PQ through a space <hi rend="italic">Nt,</hi> and parallel to MP
                    through a space ∣αf <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. Hence, if R be its position
                    at that time,</p>
                <p>PQ≈Vi, QR=⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> α</hi> &lt; <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>From these equations we find at once <hi rend="smallcaps">PQ2=¾</hi><hi

                <p>α</p>
                <p>This relation is of the same form as that already written for a parabola, and (as
                    it does not involve i) it holds for every point of the path. Hence the point
                    moves in a parabola whose axis is vertical, which touches PQ (the direction of
                    projection) in P, and in which SP = V <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∕2α, But
                    these three data determine the parabola. For we have only to draw PM vertical,
                    make the angle QPS = QPM, and measure off the lengths PM and PS each equal to V
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∕2α. Μ is a point in the (horizontal) directrix,
                    and S is the focus. Hence the path is completely determined.</p>
                <p>It is well to notice that, as V <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = 2αPM, Μ is the
                    point which the projectile would just reach if it were projected vertically
                    upwards (§ 29).</p>
                <p>§ 42. If the speed of projection be kept constant, while the direction of PQ
                    alters in a vertical plane, S describes a circle about P as centre. This
                    consideration enables us easily to <hi rend="italic">find the direction of
                    projection that a given object may be struck.</hi> Let 0 (fig. 8) be the object.
                    Join PO, and let it cut in B the circle MBS (whose centre is P). Draw ON
                    perpendicular to the common directrix, and with radius ON describe a circle
                    about O. This will (in general) cut MBS in two points F and F'. <hi
                    rend="italic">These are the foci of the two paths by either of which the</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">projectile can reach 0.</hi> For by construction FO = ON, so that
                    O lies on the path whose focus is F. Similarly for F'.</p>
                <p>To find the most distant point along PO which can be reached, with the given
                    speed of projection from P, we have merely to note that, as O is taken farther
                    and farther from P, F and F' approach B, and finally coincide with it. If O be
                    then at A, we have AT = AB, where AT is perpendicular to the directrix. Hence,
                    if we produce AT to <hi rend="italic">t</hi> so that T^ = BP, we have Ai = AP.
                    Draw through. <hi rend="italic">t</hi> a line <hi rend="italic">tm</hi> parallel
                    to TM. Then A lies on the parabola whose focus is P and directrix <hi
                    rend="italic">mt.</hi> This parabola is the envelop of all the possible paths
                    from P. Any point within it can be reached by two different paths. These become
                    coincident when the point lies on the curve; and no point outside it can be
                    reached.</p>
                <p>§ 43. Many of the most important cases of motion of a point involve acceleration
                    whose direction is always towards a definite “centre” as it is called. In such
                    cases the motion is obviously confined to the plane which, at any instant,
                    contains the centre and the line of motion of the point.</p>
                <p>Also the “moment” of the point’s velocity about the centre remains constant. Here
                    a slight digression is necessary.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Def.—</hi><hi rend="italic">Given a directed quantity</hi>
                    (α <hi rend="italic">velocity, force, Ac.) in a line AB</hi> (fig. 9). <hi
                    rend="italic">If a perpendicular OP be drawn to AB from any point 0, the

                <p>If the directed quantity be reversed, the <hi rend="italic">sign</hi> of the
                    moment is changed. The moment is, in fact, properly a directed quantity (or
                    vector) perpendicular to the plane OAB. And its numerical magnitude is double
                    the area of the triangle OAB.</p>
                <p>[§ 44. The convention usually made as to the sign-of rotation about an axis is to
                    regard it as positive when it is in the same sense as that in which the earth
                    turns about its axis, as seen by a spectator above the north pole. This is in
                    the opposite direction to that of the hands of a watch. Hence the plane angle
                    AOP (fig. 10), representing the change of direction of a line originally
                    coincident with OA, is positive, and is looked on as due to rotation about an
                    axis drawn from O <hi rend="italic">upwards</hi> from the plane of the figure.
                    Thus the rotation of the sun and the orbital motions of the planets take place
                    in the positive direction about axes drawn on the whole northwards from the
                    plane of the ecliptic; or we may put it thus :—seizing an axis by the positive
                    end, we must ««screw—by the negative end, we must screw—to give positive
                    rotation. And when, later, we consider rotations about three rectangular axes,
                    O∙r, <hi rend="italic">Oy, Oz,</hi> we shall suppose them so drawn that rotation
                    through a positive right angle about <hi rend="italic">Ox</hi> changes <hi

                <p>§ 45. Here we must introduce a simple geometrical proposition :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">If any point be taken in the plane of a parallelogram, and
                    triangles be formed with the point as vertex and with contiguous sides and the
                    conterminous diagonal as their respective bases, the sum of the areas of the
                    first two triangles is equal to the area of the third.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus, in areas (fig. 11),</p>
                <p>OAB+OAC=OAD.</p>
                <p>If 0 lie within the angle BAG, as in fig. 12, the proposition becomes</p>
                <p>OAC-OAB=OAD.</p>
                <p>§ 46. Remembering that these areas represent half the moments of the bases of the
                    respective triangles about the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n715/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0715-0684"/> point 0 (that of OAB being <hi rend="italic"
                    >negative</hi> in the second case above), we see that <hi rend="italic">The
                    moment of a diagonal of a parallelogram about any point in the plane of the
                    figure is the (algebraic) sum of the moments of two conterminous sides.</hi></p>
                <p>Now, suppose the sides of the parallelogram to represent a velocity and its
                    change. If the direction of the change pass through O, its moment is <hi
                    rend="italic">nil.</hi> Hence, <hi rend="italic">for acceleration directed
                    towards a fixed point the moment of the velocity about that point is
                    constant.</hi></p>
                <p>This is commonly expressed by saying that <hi rend="italic">the radiusvector
                    describes equal areas in equal times about the point to zvhich the acceleration
                    is directed.</hi> For the moment of the velocity is double the area so traced in
                    unit of time.</p>
                <p>Another way of expressing the same thing is to say that the angular velocity of
                    the radius-vector is inversely as the square of its length. For the product of
                    the square of the radius-vector and its angular velocity is double the area
                    described by it in unit of time.</p>
                <p>The converse of this proposition is also evidently true; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,
                    when a point moves so that the moment of the velocity about a point in the plane
                    of its motion is constant, its acceleration relative to that point (if any) is
                    directed towards or from that point.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 47. Analytically: if P be the acceleration, directed towards a fixed point
                    which we choose as origin, we have</p>
                <p>⅛ = -Pcos0= <hi rend="italic">-^Px</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>O=a⅛r-⅞⅛E=∙-^(r <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> 0).</p>

                <p>This may be transformed, at once, by the methods of the differential calculus,
                    into <hi rend="italic">ps≈pv = 7ι,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is the
                    length of the perpendicular from the origin to the tangent to the path.
                    Conversely, if equal areas be described by the radius-vector in equal times, we
                    have <hi rend="italic">r</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">()≈xy-yx = h.</hi></p>

                    rend="italic">x≈Qx, y=Qy.</hi></p>
                <p>Hence the whole acceleration is Qr, and is directed towards or from the
                    origin.</p>
                <p>While we are dealing with these formulae we may investigate the general
                    expressions for velocity and acceleration in terms of polar coordinates for a
                    point moving in a plane.</p>
                <p>We have ≈=rcos0, ι∕=rsin0.</p>
                <p>From these a5 = rcos0-r0sin0,</p>
                <p>2∕ = rsin0 + r0cos0.</p>
                <p>Hence the speed along the radius-vector is aecos0 + ÿsin0 = r; and that
                    perpendicular to the radius-vector (in the direction in which 0 increases)
                    is</p>
                <p>⅛cos0-⅛sin0 = r0.</p>
                <p>These expressions might have been written down at once, if we note that δr and
                    rδ0 are the resolved parts of δs along, and perpendicular to, <hi rend="italic"
                    >r.</hi> But we must be careful how we carry this species of reasoning one step
                    further. Taking the second fluxions of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">y,</hi> we have <hi rend="italic">x</hi> = (r - r0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>) cos 0 - (2r0 + rø) sin 0, <hi rend="italic">ÿ</hi> =
                    (i <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi>- z ’ 0 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>) sin 0 +
                    (2r0 + ?·0) cos 0.</p>
                <p>Hence the acceleration along the radius-vector is <hi rend="italic">xcosθ</hi> +
                    ^sin0 = r -r0 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, and that perpendicular to it
                    (positive when in the direction in which 0 increases) is</p>
                <p>ÿcos 0 - ⅛sin 0=2r0 + <hi rend="italic">r'θ = ^--^-(r</hi><hi rend="italic

                <p>Thus, although <hi rend="italic">r</hi> represents truly the speed along <hi
                    rend="italic">r, r</hi> does not represent the acceleration in that direction.
                    It represents, in fact, only the <hi rend="italic">acceleration of speed</hi>
                    along <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> But we have seen that there is acceleration
                    along r, if its direction changes, even -when its length is constant, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> when the path is circular; and in that case <hi

                <p>As a verification of these formulae, let us consider uniform motion in a straight

                <p>Here, although there is no acceleration, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> has a definite

                <p>From the expressions for the acceleration along and perpendicular to the

                <p>§ 48. There are two specially important cases of central acceleration. The first
                    is that of the gravitation law, the other that of Hooke’s law. We will take
                    these in order, but by very different methods.</p>
                <p>§ 49. <hi rend="italic">Planetary Motion.—</hi> With the gravitation law the
                    acceleration varies inversely as the square of the distance from the point to
                    which it is directed. But, as we have just seen, the angular velocity of the
                    radius-vector, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of the direction of acceleration,
                    varies according to the same law. Hence in the hodograph, the linear velocity
                    (whose <hi rend="italic">magnitude</hi> is that of the acceleration in the path)
                    is proportional<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n716/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0716-0685"/> to the angular velocity of the tangent (whose
                    direction is parallel to the acceleration).</p>
                <p>Thus, in the hodograph, the angle between successive tangents is proportional to
                    the arc between their points of contact; and therefore the curvature is
                    constant;— <hi rend="italic">i.e., the hodograph is a circle.</hi></p>
                <p>Let A (fig. 13) be the centre of this circle, O the pole of the hodograph, P any
                    position of the tracing point. Then OP is, in magnitude and direction, the
                    velocity in the orbit. But it may be looked on as consisting of two parts, OA
                    and AP. Of these both are constant in magnitude; but OA is constant in
                    direction, while AP is perpendicular to the direction of acceleration in the
                    orbit. Hence the velocity in the orbit is the resultant of two constant
                    parts,—one always in a fixed direction, the other always perpendicular to the
                    radius-vector.</p>
                <p>This gives the form of the orbit as follows :— x = α(e-ι∕∕r), <hi rend="italic">y
                    = ax∕r;</hi> so that <hi rend="italic">rr = xx + yy≈ery</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> or <hi rend="italic">r≈e(y+b)∙,</hi> where the meanings of
                    the quantities are obvious.</p>
                <p>But if PO cut the circle again in <hi rend="italic">p, Op</hi> is proportional to
                    the perpendicular on the tangent to the orbit from the centre of acceleration
                    (because PO. <hi rend="italic">Op</hi> is constant) and is at right angles to it
                    (because it is in the direction of the velocity). Hence the path is such that
                    the locus of the foot of the perpendicular from the centre of acceleration on
                    the tangent is a circle. This property belongs exclusively to conic sections,
                    one focus being the point from which the perpendiculars are drawn.</p>
                <p>A third and even simpler mode of treating this most important problem is as
                    follows. Draw OM perpendicular to PA (produced if necessary) and PN
                    perpendicular to OA. Then OM is the resolved part of OP parallel to the tangent
                    at P, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it is the speed with which the length of the
                    radius-vector changes. Also PN is the resolved part of OP perpendicular to the
                    fixed line OA, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it is the speed with which the
                    moving point travels in a fixed direction. But by similar triangles OAM, PAN, we
                    have</p>
                <p>OM: PN:: OA: AP = a constant ratio.</p>
                <p>Hence the increment of the radius-vector bears a constant ratio to the
                    simultaneous increment of the distance of the moving point from a fixed line in
                    the plane of motion. This is only a slightly altered form of statement of the
                    focus and directrix property of conic sections.</p>
                <p>When O is within the circle, the constant ratio is less than unity, and the conic
                    is an ellipse; when without, the ratio is greater than unity, and we have an
                    hyperbola. When O is on the circumference of the hodograph, the path is a
                    parabola; for the ratio is unity.</p>
                <p>In a subsequent section we will return to this question, and treat it from the
                    point of view of Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion.</p>
                <p>Simple as are the geometrical methods above, the direct analytical one is still
                    simpler. For we have p ,</p>

                <p>§ 50. <hi rend="italic">Elliptic Motion about the Centre.—</hi> When a point
                    moves uniformly in a circle, the motion presents very different appearances
                    according to the spectator’s point of view. If we suppose him to be situated at
                    a distance very great compared with the radius of the circle, he sees what is
                    practically an orthographic projection of the orbit on a plane perpendicular to
                    the line of sight. In general, an orthographic projection of a circle is an
                    ellipse—whose centre is the projection of that of the circle. As equal areas are
                    projected orthographically into equal areas, the appearance is therefore
                    elliptic motion, in which the radius-vector from the centre describes equal
                    areas in equal times. Hence (§ 46) the acceleration is directed towards the
                    centre. But accelerations are projected like velocities, and like lines. Hence,
                    as the acceleration in uniform circular motion is constant, and directed towards
                    the centre, so in elliptic motion, with equable description of areas about the
                    centre, the acceleration is towards the centre, and is <hi rend="italic"
                    >proportional to the length of the radius-vector.</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The elastic force called into play by

                    restore the displaced particle to its equilibrium position. We mention this, in
                    passing, to show the importance of the present investigation.</p></note> But
                    this projected orbit may again be projected orthographically, as often as we
                    please, on different planes. It will always remain elliptical, and with the
                    radius-vector from the centre describing equal areas in equal times. And the
                    acceleration will always be in the same proportion as before to the
                    radius-vector. However different in size and shape these elliptic orbits may be,
                    they have one common property, <hi rend="italic">the time of describing them is
                    the same.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus we see that when the orbit is an ellipse described about its centre of
                    figure the acceleration is central, and proportional to the radius-vector. The
                    time of describing such an ellipse depends only upon the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ratio</hi> of the acceleration to the length of the radius-vector <hi
                    rend="italic">; or, if we</hi> choose, upon the magnitude of the acceleration at
                    unit distance. And the converse of this proposition is also evidently true. When
                    we look edgewise at the uniformly-described circular path with which we
                    commenced, it is seen projected into a straight line, in which the moving point
                    appears to <hi rend="italic">oscillate.</hi> This is the case, for instance,
                    very approximately, with the satellites of Jupiter as seen from the earth.
                    Sun-spots, the red-spot on Jupiter, &amp;c., all appear to move approximately in
                    this way. But the extreme importance of this species of motion is that it is the
                    simplest type of oscillation of a particle of matter displaced from a position
                    of stable equilibrium. The vibrations of the ether when homogeneous
                    plane-polarized light is passing through it, of the air when a pure musical note
                    is sounded, the oscillations of a pendulum (through small arcs), the simplest
                    vibrations of a pianoforte wire or a tuning-fork, the indications of a
                    tide-gauge when the sea is calm,—all are instances of it. Hence the special
                    necessity for studying it in detail.</p>

                <p>From these expressions we see that, if we call ω the angular velocity of OP, so

                <p>§ 53. The simplest graphical method of exhibiting the nature of any kind of
                    rectilineal motion is to compound it with a uniform velocity in a direction
                    perpendicular to the line in which it is executed. This is, in fact, wL·at is
                    done in the majority of <hi rend="italic">self-registering</hi> instruments,
                    where a slip of paper is drawn by clock-work uniformly past the moving point, in
                    a direction perpendicular to its line of motion, and a record is made by
                    mechanical means, by a pencil, by an electric spark, or (best of all) by
                    photographic processes. When this process is applied to a simple harmonic motion
                    the record is of the general form of the curve in fig. 15. This curve has long
                    been known as the “curve of sines,” or the “harmonic” curve. All its forms can
                    be deduced from any one of them by mere extension or foreshortening in the
                    vertical or horizontal directions in the figure. It represents the simplest
                    forms into which a vibrating string can be thrown, as well as the instantaneous
                    form of a section of the surface of water along which a simple series of
                    oscillatory waves or ripples is passing. In this case the <hi rend="italic"
                    >form</hi> of the section remains the same as time goes on, but the whole figure
                    moves steadily onwards in the direction in which the waves are travelling.</p>
                <p>This is expressed analytically by the form <hi rend="italic">y≈aeos(nt -mx),</hi>
                    where <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> are horizontal and
                    vertical coordinates of a point at the surface of the water, <hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi> being measured from the level of the undisturbed surface. When <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> is constant we study, for all time, the simple harmonic
                    rise and fall at a particular <hi rend="italic">place.</hi> When <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> is constant we have the above-figured instantaneous glance
                    of a section of the whole water-surface.</p>
                <p>The rate at which the wave travels is obviously <hi rend="italic">n]m</hi>; for,
                    if we increase <hi rend="italic">t</hi> by any quantity τ, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> by the corresponding quantity <hi rend="italic">nτjm,</hi> the value of
                    <hi rend="italic">y</hi> is unaltered.</p>
                <p>§ 54. We have next to consider the result of superposing or compounding two
                    simple harmonic motions which take place in the same line. The geometrical
                    method amply suffices for this purpose provided <hi rend="italic">the
                    periods</hi> of the two are equal, however different may be their amplitudes and
                    their phases. For, if we suppose PQ (fig. 16) to turn about P in the same plane
                    and with the same angular velocity as OP about 0, the angle OPQ will remain
                    unaltered, and therefore the triangle OPQ will remain of constant size and form
                    while turning about 0. Thus Q describes a circle about 0 in the given period.
                    The resolved parts of OP, PQ, along any diameter 0A, together make up the
                    resolved part of OQ along the same line. Hence <hi rend="italic">two simple
                    harmonic motions, of the same period and in the same line, are equivalent to a
                    single simple harmonic motion of the common period.</hi> The amplitude of the
                    resultant simple harmonic motion is OQ, and depends only upon OP, PQ, and the
                    angle OPQ,—the amplitudes of the two component simple harmonic motions and <hi
                    rend="italic">the supplement of the difference of their phases.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 55. When the difference of phase is <hi rend="italic">nil,</hi> or any whole
                    numberof circumferences, the resultant amplitude is thesum of the amplitudes of
                    the components, which is its greatest value. When the difference of phase is an
                    odd number of semi-circumferences, the amplitude of the resultant is the
                    difference of those of the components.</p>
                <p>If we produce QP to meet OA in R, we see that QOA, the phase of the resultant
                    simple harmonic motion, is intermediate in value to the phases of the
                    components, which are POA and QRA respectively. Its excess over the one, and its
                    defect from the other, are the angles at Oand Q in the triangle OPQ; and their
                    sines are to one another as the separate amplitudes QP, PO. Hence, when these
                    amplitudes differ, the phase of the resultant coincides more nearly with that of
                    the component whose amplitude is the greater.</p>

                <p>Also, for the epoch of the resultant, we have <hi rend="subscript"> λ</hi> αsine

                    in value to tan e and tan <hi rend="italic">e'.</hi></p>
                <p>When the periods of the components are not exactly equal, the simple artifice
                    which follows enables us still to apply the same method of composition. We have
                    now <hi rend="italic">x</hi> = αcos <hi rend="italic">(ωt</hi> + e) + <hi
                    rend="italic">a'</hi> cos <hi rend="italic">(ω't</hi> + e'), = a cos (a√ + e) +

                <p>Hence the above values of P and Q will still satisfy the conditions if we write
                    e'+(ω'-ω)&lt; instead of e'. Thus we may treat the two components as being of
                    the same period, but make the epoch of one of them steadily increase with an
                    angular velocity equal to the difference of the angular velocities in the
                    generating circles of the components.</p>
                <p>The triangle OPQ will no longer preserve its form; it will pass <hi rend="italic"
                    >continuously</hi> through all the various forms which we have seen would be
                    given to it by various differences of phase in the component simple harmonic
                    motions. The time in which it returns to a former value is evidently 2∙∏∙∕(ω' -
                    ω), which is greater the more nearly equal are the periods of the
                    components.</p>
                <p>§ 56. One of the best examples of the principles we have just discussed is
                    furnished by the tides. If there were but one tide-producing body, we should
                    have (approximately) a simple harmonic rise and fall of the sea-level at any
                    given place twice over in the course of about twenty-four hours, and the phase
                    would depend simply upon the distance of the tide-producing body from the
                    meridian (whether above or below the pole). The joint effect of the sun and moon
                    is practically the resultant of the effects which they would separately produce.
                    Hence, when these bodies are in conjunction or in opposition <hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> at new or at full moon), the whole rise of the tide is the sum of
                    the solar and lunar tides; and we have what are called “spring tides.” When the
                    moon is in quadrature, the amplitude of the tidal rise or fall is the excess of
                    the lunar over the solar tide, for it is low water as regards the sun when it is
                    high water as regards the moon. In intermediate positions the effect lies
                    between these extremes, but the joint high-tide lies nearer to the crest of the
                    lunar than to that of the solar tide. In the first and third quarters of the
                    moon, high tide is <hi rend="italic">earlier</hi> than the high tide due to the
                    moon alone; in the second and fourth <hi rend="italic">later.</hi> This is what
                    is called “priming” and “lagging” of the tides, and is seen at once to follow
                    from the construction given above. Had the lunar and solar tides been of equal
                    amplitude, spring tides would have been of double the altitude of either, and
                    there would have been no tide at all at the time of neap.</p>
                <p>The mode in which we have treated this special case is an illustration of the
                    general method (above described) of combining simple harmonic motions in which
                    the periods are slightly different.</p>
                <p>§ 57. What we have said of the tide-waves holds of course of all waves in which
                    the separate disturbances are so small that the joint effect is found by
                    superposing the separate effects. Thus when, at sea, two series σf waves of
                    equal length meefe at any place, the resultant is still a set of waves of the
                    same length, but the altitudes and phases of the components determine those of
                    the resultant. When crest meets crest, we have waves of the sum of the original
                    amplitudes; when crest meets trough, the difference. In the latter case we have
                    still water when the amplitudes of the components are equal. What is called a
                    “jabble,”—where, for a short time, a portion of a stormy sea is almost calm, and
                    after a little it is violently agitated,—is the result of a number of “cross
                    seas.”</p>
                <p>§ 58. If we now. consider the instantaneous form of a section of the surface,
                    instead of the successive displacements of one portion of it, we can easily
                    account for a striking phenomenon which is very frequently observed on a
                    shelving beach. We often notice that every ninth or tenth wave or so is higher
                    than those immediately before or after it. This is the result of superposition
                    of two or more sets of waves in which the distance from crest to crest is
                    different in the different sets. In the joint system we have, represented as in
                    § 53, phenomena akin to the spring and neap tides, and the priming and lagging
                    of the tides.</p>
                <p>Fig. 17 shows part of the result when the amplitudes are equal, and the
                    wave-lengths as 15 to 17. It gives also a rough approximation to the whole
                    result when the lengths are as 7 to 8 or as 8 to 9</p>
                <p>§ 59. To compound any number of simple harmonic motions, of equal periods, in one
                    line, we may obviously take them two by two, and apply the preceding process
                    over and over again till we have as final resultant another simple harmonic
                    motion of the common period.</p>
                <p>Or thus :—</p>
                <p>^ = 2αcos(α√ + e) = cos α√2(α cose) - siua√2(asin e) = Pcos(a&gt;i + Q), where P
                    cos Q = 2(a cose), PsinQ = 2(asine).</p>
                <p>When the separate periods are not equal, and not even <hi rend="italic"
                    >nearly</hi> equal, it is only in special cases that any simplification can be
                    effected by analytical processes. But this is not much to be regretted, because
                    for most purposes a graphic method is sufficiently accurate, and it can always
                    be easily carried out.</p>
                <p>§ 60. We must now consider the composition of simple harmonic motions in
                    directions at right angles to each other;—but for the present we confine
                    ourselves to the case in which their periods are equal. In this case we know
                    that the acceleration is in the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> ratio to the
                    displacement in each of the two rectangular directions. Hence by the general
                    theorem of § 50 the motion is elliptic, with uniform description of areas about
                    the centre.</p>
                <p>To analyse this, suppose, at starting, that their amplitudes also are equal. Let
                    OA, OB (fig. 18) represent the two rectangular directions. With centre O, and
                    radius equal to·the common amplitude, describe a circle. Let AOE, BOF represent
                    the epochs of the two components (the corresponding circular motion being
                    supposed positive for each), then obviously EOF exceeds by a right angle the
                    difference between the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n719/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0719-0688"/> phases of the motions in OB and OA. Then if P, Q
                    represent at time <hi rend="italic">t</hi> the corresponding positions in the
                    common circle, we have arc FQ = arc EP; and if perpendiculars be drawn, PM to
                    OA, and QN to OB, their intersection S is the position at time <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi> in the resultant motion. The locus of S is, by what has been proved
                    above, an ellipse which touches the sides of the square CDC'D'.</p>
                <p>When EOF is a right angle, <hi rend="italic">i.e,,</hi> when the phases are
                    alike, this ellipse becomes,the diagonal CO' of the square touching the circle
                    at the extremities of AA' and BB'. When EOF is three right angles, the ellipse
                    becomes the diagonal DD'. When it is two right angles, or four, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> when OB is one quarter, or three quarters, of a period
                    in advance of OA, the ellipse becomes the circle ABA'B'. To find in any case
                    whether it is described positively or negatively (§ 44), we have only to notice
                    how OS turns. Now while P is near A, MS remains closely coincident with AC. If,
                    then, Q be anywhere in the semicircle BA'B', N moves in the direetion BB' and
                    the angle AOS <hi rend="italic">diminishes.</hi> Hence the ellipse is described
                    negatively (or in the direction of the hands of a watch) if the epoch of the
                    motion in OB exceeds that of the motion in OA by anything up to two right
                    angles. And similar reasoning shows that, if the excess be from two to four
                    right angles, the ellipse is described positively.</p>
                <p>If the amplitudes be not equal, we have only to extend or foreshorten the figure
                    parallel to OA or to OB. The square CDC'D' becomes a rectangle, in which the
                    orbits (all of which, with the exception of the diagonals, are now ellipses) are
                    inscribed. Everything else is as before,</p>
                <p>§ 61. When the periods in the two component motions are nearly, but not quite,
                    equal, the phase of one gains gradually on the other, and the path passes
                    continuously through the forms of all the possible ellipses, but remains
                    possessed of the one property common to them all. It becomes a species of
                    spiral, but in every convolution it touches, in succession, each side of the
                    square or rectangle above discussed.</p>
                <p>§ 62. Similar reasoning shows that the superposition of any number of simple
                    harmonic motions in any directions and with any amplitudes and differences of
                    phase, provided the period is the same for all, gives rise to motion in an
                    ellipse about the centre. But this follows more easily from analysis.</p>

                    in fig. 19. When <hi rend="italic">a=nπ</hi> the curve is a portion of a
                    parabola, its vertex being to the right or left as <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is
                    odd or even. This parabola corresponds, in the present case, to the straight
                    lines in the case of § 62. When the periods differ slightly from the ratio 2:1,
                    the path passes in succession through the forms traced, forward and backward
                    alternately; and, each time that it opens out from the parabolic form, the
                    tracing-point describes it in the opposite direction to that in which it
                    described it before the path collapsed into the parabola.</p>
                <p>§ 64. The principles already illustrated are sufficient for the examination of
                    every case of this kind. But one or two particular cases merit special notice.
                    The case of two uniform circular motions of equal periods, in one plane, we have
                    already noticed (§54). Q describes its circle about P, P its circle about 0, and
                    the result is uniform circular motion of Q about 0. The radius of this circle
                    may be equal to the sum or difference of the radii of the separate circles, or
                    may have any intermediate value, according to the difference of phase. If the
                    periods be not exactly equal, the motion takes place virtually in a circle whose
                    radius continuously oscillates between the above limits. The path is a species
                    of spiral, which lies between two concentric circles of these radii.</p>
                <p>§ 65. When the component circular motions are in opposite directions, we have an
                    extremely interesting and important case. It is obvious that there must now be
                    positions in which OP and PQ are in the same straight <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n720/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0720-0689"/> line. Let 0A, AB (fig. 20) be one of these. Then,
                    in any other position, OP and PQ are equally inclined to OA. The path of Q is an
                    ellipse, of which the major semi-axis OB is the sum of the radii, and the minor
                    axis their difference. Hence when the radii are equal the result is simple
                    harmonic motion in the line OBB' Thus we have the proposition, of very great
                    importance in optics, that a simple harmonic motion may be looked upon as the
                    resultant of two equal and opposite circular motions in one plane.</p>
                <p>When the periods are not exactly equal, the motion may be regarded as simple
                    harmonic motion, in a line which rotates with uniform angular velocity in a
                    plane. This is the case of Foucault’s pendulum, and of plane polarized light
                    passing along the axis of a crystal of quartz, or through a piece of glass or
                    other transparent substance in the magnetic field.</p>
                <p>§ 66. Uniform circular motions, of different periods, give epicycloids, &amp;c. A
                    particular case is uniform circular motion superposed on uniform rectilinear
                    motion, in which case we have cycloids, &amp;c. But these we merely mention.</p>
                <p>§ 67.- By far the most important of the applications of simple harmonic analysis
                    is summed up in what is called <hi rend="smallcaps">Fourier’s Theorem.—</hi><hi

                    the variable.</hi></p>
                <p>To show the importance of this in physics we need take but a single example. The
                    one essential characteristic of a musical sound is its “periodicity.” Hence it
                    may be analysed into a series of simple harmonic disturbances. Their respective
                    periods are the fundamental period, its half, third, fourth part, &amp;c. The
                    first gives the pitch of the note; the others determine its quality. The
                    investigation which follows is not intended to prove the theorem; it is merely
                    introduced as readily suggesting it.</p>

                <p>Since the angular velocity of SP (fig. 21) and the inclination of this line to

                    rend="italic">p,</hi> where S∕&gt; is parallel and equal to PT, is evidently
                    another logarithmic spiral, similar to the former, and described with the same
                    constant angular velocity. Hence <hi rend="italic">pt,</hi> the acceleration
                    required, is equal to <hi rend="italic">eSp,</hi> and makes with Sp an angle
                    equal to SPT. Hence, if P« be drawn parallel and equal to <hi rend="italic"
                    >pt,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">uv</hi> parallel to PT, the whole acceleration
                    P« may be resolved into Pu and <hi rend="italic">vu</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Pvu</hi> is an isosceles triangle, whose base angles are

                    bear constant ratios to <hi rend="italic">Pu,</hi> and therefore also to SP or
                    PT.</p>
                <p>The acceleration, therefore, is composed of a central acceleration proportional
                    to the distance, and a tangential retardation proportional to the velocity. And,
                    if the resolved part of P’s motion parallel to any line in the plane of the
                    spiral be considered, it is obvious that in it also the acceleration will
                    consist of two parts—one directed towards a point in the line (the projection of
                    the pole of the spiral) and proportional to the distance from it, the other
                    proportional to the velocity but retarding the motion. Hence a particle which, ∣
                    unresisted, would have a simple harmonic motion has when subject to resistance
                    proportional to its velocity a motion represented by the resolved part of the

                <p>If <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be the angle of the spiral, ω the angular velocity of

                    geometrical method ceases to be simpler than the analytical one.</p>
                <p>§ 69. What we have said about composition of motions is merely a particular case
                    of the general question of relative motion, which in its main principles is
                    exceedingly simple. It is entirely comprehended in the following
                    propositions,—which may be regarded as almost self-evident.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Given the motion of</hi><hi rend="italic">Ä</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">with regard to a point 0, and that of B with regard to A, to find
                    that of B with regard to 0.</hi></p>
                <p>By compounding the vectors of relative position OA, AB, we have at once the
                    required vector OB. Thus it is obvious that we have only to add the separate
                    components of the velocity of A with regard to O, and those of B with regard to
                    A, to obtain those of B with regard to O. And, of course, the same rule applies
                    to the accelerations.</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">x, y, z</hi> be the coordinates of A (referred to 0) at time
                    <hi rend="italic">t</hi>; α∕, y, √ those of B referred to parallel axes from A;
                    ξ, <hi rend="italic">∙η,</hi> £ those of B referred to 0; we have at once</p>
                <p>ξ=x + a∕, <hi rend="italic">η=y + y'&gt;</hi> f=z + √.</p>
                <p>They give, by differentiation with regard to <hi rend="italic">t, ζ=x+x</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> &amp;c., <hi
                    rend="italic">ξ=x+x, &amp;c.,</hi> which constitute the analytical proof of the
                    statement above.</p>
                <p>§ 70. Hence we have the solution of the further question: <hi rend="italic">Given
                    the motions of A and B with regard to 0, to find the relative motion of B with
                    regard to A.</hi> In this case, of course, before compounding, the vector of A
                    must have its sign changed.</p>
                <p>Another very important case is that in which the motion is referred to axes which
                    are themselves moving. So long as their <hi rend="italic">directions</hi> remain
                    unchanged, this reduces itself to the former investigation as a mere question of
                    changed origin <hi rend="italic">; so</hi> that we need consider only the effect
                    of the change of direction of the axes. And this is at once deducible from the
                    results of last section. For we have only to consider, instead of the moving
                    point, its projections on the moving axes, and find <hi rend="italic">their</hi>
                    velocities and accelerations relative to fixed axes.</p>
                <p>Thus, if the rectangular axes of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi> be fixed, and those of ξ and <hi rend="italic">η</hi> be rotating in the
                    same plane, we have a datum of the form, <hi rend="italic">θ =</hi> angle <hi
                    rend="italic">ξθx =fit),</hi> giving the position of the moving axes in terms of
                    the time. Let P be the moving point, and PM perpendicular to Oξ (fig. 22). Then,
                    as the polar coordinates of Μ are <hi rend="italic">£, θ,</hi> we have, for its
                    velocity, <hi rend="italic">ξ</hi> along Oξ, <hi rend="italic">ξ0</hi> along
                    MP.</p>
                <p>But these must be combined with the velocity of P relative to Μ, which consists
                    of <hi rend="italic">ή</hi> along MP and <hi rend="italic">η0</hi> parallel to
                    <hi rend="italic">ξθ.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus the velocities parallel to fixed lines corresponding to the instantaneous
                    positions of Oξ and <hi rend="italic">Oη</hi> are, respectively, <hi
                    rend="italic">ζ-ηό</hi> and 17 + ξ⅛.</p>
                <p>In the same way it is easy to see, by § 47, that the corresponding components of
                    the acceleration are <hi rend="italic">Kinematics of a Rigid Plane Figure,
                    displaced in its own Plane.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 71. When a rigid plane figure is displaced anyhow in its own plane, the
                    displacement may always be regarded as the result of a definite rotation about a
                    definite axis perpendicular to the plane.</p>
                <p>The proof of this follows at once from the fact that, under the assigned
                    conditions, the figure has only three degrees of freedom; and consequently its
                    position is determinate whenever the positions of <hi rend="italic">any two</hi>
                    of its points are given. Also, a single rotation can, in general, be found which
                    will transfer these two points from one pair of assigned positions to
                    another.</p>
                <p>Let A, B, A',B' (fig. 23) be successive positions of two points of the figure.
                    Bisect A A' by the line Oα perpendi cular to it, and let Oδ do the same for BB'.
                    Let these perpendiculars meet in O. Then it is clear that the two triangles 0AB,
                    OA'B' are similar and equal. Hence AB may be regarded as having passed to the
                    position A'B' by rotation about an axis through O perpendicular to the plane of
                    the paper. The angle of rotation is A0A' or BOB'.</p>
                <p>The construction fails when Oα and Oδ coincide, but in this case it is evident
                    that the required point O is the point of intersection of BA and B'A' (fig. 24).
                    It also fails when the bisecting perpendiculars are parallel (fig. 25). But then
                    AA' and BB' are equal and parallel, and the displacement is a pure translation,
                    the same for every point of the plane figure, which may be regarded as an
                    infinitely small rotation about an infinitely distant axis.</p>
                <p>§ 72. Since any displacement in one plane corresponds in general to a rotation,
                    any two or more rotations about parallel axes can always be compounded into a
                    single one. Of two equal and opposite rotations the resultant is simple
                    translation. This is evident from fig. 26. In both cases A and B are the initial
                    positions, A' and B' the final positions of the two axes.</p>
                <p>In the first we begin with the rotation about A, in the second with that about
                    B.</p>
                <p>§ 73. When these equal rotations are <hi rend="italic">simultaneous</hi> instead
                    of <hi rend="italic">successive,</hi> the figure becomes a rectangle; <hi
                    rend="italic">—i.e.,</hi> the translation is perpendicular to the line joining
                    the axes. For in this case we may suppose the two rotations to be each broken up
                    into successive equal but infinitesimal instalments. And the principles of
                    infinitesimals show that two such instalments, either about the same or about
                    different axes, produce the same ultimate effects whether they be applied
                    simultaneously or successively. The general principle of which this is a
                    particular case is" called the “<hi rend="italic">principle of superposition of
                    small motions.”</hi> It is merely an application of the fact that infinitesimals
                    of the second order may be neglected in comparison with those of the first
                    order.</p>

                <p>The consideration of simultaneous rotations is very important. Suppose a plane
                    figure to rotate in its own plane, with angular velocity <hi rend="italic"
                    >ω,</hi> about the origin. Then it is obvious that <hi rend="italic">τω,</hi> in
                    a direction perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> is the velocity of a
                    point whose distance from the origin is <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> The components
                    are, therefore, <hi rend="italic">x — -yω,</hi> 2∕=iCω.</p>
                <p>If the rotation be about the point <hi rend="italic">a, b,</hi> these become <hi
                    rend="italic">x = -(y-b)ω, i∕ = (x-a)ω.</hi></p>
                <p>Hence, when there is any number of simultaneous rotations about parallel axes, we
                    have</p>
                <p>⅛= - y∑ω + ∑(δω), 2∕ = ir∑ω-2(αa&gt;).</p>
                <p>If we write Ω=2α&gt;, and α=⅛, <hi rend="italic">β≈^;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >2,ω</hi> 2ω</p>
                <p>we have ⅛=-(τ∕-β)Ω, ⅛'=(aj-α)Ω.</p>
                <p>These are the component velocities which the point <hi rend="italic">x, y</hi>
                    would have if there were only a single rotation, with angular velocity Ω, about
                    an axis passing through the point α, <hi rend="italic">β.</hi></p>
                <p>When 2(ω)=Ω = 0, we see that ≈ = 2(δω), #=-2(a«), so that all points of the
                    figure have equal velocities. This is the case of pure translation. Here α and
                    <hi rend="italic">β</hi> are (in general) each infinite;— <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> we have as resultant a vanishing angular velocity about an
                    infinitely distant axis.</p>
                <p>§ 74. As any displacement of a plane figure in its own plane is equivalent to a
                    rotation, we may represent a series of displacements by a series of rotations.
                    Also if we know the positions, in the figure itself, of the points which are
                    successively the axes, and likewise the position which each of them occupies in
                    space at the instant when the rotation about it takes place, we can construct
                    the whole motion. Let them be O, A, B, C, &amp;c., and 0, <hi rend="italic">a,
                    b, c,</hi> &lt;fcc., respectively (fig. 27). Then the figure turns about 0 till
                    A coincides with <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Next it turns about A (or <hi
                    rend="italic">a)</hi> till B coincides with <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and so on.
                    Hence the motion will be represented by the <hi rend="italic">rolling</hi> of
                    the polygon OABC, fixed in the moving figure, on the polygon Oαδc fixed in the
                    plane of the motion.</p>
                <p>In the limit, when the axis continuously shifts its position in the figure while
                    the rotation goes on round it, the polygons become plane curves. Thus we have
                    the fundamental proposition that any motion of a plane figure in its own plane
                    can be represented by the rolling of a curve attached to it, on a curve fixed in
                    space. Both curves are situated at an infinite distance when the motion is one
                    of pure translation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Kinematics of a Rigid Figure.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 75. When a spherical cap, or skin, moves on the surface of a sphere of equal
                    radius with which it is everywhere in contact, we may make the construction of §
                    71 with great circles bisecting the arcs AA' and BB'. Two great circles (unless
                    they coincide) always intersect at the extremities of one definite diameter. The
                    case of coincidence is met exactly as it was in § 71. Hence every motion of a
                    spherical skin on a sphere is equivalent to a rotation about a definite axis
                    through the centre of the sphere. Thus any number of successive or simultaneous
                    rotations about axes passing through one point can be compounded into a single
                    rotation about an axis passing through that point. And the construction of § 74
                    can be carried out with spherical polygons or curves, so that we see that any
                    motion of a rigid figure, one point of which is fixed, can be represented by the
                    rolling of a pyramid or cone, fixed in the figure, upon another fixed in
                    space.</p>
                <p>§ 76. The law of composition of simultaneous angular velocities about axes which
                    pass through one point is precisely the same as that for simultaneous linear
                    velocities of a moving point. The following simple geometrical process
                    establishes the proposition for two intersecting axes; and it is easy to see
                    that it can be extended to any number of such. Let OA and OB (fig. 28)
                    represent, the two axes, and let the lengths of these lines (both drawn in the
                    positive direction for the rotation about them) represent the angular velocities
                    corre spending. Then a point P, in the angle between the positive ends of the
                    axes, is raised above the plane of the paper by rotation about OA, but depressed
                    below it by the rotation about OB. The amounts of the elevation and depression
                    are pro portional to the distance from either axis, and to the angular velocity
                    about it, conjointly. Hence they will annihilate one another if, perpendiculars
                    PM, PN being drawn to the axes, we have</p>
                <p>0A.PM = 0B.PN.</p>
                <p>This is equivalent to saying that the areas of the triangles OAP, OBP, are
                    equal,—which necessitates that P should lie on the diagonal of the parallelogram
                    of which OA, OB are conterminous sides. Let OC be the diagonal of this
                    parallelogram. From what has been said above it is evident that the displacement
                    of any point in the plane is necessarily proportional to the algebraic sum of
                    the moments of OA and OB about it, and therefore (§ 46) to the moment of OC.
                    Hence all points in the line OC remain at rest, and the figure turns about that
                    line with an angular velocity represented by its length. This analogy to moments
                    shows the reason for the remarkable proposition that angular velocities, about
                    axes which intersect, are to be compounded according to the same law as linear
                    velocities.</p>
                <p>§ 77. Any proposition regarding simultaneous linear velocities or accelerations
                    has thus its counterpart in angular velocities and accelerations. Thus, as we
                    have seen (§ 36) that under acceleration in one plane, always perpendicular to
                    the direction of motion, a point moves with uniform velocity, so, if a figure be
                    rotating about one axis, and have angular acceleration about a second axis
                    always perpendicular to the first, the <hi rend="italic">direction</hi> of the
                    axis about which it rotates is changed, but not the angular velocity.</p>
                <p>It is to be noted that in such a case the direction of the axis changes not only
                    in space, but also in the rotating figure itself. This, however, is merely the
                    result of § 36 in a slightly altered form.</p>

                <p>§ 78. Any displacement whatever of a rigid figure may be effected by means of a
                    screw-motion, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> translation parallel to some definite
                    line, accompanied by a proportionate rotation about that line. Let A and A' be
                    successive positions of any point in the figure, and suppose the body to be
                    brought back by a mere translation so that A' coincides again with A. Then we
                    have seen (§ 75) that <hi rend="italic">one</hi> line of the figure through A is
                    necessarily restored to its original position. Let P be any plane section of the
                    figure, perpendicular to this line, P' its position after displacement. These
                    fully determine the initial and final positions of the whole figure. Shift P
                    into the plane of P' by a translation perpendicular to either, and let P" be its
                    position. P" can (§ 71) be brought to coincide with P' by a rotation in its own
                    plane. Hence the proposition. There is an exceptional case when P" requires only
                    translation to make it coincide with P'. But then the whole figure is merely
                    translated.</p>
                <p>§ 79. We have seen that the straight line representing an angular velocity is to
                    be resolved by the same process as that representing a linear velocity. If we
                    consider a figure to be rotating about axes fixed relatively to it,
                    accelerations of angular velocity about these will be represented by changes in
                    the lengths of the lines representing the angular velocities, and will therefore
                    be subject to the same conditions as the angular velocities themselves. Thus, as
                    it is obvious that a figure is rotating at any instant with the same angular
                    velocity about an axis fixed relatively to itself, and about another axis <hi
                    rend="italic">fixed in space,</hi> which at the given instant coincides with the
                    former, it follows that the angular accelerations about these axes are equal at
                    that instant.</p>
                <p>This is really the same proposition as that <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is the
                    velocity along a fixed line coinciding with the radius-vector <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> (§ 47). But, just as <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is not the complete
                    acceleration parallel to <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> if <hi rend="italic">r</hi>
                    be rotating, so the proposition above, though true for the first fluxion of the
                    angular velocity about a moving line, is not generally true for fluxions of
                    higher orders.</p>
                <p>As this subject is commonly regarded as somewhat obscure, we may give a more
                    formal examination of it by an analytical process. Suppose ω <hi

                <p>§ 80. To complete the kinematics of a rigid figure of which one point is fixed,
                    we require to have the means of calculating its position, after the lapse of any

                <p>But, except in some special cases, these equations are intractable. This,
                    however, is of little consequence, because in the applications to kinetics of a

                <p>It is clear that, if we know the positions of the revolving axes, referred to a

                <p>About the common origin of the two sets of axes suppose a sphere of unit radius
                    to be described. Let X, Y, Z (fig. 29) be the traces on this sphere of the fixed
                    axes, and A, B, C those of the revolving axes. Draw a great circle ZC so as to
                    meet in A' the quadrant BA produced. Then it is clear that the figure can be
                    constructed <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> that the data are sufficient for
                    calculation) if we know (a) the angle XZC,—this we call <hi rend="italic"

                    (c) the angle A'CA, or the arc A'A, called <hi rend="italic">φ.</hi></p>
                <p>For <hi rend="italic">X,</hi> Y, Z are given. Then</p>
                <p>(a) shows how to draw the great circle ZC, whose pole is N on the great circle
                    XY. Hence (δ) gives us the points C and A'. We can next draw the great circle
                    A'N, and A and B are found on it by (c), for A'A = NB <hi rend="italic">=
                    φ.</hi> We have now only to determine these angular coordinates in terms of the
                    angular velocities of the figure about 0A, OB, OC, which we denote by ω <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, ω <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, ω <hi rend="subscript"

                <p>The velocity of C along ZC is <hi rend="italic">θ.</hi> But it is produced by the

                <p>The velocity of C perpendicular to ZC is sinØ. <hi rend="italic">ψ.</hi> This

                <p>The velocity of A along AB is that of A' together with the rate of increase of

                <p>§ 82. The process above is essentially unsymmetrical. The first suggestion of a
                    symmetrical system is due to Euler, and depends upon the general proposition of
                    § 75. What we must seek is the single axis, and the angle of rotation about it,
                    which (by one operation) will bring the system or figure from its initial state
                    determined by X, Y, Z to its state at time <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> determined

                <p><hi rend="italic">Kinematics of a Deformable Figure. Strain.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 84. So far we have considered change of position of a figure of invariable
                    form. We must now consider changes of form and volume in the figure itself. This
                    is required for application to physical problems, such as compression of a
                    liquid or gas, the distortion of a piece of india-rubber, &amp;c. Any such
                    change of volume or form is called a “strain.” The treatment of strains is
                    entirely a kinematical question, until we come to regard them as produced in
                    physical bodies, and consider their cause.</p>
                <p>The system of forces which is said to produce a strain is called a “stress.” But,
                    just as we study velocity as a preparation for the discussion of the effect of
                    force on a free body, so we study strains as a preparation for the discussion of
                    the effects of stress.</p>
                <p>§ 85. In order to fix the ideas, it is convenient to suppose the figure which is
                    to undergo strain to be cut up into an infinite number of similar, equal, and
                    similarly situated parellelepipeds. This is effected at once by supposing it to
                    be cut by three series of planes, those of each series being parallel to one
                    another, and equidistant. No two of these three series must be parallel, but the
                    distance from plane to plane need not be the same in any two of the series. If
                    the strain be <hi rend="italic">continuous</hi> there will be no finite
                    difference of effect upon any two neighbouring parallelepipeds;—but in general
                    their edges, which originally formed three series of parallel straight lines,
                    will become series of curves. No two parallelepipeds of the system will in
                    general be altered in precisely the same manner. This is called “heterogeneous
                    strain.”</p>
                <p>J 86. We found it convenient to study uniform speed before proceeding to consider
                    variable speed, and so we find it convenient to take up first what is called <hi
                    rend="italic">Homogeneous Strain.—</hi> A figure is said to be homogeneously
                    strained when all parts of it originally equal, similar, aud similarly situated
                    remain equal, similar, and similarly situated, however much they may
                    individually have been altered in form, volume, and position.</p>
                <p>Now recur to our set of parallelepipeds. After a homogeneous strain these remain
                    equal, similar, and similarly situated. Hence <hi rend="italic">they must remain
                    parallelepipeds,</hi> for they must together still continuously make up the
                    volume of the altered figure. Thus planes remain planes, and straight lines
                    remain straight lines. Equal parallel straight lines remain equal and parallel.
                    Parallel planes remain parallel, ellipses remain ellipses (as is obvious from
                    their properties relative to conjugate diameters), ellipsoids remain ellipsoids,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>But we can now easily see how many conditions fully determine a homogeneous
                    strain. For if we know how each of three conterminous edges of any one of the
                    original parallelepipeds is altered in length and direction, we can build up the
                    whole altered system. Hence, to fully describe a homogeneous strain, we require
                    merely to know what changes take place in the lengths and directions of three
                    unit lines not in one plane. Three numbers are required for the altered lengths,
                    and two (analogous, say, to altitude and azimuth, or latitude and longitude, or
                    R.A. and N.P.D.) for each of the altered directions. Hence, in general, a
                    homogeneous strain depends upon, and is fully characterized by, <hi
                    rend="italic">nine</hi> independent numbers.</p>
                <p>§ 87. The simplest form of strain is that which is due to uniform hydrostatic
                    stress acting on a homogeneous isotropic body. Here directions remain unaltered,
                    and the lengths of all lines are altered in the same ratio. Every portion of the
                    original figure remains similar to itself, its linear, superficial, and volume
                    dimensions being altered as the first, second, and third powers of that
                    ratio.</p>
                <p>Next in order of simplicity is the case in which there are three directions, at
                    right angles to one another, which suffer no change except as regards <hi
                    rend="italic">length.</hi> This state of things would be produced in a
                    homogeneous isotropic body by three longitudinal extensions or compressions in
                    lines at right angles to one another, or by hydrostatic pressure in a
                    homogeneous non-isotropic solid. In this case, if the changes of length above
                    spoken of are all different, an originally spherical figure becomes an
                    ellipsoid, with three unequal axes parallel respectively to the lines whose
                    directions remain unaltered. Every line in the body not originally parallel to
                    one of these is altered in direction. If one of the principal changes of length
                    be an extension, and another a shortening, there will be a cone formed of lines
                    which are not altered in length. This is seen at once by describing from the
                    centre of the ellipsoid a sphere equal to the original sphere. One axis of the
                    ellipsoid being greater than the radius of the sphere, and another less, the
                    ellipsoid and sphere must intersect; and all lines drawn from the common centre
                    to the curve of intersection are unaltered in length (though all altered, as
                    before remarked, in direction).</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n725/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0725-0694"/>
                <p>When two only of the changes of length are equal, the ellipsoid becomes one of
                    rotation, oblate or prolate as the case may be; and if the radius of the sphere
                    be intermediate in value to the axes of this rotation-ellipsoid, we have a <hi
                    rend="italic">right</hi> cone of rays unaltered in length.</p>
                <p>When all three changes of length are equal we have the simplest possible
                    case,—which has been already treated.</p>
                <p>§ 88. The essential element in these particular cases is that three lines at
                    right angles to one another are unaltered in direction by the strain. ' Here
                    there is a mere change of form, and the strain is said to be “pure,” or “free
                    from rotation.” Such a strain, in its most general form, is fully characterised
                    by <hi rend="italic">six</hi> independent numbers. For a system of three
                    mutually perpendicular lines is fully given in direction by <hi rend="italic"
                    >three</hi> numbers, and three more are required for the changes of length which
                    they severally undergo.</p>
                <p>But, in general, a strain is not pure. It will be shown, however, below that the
                    principal axes of the ellipsoid into which a sphere is changed by any strain,
                    and which is called the “strain ellipsoid,” were originally radii of the sphere
                    at <hi rend="italic">right</hi> angles to one another. Hence the strain may be
                    looked upon as made up of two operations, viz., a pure strain, and a rotation
                    through a definite angle about an axis in a definite position in space. The axes
                    of the pure strain are lines fixed in the figure.</p>
                <p>§ 89. It is useful, in farther considering the subject, to introduce along with
                    the original strain (thus analysed), another which is called its “conjugate.”
                    This is defined as composed of an equal pure strain with the first with an equal
                    but opposite rotation. And the separate component operations must be taken in
                    the opposite order in the strain and in its conjugate.</p>
                <p>The successive application of the strain and its conjugate thus necessarily leads
                    to the reduplication (or squaring) of the pure part of the strain, and to the
                    annihilation of the rotation. For, call the parts, as operators, P and R. The
                    strain and its conjugate, referred to axes fixed in space, may be either</p>
                <p>RP and PR- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> or P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    RandR^ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, according
                    as the pure strain or the rotation is first applied. The operations in each
                    group are written, from right to left, in the order in which they are performed.
                    Thus RP means the pure strain P, followed by the rotation R.</p>
                <p>§ 90. The final results are P <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> and P’. In the first
                    case we have the pure strain, followed by the rotation; then (by the conjugate)
                    the rotation is undone, and the pure strain reapplied. In the second we rotate
                    first, then apply the pure strain twice, and finally undo the rotation. Thus the
                    student must be cautioned against the error of supposing that the results of
                    applying PR and RP separately are generally the same. Perhaps it will be easier
                    for the reader to consider the “reciprocal,” instead of the conjugate, of a
                    strain. For if the strain be RP, the reciprocal is obviously P^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> R* <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> j if it be PR, the
                    reciprocal is R^ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> P^ <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi>. Either pair of these, taken in either order, restores the figure to its
                    primitive form. The one point to be noticed is that, in whatever order the
                    direct component operations are supposed to occur in the strain, their
                    reciprocals must be taken in the opposite order in the reciprocal strain. The
                    reciprocal strain simply undoes the strain, and therefore differs from the
                    conjugate by a factor, the square of the pure part of the strain.</p>
                <p>From this we have at once, as will be seen later, the means of decomposing a
                    given strain into its pure and its rotational factors. This is effected as soon
                    as we can form the expression for the conjugate strain in terms of that for the
                    strain itself.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> 91. As, in general, any strain converts a
                    spherical portion of a figure into an ellipsoid, and as an ellipsoid has two
                    series of parallel <hi rend="italic">circular sections,</hi> it appears that in
                    every strain there are two series of <hi rend="italic">planes of no
                    distortion.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We here
                    exclude spheres and ellipsoids of rotation. The latter have only one series of
                    circular sections, the former an infinite number.</p></note> The consideration
                    of these planes leads us to a second and very different mode of analysing a
                    strain into simpler components. Perhaps the most elementary mode of considering
                    this subject is by thinking of the motion of water flowing slowly down a uniform
                    channel. We know that water, at ordinary pressures, is practically
                    incompressible; also that the upper layers of the water in a canal flow faster
                    than those below them. Hence the definition of a “simple shear.” Let one plane
                    of a figure be fixed, and let the various planes parallel to it slide over it
                    and over one another, all in the same direction, and with velocities
                    proportional to their distances from the fixed plane. It is clear that this
                    shear produces homogeneous strain in the figure, but it is mere change of form
                    without change of volume. The fixed plane and all those parallel to it, are
                    planes of no distortion. But we have seen that there must be two sets of such
                    planes. To find the second set, let us suppose the plane of fig. 30 to be
                    parallel to the common direction of sliding, and perpendicular to the fixed
                    plane. This plane, so defined, is the plane of the shear. Let AB be the trace on
                    it of the fixed plane, PQ that of one of the sliding planes, PP' the amount of
                    its sliding. Bisect PP' in Μ by a perpendicular, meeting AB in A. Join AP, take
                    AB = AP, and draw BQ parallel to AP, Consider the strain of the rhomboidal
                    portion APQB of the figure. P moves to P', and Q to Q', where QQ' = PP'. Hence
                    the rhombus remains a rhombus, for AP' = AP = AB. But the lengths of its
                    diagonals have been interchanged. It has been subjected to an elongation of AQ,
                    and a contraction of BP, each in the same ratio (so that their product, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> double the area of the rhombus, remains unaltered),
                    while all lines perpendicular to the plane of the figure remain unaltered. From
                    the'symmetry of the rhombus it is obvious that AQ' and BP' are the greatest and
                    least axes of the strain ellipsoid, while AB and AP' are parallel to its
                    circular sections. Planes originally parallel to AP and perpendicular to the
                    paper are therefore the second set of planes of no distortion. The rotational
                    part of the shear may be measured in terms of the angle PAM, but is given
                    directly by PBP', and its axis is perpendicular to the plane of the figure. The
                    most convenient measure of the shear is the ratio of PP' to AM, or, what
                    involves the same, the angle PAP'. Another mode of measuring it is by means of
                    the ratio BP∕AQ, = 1 + <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> suppose. If <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> be a small quantity, as is usually the case with solids, we may write 1
                    ÷ <hi rend="italic">e</hi> for the measure of the shear. Here <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> indicates the extension per unit of length along one diagonal of the
                    rhombus, and the contraction per unit of length along the other.</p>
                <p>§ 92. It is quite clear from what has been said that we can analyse a strain by
                    the help of simple shears compounded with different forms of pure strain. For
                    the shears may be taken in an infinite number of ways so as to produce the
                    rotational part of the given strain, while also producing deformation without
                    change of volume. The final adjustment is to be made by a pure strain, whose
                    axes are those of the strain ellipsoid due to the shears. As a shear depends on
                    four quantities only, two shears and a dilatation furnish the nine constants
                    required for a homogeneous strain.</p>

                <p>The successive application of two pure strains does not, except in special cases,
                    give rise to a pure strain. This is, physically, a most important proposition.
                    Thus, for instance, the instantaneous strains of each element of a perfect fluid
                    in which there is no vortex motion are pure; and yet, if the element be followed
                    in its motion, it will be found in general to rotate. Its motion is said to be
                    “differentially irrotational.”</p>
                <p>To prove this proposition by the help of a particular case is simple enough.
                    Take, for instance, a compression in one direction, followed by an equal
                    extension in a different direction. Only when these directions are at right
                    angles to one another is the resultant strain pure.</p>
                <p>§ 93. The analytical theory of strains is, at least in its elements, an immediate
                    application of the properties of determinants, usually of the third order. We
                    subjoin a slight sketch of it.</p>
                <p>We have seen that it is only necessary, for the full characterizing of a strain,
                    that we should know what becomes of three unit lines not originally coplanar.

                <p>Here it is obvious, from the premises, that the nine quantities <hi rend="italic"
                    >a, b, c; d, e, f; g, h, i</hi> are all real, and altogether independent, at

                <p>If we compare this with the general expression above given for a strain, we see
                    that the coefficient of <hi rend="italic">y</hi> in the value of <hi
                    rend="italic">x!</hi> is <hi rend="italic">equal</hi> to that of <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> in the value of <hi rend="italic">y'.</hi> Similarly that
                    of <hi rend="italic">z</hi> in <hi rend="italic">x'</hi> is equal to that of <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> in <hi rend="italic">z!</hi>; and that of z in y' is equal
                    to that of y in z ’; or finally <hi rend="italic">b≈d, c=g, f=h.</hi></p>
                <p>Conversely, when these three conditions are satisfied, and not otherwise, the
                    strain is pure. It is to be observed that ξ, <hi rend="italic">η, ζ</hi> form a
                    rectangular system, and thus the nine direction cosines (usually involving <hi
                    rend="italic">six</hi> arbitrary numbers) depend here on three numbers alone.
                    Thus there are six independent numbers, corresponding to <hi rend="italic">a, e,

                <p>Hence when we apply (2) to a figure previously strained by the reciprocal of (1)
                    the result is the strain (1'). Hence we verify that the latter is the conjugate
                    of (1); as it possesses the properties described in § 90, all of which are thus
                    established.</p>
                <p>To analyse a strain in the simplest manner, we must find the axes of the strain

                    distorted into them. It is more direct, however, to consider the ellipsoid which
                    becomes a unit sphere in consequence of the strain. „The equation of that

                <p>This equation is known to have three real positive roots, because the determinant
                    is symmetrical. The roots are the squared reciprocals of the semi-axes of the
                    ellipsoid, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> they are the squares of the semi-axes of
                    the strain ellipsoid.</p>
                <p>When the three values of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> have been found from this
                    equation, any two of the equations (4) give in an unambiguous form the
                    corresponding values of the ratios <hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >:</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">: z</hi> for each of them. Thus
                    we know the original positions of the lines which become the axes of the strain
                    ellipsoid. Their final positions are found from these by means of (A). And,
                    since we thus know the original and final positions of the rectangular system,
                    the method of Rodrigues enables us to calculate the axis and amount of the
                    rotation.</p>
                <p>In homogeneous strain, one direction at least is unchanged. This is an addition

                <p>Then, writing only the second term of <hi rend="italic">x"</hi> and the first of

                <p>It is clear that, in general, this is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a pure strain.
                    But it is also clear that a third pure strain can be found whose application in
                    succession to the other two will give a pure strain.</p>
                <p>For let the last equations be written <hi rend="italic">x"=a"x + b"y+c"z, y"
                    =d"x+e"y+f"z, z!</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">= g"x + h"y + i"z;</hi> and let us

                <p>There are but three conditions to satisfy, that this strain may be pure. But we
                    may accomplish this in an infinite number of ways, for we have five disposable
                    quantities, viz., the ratios of any five of α, <hi rend="italic">e, ι, β,
                    γ,</hi> δ to the remaining one. In a precisely similar manner we may show that
                    three pure strains can be found, such that their resultant is a mere rotation.
                    In fact, all we have to do, since two pure strains in general produce a
                    distortion accompanied by rotation, is to apply a pure strain to annihilate the
                    distortion, which can of course always be done.</p>
                <p>§ 94. In general when a figure is continuously strained, which is usually the
                    case in physical applications, at least until cracks occur, the strain is not
                    homogeneous. But, on account of the continuity of the strain, portions
                    indefinitely near one another are strained indefinitely nearly alike. Hence we
                    may treat such a case by the ordinary process for homogeneous strain, so long as
                    we confine our attention to small regions of the figure strained. When there is
                    discontinuity in the motion of a fluid, it is the common practice to treat the
                    motion as continuous by the fiction of an infinitely thin vortex-sheet
                    separating the two discontinuously moving portions. This is, in all likelihood,
                    physically true in ordinary fluids; but, so far as the imaginary frictionless
                    fluid of the mathematicians is concerned, it is a mere analytical artifice to
                    enable us to carry out the investigation. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Atom</hi> and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Hydromechanics,</hi> in which the mathematical theory of
                    “vortex motion” is very fully considered.</p>
                <p>Suppose space to be uniformly occupied by points which are displaced in a

                    rend="italic">x, y, z.</hi> The continuity of the displacement requires merely

                <p>This, as seems to have been first pointed out by Stokes, can be expressed as a
                    simple integral in the form <hi rend="italic">f (fdx + ηdy + ζdz)</hi> extended
                    round the boundary of the surface. Hence the double integral has the same value
                    for all finite surfaces having the same boundary; and, as a consequence, it
                    vanishes when taken over a closed simply-connected surface. Hence we see at once
                    that it vanishes for multiply-connected surfaces also. The proof of the equality
                    of the single and double integral has only to be established for a mere surface
                    element. For, when that is done, the common boundary of each pair of elements
                    gives equal portions, with opposite signs, in the single integral.</p>
                <p>Directly connected with the displacements of a group of points, we have the
                    question, <hi rend="italic">What is the mathematical expression of the fact that
                    the number of points is not altered I</hi> There are many ways of answering
                    this; but the following, which is immediately deducible from our recent
                    investigation, seems sufficiently simple. If <hi rend="italic">I, m, n</hi> be
                    the direction cosines of the normal to an element o?S of a singly-connected
                    closed surface, the number of points which pass through the element in the time

                <p>(Zξ <hi rend="italic">+ mη + nζ)pdSSt,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is the
                    number of points per unit volume at <hi rend="italic">x, y, z.</hi> But at every
                    point inside the closed surface the density is altered from <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> to <hi rend="italic">p + pSt.</hi> It will be noticed that ξ, <hi

                    rend="italic">z</hi> components of velocity.</p>
                <p>Hence, if the excess of the number of points passing into the surface over those

                <p>In any one of the last four forms the expression is called the “equation of
                    continuity,” another of the preposterously ill-chosen terms which have been
                    introduced with only too great success into the nomenclature of our subject.</p>
                <p>§ 95. In the strains which we have hitherto considered all parts of a figure were
                    regarded as capable of changing their form and volume; and the strain of any
                    element, when not identical with that of a proximate element, was supposed to
                    differ only infinitesimally from it. But there is another class of changes of
                    form, for which this restriction does not hold. The most important case, and the
                    only one we can here consider, is that of “link-work.” Here each finite piece is
                    treated as incapable of change of form, and the change of form of the whole
                    depends merely upon the relative motions of the parts. We will further restrict
                    ourselves by the condition that the link-work is such that its form is
                    determinate when the relative position of two of its parts is assigned. Thus, a
                    jointed parallelogram is completely determined in form if the angle between two
                    of its sides is assigned. Instead of an angle, we may assign the length of a
                    diagonal; then the fact that the sum of the squares of the diagonals is equal to
                    that of the squares of the sides determines the other diagonal. This gives us
                    the kinematics of the more complex arrangement called “lazy-tongs.” The most
                    important applications of this branch of our subject are to what is called
                    “Mechanism.” One important practical problem in that branch was suggested by a
                    stationary steam-engine, in which it was required to connect, by link-work of
                    some kind, a point (of the piston-rod), which had a to-and-fro motion in a
                    straight line, with another point (of the beam) which had a to-and-fro motion in
                    a circular arc. Watt’s original solution of the problem depends ultimately upon
                    the near approach to rectilinearity of the motion of any point of a rod whose
                    extremities move in two circles in the same plane. Thus, if OP, PQ, QO' (fig.
                    31) be three ,bars jointed together at P and Q, having 0 and O <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> fixed, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n729/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0729-0698"/> the whole constrained to move in one plane, it is
                    easy to see that the complete path of any point R of PQ is a species of figure
                    of eight. A portion of that curve on each side of a point of inflexion (where
                    the curvature vanishes) was found to be sufficiently straight for practical
                    purposes.</p>
                <p>But the rigorous solution of this problem has only been arrived at in recent
                    times; and the beautiful device of Peaucellier, which we will briefly explain,
                    has led to a host of remarkable investigations and discoveries in a field
                    regarded till lately as perfectly hopeless. A simple mode of arriving at
                    Peaucellier’s result is as follows.</p>
                <p>Let PQ, PR (fig. 32) be <hi rend="italic">equal</hi> links, and PO a link of a
                    different length, all jointed together at P. Suppose O to be fixed, and Q and R
                    constrained to move in a fixed straight line OQR, what is the relation between
                    OQ and OR? We have, if PS be perpendicular to QR,</p>
                <p>OP <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> =OS <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + SP <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>,</p>
                <p>QP <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> =QS <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + SP <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> j whence</p>
                <p>OP <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>- QP <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> =OS <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>- QS <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> =OQ.OR.</p>
                <p>Thus the rectangle under OQ and OR is constant <hi rend="italic">; so</hi> that,
                    if R were to describe a straight line, Q would describe a circle having 0 on its
                    circumference. In practical application, to keep O, Q, R in one line, the parts
                    of the link-work are doubled symmetrically about that line, so that it takes the
                    form of a jointed rhombus PQP'R (fig. 33) with two equal links, PO, OP' attached
                    at the extremities of a diagonal. As a very curious result of this arrangement,
                    if OQ have its length changed by any very small amount, the corresponding change
                    of length of OR is directly as OR <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> or inversely as
                    OQ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. Hence, as will be seen later, a constant
                    force (towards or from 0) acting at Q will be balanced by a force (from or
                    towards 0) acting at R and varying inversely as the square of OR.</p>

                <p>§ 96. We commence with a few necessary definitions. A “physical particle” is a
                    purely abstract conception, embodying together the ideas of inertia and of a
                    geometrical point. It is, so to speak, a mathematical fiction, embracing only
                    those properties which are required for our temporary purpose. Any mass, however
                    large, can be treated as a particle, provided the forces to which it is subject
                    are exerted in lines passing through its “centre of inertia” or “centre of mass”
                    (this term will presently be defined), so as to be incapable of setting the mass
                    into rotation. This is, to a first approximation, true of planetary motions, but
                    when we look more closely into that question, so as for instance to take account
                    of the oblate forms of the planets, we have to deal with forces which produce
                    rotatory effects, such as “precession” and “nutation.”</p>
                <p>§97. The “quantity of matter” in a body, or the “mass,” is proportional to the
                    “volume” and the “density” conjointly. The “density” may therefore be defined as
                    the quantity of matter in unit volume.</p>
                <p>If Μ be the mass, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> the density, and V the volume of a
                    homogeneous body, we have at once</p>
                <p>M = V <hi rend="subscript"> p</hi>, provided we so take our units that unit of
                    mass is the mass of unit volume of a body of unit density. Hence the dimensions
                    of <hi rend="italic">p</hi> are [ML <hi rend="superscript"> -3</hi>].</p>
                <p>As will be presently explained, the most convenient unit mass is an <hi
                    rend="italic">imperial pound,</hi> or a <hi rend="italic">gramme,</hi> of
                    matter.</p>
                <p>§ 98. The “quantity of motion,” or the “momentum,” of a moving body is
                    proportional to its mass and velocity conjointly. As already stated this is,
                    like velocity, a directed quantity, or “vector.” Its dimensions are, of course,
                    [MLT <hi rend="superscript"> -1</hi>].</p>
                <p>§ 99. “Change of quantity of motion,* or “change of momentum,” is proportional to
                    the mass moving and the change of its velocity conjointly.</p>
                <p>Change of velocity is to be understood in the general sense of § 32. Thus, with
                    the notation of that section, if a velocity represented by OA be changed to
                    another represented by OB, the change of velocity is represented in magnitude
                    and direction by AB.</p>
                <p>§ 100. “Rate of change of momentum,” or “acceleration of momentum,” is
                    proportional to the mass moving and the acceleration of its velocity conjointly.
                    Thus (§ 36) the acceleration of momentum of a particle moving in a curve is Ms
                    along the tangent, and Mv <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∕p in the radius of
                    absolute curvature. The dimensions of this quantity are [MLT^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>].</p>
                <p>§ 101. The “vis viva,” or “kinetic energy,” of a moving body is proportional to
                    the mass and the square of the speed conjointly. If we adopt the same units of
                    mass and velocity as above, there is particular advantage in defining kinetic
                    energy as <hi rend="italic">half</hi> the product of the mass into the square of
                    its speed. Its dimensions are [ML <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> T~ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>].</p>
                <p>§ 102. “Rate of change of kinetic energy,” thus defined, is the product of the
                    speed into the component of acceleration of momentum in the direction of
                    motion.</p>

                <p>§ 104. “Force,” as we have already seen, is any cause which alters a body’s
                    natural state of rest, or of uniform motion in a straight line.</p>
                <p>The three elements specifying a force, or the three elements which must be known
                    before a clear notion of the force under consideration can be formed, are—its
                    place of application, its direction, and its magnitude. The place of application
                    may be a surface, as when one body presses on another; or it may be throughout
                    the whole mass of a body, as in the case of the earth’s attraction for it.</p>
                <p>The “measure of a force” is the rate at which it produces momentum, or the
                    momentum which it produces in unit of time, which is the same as what we have
                    already called “rate of change of momentum.” According to this method of
                    measurement <hi rend="italic">the standard or unit force is that force which,
                    acting on the unit of matter during the unit of</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n730/mode/1up"

                    velocity.</hi> The dimensions of force are therefore [MLT^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>].</p>
                <p>§ 105. Hence the British absolute unit force is the force which, acting on one
                    pound of matter for one second, generates a velocity of one foot per second.</p>
                <p>[According to the system followed till lately in treatises on dynamics, the unit
                    of mass is <hi rend="italic">g</hi> times the mass of the standard weight, <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> being the numerical value of the acceleration produced (in
                    some particular locality) by the earth’s attraction. This definition, giving a
                    varying unit of mass, is exceedingly inconvenient. In reality, standards of
                    weight are <hi rend="italic">masses,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">forces.</hi>
                    They are employed primarily for the purpose of measuring out a definite <hi
                    rend="italic">quantity</hi> of matter, not an amount of matter which shall be
                    attracted by the earth with a given force.]</p>
                <p>§ 106. To render our standard intelligible, all that has to be done is to find
                    how many absolute units will produce, in any particular locality, the same
                    effect as does gravity. The way to do this is to measure the effect of gravity
                    in producing acceleration on a body unresisted in any way. The most accurate
                    method is indirect, by means of the pendulum. The result of pendulum experiments
                    made at Leith Fort, by Captain Kater, is that the velocity acquired by a body
                    falling unresisted for one second is at that place 32 ’ 207 feet per second. The
                    variation in gravity for one degree of difference of latitude about the latitude
                    of Leith is only Ό000832 its own amount. The average value for the whole of
                    Great Britain differs but little from 32 ’ 2; that is, the attraction of gravity
                    on a pound of matter in the country is 32 ’ 2 times the force which, acting on a
                    pound for a second, would generate a velocity of one foot per second. Thus,
                    speaking very roughly, the British absolute unit of force is equal to the weight
                    of about half an ounce. The quantity of 32'2 feet per second per second is
                    usually called <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> Its dimensions are obviously [LT^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>]. And, if Μ be the mass of a body, its weight is My.
                    In the <hi rend="italic">Centimetre-Gramme-Second</hi> system of units, the
                    absolute unit of force produces in one second, in a mass of one gramme, a
                    velocity of one centimetre per second.</p>
                <p>§ 107. Forces (since they involve only direction and magnitude) may be
                    represented, as velocities are, by vectors, that is, by straight lines drawn in
                    their directions, and of lengths proportional to their magnitudes
                    respectively.</p>
                <p>Also the laws of composition and resolution of any number of forces acting at the
                    same point are, as we shall presently show (§ 117), the same as those which we
                    have already proved to hold for velocities; so that, with the substitution of
                    force for velocity, § 30 is still true.</p>
                <p>§ 108. The “component” of a force in any direction is therefore found by
                    multiplying the magnitude of the force by the cosine of the angle between the
                    directions of the force and the component. The remaining component in this case
                    is perpendicular bo the other.</p>
                <p>It is very generally convenient to resolve forces into components parallel to
                    three lines at right angles to each other, each such resolution being effected
                    by multiplying by the cosine of the angle concerned.</p>
                <p>The magnitude of the resultant of two or of three forces in directions at right
                    angles to each other is the square root of the sum of their squares.</p>
                <p>: § 109. The “centre of inertia or mass” of any system of material particles
                    whatever (whether rigidly connected with one another, or connected in any way,
                    or quite detached) is a point whose distance from any plane is equal to the sum
                    of the products of each mass into its distance from the same plane, divided by
                    the sum of the masses.</p>

                    the sum of the momenta of the parts of the system in any direction is equal to
                    the momentum in that direction of the whole mass collected at the centre of
                    mass.</p>
                <p>The problem of finding the centre of inertia of any given distribution of matter
                    is a question of mere mathematics. We must confine ourselves to a few examples
                    only. And, first, we may note that when a body is symmetrical about a plane the
                    centre of inertia must obviously lie in that plane. Thus, as an ellipsoid and a
                    rectangular parallelepiped have each three planes of symmetry, their centres of
                    inertia lie at their centres of figure, where these planes meet. Again, it is
                    obvious that, if a body can be divided into parts the centres of inertia of
                    which lie on a straight line, the centre of inertia of the whole is in that
                    line. Thus, as a triangular plate may be divided into strips parallel to one
                    side, every one of which has its centre of inertia at its middle point, the
                    centre of inertia of such a plate is the point of intersection of the bisectors
                    of the sides. Its distance from any one side, treated as base, is therefore
                    one-third of the height. Again, if a triangular pyramid (or tetrahedron) be
                    divided into triangular slices by planes parallel to one face treated as base,
                    the centres of inertia of all the slices lie in a straight line. Hence the
                    distance of the centre of inertia from the base is one-fourth of the height. If
                    the base be of any other form, it may be divided into triangles, and thus the
                    whole pyramid (or cone) into tetrahedra, for each of which the same property
                    holds. Hence the centre of inertia of a pyramid divides the line joining the
                    vertex to the centre of inertia of the base in the ratio 3:1. All this is on the
                    supposition that the solids treated of are of uniform density. When we deal
                    either with more complex forms or with heterogeneous bodies, we must in general
                    have recourse to integration.</p>
                <p>For a continuous body we must take an element of mass, say pδzδyδz, at the point
                    <hi rend="italic">x, y, z</hi> instead of the mass <hi rend="italic">m</hi> in
                    our original formula. The sums then become integrals, and we have three
                    expressions of the form <hi rend="italic">Jffpxdxdydz fjfodxdydz ’</hi></p>
                <p>Here <hi rend="italic">p</hi> represents the density at <hi rend="italic">x,
                    y,</hi><hi rend="italic">z;</hi> and the integration extends through the whole
                    volume of the body.</p>
                <p>Thus, for a homogeneous <hi rend="italic">hemisphere</hi> of fàdius <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> we have, taking the base as the plane of <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The same value would be obtained for any semiellipsoid, whatever be the diametral

                <p>Here the first factor under each integral sign is the volume of the hemispherical
                    element of radius <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> and the second is proportional to
                    its density.</p>
                <p>If the density of a thin uniform spherical shell be everywhere proportional to
                    the inverse cube of the distance from an internal point, that point is the
                    centre of inertia. For, if a double cone of small angle be drawn, having that
                    point as vertex, the volumes of the portions of the shell which it cuts out are
                    as the squares of their distances from the vertex. Hence their masses are
                    inversely as their distances from the vertex, which is thus their centre of
                    inertia. The whole shell may be divided into pairs of elements for each of which
                    this is true.</p>
                <p>The reader may easily prove that, if the density of a solid sphere be inversely
                    as the fifth power of the distance from an external point, the “electric image”
                    of that point is the centre of inertia.</p>
                <p>It may be proved in the last two examples that this point is not merely the
                    centre of inertia of such distributions of matter, but that it is also a true
                    “centre of gravity” in the sense that the whole attracts, and is attracted by,
                    any other body whatever, as if its whole mass were concentrated in this
                    point.</p>
                <p>§ 110. By introducing in the definition of moment of velocity (§ 46) the mass of
                    the moving particle as a factor, we have an important element of dynamical
                    science, the “moment of momentum.” The laws of composition and resolution are
                    the same as those already explained. Its dimensions are [ML <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> T^ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>].</p>
                <p>§ 111. A force is said to “do work” if it moves the body to which it is applied;
                    and the work done is measured by the resistance overcome, and the space through
                    which it is overcome, conjointly. The dimensions of work are therefore [MLT^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>. I.] or [ML <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> T^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>], the same as those of kinetic energy.</p>
                <p>Thus, in lifting coals from a pit, the amount of work done is proportional to the
                    weight of the coals lifted; that is, to the force overcome in raising them; and
                    also to the height through which they are raised. The unit for the measurement
                    of work, adopted in practice by British engineers, is that required to overcome
                    the weight of a pound through the height of a foot, and is called a
                    “foot-pound.”</p>
                <p>In purely scientific measurements, the unit of work is not the foot-pound, but
                    the absolute unit force (§ 105) acting through unit of length.</p>
                <p>If the weight be raised obliquely, as, for instance, along a smooth inclined
                    plane, the distance through which the force has to be overcome is increased in
                    the ratio of the length to the height of the plane; but the force to be overcome
                    is not the whole weight, but only the resolved part of the weight parallel to
                    the plane; and this is less than the weight in the ratio of the height of the
                    plane to its length. By multiplying these two expressions together, we find, as
                    we might expect, that the amount of work required is unchanged by the
                    substitution of the oblique for the vertical path.</p>
                <p>Generally, if s be an arc of the path of a particle, S the tangential component
                    of the applied forces, the work done on the particle between any two points of
                    its path is <hi rend="italic">∕Sds,</hi> taken between limits corresponding to
                    the initial and final positions. Referred to rectangular coordinates, it is easy
                    to see, by the law of resolution of forces, § 117, that this becomes</p>
                <p>/7 <hi rend="italic">X~ + Υ^+Z~}ds , J</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ds ds ds J ’</hi> where X is the component force parallel to the
                    axis of <hi rend="italic">x.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 112. Thus it appears that, for any force, the work done during an indefinitely
                    small displacement of the point of application is the product of the resolved
                    part of the force in the direction of the displacement into the
                    displacement.</p>
                <p>From this it follows that, if the motion of a body be always perpendicular to the
                    direction in which a force acts on it, the force does no work. Thus the mutual
                    normal pressure between a fixed and a moving body, the tension of the cord to
                    which a pendulum bob is attached, the attraction of the sun on a planet if the
                    planet describe a circle with the sun in the centre, are all cases in which no
                    work is done by the force.</p>
                <p>In fact the geometrical condition that the resultant of X, Y, Z shall be
                    perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">ds</hi> is <hi rend="italic">„dx</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> χ</hi><hi rend="italic">dy,</hi><hi rend="subscript">
                    7</hi> ^ <hi rend="subscript"> =</hi> A <hi rend="italic">ds ds ds ’</hi> and
                    this makes the above expression for the work vanish.</p>
                <p>§ 113. Work done on a body by a force is always shown by a corresponding increase
                    of kinetic energy, if no other forces act on the body which can do work or have
                    work done against them. If work be done against any forces, the increase of
                    kinetic energy is less than in the former case by the amount of work so done. In
                    virtue of this, however, the body possesses an equivalent in the form of
                    “potential energy," if its physical conditions are such that these forces will
                    act equally, and in the same directions, when the motion of the system is
                    reversed. Thus there may be no change of kinetic energy produced, and the work
                    done may be wholly stored up as potential energy.</p>
                <p>Thus a weight requites work to raise it to a height, a spring requires work to
                    bend it, air requires work to compress it, &amp;c.; but a raised weight, a bent
                    spring, compressed air, &lt;fcc., are <hi rend="italic">stores</hi> of energy
                    which can be made use of at pleasure.</p>
                <p>As an illustration of the calculation of work, take the following question.</p>
                <p>Suppose one end of an elastic string to be attached to a mass resting on the
                    ground, what amount of work must be done, in raising the other end vertically,
                    before the' mass is lifted I</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be at any instant the length of the string, <hi
                    rend="italic">I</hi> its original length, its tension is <hi rend="superscript
                    smallcaps"> e</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">⅜'∙</hi></p>
                <p>Hence the value of <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> when the mass is just lifted, is <hi
                    rend="superscript"> a</hi> U-^ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> + <hi
                    rend="subscript"> e</hi> J &gt; where W is the weight of the mass.</p>
                <p>The whole work done is the sum of all the elementary instalments of the form <hi
                    rend="italic">Ε^dχ.</hi></p>
                <p>These must be summed up from <hi rend="italic">x = l</hi> to .τ = z <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, so that the result required is</p>
                <p>It is to be observed that this quantity becomes less in proportion as E is
                    greater, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the less extensible is the string.</p>
                <p>An interesting variation of the question consists in supposing the upper end of
                    the string to be attached to the rim of a wheel, rough enough to prevent
                    slipping. Here the various portions of the string are wound on in a more and
                    more stretched state as the operation proceeds.</p>
                <p>At any stage of the operation let <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be the unstretched
                    length of the part already wound on the wheel. The tension of the free part is

                <p>§ 114. Weave now prepared to consider, more closely than we could at starting,
                    the bearing of the various clauses of each of Newton’s Laws. Thus, from the
                    first law we may draw the following immediate consequences.</p>
                <p>The times during which any particular body, not compelled by force to alter the
                    speed of its motion, passes through equal distances are equal. And, again, every
                    other body in the universe, not compelled by force to alter the speed of its
                    motion, moves over equal distances in successive intervals, during which the
                    particular chosen body moves over equal distances. The earth, in its rotation
                    about its axis, presents us with a case of motion in which the condition of not
                    being compelled by force to alter its speed is more nearly fulfilled than in any
                    other which we can easily or accurately observe. Hence the numerical measurement
                    of time practically rests on defining “equal intervals of time” as <hi
                    rend="italic">times during τυhich the earth turns through equal angles.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 115. It has been objected to this statement that we begin by defining uniform
                    motion by the description of equal spaces in equal times, and then employ this
                    definition as a mode of measuring equal times. The objection, however, is not
                    valid; for, if we agree to measure equal intervals by the undisturbed motion of
                    any one physical mass, we find that in the successive intervals so determined
                    all other absolutely free physical masses describe successive equal spaces.</p>
                <p>§ M6. Again, from the second law we see that, if we multiply the change of
                    velocity, geometrically determined, by the mass of the body, we have the change
                    of motion (§ 99) referred to in the law as the measure of the force which
                    produces it. In the statement of the second law there is nothing said about the
                    actual motion of the body before it was acted on by the force; the same force
                    will produce precisely the same change of motion in a body whether the body be
                    at rest or in motion with any velocity whatever. Again, nothing is said as to
                    the body being under the action of one force only; so that we may logically put
                    part of the second law in the following (apparently) amplified form :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">When any forces whatever act on a body, then, whether the body
                    be originally at rest or moving with any velocity and in any direction, each
                    force produces in the body the exact change of motion which it would have
                    produced if it had acted singly on the body originally at rest.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 117. Since now forces are measured by the changes of motion they produce, and
                    their directions assigned by the directions in which these changes are produced,
                    and since the changes of motion of one and the same body are in the directions
                    of and proportional to the changes of velocity, a single force, measured by the
                    resultant change of velocity, and in its direction, will be the equivalent of
                    any number of simultaneously acting forces. Hence <hi rend="italic">The
                    resultant of any number of forces {applied at one point) is to be found by the
                    same geometrical process as the resultant of any number of simultaneous
                    velocities.</hi></p>
                <p>From this follows at once (§ 30) the construction of the “parallelogram of
                    forces” for finding the resultant of two forces acting at the same point, and
                    the “polygon of forces” for the resultant of any number of forces acting at a
                    point. And, so far as a single particle is concerned, we have at once the whole
                    subject of Statics.</p>
                <p>§ 118. The second law gives us the means of measuring force, and also of
                    measuring the mass of a body.</p>
                <p>For, if we consider the actions of various forces upon the same body for equal
                    times, we evidently have changes of velocity produced which are proportional to
                    the forces. The changes of velocity, then, give us in this case the means of
                    comparing the magnitudes of different forces. Thus the speeds acquired in one
                    second by the same mass (falling freely) at different parts of the earth’s
                    surface give us the relative amounts of the earth’s attraction at these
                    places.</p>
                <p>Again, if equal forces be exerted on different bodies, the changes of velocity
                    produced in equal times must be <hi rend="italic">inversely</hi> as the masses
                    of the various bodies. This is approximately the case, for instance, with trains
                    of various lengths drawn by the same locomotive.</p>
                <p>Again, if we find a case in which different bodies, each acted on bya force,
                    acquire in thesame time the samechanges of velocity, the forces must be
                    proportional to the masses of the bodies. This, when the resistance of the air
                    is removed, is the case of falling bodies; and from it we conclude that the <hi
                    rend="italic">weight of a body in any given locality, or the force with which
                    the earth attracts it, is proportional to its 'mass.</hi> This is no mere

                    on the quality as well as on the quantity of matter in a particle.</p>
                <p>§ 119. It appears, lastly, from this law that every theorem of kinematics
                    connected with acceleration has its counterpart in kinetics. Thus, for instance
                    (§ 36), we see that the force under which a particle describes any curve may be
                    resolved into two components, one in the tangent to the curve, the other <hi
                    rend="italic">towards</hi> the centre of curvature,—their magnitudes being the
                    rate of change of momentum in the direction of motion, and the product of the
                    momentum into the angular velocity about the centre of curvature, respectively.
                    In the case of uniform motion, the first of these vanishes, or the whole force
                    is perpendicular to the direction of motion. When there is no force
                    perpendicular to the direction of motion, there is no curvature, or the path is
                    a straight line.</p>
                <p>Hence, if we resolve the forces acting on a particle of mass <hi rend="italic"

                    rectangular components X, Y, Z, we have the equations originally given by

                <p>In several of the examples which follow, these equations will be somewhat
                    simplified by assuming unity as the mass of the moving particle. When this
                    cannot be done, it is sometimes convenient to assume X, Y, Z as the component
                    forces on <hi rend="italic">unit</hi> mass, and the previous equations become
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> ιs</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>[Some confusion is often introduced by the division of forces into “accelerating”
                    and “moving” forces; and it is even stated occasionally that the former are of
                    <hi rend="italic">one,</hi> and the latter of <hi rend="italic">four</hi> linear
                    dimensions. The fact is, however, that an equation such as <hi rend="italic"

                    kinematical. If kinematical, the meanings of the terms are obvious; if
                    dynamical, the unit of mass must be understood as a factor on the left-hand
                    side, and in that case X is the ^-component, per unit of mass, of the whole

                <p>§120. We have now all that is necessary for the dynamics of a single particle,
                    with exception of the experimental laws of friction. These, very nearly as they
                    were established by Coulomb, we will now give.</p>
                <p>To produce sliding of one flat-faced solid on another requires a tangential force
                    which is directly proportional to the normal pressure between the surfaces, and
                    whose actual magnitude is found from this pressure by means of a factor called
                    the “coefficient of statical friction.” This coefficient depends upon the nature
                    of the solids, the roughness or smoothness of the surfaces in contact, and the
                    amount of tallow, oil, &amp;c., with which they have been smeared. It also
                    depends upon the time during which they have been left in contact. It is only in
                    extreme cases dependent on the area of the surfaces in contact.</p>
                <p>§121. When the forces applied are insufficient to produce sliding, the whole
                    amount of friction is not called into play; it is called out to an amount just
                    sufficient to balance the other forces. Thus there are two quite distinct
                    problems connected with the statics of friction :— the first, to determine the
                    amount of friction called into play under given circumstances; the second, to
                    find the limiting circumstances under which, with friction, equilibrium is
                    possible. When motion is produced, there is still friction (now called
                    “kinetic”). It follows the same laws as does statical friction, only that the
                    coefficient, which is approximately independent of the velocity, is usually
                    considerably less than the statical coefficient.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Statics of a Particle.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 122. By § 117, forces acting at the same point, or on the same material
                    particle, are to be compounded by the same laws as velocities. Therefore the sum
                    of their resolved parts in any direction must vanish if there is equilibrium;
                    whence the necessary and sufficient conditions are found by resolving in three
                    directions at right angles to one another.</p>
                <p>They follow also directly from Newton’s statement with regard to work, if we
                    suppose the particle to have any velocity, constant in direction and magnitude
                    (and by § 6 this is the only general supposition we can make, since absolute
                    rest has for us no meaning). For the work done in any time is the product of the
                    displacement during that time into the algebraic sum of the effective components
                    of the applied forces, and there is no change of kinetic energy. Hence this sum
                    must vanish for <hi rend="italic">every</hi> direction. Practically, as any
                    displacement may be resolved into three, in any three directions not coplanar,
                    the vanishing of the work for any one such set of three suffices for the
                    criterion. But, in general, it is convenient to assume them in directions at
                    right angles to each other.</p>
                <p>Hence, for the equilibrium of a material particle, it is <hi rend="italic"
                    >necessary,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sufficient,</hi> that the (algebraic)
                    sums of the applied forces, resolved in any one set of three rectangular
                    directions, should vanish.</p>
                <p>This statement gives at once the result that, if X <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>,

                <p>§ 123. By far the most extensive series of examples of the composition of forces
                    acting on a single particle is furnished by the theory of “attraction,” where
                    each particle of the attracting mass exerts upon the attracted particle a force
                    in the direction of the line joining them, and of magnitude depending on their
                    masses and their mutual distance only. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Potential.</hi></p>
                <p>§124. When there are but three forces acting on the particle, their directions to
                    give equilibrium must obviously be in one plane. For, if the third were not in
                    the plane of the other two, it would have an uncompensated component
                    perpendicular to that plane. Hence this case is always at once reducible to the
                    triangle or the parallelogram of forces; and the magnitudes of each of the three
                    forces are respectively proportional to the sines of the angles between the
                    directions of the other two.</p>
                <p>Thus, when a pellet is supported by two strings, as in fig. 34, we may proceed as
                    follows to determine their tensions. Let P be the pellet, of weight W, and let
                    AP, BP be the strings attached to points A and B respectively. Let their
                    tensions be T and T'. The remark above shows that the strings must hang in a
                    vertical plane, since the force W acts in a vertical line. Since A, B, and the
                    length of the strings are given, the figure is perfectly definite.</p>
                <p>Draw Pγ vertically upwards, and make its length represent, on any assumed scale,
                    the value of W. Draw <hi rend="italic">γβ</hi> parallel to AP, and let it meet
                    BP in <hi rend="italic">β.</hi> Then <hi rend="italic">βγ</hi> represents T, and
                    P/3 represents T', in direction and also in magnitude, on the same scale in
                    which γP represents W. This case leads to nothing but the determination of the
                    tensions, since the form of the figure is definite.</p>
                <p>Next, let one of the tensions be given in magnitude. To effect this, we may
                    suppose the end of PB not to be fastened at B, but to pass over a smooth pulley
                    and support a weight Q. Let fig. 35 represent the state of equilibrium, and let
                    the same construction as before be made. Then we must have γP: <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pβ</hi>:: W: Q; or, writing it in terms of angles, sin APB: sinAPγ:; W: Q .</p>
                <p>A and B and the direction of γP being given, this datum suffices for the drawing
                    of the figure; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> for the calculation of the angles. A
                    little consideration will show that, however small Q be, provided the string
                    supporting it be long enough, there is always <hi rend="italic">one
                    definite</hi> position of equilibrium. The actual calculations in such a case as
                    this are troublesome. It was chosen mainly on that account, so as to show, in a
                    simple case, how pure geometrical processes may occasionally save the necessity
                    of a tedious trigonometrical investigation. But a still simpler method will be
                    afterwards explained, viz., that, for a position of stable equilibrium, the
                    potential energy must be a <hi rend="italic">minimum.</hi> Now, to apply this to
                    our example, we see that any downward displacement of Q produces an upward
                    motion of P. But when AP is nearly vertical the vertical displacement of P is
                    indefinitely smaller than that of Q, so that Q must go down. On the other hand
                    if APB be nearly a straight line, a displacement of P produces an indefinitely
                    smaller displacement of Q. Hence P must go down. And these results are in
                    character independent of the relative magnitudes of P and Q, provided both be
                    finite.</p>
                <p>Finally, let both tensions be constant. Here we must imagine pulleys both at A
                    and at B (fig. 36), with weights <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n734/mode/1up"

                    now we see that we must have the limiting condition</p>
                <p>R + Q&gt;W.</p>
                <p>This is merely the geometrical condition that</p>

                    Hence its angles are given, and the sole position of equilibrium is at once
                    found.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We have assumed
                    here, what is properly part of the results of the <hi rend="italic">third</hi>
                    law of motion, that the tension of a weightless string, passing over a smooth
                    pulley, is in the direction of its length, and of the same amount at all
                    points.</p></note></p>
                <p>§ 125. Now take the case of a particle resting on a surface. As we are concerned
                    only with the portion of the surface immediately contiguous to the position of
                    the particle, we may substitute for it its tangent plane at that point (except,
                    of course, at singular points, where there may be an infinite number of tangent'
                    planes; but such cases we do not consider). Hence the problem reduces itself in
                    all cases to that of a particle resting on an inclined plane.</p>
                <p>If the plane-be smooth, the particle cannot remain in equilibrium unless some
                    force is present to prevent its sliding down. Let us suppose it to be supported
                    by a force, F, acting upwards along the plane (fig. 37), Then we have three
                    forces at work :— the weight P acting vertically downwards; the supporting
                    pressure of the plane R, which necessarily acts perpendicularly to the surface;
                    and the third force, just mentioned, which we see by previous considerations
                    must be in the plane of the other two, and must therefore lie along the line of
                    greatest slope of the plane. We might construct a triangle of forces as in the
                    previous examples, but we will now vary the process, and resolve the forces in
                    two directions at right angles to one another in their common (vertical)
                    plane.</p>
                <p>Let α be the angle of inclination of the plane to the horizon, then the algebraic
                    sum of the components of the forces must vanish both horizontally and
                    vertically. This gives us the two conditions</p>
                <p>Fcosα-Rsinα = O; Fsina + Rcosa — P = 0</p>
                <p>From these we obtain at once</p>
                <p>F = Psinα, R = Pcosa</p>
                <p>Now the choice of mutually perpendicular directions in which to resolve was at
                    our option, and we see that had we chosen to resolve <hi rend="italic"
                    >along</hi> and <hi rend="italic">perpendicular to</hi> the plane we should have
                    obtained the last two equations, which are equivalent to, but simpler than, the
                    former ones, which were obtained by resolving horizontally and vertically.
                    Theoretically speaking, it does not matter which system we choose; in practice,
                    however, it is well to select the directions which will give the required
                    results in the simplest form. The full value of a proper selection will not be
                    felt till we come to the statics of a rigid solid.</p>
                <p>If we suppose the plane to be rough, friction alone may suffice to develop the
                    requisite force F, But the utmost value of the friction is (§ 120) μR. Hence the
                    particle will be on the point of sliding if</p>
                <p>μR = F = Psi∏α.</p>
                <p>Divide the members of this equation by those of</p>
                <p>R = Pcosα, and we find <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> = tan <hi rend="italic"
                    >a.</hi></p>
                <p>Hence, so long as the coefficient of friction is greater than the tangent of the
                    inclination of the plane to the horizon, the friction will suffice to prevent
                    sliding. More and more is called into play as the inclination of the plane
                    increases, and finally when tanα = μ</p>
                <p>the particle is just about to slide down. This simple idea, taken along with
                    Coulomb’s results (§ 120), points to a very easy method of determining the
                    coefficient of friction between any two substances. The limiting angle defined
                    by</p>
                <p>α = tan^ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> μ</p>
                <p>is called, on account of this property, the “angle of repose.” § 126. Let us now
                    suppose the particle to be, in part, supported by an elastic string fixed at a
                    point in the plane, and lying in the line of greatest slope. (This modification
                    is introduced to show the nature of cases in which there are <hi rend="italic"
                    >limits</hi> between which equilibrium is possible.) We assume “Hooke’s Law,”
                    viz., that the tension of an elastic string, drawn out from its natural length
                    <hi rend="italic">I</hi> to length <hi rend="italic">l',</hi> is expressed by
                    <hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> e</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">⅛p</hi> where E is
                    a definite constant, representing theoretically the tension which would just
                    double the length of the string. *</p>
                <p>Our equations are exactly the same as before, only that F consists now of two
                    parts,—one due to friction, the other to the elasticity of the string. Thus</p>
                <p>F = F <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> + E ^-=-^=Psinα , R=Pcosa.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">υ</hi></p>
                <p>Now, when sliding is about to commence downwards we have</p>
                <p>F <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = μR,</p>
                <p>If the particle is about to be dragged upwards,</p>
                <p>F <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = -μR.</p>
                <p>Hence for the two extreme positions of equilibrium ±μPcosα + E^-γ-^=Psinα .</p>
                <p>Hence the limiting positions of equilibrium of the particle are given by its
                    distance from the fixed end of the string—</p>
                <p>PZ</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> =</hi> + g (sinαψμcosα).</p>
                <p>If Γ be less than the smaller of these, gravity pulls the particle down; if it be
                    greater than the larger of them, the tension of the string pulls the particle
                    up. In intermediate positions the full available friction is not called into
                    play.</p>
                <p>§ 127- Next, let a small ring P (fig. 38) be attached to one end of a string. Let
                    the string pass round two smooth pulleys B, C, at different points, then be
                    passed through the ring, then round two more pulleys D, E, and through the ring
                    again, and so on,—the other end being either fastened to the ring or attached to
                    a fixed point. It is required to find the position of equilibrium of the ring
                    when the string is drawn tight, by operating on the lap of it behind two of the
                    pulleys.</p>
                <p>This is equivalent, from the physical point of view, to finding the position of
                    equilibrium of a particle acted on by a number of <hi rend="italic">equal</hi>
                    forces each directed towards a given point. From the geometrical point of view
                    its solution obviously answers the question, “Find the point the sum of whose
                    distances from a number of given points is the least possible.” The points need
                    not lie all in one plane. The solution is, from the polygon of forces, that in
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n735/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0735-0704"/> the equilibrium position the laps of the string,
                    from the ring outwards, are parallel to the respective sides of a closed
                    equilateral polygon, taken all in the same direction. That the solution is
                    unique will be seen at once by considering a displacement of the ring, for the
                    resultant of the forces obviously tends to diminish the displacement. When there
                    are but three forces, their directions must be inclined at angles of 120° to one
                    another (fig. 39). Thus we have immediately the solution of the celebrated
                    geometrical problem, “Find the point the sum of whose distances from three given
                    points is the least possible.”</p>
                <p>§ 128. If, in the first problem of § 124 above, the particle were supported by
                    three strings, instead of two, each attached to a fixed point, we should first
                    have to assure ourselves that all three are brought into play. For, if not, the
                    problem is reduced to the former case. The obvious condition is that, when the
                    three strings are simultaneously tight, and the points of suspension are not in
                    one vertical plane, the particle supported shall be situated <hi rend="italic"
                    >within</hi> the triangular prism formed by vertical planes passing through each
                    pair of points. If this condition be satisfied, the process for determining the
                    tensions of the strings is merely to construct a parallelepiped, three of whose
                    edges lie along the strings, while the conterminous diagonal is vertical. This
                    leads to an obvious geometrical construction; and, when it is carried out, the
                    lengths of the various edges are to the diagonal as the corresponding tensions
                    to the weight of the particle. When the three points are in one vertical plane,
                    nothing short of infinitely perfect fitting will, in general, bring all three
                    strings simultaneously tight; and in this case the problem, mathematically
                    considered, is indeterminate.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Of course, physically, there is no indeterminateness, even
                    with perfectly inextensible strings.</p></note> When the strings are
                    sufficiently extensible, all will be brought into play; and, with sufficient
                    data, the problem is determinate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Kinetics of a Particle with One Degree of Freedom.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 129. Here the motion is rectilinear, or at least takes place in some assigned
                    curve.</p>
                <p>The simplest case is that of a falling stone, when the effect of the resistance
                    of the air is set aside and the acceleration due to gravity is reckoned the same
                    at all elevations. This has already been treated with sufficient detail as a
                    matter of pure kinematics, §§ 28, 29.</p>
                <p>§ 130. When the particle, instead of falling freely, is constrained by a smooth
                    inclined plane on which it slides, we see that (so long as it moves on the line
                    of greatest slope) its weight <hi rend="italic">⅛ig</hi> has components,
                    M&lt;7sinα tangential to the plane and M7c0sα perpendicular to it, α being the
                    inclination of the plane to the horizon. The latter component produces the
                    normal pressure on the plane, and is the only contributor to it, since there is
                    no curvature. The former produces the acceleration of the motion. Thus the
                    acceleration is now &lt;7sinα only; but, with this change, the results of § 29
                    still hold.</p>
                <p>§ 131. If the plane be rough, with coefficient of statical friction <hi
                    rend="italic">μ,</hi> it can furnish (§ 120) a force of friction tending to
                    prevent motion, of any amount up to</p>
                <p>μM&lt;7c0sα.</p>
                <p>If this be less than Musina, motion will commence, and the force accelerating it
                    will be</p>
                <p>Μ y sin α - μ'M&lt;∕C0Sa , where// isthe coefficient of kinetic friction (§121).
                    Thusthe same results as in § 29 still hold, but with <hi rend="italic">g</hi>

                    place down an inclined plane in certain cases where the mass, if once at rest,
                    would not start.</p>
                <p>§ 132. As a slightly more complex case, let us now take again the problem of free
                    motion in a vertical line, but allow for the diminution of gravity as the
                    distance from the earth increases.</p>
                <p>The weight of a particle of mass <hi rend="italic">m</hi> at the earth’s surface
                    is <hi rend="italic">mg.</hi> At a distance <hi rend="italic">x</hi> from the

                <p>If the particle be supposed to have been originally at rest, at a practically
                    infinite distance from the earth (a case which may occur with a meteorite for

                <p>The speed with which the mass reaches the surface (where x = R) is therefore

                <p>In this special case, the second integral is</p>

                <p>The second integral, in its general form, is a little complex; but we may avoid

                <p>§ 133. Let us next take a case in which the acceleration depends upon the speed
                    of the moving body. A sufficiently simple one is furnished by a falling
                    raindrop, or hailstone, when the resistance of the air is taken into account.
                    For the moderate speeds with which such bodies move, the resistance varies, at
                    least approximately, as the square of the speed. To avoid needless complexity,
                    we neglect here the variation of gravity due to changes of vertical height.</p>
                <p>Suppose the particle to have been projected vertically upwards from the origin
                    with the speed V, and let <hi rend="italic">v</hi> be its speed at any time <hi

                <p>It is to be observed that <hi rend="italic">k</hi> is the “terminal velocity,” as

                <p>The necessity for this double investigation, one part for the ascent, the other

                    the force of resistance.</p>
                <p>§ 134. As an illustration of constraint by a smooth curve, let us take the case
                    of a simple pendulum. Let O (fig. 40) be the point of suspension, P the position
                    of the bob at any time <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> Then, if PG represent the
                    weight of the bob, and be resolved into PH, HG respectively along, and
                    perpendicular to, the tangent at P, we see that PH produces the acceleration of
                    the motion, while the tension of the cord balances HG and also furnishes the
                    acceleration perpendicular to the direction of motion which is required to
                    produce the curvature of the path. PH is <hi rend="italic">(caeteris</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">paribus')</hi> proportional to the sine of PGH, that is, of POA.
                    Hence the acceleration is proportional to the sine of the angular displacement.
                    When that angle is small it may be used in place of its sine. Hence, for small
                    vibrations, the acceleration is proportional to the displacement, and the motion
                    is “simple harmonic.” The time of vibration, being (§ 51) 2π ∙7 displacement
                    /acceleration, is here</p>

                <p>The rigorous solution of the pendulum problem requires the use of elliptic
                    functions.</p>
                <p>§ 135. Some very curious properties of pendulum motion are easily proved by
                    geometrical processes. The whole theory of the motion in a vertical plane of a
                    particle attached by a weightless rod to a fixed point, whether it oscillate as
                    a pendulum or perform continuous rotations, may be deduced from the two
                    following propositions, which are easily established by geometrical processes in
                    which corresponding indefinitely small motions are compared.</p>
                <p>(1) To compare different cases of continuous rotation. Let DA (fig. 41) be taken
                    equal to the tangent from D to the circle BPC', whose centre C is vertically
                    under D. Let PAQ be any line through A, cutting in Q the semicircle on AC. Also
                    make DE = DA. Then, if P move under gravity with speed due to the level of D, Q
                    moves with speed due to the level of E, the acceleration due to gravity being
                    reduced in the ratio AC <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>: 2BC <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>(2) To compare continuous rotation with oscillation. Let two circles touch one
                    another at their lowest points O (fig. 42); compare the arcual motions of points
                    P and <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> which are always in the same horizontal line.
                    Draw the horizontal tangent AB. Then, if P move, with speed due to <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> and level α, continuously in its circle, <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> oscillates with speed due to level AB and acceleration</p>
                <p>αθ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ¾ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> *</p>
                <p>§ 136. Two particles are projected from the same point, in the same direction,
                    and with the same speed, but at different instants, in a smooth circular tube of
                    small bore whose plane is vertical, to show that the line joining them
                    constantly touches another circle.</p>
                <p>Let the tube be called the circle A, and the horizontal line, to the level of
                    which the speed is due, I.. Let Μ, Μ' (fig. 43) be simultaneous positions of the
                    particles. Suppose that MM' passes into its next position by turning about O,
                    these two lines will intercept two indefinitely small arcs at Μ and Μ' which (by
                    a property of the circle) are in the ratio MO: OM'. Let another circle B be
                    described touching MM' in 0, and such that I. is the radical axis of A and B.
                    Let MP, M'P' be drawn perpendicular to I.. Let M'M cut I. in C. Then, by the
                    property of the radical axis, CO <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = CM. CM'; from
                    which we have, by geometry,</p>
                <p>CM: CM' = 0M <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>: OM' <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    or OM <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>: 0M' <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = PM:
                    P'M'.</p>
                <p>But (speed at M) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>: (speed at M') <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = PM: P ’ M'.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0737-0706"/>
                <p>Hence the speeds of Μ and Μ' are as MO: OM', and therefore, by what we have
                    stated above about elementary arcs at Μ and M', the proximate position of MM' is
                    also a tangent to B, which proves the proposition.</p>
                <p>It is easily seen from this that, if one polygon of a given number of sides can
                    be inscribed in one circle and circumscribed about another, an infinite number
                    can be drawn. For this we have only to suppose a number of particles moving in A
                    with speeds due to a fall from I., and then if they form at any time -the
                    angular points of a polygon whose sides touch B they will continue to do so
                    throughout the motion. Fig. 44 shows two forms of a quadrilateral possessing
                    this property.</p>

                <p>Let O (fig. 45) be the point from which the particle commences its motion. Draw
                    OA' parallel to CA, and on BA' describe a semicircle. Let P,P', P" be
                    corresponding points of the curve, the generating circle, and the circle just
                    drawn, and let us compare the speeds of the particle at P and the point P", Let

                <p>Hence speed of P"= . ∕ r‰ . A'B, a constant.</p>

                <p>And, as the length of A'P"B is ⅜τr . A'B, time from A' to B in circle = time from
                    0 to B in cycloid</p>

                <p>The time of fall to the vertex from all points of the curve is therefore the
                    same. Hence the cycloid is called a “tautochrone.”</p>
                <p>§ 138. As an instance of cases in which the acceleration depends upon the speed
                    and the position jointly, take the motion of a simple pendulum in a medium whose
                    resistance varies as the velocity directly. This is the law, at least
                    approximately, for very small speeds, whether the pendulum oscillate in a gas or
                    in a liquid,—and even when the resistance is due to magneto-electric induction,
                    as when the pendulum is a magnetic needle vibrating in presence of a conducting
                    plate or a closed coil. A synthetical solution of this problem has already been
                    given under Kinematics in § 68.</p>

                <p>The ratio <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> ∣ <hi rend="italic">ml</hi> may be increased
                    (theoretically) without limit by-increasing the surface which the bob exposes,
                    without changing its mass. But it cannot be indefinitely diminished. We will
                    write <hi rend="italic">2k</hi> for it. If we assume the angle of oscillation to
                    be small, we may write the equation in the form <hi rend="italic">θ + 2k0 +

                    greater. A particular integral of this equation is evidently e≈e <hi

                    allowed to fall back; it then approximates asymptotically to its position of
                    equilibrium; and (2) when it is drawn aside and flung back; in this case it may

                <p>This may be looked upon as a “simple harmonic motion” (§ 52), of which the
                    amplitude diminishes in a geometric ratio with the time, the decrement depending
                    on the resistance alone, while the period is permanently lengthened in the ratio

                    and the resistance, so that for the same medium and same bob it is different for

                    gradual dying away (by internal friction or by imperfect elasticity, &amp;c. )
                    of all vibratory movements. The rate of diminution of amplitude, say of
                    torsional vibrations of a wire, is thus a valuable indication and measure of a
                    somewhat recondite physical quantity, which, without this method, would (at

                    increases; but, as in case (a), it may either do so continuously or after having

                <p>§ 139. When the path is given, the determination of the motion under given forces
                    is, as we have seen, a mere question of integration of the equation for
                    acceleration along the tangent. But more is required if we wish to find the

                <p>§ 140. The simplest case is that of a projectile, when gravity is supposed to be
                    uniform and to act in parallel lines throughout the whole path, and the
                    resistance of the air is neglected. This has been sufficiently discussed in §§
                    40-42. It is merely the combination of ( 1 ) the uniformly accelerated motion of
                    a stone let fall, with (2) a uniform velocity in a definite direction. Looked at
                    from this point of view, it gives an interesting example of the graphic method
                    applied in § 53 to indicate the nature of simple harmonic motion.</p>
                <p>§ 141. We can extend these projectile results so as to take account of the

                    remembering that, as shown in § 49, the path of an unresisted projectile is an
                    ellipse, one of whose foci is at the centre of the earth. The following, among
                    many other analogous propositions, are easily proved.</p>
                <p>(1) The locus of the second foci of the paths of all projectiles leaving a given
                    point with a given speed, in a vertical plane, is a circle.</p>
                <p>(2) The direction of projection, for the greatest range on a given line passing
                    through the point of projection, bisects the angle between the vertical and the
                    line.</p>
                <p>(3) Any other point on the line which can be reached at all can be reached by two
                    different paths, and the directions of projection for these are equally inclined
                    to the direction which gives the maximum range.</p>
                <p>(4) If a projectile meet the line at right angles, the point which it strikes is
                    the vertex of the other path by which it may be reached.</p>
                <p>(5) The envelop of all possible paths in a vertical plane is an ellipse, one of
                    whose foci is the centre of the earth, and the other the point of
                    projection.</p>
                <p>To prove these propositions, let E (fig. 4G) be the earth’s centre, P the point
                    of projection, A the point which the projectile would reach if fired vertically
                    upwards. With centre E, and radius EA, describe a circle in the common plane of
                    projection. This, the circle of zero velocity, corresponds to the common
                    directrix of the parabolic paths in the ordinary theory If F be the second focus
                    of any path, we must have EP + PF constant, because the axis major depends on
                    the speed, not the direction, of projection. Hence (1) the locus of F is the
                    circle AFO, centre P. Again, since, if F be the focus of the path which meets PR
                    in Q, we must have FQ = QS, it is obvious that the greatest range <hi
                    rend="italic">Vq</hi> is to be found by the condition O7 = <hi rend="italic"
                    >qs.</hi> O is therefore the second focus of this trajectory, and therefore (2)
                    the direction of projection for the greatest range on PR bisects the angle APR.
                    If QF = QF' = QS, F and F' are the second foci of the two paths by which Q may
                    be reached; and, as <hi rend="italic">I.</hi> F'PO= <hi rend="italic">I.</hi>
                    FPO, we see the truth of (3). If Q be a point reached by the projectile when
                    moving in a direction perpendicular to PR, we must evidently have <hi
                    rend="italic">I.</hi> PQF' = <hi rend="italic">I.</hi> PQF = <hi rend="italic"
                    >I.</hi> SQR = <hi rend="italic">I.</hi> EQP; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> EQ
                    passes through F'. When this is the case, the ellipse whose second focus is F
                    evidently meets PR at right angles; and that whose second focus is F' has (4)
                    its vertex at Q. The locus of <hi rend="italic">q</hi> is evidently the envelop
                    of all the trajectories. Now <hi rend="italic">Pq =</hi> PO + <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oq</hi> = PA + <hi rend="italic">Oq, Εq=Εs-sq=</hi> EA— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oq</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>Hence <hi rend="italic">Pq</hi> + Eg = PA + AE, or (5) the envelop is an ellipse,
                    whose foci are E and P, and which passes through A.</p>
                <p>§ 142. One of the most important problems in this branch of our subject is that
                    of planetary motion, which forms a good typical example of the processes to be
                    employed in the treatment of central orbits. One or two definitions, and a
                    general property of central orbits, must be premised.</p>
                <p>§ 143. <hi rend="italic">Def.</hi> An “apse” is a point, in a central orbit, at
                    which the path is perpendicular to the radius-vector along which the central
                    force acts.</p>
                <p>The length of the radius-vector is therefore, at such a point, generally a
                    maximum or a minimum. This radius vector, drawn to an apse, is called an
                    “apsidal line.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A central orbit is symmetrical about every apsidal line.</hi>
                    The simplest proof of this theorem depends upon the general principle of
                    “reversibility,” which holds in all conservative systems. In fact if, at any
                    instant, the velocityvector of a particle, moving under the action of a
                    conservative system of forces, be reversed, the particle will simply retrace its
                    previous path. For if we suppose a smooth tube, in the form of the previous
                    path, to be employed to guide it back, the speed at every point will be of the
                    same magnitude as before. The curvature also of the path will be the same; and
                    thus the normal component of the applied forces will balance the so-called
                    centrifugal force,— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> will suffice to produce the
                    requisite curvature,—so that there will be no pressure on the tube, and it is
                    not required. Hence since, at an apse, the velocity is perpendicular to the
                    radius-vector, the two halves of the orbit on opposite sides of the apsidal line
                    are similar and equal. Hence, however many apses there may be, there can be. at
                    most only two apsidal distances. For the property of symmetry about each apsidal
                    line shows that, if there be more apses than one, the fir⅝t, third, fifth, Ac.,
                    must have their apsidal distances equal, as also must the second, fourth, sixth,
                    Ac. If there be one apse only, it may correspond either to a minimum or to a
                    maximum value of the radius-vector; but, if there be more than one, they must be
                    maxima and minima alternately.</p>
                <p>§ 144. We now proceed to the gravitation case already promised. We will take,
                    first, the direct problem as in § 49, where the force is assigned and the orbit
                    is to be found.</p>

                <p>§ 145. By laborious calculation from an immense series of observations of the
                    planets, and of Mars in particular, Kepler was led to enunciate the following as
                    the kinematical laws of the planetary motions about the sun.</p>
                <p>I. The planets describe, relatively to the sun, ellipses of which the sun
                    occupies a focus.</p>
                <p>II. The radius vector of each planet traces out equal areas in equal times.</p>
                <p>III. The squares of the periodic times of any two planets are as the cubes of the
                    major axes of their orbits.</p>
                <p>§ 146. We proceed to the <hi rend="italic">inverse</hi> problem of § 8 (δ), the
                    determination of the force from the observed motions.</p>
                <p>From the second of the above laws we conclude that the planets are retained in
                    their orbits by an attraction tending to the sun. <hi rend="italic">If the
                    radius-vector of a particle moving in a plane describe equal areas in equal
                    times about a point in that plane, the resultant attraction on the particle
                    tends to that point.</hi> For the datum is equivalent to the statement that
                    there is no change of moment of momentum about the sun, or that the
                    accelerations all pass through the sun viewed as a point.</p>
                <p>From the first law it follows that the law of the intensity of the attraction is
                    that of the inverse square of the distance.</p>
                <p>The polar equation of an ellipse referred to its focus is</p>
                <p>2 w=-^-(l + ecos0), where <hi rend="italic">I</hi> is the latus rectum.</p>

                <p>Hence _=-- <hi rend="subscript"> c</hi> os0, and therefore the attraction to the
                    focus requisite for the description of the ellipse is (§ 47)</p>

                    rend="italic">Hence, if the orbit be an ellipse described about a centre of
                    attraction at the focus, the law of intensity is that of the inverse square of
                    the distance.</hi></p>
                <p>From the third law it follows that the attraction of the sun (supposed fixed)
                    which acts on unit of mass of each of the planets is the same for each planet at
                    the same distance.</p>
                <p>For, in the last formula in § 144, T <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> will not vary
                    as α <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> unless <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> be constant,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> unless the strength of attraction of the sun be the
                    same for all the planets.</p>
                <p>We shall find afterwards that for more reasons than one Kepler’s laws are only
                    approximate, but their enunciation was sufficient to enable Newton to propound
                    the doctrine of universal gravitation, viz., that <hi rend="italic">every
                    particle of matter in the τιniverse attracts every other with an attraction
                    whose direction is that of the line joining them, and whose magnitude is as the
                    product of the masses directly and as the square of the distance inversely</hi>;
                    or, according to Maxwell’s formulation, <hi rend="italic">between every pair of
                    particles there is a stress of the nature of a tension, proportional to the
                    product of the masses of the particles divided by the square of their
                    distance.</hi></p>
                <p>If we take into account that the sun is not absolutely fixed, then, neglecting
                    the mutual attractions of the planets, Kepler’s third law should be stated thus
                    :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The cubes of the major axes of the orbits are as the squares of
                    the periodic times and the sums of the masses of the sun and the

                <p>§ 147. We will now indicate, as briefly as possible, the more ordinary
                    transformations by which the preceding formulae are adapted (for astronomical
                    applications) to numerical calculation.</p>
                <p>Suppose APA' (fig. 47) to be an elliptic orbit described about a centre of
                    attraction in the focus S. Also suppose P to be the position of the particle at
                    any time <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> Draw PM perpendicular to the major axis ACA',
                    and produce it to cut the auxiliary circle in the point Q. Let C be the common
                    centre of the curves. Join CQ.</p>
                <p>When the moving particle is at A, the nearest point of the orbit to S, it is said
                    to be in “perihelion.”</p>
                <p>The angle ASP, or the excess of the particle’s longitude over that of the
                    perihelion, is called the ’ ∙ true anomaly.” Let us denote it by <hi
                    rend="italic">θ.</hi></p>
                <p>The angle ACQ is called the “excentric anomaly,” and is generally denoted by w.
                    And, if <hi rend="italic">2π∕n</hi> be the time of a complete revolution, <hi
                    rend="italic">nt</hi> is the circular measure of an imaginary angle called the
                    “mean anomaly it would evidently be the true anomaly if the particle’s angular
                    velocity about S were constant.</p>
                <p>It is easy from known properties of the ellipse to deduce the following relations
                    between the mean and excentric, and also between the true and excentric,
                    anomalies:—</p>

                <p>By far the most important problem is to find the values of <hi rend="italic"
                    >θ</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> as functions of <hi rend="italic">t,</hi>
                    so that the direction and length of a planet’s radius-vector may be determined
                    for any given time. This generally goes by the name of Kepler’s Problem.</p>
                <p>Before indicating the systematic development of <hi rend="italic">u, r,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> in terms of <hi rend="italic">t</hi> from our

                    that of Lagrange, and the general principle of it is this :—</p>
                <p>We can develop <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> from equation (2) in a series ascending
                    by powers of a small quantity, a function of <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> the

                    multiples of <hi rend="italic">u.</hi> Now by Lagrange’s theorem we may from
                    equation (3) express <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> 1 - ecos2i, sinu, sin2u, &amp;c.,
                    in series ascending by powers of <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> whose coefficients
                    are sines or cosines of multiples of <hi rend="italic">nt.</hi> Hence, by
                    substituting these values in equation (1) and in the development of (2), we have
                    <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> expressed in series whose
                    terms rapidly decrease, and whose coefficients are sines or cosines of multiples
                    of <hi rend="italic">nt.</hi> This is the complete practical solution of the
                    problem. But we must refer the reader to special treatises for the full
                    development of this subject. Compare § 52.</p>
                <p>§ 148. We may take an opportunity here of giving a sketch of a particular case of
                    the important question of “kinetic stability.” The general treatment of this
                    subject is entirely beyond our limits. But we may investigate its conditions, in
                    the case of a central orbit naturally circular, by a very slight modification of
                    our equations.</p>
                <p>Whatever be the law of central force, provided it depend on the distance alone,

                <p><hi rend="italic">Special Problem. The Brachistochrone.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 150. A celebrated problem in the history of dynamics is that of the “curve of
                    swiftest descent,” as it was called: —</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Two points being given, which are neither in a vertical nor in
                    a horizontal line, to find the curve joining them down which a particle sliding
                    under gravity, and starting from rest at the higher, will reach the other in the
                    least possible time.</hi></p>
                <p>The curve must evidently lie in the vertical plane passing through the points.
                    For suppose it not to lie in that plane, project it orthogonally on the plane,
                    and call corresponding elements of the curve and its projection σ and <hi
                    rend="italic">σ'.</hi> Then if a particle slide down the projected curve its
                    speed at σ' will be the same as the speed in the other at σ. But σ is <hi
                    rend="italic">never less</hi> than <hi rend="italic">σ',</hi> and is generally
                    greater. Hence the time through &lt;r' is generally less than that through σ,
                    and <hi rend="italic">never greater.</hi> That is, the whole time of falling
                    through the projected curve is less than that through tħe curve itself. Or the
                    required curve lies in the vertical plane through the points.</p>
                <p>Also it is easy to see that, if the time of descent through the entire curve is a
                    minimum, that through any portion of the curve is less than if that portion were
                    changed into any other curve.</p>
                <p>And it is obvious that, <hi rend="italic">between any two contiguous equal values
                    of a continuously varying quantity, a maximum or minimum must lie.</hi> [This
                    principle, though excessively simple (witness its application to the barometer
                    or thermometer), is of very great power, and often enables us to solve problems
                    of maxima and minima, such as require, in analysis, not merely the processes of
                    the differential calculus but those of the calculus of variations. The present
                    is a good example.]</p>
                <p>Let, then, PQ, QR and PQ', Q'R (fig. 48) be two pairs of indefinitely small sides
                    of polygons such that the time of descending through either pair, starting from
                    P with a given speed, may be equal. Let QQ' be horizontal, and indefinitely
                    small compared with PQ and QR. The brachistochrone must lie between these paths,
                    and must possess any property which they possess in common. Hence if <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> be the speed down PQ (supposed uniform) and <hi

                <p>Now if <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> be the inclination of PQ to the horizon, &amp;

                    that line,—which is easily seen to be a property of the cycloid, if we remember
                    that the tangent to that curve is parallel to the corresponding chord of its

                <p>The brachistochrone then, under gravity, is an inverted cycloid whose cusp is at
                    the point from which the particle descends.</p>
                <p>§ 151. Whatever be the impressed forces, reasoning similar to that in last
                    section would show that the osculating plane of the brachistochrone always
                    contains the resultant force, and that <hi rend="italic">v'</hi> cosø=

                    between the curve and the resultant of the impressed forces.</p>
                <p>Let that resultant = F, and let the element PQ = δs, and <hi rend="italic">θ' =

                <p>and Fcosø is the normal component of the impressed force. Hence we obtain the
                    result that, in any brachistochrone, the pressure on the curve is double of that
                    due to the force acting.</p>
                <p>§ 152. Now for the unconstrained path from P to R we have <hi rend="italic"
                    >feds</hi> a minimum (§· 202). Hence in the same way as before, &lt;∕&gt; being
                    the angle corresponding to 0, <hi rend="italic">vcosφ = v'cosφ'</hi> from
                    element to element, and therefore throughout the curve, if the direction of the
                    force be constant. Now, if the velocities in the unconstrained and
                    brachistochrone paths be equal at any equipotential surface, they will be equal
                    at every other. Hence, taking the angles for any equipotential surface, cos 0
                    cos <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> = constant.</p>
                <p>As an example, suppose a parabola with its vertex upwards to have for directrix
                    the base of an inverted cycloid; these curves evidently satisfy the above
                    condition, the one being the free path, the other the brachistochrone, for
                    gravity, and the velocities being in each due to the same horizontal line. And
                    it is seen at once that the product of the cosines of the angles which they make

                    and the applied force, will be a normal plane, and therefore the path will be a

                <p>§ 154. An excellent and important example is furnished by the simple pendulum,
                    when its vibrations are not confined to one vertical plane. When the bob moves
                    in a horizontal plane, the arrangement is called a “conical” pendulum, and it is
                    a very simple matter, as follows, to find the motion. For the vertical component
                    of the tension of the string must support the weight of the bob; <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi></p>
                <p>Tcosα = wι&lt;∕, where a is the inclination of the string to the vertical. Also
                    the horizontal component of the tension must supply the force τnV <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∕R (§ 49) requisite for the production of the
                    curvature of the path, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi></p>

                    of the small vibrations of a simple pendulum whose length is the vertical
                    component of that of the conical pendulum (§ 134).</p>
                <p>To carry the investigation to cases in which the pendulum describes a tortuous
                    cjιrve, we require (except for approximate results) the use of elliptic
                    functions. We thus obtain, among others, the following results :—</p>
                <p>The motion will be comprised between two horizontal circles. Let the depths of
                    these circles below the centre be <hi rend="italic">b + c</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b - c;</hi> then the vertical motion of the bob of the pendulum
                    will be the same as that of a point on a simple pendulum of length <hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∕c</hi> performing complete revolutions in the same periodic time as the
                    spherical pendulum.</p>
                <p>But for one of the most important applications the deflexion from the vertical is
                    always very small, and it is easy to obtain a sufficiently accurate working
                    approximation without the use of elliptic functions. If we put <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">q</hi> for the semidiameters of the small elliptic
                    orbit which will then be described by the pendulum bob, we find for the apsidal
                    angle <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> √1 <hi rend="subscript"> +</hi> ⅛2 <hi

                <p>Hence, when a pendulum is slightly disturbed in any way, the motion is to a first
                    approximation elliptic as in § 50. But the second approximation shows that this
                    ellipse rotates in its own plane, and in the same sense as that in which it is
                    described, with an angular velocity proportional to its area. Hence the
                    necessity for extreme care, in making Foucault’s experiment (presently to be
                    described), lest the path should even slightly deviate from a vertical
                    plane.</p>
                <p>§ 155. Another very important and useful example is furnished by Blackburn’s
                    pendulum, which is simply a pellet supported by three threads or fine wires
                    knotted together at one point C (fig. 50). The two other ends of two of them are
                    attached to fixed points A and B, and the third supports the pellet P. The
                    motion of P is virtually executed on a smooth surface, whose principal
                    curvatures near the lowest point are 1/CP in the plane of the three threads, and
                    1/PE in the plane perpendicular to them,—E being the intersection of the
                    vertical through C with the line AB. Hence for small disturbances of this
                    system, P has a simple harmonic motion in the plane of the paper whose period is
                    2τr √ <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> CP∕y, and another at right angles to it,
                    with period 2τr √ ’ PE∕y. The amplitudes of these motions are arbitrary, and,
                    with the difference of phase, depend entirely on the initial disturbance. Thus
                    we have a very simple mechanical means of producing the combinations treated in
                    § 63; for we have only to make</p>
                <p>PE: PC:: ω <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>: ω' <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, and
                    give the bob its proper initial motion.</p>
                <p>§ 156. When CE is very small compared, with CP, we have a realization of the case
                    of § 61, in which the <pb break="no"

                    which the ellipse gradually changes its form and position, so as to be always
                    inscribed in a definite rectangle. This experimental arrangement is exceedingly
                    instructive. To avoid as far as may be the effects of resistance of the air, the
                    vibrations should be slow, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the wires should be as
                    long as possible. The bob should be a ball of lead, containing a tube full of
                    ink which slowly escapes from a fine orifice at its lower end, so as to make a
                    permanent record of the path on a sheet of paper placed below the plane of
                    motion of the bob, but parallel and very close to it. Or, the bob may be
                    furnished with a spike at its lower end, from which induction sparks may be
                    taken so as to pierce a sheet of paper laid on a copper plate below it.</p>
                <p>By mere alterations of the point of suspension A, the ratio of ω, ω' may be
                    varied at pleasure, provided that AC and BC are long enough compared with
                    CP.</p>
                <p>§ 157. Lissajoux produced similar curves by attaching plane mirrors to the legs
                    of tuning-forks, and allowing a ray of light, after successive reflexions from
                    two such mirrors, to fall on a screen. But it seems to have been first pointed
                    out much earlier by Sang, and afterwards developed by Wheatstone, that the same
                    result is obtained by fixing firmly one end of a steel rod, and setting the free
                    end in vibration. There are two planes of greatest and least flexural rigidity
                    (§ 274) in all wires, however carefully drawn. These are at right angles to one
                    another; and the motion of the free end of the wire when slightly disturbed is
                    therefore precisely that of the bob of the Blackburn pendulum. Another
                    interesting mode of producing the same result is by causing a ray of sunlight to
                    be reflected in succession from four mirrors, all attached, nearly at right
                    angles, to parallel axes. One pair is made to rotate, the two in opposite
                    directions, with one angular velocity. A ray reflected in succession from these
                    is (§ 65) made to oscillate according to the simple harmonic law, in a plane
                    which can be varied at pleasure by altering the relative position of the normals
                    to the two mirrors. The other pair of mirrors supplies the other simple harmonic
                    motion, also in any desired plane.</p>
                <p>§ 158. We must next consider the effect of the earth’s rotation upon the motion
                    of a simple pendulum. Strange to say it was left for Foucault to point out, in
                    February 1851, that the plane of vibration of a simple pendulum suspended at
                    either pole would <hi rend="italic">appear</hi> to turn through four right
                    angles in twenty-four hours,—the plane, in fact, remaining constant in position
                    while objects beneath the pendulum were carried round by the diurnal rotation.
                    At the equator, it was pretty obvious that no such effect would occur, at least
                    if the original plane of vibration was east and west. By some process, pf which
                    he gives no account, Foucault arrived at the result that the plane of
                    oscillation must, in any latitude, appear to make a complete revolution in <hi

                    latitude. This curious result has been amply verified by experiment.</p>

                <p>To interpret equations (2) it is convenient to employ a second change of

                    with angular velocity Ω. If p,? be the coordinates referred to the new axes, we
                    have by analytical geometry</p>
                <p>η = pcos∩Z - ^sin∩i, £=psin4M + ^cos∩i, the substitution of which in (2) leads to

                    direction to that of the earth, with the component of the earth’s angular

                    by (3) that the bob of the pendulum describes an approximately elliptic orbit,

                <p>These are precisely the equations we should have had if the point had been fixed,
                    and in addition to the forces X, Y, and R acting on the particle, we had
                    applied, reversed in direction, the accelerations of the point’s motion with the
                    mass as a factor. It is evident that the same theorem will hold in three
                    dimensions. The accelerations , —are known as functions of <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The relative motion will evidently be that of a simple pendulum from side to side
                    of the point’s line of motion. In certain cases, when the angular velocity
                    exceeds a certain limit, we shall have the string occasionally untended; and
                    this will give rise to an impact when it is again tended. While the string is
                    untended the particle moves, of course, in a straight line.</p>

                <p>In each of these three cases the complete solution of the problem can be
                    exhibited in terms of elliptic functions. In the last two cases, when the arcs
                    of oscillation are very small, a sufficient solution may easily be obtained by
                    the usual methods of approximation. This is a particularly instructive
                    example.</p>
                <p>§ 160. As a final example of constrained motion of a particle, let us find the
                    form of a curve such that a particle will slide down any arc of it, from the
                    origin, in the same time as down the chord of that arc. If OA, OB (fig. 53) be
                    any two chords, it is plain that the difference of the times down these chords
                    must be equal to the time of describing the arc AB. But, if OA make an angle <hi
                    rend="italic">θ</hi> with the vertical, the time of descent along it is /

                <p>And the velocity at A is √2yOAcos0, so that the time of describing AB (considered
                    as infinitesimal) is <hi rend="smallcaps">AB∕λ∕2&lt;∕OAcos0.</hi></p>
                <p>If we put <hi rend="italic">r</hi> for OA, our condition gives at once <hi

                    relation is r <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> =α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    sin20, which belongs to the well-known lemniscate of Bernoulli. From its form we
                    see that the vertical line from which <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> is measured is a
                    tangent at 0; so that the motion in arc commences vertically</p>
                <p>§ 161. To complete this elementary sketch of the dynamics of a single particle we
                    take an instance or two of “disturbed motion.” The essence of this question is
                    usually that the disturbing forces are, at any instant, small in comparison with
                    the forces producing the motion; so that, during any brief period, the motion is
                    practically the same as if no disturbing cause had been at work. But, in time,
                    the effects of the disturbance may become so great as entirely to change the
                    dimensions and form of the orbit described. The mathematical method which has
                    been devised to meet this question depends upon what has just been said. The <hi
                    rend="italic">character</hi> of the path is not, at any particular instant,
                    affected by the disturbance; but its form and dimensions are. Hence, as the
                    first depends upon the <hi rend="italic">form</hi> of the equations which
                    represent it, while the latter depend upon the actual and relative magnitudes of
                    the constants involved, we settle, once for all, the <hi rend="italic">form</hi>
                    of the equation as if no disturbing cause had acted. But we are thus entitled to
                    assume that the constants which it involves are quantities which vary with the
                    time in consequence of the slight, but persistent, effects of the disturbance.
                    And, as we know that, if at any moment the disturbance were to cease, the motion
                    would forthwith go on for ever in the orbit <hi rend="italic">then being
                    described,</hi> we may assume that in the expressions for the components of the
                    velocity no terms occur depending on the rate of alteration of the values of the
                    constants. This, as will be seen below, very much simplifies the mathematical
                    treatment of such questions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Suppose a cycloidal pendulum, or a simple pendulum vibrating
                    through very small arcs, to be subjected to a simple harmonic disturbance in the
                    direction of its motion.</hi> The equation of motion will obviously be of the
                    form <hi rend="italic">θ + ri</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">θ≈ A. cos mt,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">ri</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">= l∕g,</hi> as in § 134.</p>
                <p>The integral of this equation is</p>
                <p>0 = Pcos(ni + Q) cosmi.</p>
                <p>m <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>- n <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi></p>
                <p>We see then that the result is the superposition of a new simple harmonic motion
                    on the natural simple harmonic motion of the undisturbed bob, and that it is
                    altogether independent of the amplitude and phase of the undisturbed motion. So
                    long as the disturbance is very small, this new part of the motion may be
                    neglected, unless <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is very nearly equal to <hi
                    rend="italic">n.</hi> For in that case the amplitude of the disturbance may
                    become much greater than that of the original motion. When <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> is equal to <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> the integral changes its form, and
                    we have <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> = P cos <hi rend="italic">(nt</hi> + Q) + A
                    θsin <hi rend="italic">nt. . ∆ib</hi></p>
                <p>This shows that, in the special case of a disturbance of the same period as the
                    undisturbed motion, the nature of the motion is entirely changed. Thus, suppose
                    the pendulum to be at rest at its lowest point when the disturbance is applied;
                    then we have merely <hi rend="italic">θ=</hi> A—sinni, <hi rend="italic">2n
                    ’</hi> a simple harmonic motion whose amplitude increases in proportion to the
                    time elapsed since the disturbance commenced.</p>
                <p>§ 162. As another illustration, <hi rend="italic">suppose the point of suspension
                    of a simple pendulum to have a simple harmonic motion of small amplitude in a
                    horizontal line.</hi></p>
                <p>Here the equations of motion are (to horizontal and vertical axes)</p>
                <p>∏ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ≈ - £</p>

                <p>But if we suppose the oscillations to be small, we may write <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi>- ξ = <hi rend="italic">lθ, y=l,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">I</hi> is
                    the length of the pendulum, and <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> the angle it makes with
                    the vertical. Then we have <hi rend="italic">x=lθ + ξ = lθ + Acosmt,</hi>
                    suppose, andÿ=0.</p>
                <p>Hence <hi rend="italic">mg≈</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Γ,</hi> and Z0 + Acoswzi = <hi rend="italic">-gθ,</hi> which is
                    precisely the equation of the preceding investigation.</p>
                <p>We see from this how to explain the somewhat puzzling phenomenon which we observe
                    when we produce complete rotations of a stone in a sling by a comparatively
                    trifling motion of the hand. All that is necessary is that the hand should have
                    a slight to and fro horizontal motion, in a period nearly equal to that in which
                    the sling and stone would vibrate as a pendulum. This result of particle
                    kinetics is (like that in § 161) of great value in other branches of physics,
                    especially sound, light, and radiant heat.</p>
                <p>To illustrate the general principle, let us take the case of one degree of
                    freedom. Then the equation of motion of an unit mass must be of the form</p>
                <p>0 = Θ + Θ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, where Θ represents the normal force, and
                    Θ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> the abnormal or disturbing force. Leaving out Θ
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> for the moment, let the integral of 0 = Θ be</p>
                <p>β=∕(α, <hi rend="italic">ß,</hi><hi rend="italic">t),</hi> in which α and <hi
                    rend="italic">β</hi> are two arbitrary constants. We may now suppose <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">β</hi> to be variable in such a way
                    that the equation shall still be satisfied by this value of <hi rend="italic"
                    >θ</hi> when the disturbing forces are included. This imposes only one condition
                    on the two independent quantities <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >β,</hi> so that to determine them completely we must impose a second. This we
                    do, as already explained, by making the expression for the speed independent of
                    the rates of alteration of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >β,</hi> and we gain the advantage that our solution will accord at every
                    instant with what would be the actual future motion if the disturbance were
                    suddenly to cease. The speed is <hi rend="italic">6≈f</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic"
                    >(a)h+f'(β)β+f'(t).</hi></p>
                <p>We therefore assume <hi rend="italic">f(af</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">

                <p>Taking account of this and differentiating again, we have
                    ¼Λ0∙*+⅛Z(&lt;)∙4+∕"ω.</p>
                <p>Hence we have, for the determination of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi

                    disturbance, made once for all, in the motion of a particle describing a
                    definite path under given forces. A single example must suffice.</p>

                    rend="italic">Third Law Kinetics of Two or More Particles.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 164. We have, by means of the first two laws, arrived at a <hi rend="italic"
                    >definition</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">measure</hi> of force, and have found
                    how to compound, and therefore how to resolve, forces, and also how to
                    investigate the conditions of equilibrium or motion of a single particle
                    subjected to given forces. But more is required before we can completely
                    understand the more complex cases of motion, especially those in which we have
                    mutual actions between or amongst two or more bodies,—such as, for instance,
                    tensions or pressures or transference of energy in any form. This is perfectly
                    supplied by the third law, on which Newton comments nearly as follows.</p>
                <p>§ 165. If one body presses or draws another, it is pressed or drawn by this other
                    with an equal force in the opposite direction. If any one presses a stone with
                    his finger, his finger is pressed with an equal force in the opposite direction
                    by the stone. A horse, towing a boat on a canal, is dragged backwards by a force
                    equal to that which he impresses on the towing-rope forwards. By whatever
                    amount, and in whatever direction, one body has its “motion” changed by impact
                    upon another, this other body has its “motion” changed by the same amount in the
                    opposite direction; for at each instant during the impact they exerted on each
                    other equal and opposite pressures. When neither of the two bodies has any
                    rotation, whether before or after impact, the changes of velocity which they
                    experience are inversely as their masses. When one body attracts another from a
                    distance, this other attracts it with an equal and opposite force.</p>
                <p>§ 166. We shall for the present take for granted that the mutual action between
                    two particles may in every case be imagined as composed of equal and opposite
                    forces in the straight line joining them, two such equal and opposite forces
                    constituting a “stress” between the particles. From this it follows that the
                    sura of the quantities of motion, parallel to any fixed direction, of the
                    particles of any system influencing one another in any possible way, remains
                    unchanged by their mutual action; also that the sum of the moments of momentum
                    of all the particles round any line in a fixed direction in space, and passing
                    through any point moving uniformly in a straight line in any direction, remains
                    constant. From the first of these propositions we infer that the centre of mass
                    of any system of mutually influencing particles, if in motion, continues moving
                    uniformly in a straight line, except in so far as the direction or speed of its
                    motion is changed by stresses between the particles and some other matter not
                    belonging to the system; also that the centre of mass of any system of particles
                    moves just as all their matter, if concentrated in a point, would move under the
                    influence of forces equal and parallel to the forces really acting on its
                    different parts. From the second we infer that the axis of resultant rotation
                    through the centre of mass of any system of particles, or through any point
                    either at rest or moving uniformly in a straight line, remains unchanged jn
                    direction, and the sum of moments of momentum round it remains constant, if the
                    system experiences no force from without, or only »forces whose resultant passes
                    through the centre of inertia of the system. This principle is sometimes called
                    “conservation of areas,” a very misleading designation.</p>
                <p>§ 167. Newton’s scholium, which we treat as a fourth law, points out that
                    resistances against acceleration are to be reckoned as reactions equal and
                    opposite to the actions by which the acceleration is produced. Thus, if we
                    consider any one material point of a system, its reaction against acceleration
                    must be equal and opposite to the resultant of the forces which that point
                    experiences, whether by the actions of other parts of the system upon it, or by
                    the influence of matter not belonging to the system. In other words, it must be
                    in equilibrium with these forces. Hence Newton’s view amounts to this, that all
                    the forces of the system, with the reactions against acceleration of the
                    material points composing it, form groups of equilibrating systems for these
                    points considered individually. Hence, by the principle of superposition of
                    forces in equilibrium, all the forces acting on points of the system form, with
                    the reactions against acceleration, an equilibrating set of forces on the whole
                    system. This is the celebrated principle first explicitly stated and very
                    usefully applied by D’Alembert in 1742, and still known by his name.</p>
                <p>§ 168. Thus Newton lays, in an admirably distinct and compact manner, the
                    foundations of the abstract theory of “energy,” which recent experimental
                    discovery has raised to the position of the grandest of known physical laws. He
                    points out, however, only its application to mechanics. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >actio</hi><hi rend="italic">agentis,</hi> as he defines it, which is evidently
                    equivalent to the product of the effective component of the force into the
                    velocity of the point at which it acts, is simply, in modern English
                    phraseology, the rate at which the agent works, called the “power” of the agent.
                    The subject for measurement here is precisely the same as that for which Watt, a
                    hundred years later, introduced the practical unit of a “horse-power,” or the
                    rate at which an agent works when overcoming 33,000 times the weight of a pound
                    through the distance of a foot in a minute,—that is, producing 550 foot-pounds
                    of work per second. The unit, however, which is most generally convenient is
                    that which Newton’s definition implies, namely, the rate of doing work in which
                    the unit of work or energy is produced in the unit of time.</p>
                <p>§ 169 Looking at Newton’s words in this light, we see that they may be converted
                    into the following :—</p>
                <p>“Work done on any system of bodies (in Newton’s <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n747/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0747-0716"/> Statement, the parts of any machine) has its
                    equivalent in work done against friction, molecular forces, or gravity, if there
                    be no acceleration; but if there be acceleration, part of the work is expended
                    in overcoming the resistance to acceleration, and the additional kinetic energy
                    developed is equivalent to the work so spent.”</p>
                <p>When part of the work is done against molecular forces, as in bending a spring,
                    or against gravity, as in raising a weight, the recoil of the spring and the
                    fall of the weight are capable, at any future time, of reproducing the work
                    originally expended. But in Newton’s day, and long afterwards, it was supposed
                    that work was absolutely lost by friction.</p>
                <p>§ 170. If a system of bodies, given either at rest or in motion, be influenced by
                    no forces from without, the sum of the kinetic energies of all its parts is
                    augmented iu any time by an amount equal to the whole work done in that time by
                    the stresses which we may imagine as taking place between its points. When the
                    lines in which these stresses act remain all unchanged in length, the sum of the
                    kinetic energies of the whole system remains constant. If, on the other hand,
                    one of these lines varies in length during the motion, the stress in that line
                    will do work or will consume work, according as the distance varies with or
                    against it.</p>
                <p>§ 171. Experiment has shown that the mutual actions between the parts of any
                    system of natural bodies always perform, or always consume, the same amount of
                    work during any motion whatever, by which the system can pass from one
                    particular configuration to another; so that each configuration corresponds to a
                    definite amount of kinetic energy. Hence no arrangement is possible in which a
                    gain of kinetic energy can be obtained when the system is restored to its
                    initial configuration. In other words, “the perpetual motion” is impossible.</p>
                <p>The “potential energy” (§ 113) of such a system, in the configuration which it
                    has at any instant, is the amount of work that its mutual forces perform during
                    the passage of the system from any one chosen configuration to the configuration
                    at the time referred to. It is generally convenient so to fix the particular
                    configuration chosen for the zero of reckoning of potential energy that the
                    potential energy in every other configuration practically considered shall be
                    positive.</p>
                <p>As particular instances of this we may notice many of the results already given:
                    for instance, the ordinary expression for the velocity acquired by a falling
                    stone (§ 28), ⅜v <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = <hi rend="italic">gx</hi>; for

                    increase of kinetic energy produced.</p>
                <p>To put this in an analytical form, we have merely to notice that, by what has

                <p>§ 172. Hitherto, as we have been dealing with the motion of a single particle
                    only, we have not required the assistance of even the third law. For, in those
                    cases, already treated, in which one of the forces was not given, it was at all
                    events due to a given constraint, and the geometrical circumstances of the
                    constraint supplied the means of determining it. In fact we were not, in any
                    case, concerned with reaction; or, to use the more modern form of expression, we
                    were engaged with one half, only, of a stress. When a stone’s motion was
                    investigated, no account was taken of the stone’s attraction for the earth ∖
                    when we dealt with central forces, the centre was supposed to be fixed; and,
                    even in the cases in which variable constraint was supposed, the curve which
                    produced it was assumed to move in a manner absolutely determined beforehand,
                    and in no way affected by the reaction of the mass acted upon.</p>
                <p>But, in nature, circumstances are not so simple. Though, for all practical
                    purposes, we may calculate the motion of an ordinary projectile as if its
                    attraction had no influence upon the motion of the earth, we cannot do so in the
                    case of the motion of the moon about the earth. The mass of the moon is about ∙
                    <hi rend="subscript"> g</hi> ⅛th of that of the earth, and its gravitation
                    effects on the motion of the earth cannot be neglected. The moon, in fact, moves
                    faster round the earth than would a projectile of less mass, though moving in
                    precisely the same relative orbit (§ 146). If the earth’s motion were not
                    accelerated by the reaction of the moon, the sole crest of the lunar tide-wave
                    would be on the side of the earth next the moon, and there would be full-tide
                    once only in a single rotation of the earth about its axis. We need not give
                    further instances here; they will present themselves in almost every case we
                    investigate.</p>
                <p>§ 173. To give a general notion of the applications of, and necessity for, the
                    third law, we choose a few special cases, selected so as to give, in short
                    compass, a sufficiently general glance at the whole subject.</p>
                <p>We take, first, the case of two stones or bullets connected by an inextensible
                    string passing over a smooth pulley. Let their masses be <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">m'.</hi> Our physical condition is that the
                    tension of the string, whatever be its value, is the same throughout; and this
                    is accompanied by the geometrical condition that the length of the string is
                    constant, or that the speeds of the two masses are equal but in opposite
                    directions. Hence the amounts of increase of momentum in a given time are as the
                    masses. But they are also as the forces, by the second law. Thus <hi
                    rend="italic">m: m'</hi>:: T - <hi rend="italic">mg: m’g -</hi> T.</p>
                <p>This gives, at once, <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic">
                    mm'</hi><hi rend="italic">. m + m'</hi> ’ so that the whole downward force on
                    <hi rend="italic">m'</hi> is <hi rend="italic">,</hi><hi rend="italic">,m' -
                    m</hi><hi rend="italic">mg-Γ</hi><hi rend="italic">= m-.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">+</hi><hi rend="italic">nd ’</hi> and the whole upward force on
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is m <hi rend="italic">...</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >m'</hi><hi rend="italic">-</hi><hi rend="italic">m</hi> I - <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The motion of the system is therefore of precisely the same <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n748/mode/1up"

                    vertical line, but the acceleration is less, in the ratio of the difference of
                    the two masses to their sum.</p>
                <p>§ 174. This is the essence of the arrangement called <hi rend="italic">Atwood’s
                    Machine,</hi> which used to be employed for the demonstration (in a rough way)
                    of the first and second laws of motion, in certain simple cases. The main
                    feature of the method is the artificial reduction of the acceleration, so that
                    the motion of the falling body is rendered slow enough to be followed by the eye
                    with some degree of accuracy. To prove the first law, a bar of metal was laid
                    across one of two equal masses suspended as in the example; and the system was
                    allowed to move under acceleration until the preponderating mass passed through
                    a ring which arrested the bar. The subsequent motion, with no acceleration, was
                    then observed by noting the passage of the falling mass in front of a vertical
                    scale, while the observer also listened to the ticking of a pendulum escapement.
                    For the verification of the second law, so far as uniform force is concerned,
                    the apparatus was adjusted by trial so that the extra load was detached from the
                    preponderating mass after 1, 2, 3, &amp;c., beats of the pendulum; and the
                    subsequent uniform speed was found to be nearly in proportion to these numbers.
                    And, again, to prove that momentum acquired is, <hi rend="italic"
                    >caeteris</hi><hi rend="italic">paribus,</hi> proportional to the force, the
                    effects of bars of different masses were compared by the same process.</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">l-x</hi> be the portions of the
                    string on opposite sides of the pulley at time <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> we have
                    <hi rend="italic">d?x</hi> m <hi rend="italic">m—</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    >m'x.</hi></p>
                <p>Hence by elimination of T we have <hi rend="italic">m - m'</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi><hi rend="italic">—χ</hi><hi rend="italic">, m + m</hi> and by

                <p>When one of the masses is vibrating pendulum-wise, the problem assumes a very
                    much more difficult aspect. We will take it later as an example of the
                    application of Lagrange’s general method.</p>
                <p>§ 175. Let us now suppose these masses, so connected, to be thrown like a
                    chain-shot. We see by § 166 that their centre of inertia moves as if the masses
                    were concentrated there. Also that the moment of momentum is unaffected. Hence
                    we have only to find the initial position and motion of the centre of inertia,
                    and the plane and amount of the initial moment of momentum; and the complete
                    determination of the motion follows. This case is precisely the same as that of
                    a well-thrown quoit, the rotation of which is about its axis of symmetry. It is,
                    so far as § 166 goes, the case of an ill-thrown quoit, which appears to wabble
                    about in an irregular manner. But these are matters properly to be treated under
                    Kinetics of a Rigid System.</p>
                <p>§ 176. Suppose, next, two masses <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> l</hi> and τn <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> to be connected together
                    by an elastic string, the extension of the string being proportional to the
                    tension. Let <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi> be held
                    in the hand, while <hi rend="italic">m.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi>
                    hangs at rest. Then let the system be allowed to fall. What is the nature of the
                    motion? Without mathematical investigation it is easy to see that, the moment
                    the masses are left free to fall, the tension of the stretched string will
                    gradually draw them together. When it has thus contracted to its normal length,
                    <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">relative</hi> speed of the two
                    masses will have a definite value. This will continue to be the relative speed
                    until they have passed one another and again arrived at a mutual distance <hi
                    rend="italic">I.</hi> At that instant the tension of the string comes into play
                    again; the relative speed becomes less and less, finally vanishing when the
                    distance between the masses is what it was at starting. Then the relative speed
                    becomes again one of approach, increasing steadily till the distance between the
                    masses is <hi rend="italic">I.</hi> This maximum speed of approach continues
                    till, after again passing one another, the particles once more reach the
                    relative distance <hi rend="italic">I.</hi> And so on. All this time, however,
                    their common centre of inertia has been steadily falling with uniformly
                    accelerated speed, as if the masses had been concentrated at it into one. Since
                    <hi rend="italic">I</hi> is the unstretched length of the string, if we call E
                    its modulus of elasticity, its tension at any other length, λ, is</p>
                <p>T=E <hi rend="superscript"> λ</hi> ~ <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> by Hooke’s
                    law. Hence, if initially <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> 1</hi> were at the origin, and the axis of <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    be taken vertically downwards, we have for the initial coordinate of ττz <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi></p>
                <p>&lt;⅛⅛-(ψ <hi rend="subscript"> +</hi> ι)∣.</p>
                <p>When the masses are moving, the third law informs us that the tension of the
                    string acts equally and in opposite directions on them. Thus the equations of
                    motion are <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>§ 177. Next let us take the case of a <hi rend="italic">Complex Pendulum,—</hi>
                    the motion of two or more pellets attached, at different points, to the same
                    thread, supported at one end. The general solution of this question presents
                    considerable difficulties, but if we confine our attention to slight
                    disturbances it is easily treated by very elementary processes. In fact, just as
                    a simple pendulum, <hi rend="italic">slightly</hi> disturbed in a vertical
                    pl⅛ne, has simple harmonic motion which may be regarded as the resolved part of
                    conical pendulum motion, so we may treat of a complex conical pendulum, and
                    resolve its motions parallel to any vertical plane.</p>
                <p>If there be but two masses attached to the string·, it is clear that they must,
                    if the motion is to be a persistent conical one, be always in one vertical plane
                    with the point of suspension. And there are obviously <hi rend="italic">two</hi>
                    dispositions of the string which are consistent with kinetic stability.</p>
                <p>Let A (fig. 54) be the point of suspension, then the masses may rotate steadily
                    in either of the two configurations sketched. To keep either mass moving in a
                    horizontal circle, all that is required is that the resultant force on it shall
                    be horizontal, directed towards the centre, and producing an acceleration equal
                    to V <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∕R, as in § 34. Let the whole system turn
                    with angular velocity ω, and let the lengths of the strings be <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> and δ, their directions making angles 0, &lt;∕&gt; with the
                    vertical.</p>
                <p>We will treat only the case in which these angles are so small that the arcs may
                    be written in place of their sines. Then <hi rend="italic">m</hi> requires a
                    horizontal resultant force <hi rend="italic">ma()of</hi> directed towards the
                    axis, and Μ requires M(α0 + δ&lt;∕&gt;)ω <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    similarly directed. Also, as the strings are both very nearly vertical, the
                    tension of the lower string may be taken as the weight of Μ, and that of the
                    upper as the sum of the weights of Μ and <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> Treating it,
                    then, as a statical problem, we have for the mass <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">maθω</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi> = (Μ + <hi

                <p>These formulae correspond to the first configuration, but a change of sign of <hi
                    rend="italic">φ</hi> adapts them to the second.</p>
                <p>These two equations involve three unknown quantities ω <hi rend="superscript">

                    of <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> and <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> is involved, so that
                    two equations are sufficient. [We have confined ourselves to small values of <hi
                    rend="italic">θ</hi> and <hi rend="italic">φ,</hi> but have not assigned any
                    limit to their smallness; so that their ratio has still an infinite range of
                    values.]</p>
                <p>Eliminate the ratio <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> ∣ <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> between
                    the two equations; and we have, putting <hi rend="italic">ψ</hi> for <hi

                <p>It is clear that, because the right-hand member is essentially less than <hi
                    rend="italic">ab,</hi> there are always two real values of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ψ,</hi> both positive, but one greater than the greater of <hi rend="italic">a,
                    b,</hi> the other less than the lesser. These correspond to two values of <hi

                    vibrates in one plane, consists (for each of the masses) of the resultant of two
                    simple harmonic motions, whose periods are</p>

                    of tracing (by ink, sand, electric sparks, &amp;c., § 156) a graphical
                    representation of the composition of two simple harmonic motions, of different

                <p>We see therefore that <hi rend="italic">the change in the kinetic energy of the

                <p>Another general expression for the kinetic energy of a system of particles, in

                    the coordinates, at time <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> of the particle ?zi, we have

                <p>But if X, Y, Z be the components of the forces (of whatever kind) acting on <hi

                <p>This expression was originally devised by Clausius for application to the kinetic
                    theory of gases. The quantity <hi rend="italic">2m(x</hi><hi rend="italic

                    inertia of the group of particles about the origin (§ 234).</p>
                <p>In all cases of motion of a group, in which this sum is either constant or
                    oscillates in an extremely short period about a constant value, the left-hand
                    side may be regarded as (on the average at least) a vanishing quantity. Thus an
                    equivalent of the kinetic energy is expressible as <hi rend="italic">-⅛2(Xx + Yy

                <p>§ 180. There remains to be treated, so far as particle dynamics is concerned, the
                    self-contained subject of <hi rend="italic">Impact.</hi> In connexion with it we
                    must once more refer to the second and third of Newton’s laws. We are now
                    dealing with forces which produce, in finite masses, finite changes of momentum
                    in excessively short periods of time. It is clear from this statement that their
                    effects may be treated altogether independently of finite forces, which may be
                    acting along with them, but which produce during the very short periods in
                    question only infinitesimal results. And, as in general we have no knowledge of
                    the actual force exerted at any instant during the impact, nor of the time
                    during which the action lasts, we confine ourselves to the quantity, called the
                    “impulse,” which measures the amount of momentum lost by one of the impinging
                    bodies and acquired by the other.</p>

                <p>§ 181. When two balls of glass or ivory impingeon one another, the portions of
                    the surfaces immediately in contact are disfigured and compressed until the
                    molecular reactions thus called into play are sufficient to resist further
                    distortion and compression. At this instant it is evident that the points in
                    contact are moving with the same velocity. But as solids in general possess a
                    certain degree of elasticity both of form and of volume, the balls tend to
                    recover their spherical form, and an additional impulse is generated. This is
                    proportional, as Newton found by experiment, to that exerted during the
                    compression, provided neither of the bodies is permanently distorted. The
                    coefficient of proportionality is a quantity determinable by experiment, and may
                    be conveniently termed the “coefficient of resti tution.” It is always less than
                    unity.</p>
                <p>§ 182. The method of treating questions involving actions of this nature will be
                    best explained by taking as an example the case of <hi rend="italic">direct
                    impact of one spherical ball</hi><hi rend="italic">on another.</hi> It is
                    evident that in the case of direct impact of smooth or non-rotating spheres we
                    may consider them as mere particles, since everything is symmetrical about the
                    line joining their centres. If the impinging masses are of large dimensions, of
                    the size of the earth, for instance, we cannot treat the effects of the impact
                    independently of the other forces involved; for the duration of collision in
                    such a case may be one of hours instead of fractions of a second.</p>
                <p>§ 183. Suppose that a sphere of mass Μ, moving with a speed <hi rend="italic"
                    >v</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi> overtakes and impinges on another of
                    mass M', moving in the same straight line with speed <hi rend="italic">v',</hi>
                    and that, at the instant when the mutual compression is completed, the spheres
                    are moving with a common speed V. Let R bé the impulse during the compression,
                    then</p>
                <p>M(t&gt;-V) = M'(V-√) = Rj <hi rend="subscript"> γ</hi>- <hi rend="subscript">

                <p>From these results we see that the whole momentum after impact is the same as
                    before, and that the common speed is that of the centre of inertia before
                    impact. The quantity V can vanish only if</p>
                <p>Mv+MV=0 , that is, if the momenta were originally equal and opposite.</p>
                <p>This is the complete solution of the problem if the balls be inelastic, or have
                    no tendency to recover their original form after compression.</p>

                <p>These results may be more easily obtained by the simple consideration that the

                <p>Thus if a number of equal solitaire balls or billiard balls be arranged in

                    of the row, it is reduced to rest, and the ball at the other end of the row goes
                    off with the original speed of impact. If two impinge, two go off, and so
                    on.</p>

                    impacts, whose effect is comparable with that of a finite force. One obvious
                    method of considering such a problem is to estimate <hi rend="italic"
                    >separately</hi> the changes in the velocity produced by the finite forces and
                    by the impacts, in the same indefinitely small time δi, and compound these for
                    the actual effect on the motion in that period.</p>
                <p>Another way, of course, is to equate the rate of increase of momentum per unit of
                    time to the force producing it.</p>

                    an attraction varying inversely as the cube of the distance from a point in its

                <p>This problem obviously leads to the same result as the following :— <hi

                <p>§ 190. Another excellent instance of the application of this process is furnished
                    by the motion of a rocket, where the motive power depends on the fact that a
                    portion of the mass is detached with considerable relative velocity. The
                    increase of the momentum of the rocket due to this cause is equal to the
                    relative momentum with which the products of combustion escape. If we suppose
                    the rocket, originally of mass Μ, to lose eM in unit of time, projected from it
                    with relative velocity V, the gain of momentum in time δi due to this cause is
                    eMVδZ.</p>

                <p>§ 191. The la&lt;V of energy, in abstract dynamics, may be expressed as follows
                    :—the whole work done in any time, on any limited material system, by applied
                    forces, is equal to the whole effect in the forms of potential and kinetic
                    energy produced in the system, together with the work lost in friction. This
                    principle may be regarded as comprehending the whole of abstract dynamics,
                    because the conditions of equilibrium and of motion, in every possible case, may
                    be derived from it.</p>
                <p>§ 192. A material system, whose relative motions are unresisted by friction, is
                    in equilibrium in any configuration if, and is not in equilibrium unless, the
                    rate at which the applied forces perform work at the instant of passing through
                    it is equal to that at which potential energy is gained, in every possible
                    motion through that configuration. This is the celebrated principle of “virtual
                    velocities,” which Lagrange made the basis of his <hi rend="italic">Mécanique
                    Analytique.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 193. To prove it, we have first to remark that the system cannot possibly move
                    away from any particular configuration except by work being done upon it by the
                    forces to which it is subject; it is therefore in equilibrium if the stated
                    condition is fulfilled. To ascertain that nothing less than this condition can
                    secure the equilibrium, let us first consider a system having only one degree of
                    freedom to move. Whatever forces act on the whole system, we may always hold it
                    in equilibrium by a single force applied to any one point of the system in its
                    line of motion, opposite to the direction in which it tends to move, and of such
                    magnitude that, in any infinitely small motion in either direction, it shall
                    resist or shall do as much work as the other forces, whether applied or
                    internal, altogether do or resist. Now, by the principle of superposition of
                    forces in equilibrium, we might, without altering their effect, apply to any one
                    point of the system such a force as we have just seen would hold the system in
                    equilibrium, and another force equal and opposite to it. All the other forces
                    being balanced by one of these two, they and it might again, by the principle of
                    superposition of forces in equilibrium, be removed; and therefore the whole set
                    of given forces would produce the same effect, whether for equilibrium or for
                    motion, as the single force which is left acting alone. This single force, since
                    it is in a line in which the point of its application is free to move, must move
                    the system. Hence the given forces, to which the single force has been proved
                    equivalent, cannot possibly be <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n753/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0753-0722"/> in equilibrium unless their whole work for an
                    infinitely small motion is nothing, in which case the single equivalent force is
                    reduced to nothing. But whatever amount of freedom to move the whole system may
                    have, we may always, by the application of frictionless constraint, limit it to
                    one degree of freedom only; and this may be freedom to execute any particular
                    motion whatever, possible under the given conditions of the system. If,
                    therefore, in any such infinitely small motion there is variation of potential
                    energy uncompensated by work of the applied forces, constraint limiting the
                    freedom of the system to only this motion will bring us to the case in which we
                    have just demonstrated there cannot be equilibrium. But the application of
                    constraints limiting motion cannot possibly disturb equilibrium, and therefore
                    the given system under the actual conditions cannot be in equilibrium in any
                    particular configuration if the rate of doing work is greater than that at which
                    potential energy is stored up in any possible motion through that
                    configuration.</p>
                <p>§ 194. If a material system, under the influence of internal and applied forces,
                    varying according to some definite law, is balanced by them in any position in
                    which it may be placed, its equilibrium is said to be neutral. This is the case
                    with any spherical body of uniform material resting on a horizontal plane. A
                    right cylinder or cone, bounded by plane ends perpendicular to the axis, is also
                    in neutral equilibrium on a horizontal plane. Practically, any mass of moderate
                    dimensions is in neutral equilibrium when its centre of inertia only is fixed,
                    since, when its longest dimension is small in comparison with the earth’s
                    radius, the action of gravity is, as we shall see (§ 222), approximately
                    equivalent to a single force through this point.</p>
                <p>§ 195. But if, when displaced infinitely little in any direction from a
                    particular position of equilibrium, and left to itself, it commences and
                    continues vibrating, without ever experiencing more than infinitely small
                    deviation, in any one of its parts, from the position of equilibrium, the
                    equilibrium in this position is said to be stable. A weight suspended by a
                    string, a uniform sphere in a hollow bowl, a loaded sphere resting on a
                    horizontal plane with the loaded side lowest, an oblate body resting with one
                    end of its shortest diameter on a horizontal plane, a plank, whose thickness is
                    small compared with its length and breadth, floating on water, are all cases of
                    stable equilibrium,—if we neglect the motions of rotation about a vertical axis
                    in the second, third, and fourth cases, and horizontal motion in general in the
                    fifth, for all of which the equilibrium is neutral.</p>
                <p>§ 196. If, on the other hand, the system can be displaced in any way from a
                    position of equilibrium, so that when left to itself it will not vibrate within
                    infinitely small limits about the position of equilibrium, but will move
                    .farther and farther away from it, the equilibrium in this position is said to
                    be unstable. Thus a loaded sphere resting on a horizontal plane with its load as
                    high as possible, an egg-shaped body standing on one end, a board floating
                    edgewise in water, would present, if they could be realized in practice, cases
                    of unstable equilibrium.</p>
                <p>§ 197. When, as in many cases, the nature of the equilibrium varies with the
                    direction of displacement, if unstable for any possible displacement it is
                    practically unstable on the whole. Thus a circular disk standing on its edge,
                    though in neutral equilibrium for displacements in its plane, yet being in
                    unstable equilibrium for those perpendicular to its plane, is practically
                    unstable. A sphere resting in equilibrium on a saddle presents a case in which
                    there is stable, neutral, or unstable equilibrium according to the direction in
                    which it may be displaced by rolling; but practically it is unstable.</p>
                <p>§ 198. The theory of energy shows a very clear and simple test for discriminating
                    these characters, or determining whether the equilibrium is neutral, stable, or
                    unstable, in any case. If there is just as much potential energy stored up as
                    there is work performed by the applied and internal forces in any possible
                    displacement, the equilibrium is neutral, but not unless. If in every possible
                    infinitely small displacement from a position of equilibrium there is more
                    potential energy stored up than work done, the equilibrium is thoroughly stable,
                    and not unless. If in any or in every infinitely small displacement from a
                    position of equilibrium there is more work done than energy stored up, the
                    equilibrium is unstable. It follows that if the system is influenced only by
                    internal forces, or if the applied forces follow the law of doing always the
                    same amount of work upon the system while passing from one configuration to
                    another by all possible paths, the whole potential energy must be constant in
                    all positions for neutral equilibrium, must be a minimum for positions of
                    thoroughly stable equilibrium, and must be either a maximum for all
                    displacements or a maximum for some displacements and a minimum for others when
                    there is unstable equilibrium.</p>
                <p>§ 199. We have seen that, according to D’Alembert’s principle, as explained
                    above, forces acting on the different points of a material system, and their
                    reactions against the accelerations which they actually experience in any case
                    of motion, are in equilibrium with one another. Hence, in any actual case of
                    motion, not only is the actual work by the forces equal to the kinetic energy
                    produced in any infinitely small time, in virtue of the actual accelerations,
                    but so also is the work which would be done by the forces, in any infinitely
                    small time, if the velocities of the points constituting the system were at any
                    instant changed to any possible infinitely small velocities, and the
                    accelerations unchanged. This statement, when put into the concise language of
                    mathematical analysis, constitutes Lagrange’s application of the “principle of
                    virtual velocities” to express the conditions of D’Alembert’s equilibrium
                    between the forces acting and the resistances of the masses to the acceleration.
                    It comprehends, as we have seen, every possible condition of every case of
                    motion. The “equations of motion” in any particular case are, as Lagrange has
                    shown, deduced from it with great ease.</p>

                    the rest of the solution is a question of pure mathematics.</p>
                <p>When we deal with a non-conservative system (which is equivalent in nature to
                    saying “when we take an incomplete view of the question ”), some of the
                    conditions may vary in character during the motion. This will be expressed
                    analytically by the entrance of <hi rend="italic">t</hi> explicitly into one or
                    more of the equations of condition <hi rend="italic">f.</hi> But, if we think of
                    the mode of formation of Lagrange’s equation, we see that it was built up of
                    separate equations, such as <hi rend="italic">mx</hi> = X + X', which are true
                    whether the equations of condition involve <hi rend="italic">t</hi> explicitly
                    or not. Each of these was multiplied by a quantity δα;, &amp;c., the only
                    limitation on which was that it should be consistent with the conditions of the
                    system at the instant considered, whatever instant that might be. Hence equation
                    (2) still holds good.</p>
                <p>When, however, we introduce in that equation multipliers corresponding to the
                    actual motion of the system, so that <hi rend="italic">δx=xδt,</hi> &amp;c., we
                    find a remarkably simple expression for the energy given to, or withdrawn from,
                    the system in consequence of the varying conditions. For the unintegrated
                    equation (2) now becomes</p>

                <p>F(f)+(f)-∙</p>
                <p>which are obtained by differentiating the equations of condition with regard to

                <p>§ 200. To complete our sketch of kinetics of a particle we will now briefly
                    consider the important quantity called “action.” This, for a single particle,
                    may be defined either as the space integral of the momentum or as double the
                    time integral of the kinetic energy, calculated from any assumed position of the
                    moving particle, or from an assigned epoch. For a system its value is the sum of
                    its separate values for the various particles of the system. No one has, as yet,
                    pointed out (in the simple form in which it is all but certain that they can be
                    expressed) the true relations of this quantity. It was originally introduced
                    into kinetics to suit the metaphysical necessity that something should be a
                    minimum in the path of a luminous corpuscle (see an extract from Hamilton in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Light,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 598). But there can be
                    little doubt that it is destined to play an important part in the final
                    systematizing of the fundamental laws of kinetics.</p>
                <p>The importance of the quantity called action, so far as is at present known,
                    depends upon the two principles of “least action” and of “varying action,” the
                    first as old as Maupertuis, the other discovered by Hamilton about half a
                    century ago.</p>
                <p>The first is— <hi rend="italic">If the sum of the potential and kinetic</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">energies</hi><hi rend="italic">of a system is the same in all its
                    configurations, then, of all</hi><hi rend="italic">the</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sets of paths by which the p&gt;arts of the</hi><hi rend="italic">system
                    can</hi><hi rend="italic">be</hi><hi rend="italic">guided by</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">frictionless constraint to pass from</hi><hi rend="italic">one
                    given configuration to</hi><hi rend="italic">another, that one for which the
                    action is least</hi><hi rend="italic">is the natural</hi><hi rend="italic">one
                    or requires no constraint.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 201. Unfortunately it is not easy to give examples of this important principle
                    which can be satisfactorily treated by elementary methods,—except, indeed, the
                    very simplest, such as those furnished by the corpuscular theory of light. Thus
                    it is obvious that, as long as a medium is homogeneous and isotropic, the speed
                    of a corpuscle in it is constant. The action is thus reduced to the product of
                    the constant speed of the corpuscle by the length of its path. Hence the
                    principle at once shows that the path must be a straight line. When the
                    corpuscle is refracted from one such medium into another, the path is a broken
                    line such that the product of each of its parts by the corresponding speed of
                    the corpuscle is the least possible. This gives the law of the sines, but to
                    agree with experiment the speed would have to be greater in the denser medium
                    than in the rarer.</p>
                <p>§ 202. The problem <hi rend="italic">to find change of action as depending on
                    change {nowhere finite') of the mode of passage from one given configuration to
                    another</hi> (restricted by the condition already mentioned), is expressed
                    mathematically by</p>

                <p>H being the constant energy of the system, and the integral being taken between
                    limits supplied by the two given configurations.</p>
                <p>The first equation gives</p>

                <p>If we now take the corresponding variation of the expressions for the kinetic

                    which so far is a mere kinematical result. But it can be rendered physical by
                    putting - δV for δ <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> Γ, in accordance with the
                    above condition. This we will suppose done.</p>
                <p>If now we desire to make δA vanish, so as to obtain what is called the
                    “stationary condition,” we must make the factor in square brackets in the
                    integral vanish; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> we must have <hi rend="italic"
                    >2m(xδx</hi><hi rend="italic">+</hi><hi rend="italic">i∕δy</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >+</hi><hi rend="italic">zδz)</hi> + δV = 0</p>
                <p>for all admissible simultaneous values of <hi rend="italic">δx, δy, δz</hi> for
                    the various particles of the system. But this is precisely the general equation
                    which, as we found in § 199 (1), determines the undisturbed motion of the
                    system.</p>
                <p>§ 203. The expression δA=0 really signifies that any infinitesimal change from
                    the natural mode of passage producesan infinitely smaller change in the
                    corresponding amount of the action between the terminal configurations.</p>
                <p>§ 204. It will be noticed that the essential characteristic of the modes of
                    passage considered in this investigation is that all shall have the same
                    terminal configurations, and that the system shall <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n755/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0755-0724"/> always have the same definite amount of energy.
                    All, except the natural mode of passage, in general require constraint in order
                    that they may be described. Hamilton's grand extension of the subject depended
                    on comparing the actions in a number of <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> modes of
                    passage, differing from one another by slight changes in their terminal
                    configurations, and slight changes in the whole initial energy.</p>
                <p>In this new form of statement the unintegrated part of the expression for δA
                    vanishes, since all the modes of passage contemplated are natural. The
                    alteration of the whole energy, however, adds a special term to the equation,
                    and we can at once write, from the expression (A) § 202, the equation for the
                    change in the action under the new conditions, viz.,</p>
                <p>δ A=£x?n(x <hi rend="italic">δχ</hi><hi rend="italic">÷</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >yδy</hi><hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> f ~δ~)J + ZδH, the part in brackets
                    having to be taken between limits corresponding to the terminal configurations,
                    and the variations δz, δy, <hi rend="italic">δz</hi> at these being subject to
                    the conditions of the system.</p>
                <p>We cannot here consider this equation in its general form. We content ourselves
                    with the simpler special deductions from it required for completing our sketch
                    of Kinetics of a Particle.</p>
                <p>The last given equation, written in full for a single particle of unit mass,

                    If the particle be altogether free, the seven variations on the right-hand side
                    are independent of one another; and thus we have the following remarkable
                    properties of the quantity A, regarded as a function of seven independent

                    A, called by Hamilton the “characteristic function.” The determination of this
                    function is troublesome, even in very simple cases of motion; but the fact that

                <p>§ 208. “Equiactional surfaces,” <hi rend="italic">i.c.,</hi> those whose common

                <p>A = const., are cut at right angles by the trajectories.</p>

                <p>Thus the determination of equiactional surfaces is resolved into the problem of
                    finding the orthogonal trajectories of a set of given curves in space, whenever
                    the conditions of the motion are given.</p>

                <p>This may be seen at once as follows: the element of the action, which is the same

                <p>§ 209. In consequence of the importance of the method we will take two examples
                    of its application. First a direct example, then one depending on the
                    equiactional surfaces.</p>

                <p>In this case it is obvious that represents the attraction of <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Let us take the plane of <hi rend="italic">xy</hi> as that of the orbit, then the

                    origin as centre. Thus the lines of equal action and the paths of individual
                    particles are convertible.</p>
                <p>We have also, in each of these cases, <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>This shows (as in § '94) that, whatever be originally the grouping of a set of
                    particles moving all according to one or other of these conditions, the density
                    at any part of the group remains unchanged during the motion. In fact, as it is
                    easy to prove, A and A' are elementary solutions of the partial differential
                    equation</p>

                    rend="italic">dy</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> and they are

                <p>For this reason the paths belonging to the two systems are everywhere orthogonal
                    to one another.</p>
                <p>Also, as the differential equation (1) for A is linear, any linear function of
                    particular integrals is an integral. Thus, for instance, we may take (p being

                <p>These, representing orthogonal sets of logarithmic spirals, possess the same
                    properties with regard to action as did the concentric circles and their radii,
                    which, in fact, are the mere particular case when <hi rend="italic">p</hi><hi

                <p>§ 213. It is easy to give graphic methods of tracing these curves of action by
                    means of an old process recently much developed by Clerk Maxwell. The present
                    example, though a very simple one, is quite sufficient to illustrate the
                    process.</p>
                <p>Draw, as in fig. 56, a set of circles whose radii are <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>, &amp;c., and a set of radii vectores making with the
                    initial line the successive angles, — , 2— , 3— , <hi rend="italic">Ac.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">,</hi> α being a quantity which <hi rend="italic">p p P</hi> may
                    have any convenient value. These lines will form a network, finer as <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> is smaller. Now suppose we wish to trace the curve</p>
                <p>A= <hi rend="italic">na.</hi></p>
                <p>We take the intersection of the circle whose radius is 6 <hi rend="superscript">

                    >(3-n)i.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus we have for the value of A at the point of intersection</p>

                <p>By marking the intersections corresponding to different values of <hi

                <p>In fig. 56 portions of three separate sets of mutually orthogonal logarithmic
                    spirals have been traced, by using the intersections of the fundamental straight
                    lines and circles.</p>
                <p>We may pursue the subject much farther, by combining particular solutions like
                    those given but taken from different origins. We can afford space for one only.
                    Let P, Q (fig. 57) be points on the axis of <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> distant
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">-a</hi> from the origin, R any

                <p>A' = 0-0 <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, we must have, not only the equation <hi

                    >dx</hi></p>
                <p>This follows at once from the fact that all the equations are linear.</p>
                <p>§ 214. In fig. 57 we have <hi rend="smallcaps">S</hi><hi rend="superscript
                    smallcaps"> a</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">=</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">PR∕QR.</hi>
                    Hence the locus of R is a circle, whose centre, B, is on QP produced.</p>
                <p>Again A' = a&lt;RPaJ-^≤,RQaj=^ιPRQ . The locus of <hi rend="subscript"> v</hi> R
                    is, in this case, any circle passing through P and Q.</p>
                <p>These circles evidently cut one another orthogonally in R; for BR, which is a
                    radius of the one, is a tangent to the other.</p>
                <p>Thus particles moving in a plane, so that the speed at any point R is inversely
                    as PR. RQ, may describe circles in wfιich PQ is a chord. In this case the curves
                    of equal action are circles defined by the condition that the ratio PR: RQ is
                    constant. Or they may move in the latter system of circles, in which case the
                    former system gives the lines of equal action. For the equations in the
                    preceding section give <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">dx)</hi><hi

                <p>We may easily extend this example to other sets of orthogonal curves whose
                    equations are</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> =pA + A ’,</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = — A + <hi rend="italic">pA',</hi> where A and A'
                    have their recent values. Or we may extend the example by assuming at

                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, in which case it will be found that we must have <hi

                    >θ</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>These pairs may again be combined into <hi rend="italic">pA + A</hi> ’ and - <hi

                    on.</p>
                <p>It will be noticed that in these examples the curves of equal action and the
                    paths of the particles correspond in steady fluid motion to curves of equal
                    pressure and lines of flow, and in electric conduction to equipotential lines
                    and current lines. In such cases in fact, where there is no vortex-motion, the
                    action is closely analogous to what is called the “velocity potential” in a
                    fluid.</p>

                <p>§ 215. By the help of the result already obtained in connexion with least action,
                    we may easily obtain in a simple, though indirect, way the remarkable
                    transformation of the equations of motion of a system which was first given by
                    Lagrange. We are not prepared to give here the transformation to <hi
                    rend="italic">G</hi><hi rend="italic">eneralized Coordinates</hi> in its most
                    general form; but, even in the restricted form to which we proceed, it is almost
                    invaluable in the treatment of the motion of conservative systems of particles
                    in which the number of degrees of freedom is less than three times that of the
                    particles. The one point to be noticed is that, when we restrict ourselves to a
                    system of this kind, the expression for the kinetic energy, T, is necessarily a
                    pure quadratic function of the rates of increase of the generalized coordinates.
                    This is obvious from § 19. Repeating with generalized coordinates the
                    investigation of § 202, we have</p>

                <p>To exemplify the use of these equations we will take again a few of the more

                <p>Still keeping to easy examples, suppose the cord of the ordinary simple pendulum

                    for acceleration perpendicular to, and along, the radius-vector of a plane curve
                    (§47).</p>
                <p>Instead of the complex pendulum treated in § 177, we will now take the case of
                    two masses attached at different points to an elastic string, or light helical
                    spring, and consider their <hi rend="italic">vertical</hi> vibrations.</p>

                    >η</hi> be the vertical displacements at time <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> we

                <p>The equilibrium positions are found by supposing the accelerations to vanish, so
                    that, if we suppose ξ and <hi rend="italic">η</hi> to be measured from them, the
                    terms in <hi rend="italic">g</hi> will disappear. Hence the solution is of
                    exactly the same nature as that already given for an apparently different
                    problem (§ 178).</p>
                <p>We may mention that equations practically the same as these are obtained when we
                    consider the motions of a watch and its balancewheel, the watch being supported
                    in a horizontal position by means of a wire, and oscillating in its own plane by
                    the torsion-elasticity of the wire. The reader of § 242 below will have no
                    difficulty in obtaining this result. It suggests a practical method of “setting”
                    a watch to true time, without turning the hands forward or backward, and without
                    letting it run down.</p>
                <p>The following is a simple, but very instructive, example of the transference of
                    energy (back and forward) between two parts of a system. Two bar-magnets of
                    equal mass, length, and strength (fig. 58), are supported horizontally by pairs
                    of parallel strings, so that when at rest they are in one line.</p>
                <p>One of them is slightly displaced in the direction of its length, find the
                    subsequent motion of both.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>We suppose the bars to be so long, in comparison with the distance between
                    them, that we need take account only of the action of their poles which are
                    turned towards one another.</p></note></p>
                <p>If we can, by any process, find two fundamental states of motion which, once
                    established, will be permanent, any other possible motion of the system will be
                    a superposition of these two. The amplitudes and phases in the components may
                    have any values, so long as the whole disturbance is small. This follows from
                    the fact that the system has two degrees of freedom only,—since we are concerned
                    only with motions in the plane of the figure.</p>
                <p>(A) Now one obviously possible motion is a simple harmonic vibration of the
                    whole, without change of distance between the magnets. The period of this
                    vibration is obviously the same as that of either magnet if the other were
                    removed.</p>
                <p>(B) Another obviously possible motion is that in which the magnets are, at every
                    instant, equally and oppositely deflected. The period of this oscillation will
                    be less or greater than that of the former according as the poles attract or
                    repel one another.</p>
                <p>Now the initial state of motion proposed evidently consists of the superposition
                    of (A) and (B) in such a way that there is, at starting, no displacement of
                    either mass, but a definite velocity of one of them only. This corresponds to
                    simultaneous zero of displacement, with equal velocities, for each of (A) and
                    (B). There is therefore at that instant no displacement of either mass; and one
                    is at rest while the other is moving with double the assigned velocity. If <hi
                    rend="italic">2π∕n, 2π</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">n'</hi> be
                    the periods of the two motions, it is obvious that after the time <hi
                    rend="italic">π</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">(n-n')</hi> the
                    magnets will have interchanged their states so that the arrangement will present
                    exactly the same appearance as at first, <hi rend="italic">if looked at from the
                    other side.</hi></p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be the distance between the ends of the bars when
                    all four strings are vertical. Then, if 0, <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> be at time

                    the strings. The expression for the potential energy due to magnetism is of the
                    form ∕z∕D, where <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> is positive if like poles be turned to
                    one another.</p>
                <p>Hence</p>
                <p>T = ⅛mZ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> (0 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + ≠ <hi

                <p>Forming the equations as usual, and omitting powers of 0 and <hi rend="italic"
                    >φ</hi> above the first, we have wi <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> 0= <hi

                    from which the results already given may be deduced.</p>
                <p>Finally, let us take the case of Atwood’s machine (§ 173) when the masses are
                    equal, and one of them is vibrating through small arcs.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">r, θ</hi> be the polar coordinates of the vibrating mass;
                    then, neglecting powers of 0 higher than the second, we have the generalized
                    equations</p>
                <p>2r-r0 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = - ⅜&lt;∕0 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>,

                    rend="italic">.</hi><hi rend="italic">at</hi></p>
                <p>Put <hi rend="italic">⅛gr</hi> for <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and 0√2 for 0, and
                    we get <hi rend="italic">r</hi>- r0 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = - 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, I4(r <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> 0)= - 20. <hi
                    rend="italic">r at</hi></p>
                <p>Transform to rectangular coordinates in the plane of motion, <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> being vertically downwards; then <hi rend="italic">x=y*</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    i</hi><hi rend="italic">, y=-2y)x.</hi></p>
                <p>This shows that the vertical acceleration of the vibrating particle is very
                    small, but constantly downward. Hence the energy of the vibratory motion is
                    steadily converted into energy of translation of the masses.</p>
                <p>When both the equal masses vibrate through small arcs, it is found that the mass
                    whose angular range is the greater has downward acceleration with diminishing
                    angular range. Hence it would appear that, if the string be long enough, the
                    entire motion would be periodic.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Statics of a Rigid Solid.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 217. A rigid body, as we have already seen, has at the utmost six degrees of
                    freedom, three of translation and three of rotation. According to Newton’s
                    scholium, the conditions of equilibrium of such a body, under the action of any
                    system of forces, are that the algebraic sum of the rates of doing work by and
                    against the forces shall be <hi rend="italic">nil</hi> whatever uniform velocity
                    of translation or of rotation the body may have. For, if this were not so, there
                    would be work done against acceleration, and the body would gain or lose kinetic
                    energy. And this gain or loss would take place even if the body were originally
                    at rest, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it would not be in equilibrium. To ensure
                    equilibrium then, all that is necessary is that the sums of the components of
                    the forces in any three non-coplanar directions shall vanish, along with the
                    sums of their moments about any three non-coplanar lines. For simplicity it is
                    usual to assume for these directions a system of rectangular axes, and for the
                    lines another system parallel to them and passing through some definite point
                    (say the centre of inertia) of the body.</p>
                <p>Thus we have at once</p>
                <p>2(X) = 0, 2(Y) = 0, 2(Z) = 0;</p>
                <p>Σ(Zy-Yz) = 0, 2(Xz-Zx) = 0, 2(Yz-Xι∕) = 0, where X, Y, Z are the components,
                    parallel to the axes, of a force acting at the point <hi rend="italic">x, y,
                    z</hi> of the body. If P, with direction cosines λ, ∕z, <hi rend="italic"
                    >v,</hi> represent the force acting at <hi rend="italic">x, y, z,</hi> these
                    equations may be written in the form</p>
                <p>2(Pλ) = 0, <hi rend="smallcaps">2(P</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> m</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">=</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">0,
                    2(Pγ)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">=</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">0</hi></p>
                <p>2[P(vy-∕4z)] = 0, 2[P(λz-w)] = 0, 2[P(<hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> ux-λy)] =
                    0.</p>
                <p>These equations correspond to the six degrees of freedom involved.</p>
                <p>It is easy to see that it is a mere matter of convenience through what point of
                    the body we draw the lines about which moments are taken. For, if we shift it by
                    quantities <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> δ, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> respectively,
                    the moments become</p>
                <p>2{Z(y-δ)-Y(z- <hi rend="subscript"> c</hi>)}, &amp;c.; but these are 2(Zy - Yz) -
                    δ2(Z) + c2(Y), &amp;c.; and, by the first three equations, these quantities are
                    seen to reduce themselves to their first terms. Hence, in forming the equations
                    of equilibrium, simplicity will be gained by choosing as origin a point through
                    which the line of action of one or more of the applied forces passes.</p>
                <p>Again, the point of application of any one of the forces may be shifted at will
                    anywhere along the line in which the force acts. For the equations of the line
                    in which the force at <hi rend="italic">x, y,</hi><hi rend="italic">z</hi> acts
                    are a/ <hi rend="italic">- x y</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi> z' <hi rend="italic">-z</hi> ^X^ —W““Z~ ’</p>
                <p>and these give Zy' - Yz ’ = <hi rend="italic">7.y - Yz</hi>, &amp;c., so that the
                    expressions for the moments are unaltered if the point of application of the
                    force be shifted to any position along the line in which it acts.</p>
                <p>§ 218. In the great majority of treatises on Statics the fundamental propositions
                    of the subject, above given, are deduced from the assumption (as a thing to be
                    proved experimentally) of the result just established, which is designated the
                    “principle of the transmission of force.” Along with it are assumed the
                    parallelogram of forces, and the principle of the “superposition of systems of
                    forces in equilibrium.” Since the publication of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principia,</hi> the continued use of such methods must be looked upon as a
                    retrograde step in science.</p>
                <p>§ 219. From this category we cannot quite except (so far at least as the usual
                    modes of treating it are concerned) the valuable idea of the “couple,” due to
                    Poinsot. But the term is in such common use, and the idea in its applications
                    sometimes of such importance, that it cannot be omitted here.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A couple is a pair of equal forces acting on the same body in
                    opposite directions and in parallel lines.</hi></p>
                <p>From the general conditions already given we see that a couple produces a
                    definite moment of force about a particular axis, but that the axis is
                    determinate merely as regards directiou, and not as regards position in space.
                    The forces of a couple do not appear in the first three of the equations of
                    equilibrium. On the other hand, the left hand members of the other three
                    equations may all be regarded as moments of couples. All the properties of
                    couples are contained in these statements. Thus, for instance, it is obvious
                    that, so far as its eSects are concerned—</p>
                <p>1. A couple may be shifted by translation to any other position in its own
                    plane.</p>
                <p>2, It may be shifted to any parallel plane.</p>
                <p>3. In either of these it may be turned through any angle.</p>
                <p>4. Its forces may be increased or diminished in any ratio, provided the distance
                    between their lines of action (which is called the “arm” of the couple) be
                    proportionately diminished or increased.</p>
                <p>A couple is therefore completely determined by means of its “axis,” which is a
                    line drawn perpendicular to its plane, and of length representing its moment.
                    And two couples are obviously to be compounded by treating their axes as if they
                    were forces acting at one point.</p>
                <p>§ 220. We will now examine the consequences of the six conditions of equilibrium
                    (§ 217) in some of the more common cases which present themselves. But, before
                    doing so, it may make matters clearer if we restate these conditions in a
                    somewhat different form.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The resultant of any number offerees, acting at any points of a
                    rigid body, may be represented by a single force acting at the origin, and a
                    couple of definite moment about a definite line passing through the
                    origin.</hi><hi rend="italic">For equilibrium of the body this force and couple
                    must separately vanish.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus if, in fig. 59, P, acting at Q, be any one of the forces, and O the origin
                    (chosen at random), we may introduce at O a pair of equal and opposite forces ±
                    P, parallel to P. The original force, taken along with - P at the origin, gives
                    a couple; and in addition there is + P acting at the origin.</p>
                <p>§ 221. When only two forces act on a body, the first <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n760/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0760-0729"/> condition above shows that they must be equal and
                    opposite, and the second that they must act in the same line, if they are to
                    maintain equilibrium. When only three forces act, the first condition shows that
                    their directions must lie in one plane, the second that their lines of action
                    must be parallel or must meet in one point, if they are to maintain
                    equilibrium.</p>
                <p>If their directions meet in one point we have again the problem of the
                    equilibrium of a single particle under three forces; for there can be no moment
                    about this point.</p>
                <p>When the directions are parallel, one of the forces must obviously be equal to
                    the sum of the other two, and must act in the opposite direction. Also its line
                    of action must lie between those of the other two, for their moments about any
                    point in it must be equal and opposite. Hence it is impossible that any single
                    force should balance a couple, unless we adopt the mathematical fiction of an
                    infinitely small force acting in a line everywhere at an infinite distance; <hi
                    rend="italic">so</hi> that its moment may be finite, and equal and opposite to
                    that of the couple.</p>
                <p>§ 222. When any number of parallel forces act simultaneously on a rigid body,
                    their resultant is a single force equal to their algebraic sum, with a couple
                    whose plane is obviously parallel to the common direction of the forces. The
                    forces of this couple may be made, by lengthening or shortening the arm, equal
                    to the resultant force. One of them will neutralize it, and the other remains
                    the final resultant, which passes through a definite point called the “centre of
                    parallel forces.” Thus any set of parallel forces necessarily has a single force
                    as a resultant, excepting in the special case when their algebraic sum is
                    zero.</p>
                <p>§ 223. Excellent examples are furnished by heavy bodies of moderate dimensions,
                    where the weights of their parts are forces practically in parallel lines. The
                    single resultant force, in such cases, is the whole weight of the body. Its
                    direction always passes through the centre of inertia (§ 109) because weight (in
                    any one locality) is proportional to mass. For this reason all heavy bodies of
                    moderate dimensions are said to have a “centre of gravity,” which coincides with
                    the centre of inertia. But it must be noticed that the two ideas are radically
                    different, and that, while every piece of matter has a true centre of inertia,
                    it is, in general, only approximately that we can predicate of it that it has a
                    centre of gravity. In fact a body has a true centre of gravity only when it
                    attracts, and is attracted by, all other gravitating matter as if its whole mass
                    were concentrated. in that point. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Potential.</hi> When
                    there is a centre of gravity in a body, it is necessarily coincident with the
                    centre of inertia. In gravitation cases, where bodies of moderate size are
                    concerned, the resultant is, at least approximately, a single force. But, when
                    we deal with large non-barycentric bodies like the earth, we find that the
                    resultant of the sun’s attraction is a force (determining the orbit) and a
                    couple (producing precession, &amp;c.).</p>
                <p>When a mass is laid on a three-legged table, we find the pressure which each leg
                    supports by simply taking moments about the line joining the upper ends of the
                    other two. The leg is thus seen to support a fraction of the weight of the mass,
                    whose numerator is the distance of the centre of gravity of the mass from this
                    line, and its denominator the distance of the leg from the same line. Thus we
                    have a physical proof of the geomet rical proposition that if any point, P, be
                    taken in the plane of a triangle ABC (fig. 60), and perpendiculars be drawn from
                    it and from the angles, we have</p>
                <p>Aα <hi rend="smallcaps">BΓ'Cc '</hi></p>
                <p>If the mass of the table is to be reckoned, P must be taken as the centre of
                    gravity of the system of table and load together. If the table be of uniform
                    material, triangular, and supported by legs at its corners, similar reasoning
                    shows that when it is unloaded (or loaded at its centre of gravity) each leg
                    supports one third of the weight.</p>
                <p>§ 224. Examples in which the resultant is a single couple are found in rigidly
                    magnetized bodies placed in a uniform magnetic field. As the amounts of N. and
                    S. magnetism in a body are always equal, there is no force of translation in a
                    uniform field. The resultant couple depends for its magnitude on the orientation
                    of the body, and the positions of equilibrium are those for which its moment
                    vanishes.</p>
                <p>§ 225. Let P at <hi rend="italic">x, y,</hi> z, be one of a system of parallel

                <p>λ'R = S[P(ry-μz)], μ'R = 2[P(λz- <hi rend="italic">vx)],</hi> v'R=2[P(μa!-λy)]
                    .</p>
                <p>The last three equations give the following conditions determining R, λ', <hi
                    rend="italic">μ',</hi><hi rend="italic">ν':</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi></p>
                <p>λ'R + <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> α2(Pz) - v2(Py) = 0, -λ2(Pz)+√R + r2(Pz) =
                    0,</p>
                <p>+ λ2(Py) - μ2(Px) + PR =0.</p>
                <p>From these we have the equation of condition λλ' + <hi rend="italic">μμ'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">÷</hi><hi rend="italic">vv</hi> = 0 , showing that the axis of the
                    couple is at right angles to the common direction of the parallel forces.</p>
                <p>We have also</p>
                <p>R <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> =(2(Pz)) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> +

                <p>This expression is of the same form as that in § 77, and we therefore conclude
                    that, if λ", <hi rend="italic">μ",</hi><hi rend="italic">v"</hi> be the
                    direction cosines of a line in the body such that</p>

                <p>the magnitude of the resultant couple is directly as the sine of the angle
                    between this line and the common direction of the parallel forces. In fact the
                    mere form of the three equations above proves this result.</p>
                <p>In the case of a body of moderate dimensions, acted on by gravity, P is the
                    weight of the element at <hi rend="italic">x, y, z,</hi> and therefore
                    proportional to its mass, so that if the centre of inertia be taken as the
                    origin we have</p>
                <p>2(Pz∙) = 0, 2(Pτ∕) = 0, 2(Pz) = 0, and there is no couple. The whole effect is
                    therefore the same as if the mass were condensed at the centre of inertia.</p>
                <p>In the case of a magnet,</p>
                <p>2(P)=0, and there is no translatory force. The couple, as we have seen, depends
                    upon the orientation of the body as regards the direction of the line of the
                    earth’s magnetic force.</p>
                <p>§ 226. We have seen that any system of forces acting on a rigid body may be
                    reduced to a force and a couple; also that when the force is in the plane of the
                    couple the resultant can always be put in the form of a single force acting in a
                    definite line in the body. When the force is not in the plane of the couple, we
                    may resolve the couple into two components, the plane of one being parallel, of
                    the other perpendicular, to the force. The first, when compounded with the
                    force, merely shifts the line in which it acts. Thus any system of forces may be
                    reduced to a single force, acting in a definite line called the “central axis,”
                    and a couple in a plane perpendicular to it. One of the forces of the couple may
                    now be compounded with the single force, and thus we obtain, as the resultant of
                    any system of forces, a pair of forces in non-intersecting lines not
                    perpendicular to one another. This is only one of an infinite number of ways in
                    which fancy, or convenience, may lead us to represent the equivalent of a group
                    of forces. Many very curious theorems have been met with in investigations on
                    this subject. For instance, by compounding one of the forces of the resultant
                    couple with the resultant force (not <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n761/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0761-0730"/> now necessarily perpendicular to its plane) we
                    have a system of two forces acting in non-intersecting lines. Then we have the
                    following curious proposition, which may easily be proved from the formulae
                    already given :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">When a</hi><hi rend="italic">system of forces</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">is reduced in any manner what</hi><hi rend="italic">ever</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">is constant.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 227. The most symmetrical pair of resultant forces is found thus. Take any
                    point P (fig. 61) in the central axis, and draw through it a lihe APA',
                    perpendicular to it, and bisected at P. Substitute for the single force at P its
                    halves acting at A and A' respectively. Combine these respectively with the
                    forces AQ, A ’ Q' of the couple when AA' is made its arm. The system is thus
                    reduced to two equal forces AR, A'R', whose directions are interchangeable by a
                    rotation of two right angles about the central axis.</p>
                <p>Let P with direction cosines λ, <hi rend="italic">μ,</hi><hi rend="italic">v</hi>
                    be one of the forces, and let <hi rend="italic">x, y, z</hi> be its point of
                    application. Then</p>
                <p>X = 2(Pλ), Y = S(P∕χ), Z = S(P^) are the components of the single force at the
                    origin. Also I. = 2[P(<hi rend="italic">vy -</hi> μz)]</p>
                <p>M = 2[P(λz-va)] N=S[P(<hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> uα-λy)] are the components of
                    the resultant couple.</p>
                <p>If we shift the origin to the point <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi> the first three quantities are unaltered, but
                    the couples become</p>
                <p>I.'= I. + cY-Z&gt;Z M'=M + αZ-cX N'=N + Z&gt;X-αY.</p>
                <p>The point <hi rend="italic">a, b, c</hi> is on the central axis if the axis of
                    the resultant couple be parallel to the single force, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> if</p>
                <p>⅜=γ=y= <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> &gt; <hi rend="superscript"> su</hi> PP <hi

                    rend="italic">-bX + aY +</hi><hi rend="italic">eZ.</hi></p>
                <p>Either of these sets gives the equations of the central axis.</p>
                <p>The resultant force and couple are in one plane, and therefore the resultant is a
                    single force in the central axis, when</p>
                <p>I.'X + M'Y + N'Z = 0.</p>
                <p>By the values of I.', M', N', above, we see that this is equivalent</p>
                <p>LX + MY + NZ = 0.</p>
                <p>When this last conditionis not satisfied, we see that the value of the left hand
                    member which, from the way in which it occurs, must obviously be an invariant,
                    is e(X <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + Y <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + Z <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>), where <hi rend="italic">e</hi> has the same value
                    as in the three equations above.</p>
                <p>§ 228. One of the most remarkable of the many curious theorems connected with the
                    single resultant of a system of forces is that of Minding. We have seen that, in
                    general, the resultant may be put in the form of a single force and a couple in
                    a plane perpendicular to it. Tf we now suppose the system of forces to be
                    shifted into a new position such that their points of application, their
                    magnitudes, and the angles between their directions two and two, all remain
                    unchanged, the resultant force will be of the same magnitude as before, but the
                    couple will in general be different. Of the infinitely infinite number of
                    possible positions which the forces may assume, an infinite number correspond to
                    a zero couple. Minding has shown that the lines of action of these single
                    resultants consist of all lines passing through each of two curves, fixed in the
                    body, an ellipse and an hyperbola, in planes perpendicular to each other. The
                    proof of the proposition gives an interesting example of the use of Rodrigues’s
                    coordinates (§ 83).</p>
                <p>The most obvious mode of attacking this question would be to resolve the applied
                    forces into three groups, parallel respectively to three rectangular axes which
                    revolve with them, and to choose those axes so that the sum of the resolved
                    parts does not vanish parallel to any one of the three. Each of these systems of
                    parallel forces has its own “centre” (§ 222),—so that the final resolution gives
                    three forces, each of a given magnitude, acting in any mutually perpendicular
                    directions at three definite points in the body. This, however, is not
                    analytically so simple as the following.</p>
                <p>We refer the body to fixed axes <hi rend="italic">Ox, Oy, Oz,</hi> to be
                    afterwards specified. As the origin and the directions of these axes are at our
                    disposal, we may impose six conditions. Now suppose the forces to be resolved
                    parallel to a set of rectangular axes Oa∕, <hi rend="italic">Oy', Oz!</hi> which
                    will be considered afterwards to rotate with them. Such a system of axes may, at
                    starting, have any assigned position. This gives us three conditions more. Let
                    then A, B, C be the components, parallel to the second set of axes, of the force
                    applied at the point whose coordinates referred to the first system are <hi
                    rend="italic">a, b, c.</hi> Let the direction cosines of the second system in
                    any of its future positions, referred to the first system, be <hi rend="italic"
                    >l</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">, m</hi><hi

                <p>Then the force at <hi rend="italic">a,</hi><hi rend="italic">b,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> has the following components :—</p>

                    Oz.</hi></p>
                <p>The expressions for the resultant force and couple at the origin will evidently
                    depend upon the following twelve quantities, besides the direction cosines, viz
                    :—</p>
                <p>SA, SB, SC,</p>
                <p>S(Aα), S(A⅛), S(Ac), S(Bα), S(Bδ), S(Bc), S(Cα), S(CZ&gt;), S(Cc).</p>
                <p>Assume SB = 0, SC = 0, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> let <hi rend="italic">Ox</hi>
                    ’ be always parallel to the direction of the resultant force. Next, let</p>

                    we have still four conditions to impose, we select the following:—</p>
                <p>S(Bα) = 0, S(Bc)=0, S(Cα) = 0, S(Cδ) = 0.</p>

                <p>§ 229. Suppose a ladder to be leaning against a vertical wall. If there be no
                    friction, what force, applied at the ' lower end, will just suffice to support
                    it?</p>
                <p>In the treatment of all questions of this kind the student should commence by
                    making a rough sketch of the situation, indicating all the forces concerned,
                    with the directions in which they act. As shown in fig. 62, the wall exerts an
                    outward thrust S.on the upper end of the ladder, the ground an upward thrust R
                    on the lower end. The only other force is gravity, which may be supposed to
                    produce a downward force at the middle of the ladder, equal to its whole weight.
                    Unless there be some other horizontal force to balance S, - the ladder will
                    obviously slide down. Suppose then a horizontal force F to be applied at the
                    lower end, and let the ladder be inclined at an angle α to the horizon. Then our
                    conditions become horizontally S - F=0, vertically W-R=0, and for the couple in
                    the plane of the figure, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> being the length of the
                    ladder,</p>
                <p>⅜WZ cosα - SZsina = 0.</p>
                <p>[The last equation is obtained by taking moments about the lower end of the
                    ladder, this point being chosen (§ 217) because the directions of two of the
                    forces pass through it.] From these equations we find at once</p>
                <p>F = S = ⅜W cota.</p>
                <p>It is to be observed that the requisite force F is very small while the ladder is
                    nearly vertical, but increases without limit as it becomes more nearly
                    horizontal.</p>
                <p>§ 230. Next let us vary the question by supposing the coefficient of friction on
                    the ground to be <hi rend="italic">μ.</hi> The equations are precisely the same
                    as before, and the limiting value of α for which equilibrium is possible is now
                    to be found by putting <hi rend="smallcaps">F=</hi><hi rend="subscript
                    smallcaps"> m</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">R-</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps">
                    m</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">W.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus 2μ = Cθta gives the smallest value of α for which equilibrium is possible.
                    For any larger value of α less friction is called into play.</p>
                <p>§ 231. If next we assume the wall also to be rough, a new friction force, G,
                    comes in. The equations (for any given value of α) are</p>
                <p>S-F≈0,</p>
                <p>W-R-G = 0, ⅛ΛVZcosα-SZsinα-GZcosα = 0 .</p>
                <p>Here there is a certain amount of indeterminateness which our formulae cannot
                    escape (although of course it does not exist in nature) so long as we are not
                    dealing with the limiting case in which motion is about to commence. In that
                    case we have the additional conditions</p>
                <p>G= <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> *S, <hi rend="smallcaps">F=</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript smallcaps"> m</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">R.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus, in all, there are five equations. These are requisite and necessary because
                    there are four forces S, G, R, F to be determined, as well as the special value
                    of the angle α. The result of eliminating the four forces is <hi

                <p>§ 232. We may still further vary the question by supposing a man of* weight <hi
                    rend="italic">w</hi> to ascend the ladder. Let <hi rend="italic">e</hi>
                    represent the fraction of the ladder’s length which he has ascended. The
                    equations are</p>
                <p>S-F=0,</p>
                <p>W+w-R-G=0,</p>

                <p>Introducing the condition that slipping is just about to commence, we obtain w
                    (l÷μ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> )e-μ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> tan α

                <p>W</p>
                <p>where <hi rend="italic">a</hi> has the value given in § 231. Hence the limiting
                    angle is increased or diminished by the load on the ladder according as</p>
                <p>2(l + <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> u <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>)i-2μ <hi

                <p>The ratio w/W does not appear in this condition. But it shows its importance when
                    <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is either greater or less than ∣.</p>
                <p>Hence, when the ladder is just about to slip, a man makes it more stable if he
                    stands anywhere on the lower half of it, but brings it down if he mounts higher.
                    We conclude that, so far as sliding is concerned, it is advantageous to make the
                    lower half of a ladder more massive than the upper half.</p>
                <p>§ 233. Suppose a ladder, with its lower end resting against a wall, to be
                    supported by a horizontal rail parallel to the wall (fig. 63). This case is
                    chosen because it illustrates definite limits within which stability is
                    ensured.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be the half length of the ladder, <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> its inclination to the horizon, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> the distance of
                    the rail from the wall. Suppose the ladder in such a' position that if there
                    were no friction it would slip downwards. Then the equations of equilibrium
                    are</p>
                <p>R + G cos α - S sin <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = 0,</p>
                <p>F + Scosa + Gsina-W = 0,</p>
                <p>S&amp;seca - Wacosa = 0.</p>
                <p>In the third of these equations the lower end of the ladder has been chosen as
                    the point about which moments are taken, because the lines of action of three of
                    the forces <pb break="no"

                    indeterminateness, because there are two places at which friction comes in, and
                    we do not know at which it is most freely exerted. But if the whole be on the
                    point of slipping, we have as before the additional data <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Kinetics of a Rigid Solid.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 234. The motion of a rigid body is, as we have seen, completely determined when
                    we know the motion of one of its points and the relative motion of the body
                    about that point. The point usually chosen is the centre of inertia of the body,
                    and the investigation of its motion comes under the kinetics of a particle,
                    which we have already sufficiently discussed. For we are permitted to suppose
                    the whole mass to be concentrated at that point, and to be acted on by all the
                    separate forces, each unaltered in direction and magnitude. Hence we may now
                    confine ourselves to the study of the motion about the centre of inertia which,
                    for the moment, we may look on as fixed.</p>
                <p>To illustrate, in a very simple manner, the new conceptions which are required
                    for the study of this question, let us take a uniform circular ring of matter,
                    of radius R, revolving with angular velocity ω about an axis through its centre,
                    and perpendicular to its plane. Its moment of momentum is obviously</p>

                <p>The work done by the couple in time <hi rend="italic">St</hi> is <hi

                <p>By equating these we have (after dividing both sides by ω) the same equation as
                    we obtained from the rate of increase of moment of momentum. It will be observed
                    that these equations are of exactly the same form as those for the motion of a
                    particle parallel to one of the coordinate axes, only that ω takes the place of
                    a velocity (such as <hi rend="italic">x)</hi> while the expression MR <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> takes the place of Μ, and the right-hand side is the
                    moment of a force, not a force simply.</p>
                <p>§ 235. Hence, generally, we define as follows :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Def.</hi> The “moment of inertia” of a body about any axis
                    is the sum of the products of the mass of each particle of the body into the
                    square of its (least) distance from the axis.</p>
                <p>The following theorem enables us at once to find the moment of inertia about any
                    line, as axis, from that about a parallel axis through the centre of
                    inertia.</p>
                <p>Let the line be chosen as the axis of <hi rend="italic">z,</hi> then the moment
                    of inertia about it is</p>

                <p>But, if <hi rend="italic">x, y</hi> be the coordinates of the centre of inertia,
                    ξ, η the coordinates of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> with reference to that centre,
                    we have x=χ + ξ, <hi rend="italic">y=y + ∙η,</hi> and the above expression for
                    the moment of inertia becomes</p>

                <p>2(wιξ)≈=0, 2(∞η) = 0.</p>
                <p>Hence the above expression consists of two parts:—</p>

                    inertia.</p>
                <p>§ 236. Hence we need study only the moments of inertia about axes passing through
                    the centre of inertia. But we will commence with an origin assumed at
                    hazard.</p>

                <p>If we measure off, on the axis, a quantity <hi rend="italic">p</hi> whose square

                <p>As the moment of inertia is essentially a positive quantity, this equation
                    represents an ellipsoid. It must of course have three principal axes; and, when
                    these are taken as the coordinates axes, the terms in <hi rend="italic">ξη,
                    ηζ,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ζξ</hi> in the above expression must
                    disappear.</p>
                <p>§ 237. Hence at every point of every rigid body there are three “principal axes”
                    of inertia, at right angles to one another. One of them is the axis of absolute
                    maximum moment, another that of absolute minimum.</p>
                <p>Our equation now becomes, when referred to these axes, l = Aξ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + B√ + Cf <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, or,
                    dividing by p <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>,</p>

                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>Thus the moment of inertia about any axis is found from those about the principal
                    axes at that point by multiplying each by the square of the corresponding
                    direction cosine, and adding the results.</p>
                <p>For the quantity A was written originally as</p>
                <p>Sτn(y <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> +z <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>), <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, it is the moment of inertia about the axis of <hi
                    rend="italic">x.</hi> We see also that, at every point of a body, there are
                    three rectangular axes such that the expressions <hi rend="italic">⅛(mxy),
                    ⅛(myz'), 2(mzx)</hi> vanish when these are taken as coordinate axes.</p>
                <p>To find how these axes are distributed in a body, let us suppose it referred to
                    the principal axes through its centre of inertia, and let M⅛ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, M⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>, M⅛∣ be the
                    moments of inertia about them. The quantities fc <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, ⅛

                    principal “radii of gyration.” Then, by the results above, the moment of inertia
                    about a line λ, <hi rend="italic">μ,</hi><hi rend="italic">v</hi> through the
                    point <hi rend="italic">a, β,</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi> is <hi rend="italic"

                <p>For a principal axis this is to be a maximum or minimum, with the sole

                <p>The determination of moments of inertia is, like that of centres of inertia, a
                    purely mathematical matter, the full discussion of which would lead us away from
                    the proper objects of this article.</p>
                <p>§ 239. The simplest cases that can present themselves so far as rotation is
                    concerned (for the translational effects on a rigid body are treated precisely
                    as if it were a mere particle,—a process already sufficiently illustrated) are
                    those in which there is one degree of freedom to rotate, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> when the body is rigidly attached to a fixed axis. Here the physical
                    condition is simply that the rate of increase of moment of momentum is equal to
                    the moment of the resultant couple about the axis of rotation.</p>
                <p>§ 240. Let us recur to Atwood’s machine as a first example, and suppose the
                    string not to slip on the pulley, so that the pulley must turn. In this case we
                    must observe that the two free parts of the string are now, as it were, separate
                    strings, so that we have no right to assume their tensions to be equal. In fact
                    if they were equal there would be no acceleration of the rotation of the pulley,
                    nor of course of the common velocity of the two masses. We assume that the
                    pulley is symmetrical, and the axis through its centre of inertia.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be the radius of the pulley, and ω its angular
                    velocity, then α&lt; <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> &gt; is the linear velocity of
                    either mass. Thus the linear acceleration of each of the masses is equal to <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> times the angular acceleration of the pulley. But the
                    linear acceleration multiplied by the mass is the measure of the force producing
                    it; while the angular acceleration multiplied by the moment of inertia is the
                    measure of the moment of the couple producing it. Thus we have (Μ being the mass
                    of the pulley, and <hi rend="italic">k</hi> its radius of gyration)</p>
                <p><hi> MI</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> × angular acceleration = (T' - T)α,

                    >mg.</hi></p>
                <p>Eliminating T and T', and taking account of the above relation between the
                    accelerations, we find at once</p>

                    from which, by the last two of our equations, the separate values of T and T'
                    may be found.</p>
                <p>If we compare this result with that obtained in § 173, on the supposition that
                    the pulley was perfectly smooth, we see that the only difference is in the
                    addition of M^ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∕αto the sum of the two masses.
                    Otherwise the nature of the motion remains unaffected.</p>
                <p>§ 241. Let us next take the case of a body of any form attached to a horizontal
                    axis which does not pass through its centre of inertia. In such a case gravity
                    is the force producing motion, and we have what is called a “compound pendulum.”
                    Draw through the centre of inertia a line parallel to the axis; let <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> be the distance between these lines, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >θ</hi> the angle which their plane makes (at a given time) with the vertical.
                    The moment producing angular acceleration is obviously</p>

                <p>If then we can find two parallel axes in a rigid body, lying in one plane with
                    the centre of inertia, and on opposite sides of that point, such that the time
                    of oscillation is the same for each, the distance between them is the length of
                    the equivalent simple pendulum. Kater made use of this proposition in his
                    determination of the length of the second’s pendulum, under the circumstances in
                    which it was defined by Act of Parliament as a datum for restoring, in case of
                    loss, the standard yard.</p>

                    parallel to that about which the first is constrained to move; and, for
                    simplicity, suppose the centre of inertia of the first body to be in the plane
                    containing the two axes. Here we have a <hi rend="italic">complex compound

                    distinguish between two hollow shells, one of gold the other of silver, if their
                    diameters and masses be alike, and both be painted.” If we observe that the
                    volumes of equal masses are inversely as the densities, the volume of the gold
                    shell is seen to be less than that of the silver one, and therefore, on the
                    whole, its mass is farther from the centre, and its moment of inertia greater.
                    Hence any form of experiment in which the moment of inertia comes in will
                    suffice to decide the question. Thus they might be alternately clamped tight to
                    the end of a rod, and the system swung as a pendulum, when the gold sphere would
                    vibrate more slowly than the silver one. Or they might be allowed to <hi
                    rend="italic">roll,</hi> not <hi rend="italic">slide,</hi> down a rough plane.
                    In this case the work done by gravity on each is the same when they have fallen
                    through equal spaces. But its equivalent is in the form of kinetic energy,
                    partly translational and partly rotational. The relative amounts of these two
                    depend on the moments of inertia of the spheres, for the ratio of the
                    translational velocity to the angular velocity is the same for each. Hence the
                    gold sphere, having the greater moment of inertia, will have the smaller
                    velocity of translation. Another form of this question was to have a shell with
                    a spherical mass inside, which might be either free to rotate on gimbals, or
                    else be keyed to the outer skin. The keying would of course retard the motion of
                    the whole down a rough plane, for part of the energy due to gravity would then
                    be shared by the internal mass in the form of energy of rotation, from which it
                    would otherwise have been free. Another very instructive form is that of a
                    spherical shell full of fluid. If the fluid be perfect, the moment of inertia is
                    that of the shell alone; if it be infinitely viscous, the moment of inertia is
                    that of shell and fluid as if they constituted one rigid solid; and we may have
                    every intermediate amount. If we suppose the rotation of the outer shell to be
                    suddenly stopped, the infinitely viscous contents would be reduced to rest also.
                    But if they be not infinitely viscous they will not at once be brought to rest,
                    but will be able to put the shell in rotation again if it be at once set free.
                    Thus, in practice, we can tell a raw egg from a hard-boiled <hi rend="italic"
                    >egg.</hi> The first is with difficulty made to rotate, and sets itself in
                    motion again if it be stopped and at once let go. The second behaves,
                    practically, like a rigid solid.</p>
                <p>§ 244. The problem of the rolling of a sphere down a rough inclined plane is
                    solved at once, as above, by applying the conservation of energy. For, if <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> be the coordinate of its centre parallel to the plane, <hi
                    rend="italic">θ</hi> the angle through which it has turned, and <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> its radius, we have the kinematical condition <hi

                <p>(due to the perfect roughness of the plane).</p>
                <p>Also the potential energy lost is</p>
                <p>Musina, where a is the inclination of the pl⅛ne to the horizon; and the kinetic
                    energy gained is made up of the two parts,— ∣M⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    translational, and ∣MO <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> rotational.</p>
                <p>Hence M(⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>)^ <hi

                <p>The centre of inertia of the mass therefore moves, relatively to the constrained

                <p>This is, again, the equation of motion of a simple pendulum, but the angle of

                    but from the uniformly rotating radius of the guide circle. Hence the mass
                    oscillates, pendulum-wise, about this uniformly revolving line.</p>
                <p>§ 246. Let us take, as an instance of impulse, the case of Robins’s “ballistic
                    pendulum,”—a massive block of wood movable about a horizontal axis at a
                    considerable distance above it,—employed to measure the velocity of a cannon or
                    musket shot. The shot is usually fired into the block in a horizontal direction
                    perpendicular to the axis. The impulsive penetration is so nearly instantaneous,
                    and the mass of the block so large compared with that of the shot, that the ball
                    and pendulum are moving on as one mass before the pendulum has been sensibly
                    deflected from the position of equilibrium. This is the essential peculiarity of
                    the ballistic method,—which is used also extensively in electromagnetic
                    researches and in practical electric testing, when the integral quantity of the
                    electricity which has passed in a current of short duration is to be measured.
                    The line of motion of the bullet at impact may be in any direction whatever, but
                    the only part which is effective is the component in a plane perpendicular to
                    the axis. We may therefore, for simplicity, consider the motion to be in a line
                    perpendicular to the axis, though not necessarily horizontal.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">m</hi> be the mass of the bullet, <hi rend="italic">v</hi>
                    its velocity, and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> the distance of its line of motion
                    from the axis. Let Μ be the mass of the pendulum with the bullet lodged in it,
                    and <hi rend="italic">k</hi> its radius of gyration. Then, if ω be the angular
                    velocity of the pendulum when the impact is complete, <hi rend="subscript">
                    %</hi><hi rend="italic">mιp</hi> = M7t <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ω, from
                    which the solution of the question is easily determined. For the kinetic energy
                    after impact is changed into its equivalent in potential energy when the
                    pendulum reaches its position of greatest deflexion. Let this be given by the
                    angle <hi rend="italic">θ</hi>; then the height to which the centre of inertia
                    is raised is ⅞(1 - cosθ), if <hi rend="italic">h</hi> be its distance from the
                    axis. Thus</p>

                    an expression for the chord of the angle of deflexion. In practice the chord of
                    the angle <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> is measured by means of a light tape or cord
                    attached to a point of the pendulum, and slipping with small friction through a
                    clip fixed close to the position occupied by that point when the pendulum hangs
                    at rest.</p>
                <p>§ 247. As another example of impulse let us consider the case of a body moving in
                    any way in a plane perpendicular to one of its principal axes. It is required to
                    find what point of the body must be suddenly fixed in order that the whole may
                    be brought to rest; also, what will be the consequent impulsive pressure at this
                    point. It is easy to see that this is exactly the same question as to find the
                    impulse, and its point of application, so that it may produce a given motion of
                    a body in a plane perpendicular to one of its principal axes.</p>
                <p>The impulse must obviously act in a plane passing through the centre of inertia.
                    And the physical conditions are that the change of momentum of translation is
                    equal to, and in the direction of, the impulse, while the change of moment of
                    momentum about the centre of inertia is equal to the moment of the impulse. Let
                    the impulse acting at the point <hi rend="italic">ξ, η</hi> have components R, S
                    parallel to rectangular coordinates in the plane of motion, and let ω be the
                    angular velocity, <hi rend="italic">u, v</hi> the linear velocities, generated
                    by it. Then the physical conditions are</p>
                <p>Mu==R, Mv=S, MZ,"ω = Sξ — Rη,</p>
                <p>When <hi rend="italic">u, v, ω</hi> are given, R and S are found from the first
                    two equations, and the third is then the equation of the line in which the
                    impulse must act. Similarly, when the impulse and its line of action are given,
                    we have in terms of these data the quantities <hi rend="italic">u, v,</hi>
                    ω.</p>
                <p>§248. Asa simple practical example, suppose one strikes a hard object with a
                    stick in such a way that his hand is at rest at the instant*of the impact; with
                    what part of the stick must he strike so that there may be no jar on his
                    hand?</p>
                <p>Let £ be measured along the stick from its centre of inertia in the direction
                    which it has at the instant of impact. Then the kinematical condition is <hi
                    rend="italic">v≈aω,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is the distance from the
                    hand to the centre of inertia of the stick. Thus, as the impulse S is the sole
                    cause of the stick’s being brought to rest, we have</p>
                <p>Mv + S = 0, Mfc⅛∕α + Sξ=0; so that <hi rend="italic">ξ=÷k</hi><hi rend="italic

                <p>If, however,the hand be moving, at the instant of impact, perpendicularly to the
                    stick with velocity V, the kinematical condition is <hi rend="italic">v—</hi> V
                    = αω, which introduces a corresponding change in the result.</p>
                <p>§ 249. The reaction of the axis is easily calculated. If the axis about which the
                    body is constrained to rotate be perpendicular to a plane though the centre of
                    inertia about which the body is symmetrical, and if the applied forces act in
                    that plane, it is clear that the reaction of the axis is a single force in that
                    plane. Let its components be S and H. Then</p>

                    cannot get the information required to evaluate separately Z and Z'.</p>
                <p>§ 250. When impulsive forces are applied to the body, exactly the same methods
                    may be employed, with the exception that <hi rend="italic">u' — u</hi> must be
                    written for ⅛ ’, &lt;fcc., and ω' - ω for <hi rend="italic">θ.</hi> The
                    quantities X, Y, Z, S, H, Z, S', H', Z' now denote impulses and not forces.</p>
                <p>As a single example of the use of these formulae, take the case of a body
                    rotating, under the action of no force, about an axis through its centre of
                    inertia. Here 2(mae) = 0, &amp;c., and a is constant. The first two of the six
                    equations last written show that the pairs of forces S, S' and H, H' form
                    couples. The fourth equation gives <hi rend="italic">θ = ωt;</hi> and with this
                    the remaining two become</p>
                <p>2(wιz2∕).ω <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = - cH - c'H'= - (c-c')H , 2(m).α&gt;
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = -c≡-c'S'= -(c-c')Ξ.</p>
                <p>The multipliers of <hi rend="italic">ω</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi>
                    are each zero if the axis of rotation be a principal axis, and thus, in this
                    case, there is no stress perpendicular to the axis. When the axis is not a
                    principal axis the left hand terms are generally finite but they vary as the
                    body turns. It is easy to see, however, that together these terms constitute a
                    constant couple always in a plane passing through the axis, rotating with the
                    body and dependent directly on the square of the angular velocity. Thus, to
                    analyse the factor <hi rend="italic">^2,{mzy),</hi> we note that <hi
                    rend="italic">z</hi> is constant, and</p>
                <p>2∕ = rsin(α√ + α), where <hi rend="italic">r, a</hi> were the polar coordinates
                    of the mass <hi rend="italic">m</hi> at time <hi rend="italic">t</hi> = 0. Hence
                    <hi rend="italic">'2,{mzy)</hi> = sin ω∕2(wιzic <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>) +
                    cos <hi rend="italic">ωt2(mzy</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">'),</hi> where ic <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> = rcosα and 2∕ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> =rsinα were the
                    coordinates of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ati = 0. Similarly we have <hi
                    rend="italic">'2,(mzx) =</hi> cosω∕2(maq) - sin <hi rend="italic"
                    >ωt2(mzy</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">).</hi></p>
                <p>These expressions prove the preceding statements.</p>
                <p>§ 251. Asa final instance of impulse in this branch of the subject, suppose that
                    a rigid plate, moving anyhow in its own plane, has one of its points suddenly
                    fixed, what will be the subsequent motion? Let the position in space at which
                    the point is to be fixed be chosen as origin, and let the axis of <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> be chosen so as to pass through the centre of inertia at
                    the moment of fixture. Then, if <hi rend="italic">u, υ</hi> be the velocities of
                    the centre of inertia, ω the angular velocity about it, <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    its distance from the point to be fixed, the conditions of the impact are <hi
                    rend="italic">u'=u -</hi> ≡∕M, √ = t&gt;-H∕M, <hi rend="italic">ω'=ω +
                    Ha∕lΛk</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi></p>
                <p>—three equations with five unknown quantities. But the conditions that the point
                    in question is reduced to rest are evidently w = 0, √-ω'α=0.</p>
                <p>These furnish the requisite additional data, and the solution is complete. If we
                    eliminate H between the two equations which contain it, we have</p>
                <p>⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ω' + <hi rend="italic">av' = k</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">ω + av,</hi> whence by the
                    relation between <hi rend="italic">v'</hi> and ω' we have <hi rend="italic"
                    >(k</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> + α <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>)ω' = <hi rend="italic">k</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ω + av.</hi></p>
                <p>These equal quantities, each multiplied by Μ, represent respectively the moment
                    of momentum about the point before and after its fixture.</p>
                <p>§ 252. Thus, as a little consideration will show, we might have solved the
                    problem at once, so far as the impulsive change of <hi rend="italic">motion</hi>
                    is concerned, by noticing that as the impulse is applied at the origin, the
                    moment of momentum about that point will not be altered by it. In fact many
                    problems, which present serious complexity when treated by the direct methods,
                    are solved with comparative ease by such general considerations as the
                    conservation of moment of momentum, or the conservation of energy. The first
                    principle holds good when there is no resultant couple, or impulsive couple,
                    round the origin; the second when no work on the whole is done by or against the
                    forces or impulses.</p>
                <p>§ 253. We have given instances of pure sliding, and of pure rolling, in one
                    plane, and will now give a single instance of combined rolling and sliding. A
                    common but instructive case of the problem we propose to consider is that of a
                    hoop thrown forwards and at the same time made to rotate, so that after a time
                    it stops, and finally rolls backwards to the hand. Other cases are furnished by
                    a “following stroke” or a “screw-back” with a billiard ball.</p>
                <p>Let the axis of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> be parallel to the motion of translation
                    of a sphere or cylinder moving on a horizontal plane. Then we have, if F be the
                    friction, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the radius of the hoop or ball, the rate of
                    change of momentum = F, and that of moment of momentum about the centre =
                    Fα.</p>
                <p>So long as sliding continues, F is constant, and equal to the product μ,M&lt;∕ of
                    the normal pressure and the coefficient of kinetic friction. Hence at time <hi

                    point of contact with the plane must bear to that of translation of the ball a
                    ratio of over 7:2 if it is to stop and return. In the case of a hoop this ratio
                    must be at least 2 :1.</p>
                <p>§ 254. We pass now to the case of a rigid body one point only of which is fixed.
                    As we have already seen (§ 234) this has only to be compounded with the motion
                    of the whole mass, supposed concentrated at the point, in order to give the most
                    general motion of which a rigid body is capable. The geometrical processes which
                    have been applied to this problem, though in many respects of great power and
                    elegance, cannot be introduced here. We will therefore give the more important
                    results in a brief analytical form, and then geometrically exhibit their
                    application.</p>
                <p>Recurring to the general equations</p>
                <p>2nι(aφ - <hi rend="italic">yχ) =</hi> 2(a≈Y - 2/X )= N, &amp;c., we may transform
                    the left hand members as follows.</p>

                <p>Now if the fixed axes be taken so as to coincide at a particular instant with the

                    case, from these equations, the actual orientation of the body at any time can
                    be calculated from them by the kinematical processes of § 81. The position in
                    space of the point of the body which has been hitherto treated as fixed is to be
                    calculated separately by the processes already explained for kinetics of a
                    particle, and thus the motion of the body is completely determined—in the sense
                    that the difficulties of the further steps are of a purely mathematical
                    nature.</p>
                <p>When the forces applied to the body have a single resultant, which either
                    vanishes or passes through the origin, the right-hand terms disappear from
                    Euler’s equations. Multiply the equations by ω <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, ω

                <p>But if, in these equations, we norv choose to regard ω <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>, α∙. <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, ω <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> as the
                    coordinates, parallel to the principal axes, of the extremity of a line which
                    represents, in magnitude and direction, the instantaneous axis, we see that that
                    axis is a central vector of each of the ellipsoids (1) and (2). Hence the
                    instantaneous axis describes, relatively to the body, a cone of the second
                    order. Since T and D are the only arbitrary coefficients in the equations, all
                    the ellipsoids (1) or (2) are similar and similarly situated. The curve of
                    intersection of (1) and (2) projected on the plane of the axes A and B has the
                    equation</p>
                <p>A(C - A)αq + B(C - B)ω <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = 2TC - D <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>This represents an ellipse if the terms on the left have the same sign, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> if 0 is either greater or less than each of A and B.
                    Hence, if the body be originally rotating about an axis nearly coinciding either
                    with the axis of greatest or that of least moment of inertia, it will continue
                    to do so. These two cases are exemplified respectively by a quoit and by an
                    elongated rifle bullet,—at least in so far as the resistance of the air does not
                    interfere with their motion. But if the body be originally rotating about an
                    axis nearly coinciding with the axis of intermediate moment of inertia, the
                    curve indicated by the equation above is an hyperbola or a pair of straight
                    lines through the origin; and the instantaneous axis travels, in general, far
                    away from its first position in the body. We will henceforth look on A, B, C as
                    in descending order of magnitude. It is obvious from the mode in which they are
                    formed that A = B + C only when the body is a plate. Hence, generally, any two
                    of A, B, C are together greater than the third. Also by multiplying (1) by A,
                    and comparing it term by term with (2), we see that 2AT &gt;D <hi

                <p>To complete the examination of the immediate results of Euler’s equations in this
                    case, let ns find how the length of the instantaneous axis, considered as a
                    common vector-radius of the ellipsoids (1) and (2), depends on the time.</p>

                <p>§ 255. Such a solution, however, fails to give so clear a conception of the
                    nature of the motion as is afforded by the very elegant geometrical
                    representation discovered by Poinsot. We may arrive at it by considering the
                    tangent plane to (1) at the extremity of the radius Ω. If <hi rend="italic">x,
                    y, z</hi> be the current coordinates of that plane, its equation is</p>
                <p>Aω <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> (ω <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> — <hi
                    rend="italic">x)</hi> ÷ Bα∣ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (ω <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 2</hi> — <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">)</hi> + Cω <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> (α&gt; <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> — a) = 0 , so that the perpendicular from the origin
                    upon it is equal, by (2), to 2T∕D, a constant. The direction cosines of this
                    perpendicular are proportional to Aω <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, Bω <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, Cω <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, the component moments
                    of momentum. Hence it is the axis of resultant moment of momentum, and is
                    therefore (§ 166) fixed in direction in space. The tangent plane to (1) at the
                    extremity of the instantaneous axis is therefore a fixed plane, and the
                    ellipsoid (1) rolls upon it as if it were perfectly rough. From this we can of
                    course find the equation of the curve of contact with the plane, and thence that
                    of the cone, fixed in space, on which the cone of instantaneous axes in the body
                    rolls, as in § 75. The latter cone is of course given by the intersection of (1)
                    and (2).</p>
                <p>To complete this beautiful representation of the motion, all that is necessary is
                    a method of measuring time, something to show the rate of rolling of the
                    ellipsoid on the fixed plane. Many constructions have been given for this
                    purpose, such as Poinsot’s “rolling and sliding cone,” &amp;c., but none can
                    compare in elegance with that invented by Sylvester. We can only sketch a
                    particular case— sufficient, however, to completely solve the question.</p>

                <p>Hence the line OQ lies in the plane containing the instantaneous axis OP and the
                    fixed line OL. The motion of ellipsoid (6) is therefore one of combined sliding
                    and rolling along the new tangent plane. To find the sliding, we must find the
                    angular velocity of Q about the line OL. It is to that about OP, which is Ω, in
                    the ratio of the sines of the angles POQ and QOL.</p>

                <p>Hence the angular velocity of Q about OL is Dp, a constant. Now suppose the plane
                    on which the ellipsoid (6) rolls and slides to become perfectly rough, and to be
                    capable of rotating round OL as an axis, there will no longer be sliding of Q,
                    but the plane will be made to rotate with the constant angular velocity Dp. Thus
                    the time of any portion of the motion of the body will be measured out by the
                    angle of forced rotation of this plane.</p>

                <p>§ 257. Next let us take the case of a pendulum bob, supported by a flexible but
                    untwistable wire, and containing a gyroscope whose axis is in the direction of
                    the length of the pendulum. Here we may use, for variety, Lagrange’s equations.
                    For simplicity we suppose the centres of inertia of the bob and gyroscope to lie
                    in the axis, and the bob to be symmetrical about the direction of the length of
                    the pendulum.</p>
                <p>Let the moment of inertia of the whole about the axis of symmetry be A when the
                    gyroscope is supposed to be prevented from turning relatively to the bob, and
                    let the other two principal moments about the point of suspension be B. Let that
                    of the gyroscope about its axis be C. Then, if <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> be the

                    axis, we easily find</p>

                    distance from the point of suspension to the centre of inertia of the whole.</p>
                <p>The general treatment of this complex problem cannot be attempted here. We may,
                    however, easily obtain useful and characteristic results in some special simple
                    cases, which will enable us to form a general idea of the nature of the
                    motion.</p>
                <p>Thus, suppose if possible 0 to be constant. This is the <hi rend="italic">Conical
                    Gyroscopic Pendulum.</hi> We easily find the equations <hi rend="italic">φ</hi>
                    — (1 - cos <hi rend="italic">θ)φ</hi> = Ω = const.</p>

                <p>For any assigned values of Ω and 0, this shows what will be the corresponding
                    value of <hi rend="italic">φ.</hi> But it also shows that if we change
                    simultaneously the signs only of Ω and <hi rend="italic">φ,</hi> the value of 0
                    is unaltered. Thus, reversal of the direction of rotation of the gyroscope
                    involves reversal of the direction of motion of the bob, if the time of rotation
                    is to be unaltered. But to any assigned values of 0 and Ω two values of <hi
                    rend="italic">φ</hi> correspond. As 0 cannot, in the case considered, exceed
                    ⅜τr, the multiplier of <hi rend="italic">φ</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    2</hi> is essentially positive. So is V <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> =M&lt;7Z.
                    Hence the values of <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> are real; and one is positive, the
                    other negative. Thus the pendulum, with any rate of rotation of the gyroscope,
                    may be made to move in any horizontal circle; but the angular velocity will be
                    greater when it is in the same sense as that of the rotation of the gyroscope
                    than when it is in the opposite sense. When 0 is so small that 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> may be neglected, we have</p>
                <p>B≠ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>- CΩ≠=V <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>, or

                <p>The angular velocity, when the gyroscope is not rotating, would be that of the
                    corresponding conical pendulum,</p>
                <p>√&lt;7∕Z= ±3'162; so that in this case the gyroscopic pendulum would rotate about
                    twice as fast, or only about half as fast, as the ordinary conical pendulum,
                    according as it rotated with or against the gyroscope.</p>
                <p>If we had taken Ω = 10π we should have found</p>

                <p>Thus the slower the gyroscope rotates the slower is the conical pendulum motion
                    in the same direction, and the quicker that in the opposite direction.</p>

                    being in equilibrium, suppose any finite arc of it, as PQ (fig. 64), to become
                    rigid. The forces acting on PQ are three—the tensions T <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> and T <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> at its ends, and its weight »W acting
                    at its centre of inertia. But three forces in equilibrium are in one plane
                    (§221). Hence the curve is in one vertical plane. Also, as the two tensions are
                    not parallel to one another, the lines of action of all three forces meet in one
                    point. Hence there is no couple, and the conditions are simply</p>

                    the inclinations to the horizon of the tan gents at the ends of the portion

                    samt at P and Q, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> all through the chain. The second
                    asserts that the difference of the vertical parts of the tensions at any two
                    points is equal to the weight of the part of tin chain between them. By proper
                    mathematical methods these data lead to the results already obtained. In fact
                    the equations we have just obtained are the first integrals of the equations in
                    § 259.</p>

                <p>The tension at the lowest point is thus equal to the weight of a piece of chain
                    like that at the vertex, and of length equal to the radius of the circle; the

                    rend="italic">ρ</hi><hi rend="italic">V ’</hi> and suppose that the curve in
                    which the particle moves is the same as the catenary above, while the speed at
                    each point has the same numerical value as the tension, we see that we must have
                    <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> '=∆'=-q E=Σ'=-K.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">V</hi> T ’ <hi rend="italic">V</hi> T</p>
                <p>or S'=-ST, N'=-NT.</p>
                <p>Thus the catenary will be the free path of the particle provided the force
                    applied at any point is equal to the reverse of the product of that acting on
                    the chain by the numerical value of the tension of the chain at that point.</p>
                <p>Conversely, if we take any case of free motion of a particle, a uniform chain
                    will hang in the corresponding orbit under the action of the same forces each
                    reversed, and divided by the numerical value of the speed at the corresponding
                    point of the orbit. Thus we can at once pass from particle kinetics to
                    corresponding cases of catenaries.</p>
                <p>In the case of a projectile, the path is’a parabola, the force is constant and
                    parallel to the axis, and the speed is as the squareroot of the distance from
                    the directrix. Hence, that the parabola may be a catenary under gravity, it must
                    be turned vertex downwards; and the mass of the chain per unit length at any
                    point must be inversely as the square root of the distance from the directrix.
                    It is easily found from this that the mass of any arc of the chain must be
                    proportional to the length of its horizontal projection, as in the second
                    problem solved in § 262.</p>
                <p>In the case of a planet we have</p>
                <p>ι&gt; <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> =p(2∕rl∕α).</p>
                <p>Hence a chain will hang in an ellipse if it be <hi rend="italic">repelled</hi>
                    from one focus by a force varying inversely as the square of the distance, the
                    mass per unit length of the chain being directly as the square root of the
                    distance from that focus and inversely as the square root of the distance from
                    the other. If the chain be uniform, the law of the repulsive force from the
                    first focus must be <hi rend="italic">~[</hi><hi rend="italic">∣∖</hi><hi

                <p>§ 2G1. When a chain or string is stretched over a curved surface, the surface
                    must exert a reaction on it to keep it in its curved form. The preceding
                    investigation has shown that the force normal to a chain per unit length at any
                    point is balanced by T/p per unit of length, which must therefore be the
                    magnitude of the reaction. We <pb break="no"

                    manner, as follows :—</p>
                <p>Let AB (fig. 65) be a small portion of the cord, and AC, CB the tangents at its
                    extremities; and let the (small) exterior angle at C be <hi rend="italic"
                    >θ.</hi> Then, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> being the pressure per unit length of

                <p>2&gt;.AB = 2Tsin⅜0 = T0 ultimately. But AB = p0, so that <hi rend="italic"

                <p>If there be friction, and if the element of the rope be just about to slip, in

                <p>T'-T=∕⅜p.AB = <hi rend="subscript"> μ</hi> T0, so that</p>
                <p>T' = T(1 <hi rend="italic">+μθ).</hi></p>
                <p>This leads to the formula for the growth of a sum at compound interest at <hi
                    rend="italic">μ</hi> per cent, payable every instant. Hence for a <hi

                <p>It is to be remarked here that neither the dimensions nor the form of the curve
                    on which the cord is stretched, provided only it be plane, have any influence on
                    this result, which involves only the coefficient of friction and the angle
                    between the two free portions of the cord.</p>

                <p>§ 265. The equations of motion of a chain, under the action of any finite forces,
                    are at once formed from those of equilibrium by introducing the forces of
                    resistance to acceleration according to Newton’s principle. Here we enter on a
                    subject of extreme importance, but also (at least in the majority of cases) of
                    great mathematical difficulty. One valuable result, however, can be obtained by
                    very simple means.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A uniformly heavy and perfectly flexible cord, placed in the
                    interior of a smooth tube in the form of any curve, and subject to no external
                    forces, will exert no pressure on the tube if it have everywhere the same
                    tension, and move with a certain definite speed.</hi></p>
                <p>For, as in § 264, the statical pressure due to the curvature of the rope is <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">ΓΘ</hi> ∣ <hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">σ</hi> per unit of length (where σ is the
                    length of the arc AB in that figure) directed inwards to the centre of
                    curvature. Now, the element &lt;r, whose mass is <hi rend="italic">m&lt;r</hi>
                    (if <hi rend="italic">m</hi> be the mass per unit of length), is moving in a
                    curve whose curvature is <hi rend="italic">θ'σ,</hi> with speed <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> (suppose). The requisite force is - <hi rend="superscript">
                    l</hi> Lf- — <hi rend="italic">mv~θ</hi>, and for unit of length <hi

                    2</hi> the theorem is true. If we suppose a portion of the tube to be straight,
                    and the whole to be moving with speed <hi rend="italic">v</hi> parallel to this
                    line, and against the motion of the cord, we shall have the straight part of the
                    cord reduced to rest, and an undulation, of any, but unvarying, form and
                    dimensions, running along it with linear speed <hi rend="italic">fΥ</hi> ∣ <hi
                    rend="italic">m.</hi></p>
                <p>Suppose the tension of the cord to be equal to the weight of W pounds, and
                    suppose its length <hi rend="italic">I</hi> feet and its own mass <hi
                    rend="italic">w</hi> pounds. Then T = ∖ <hi rend="italic">Vy, lm = ιv,</hi> and
                    the speed of the undulation is <hi rend="italic">f</hi> ∖∖ <hi rend="italic"
                    >ly'w</hi> feet per second.</p>
                <p>266. As will be shown later, when such an undulation reaches a fixed point of the
                    cord or chain, it is <hi rend="italic">reflected,</hi> and runs back along the
                    cord with the same definite speed. But the reflected form differs from the
                    incident form in being turned about in its own plane through two right angles.
                    When the string is fixed at both ends any disturbance runs along it, backwards
                    and forwards, with this speed, and thus (in a piano or harp) administers
                    periodic shocks to the sounding board, causing it to give out a musical note.
                    The interval between these periodic shocks is of course the time taken by the
                    disturbance in running from end to end of the string. Dividing the length <hi
                    rend="italic">I</hi> of the string by the speed above reckoned, we find for this
                    interval the value <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">lwl∕W</hi><hi
                    rend="italic                     superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">g = l

                    which is the number of impulses per second. It is thus seen to be directly as
                    the square-root of the tension of the string, inversely as the square-root of
                    its mass per unit of length, and also inversely as its length. These are
                    well-known facts in Acoustics. It is to be observed that there is no necessity
                    for limiting the proposition above to a plane curve, though we have treated the
                    question as if it were such. The demonstration applies even to a knot of any
                    form.</p>
                <p>267. We will now consider more particularly the vibrations of a musical string,
                    whose tension is great and its own mass small.</p>
                <p>Forming the equations of motion as above hinted, we have three of the type</p>
                <p>⅛T⅛)=-μ(X→).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">as</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">as j</hi></p>
                <p>In the special case of a tightly stretched inextensible string, performing very
                    small transverse oscillations, we may greatly simplify these by assuming that no
                    external forces act. This practically means that the weight of the string is
                    negligible in comparison with the tension. If the axis of <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> be taken to coincide with the undisturbed position of the string, we
                    have to the second order of small quantities <hi rend="italic">s≈x.</hi></p>
                <p>With this the equation above written becomes</p>
                <p>≤-o, <hi rend="italic">as</hi> or the tension is the same throughout. The second
                    and third equations now become <hi rend="subscript"> rp</hi> &lt;Z <hi

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">y</hi> and <hi rend="italic">z</hi> disturbances are
                    therefore of the same general character, and perfectly independent of one
                    another. We will therefore confine our attention to one of them. From the
                    equations we see that T∕ <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> u must be of two linear
                    dimensions, and we will therefore write for it α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.
                    As this quantity must also be of two negative dimensions in time, <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> represents a speed. What speed will be seen
                    immediately.</p>
                <p>The equation in <hi rend="italic">y</hi> is now „ ^ <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> '∕ .∙ <hi rend="italic">“to*'</hi> whose integral is known to be <hi

                    arbitrary functions. As we have already seen (§ 53), the first part of the value
                    of <hi rend="italic">y</hi> expresses a wave running with speed <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> along the axis of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> in the positive
                    direction; the second part a wave in the negative direction with the same speed.
                    Thus we see that any small disturbance whatever, of a stretched string, gives
                    rise to two series of waves propagated in opposite directions with equal speeds.
                    Also, as the equation is linear, the sum of any two or more particular integrals
                    is also an integral.</p>
                <p>If we suppose one extremity of the string to be fixed at the origin, we have the
                    condition z = 0, y=0, and therefore</p>
                <p>0 =/(«&lt;)+ F(n&lt;)∙</p>
                <p>As this holds for all values of <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> the function F is
                    sinq&gt;ly the negative of/, so that y-∕(&lt;tf-*) <hi rend="italic">-f(at +
                    x').</hi></p>
                <p>To investigate what becomes of a disturbance which runs along the cord to the

                    any <hi rend="italic">part</hi> of a disturbance of the string) is a function
                    which vanishes for all values of <hi rend="italic">r</hi> which do not lie

                    >q,</hi> but which for values of <hi rend="italic">r</hi> between these limits
                    takes definite values. Then at time i = 0 we have <hi rend="italic">y≈</hi><hi

                    as before, but the sign of the disturbance and the direction of its propagation
                    are both reversed. Every portion of a wave is therefore reflected, with simple
                    <hi rend="italic">reversal</hi> of the displacement, as soon as it reaches the

                <p>268. As another example, suppose a uniform chain to be suspended by one end, and
                    to make small oscillations in a vertical plane.</p>
                <p>We cannot enter here into details; so we simply assume that elementary persistent

                    As the oscillations are supposed to be small, we may neglect the change in the
                    vertical ordinate of any point of the chain, because it must be of the second
                    order of small quantities if the horizontal displacement is of the first order.
                    Hence we may put everywhere <hi rend="italic">x</hi> for <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The complete integral of this equation would be much more general than we
                    require, for it would express every possible small motion of the chain, however
                    apparently irregular/ What we seek are the fundamental modes of simple harmonic
                    oscillation, any number of which, as in the case of a musical string, may be
                    superposed. Hence we may write</p>

                <p>For, calling the instantaneous speeds along the tangent and along the radius of

                    there can be no impulsive speed perpendicular to the osculating plane. The
                    kinematical condition is simply that an elementary arc δs is not altered in
                    length. But the tangential increment of speed alone would imply an increase of
                    the length of δs in the ratio <hi rend="italic">l-}~8t∙.</hi> 1 intime δZ. Also
                    the impulsive speed <hi rend="italic">vp</hi> would imply a diminution of its

                    possibility of an impact’s being propagated instantaneously along the whole
                    length of a chain depends upon its assumed inextensibility. When a wire (such as

                <p>§ 271. This subject, which is a very extensive and difficult one, and in its
                    generality quite unsuitable for discussion here, has already been to some extent
                    treated of under <hi rend="smallcaps">Elasticity.</hi> We therefore content
                    ourselves with one or two examples, whose treatment is comparatively simple,
                    while their applications are frequent and of considerable practical
                    importance.</p>
                <p>§ 272. Even so restricted a problem as that of determining the form assumed by a
                    wire or thin rod of homogeneous isotropic elastic material, under the action of
                    given forces and couples, presents somewhat formidable difficulties unless in
                    its unstrained state the wire be straight and truly cylindrical or prismatic.
                    And, even with these limitations, the problem again becomes formidable if we
                    introduce the consideration of non-isotropic material; while, in any case, if
                    the radius of curvature at each point is not very large in proportion to the
                    thickness of the rod in the plane of bending, the problem is to no appreciable
                    extent simplified by the limitation of form of the body. We will therefore give
                    the comparatively simple case of the mere bending and twist of a homogeneous
                    isotropic wire whose natural form is cylindrical or prismatic, the amounts of
                    these from various sources being so small as to be superposable. Bending
                    lengthens one set of lines of particles originally parallel to the axis of the
                    wire and shortens others. Twist lengthens all but one such line, forming them
                    into helices. The more detailed investigation, which we cannot give here, shows
                    that there is one line of particles (the “elastic central line ”) which passes
                    through the centre of inertia of each transverse section, and which may be
                    treated (under our present limitations) as rigorously unchanged in length. The
                    mutual molecular action of the parts of the wire on opposite sides of any
                    transverse section may of course be reduced to a force and a couple, and the
                    force may be conveniently treated as passing through the centre of inertia of
                    the section. Also the twist and curvature of the wire near this section
                    obviously depend on the couple and not on the force. For the moment of the
                    couple is in general finite, while that of the force (about any point in the
                    corresponding element of the wire) is infinitesimal.</p>
                <p>§ 273. Let any two planes, at right angles to one another, be drawn through the
                    elastic central line before distortion; and let them be cut in lines PR and PS
                    by a transverse section through a point P of the central line. Also let PT be a
                    tangent to that line. Suppose a similar construction to be carried out for every
                    point P of the central line. Then it is clear that the form of the distorted
                    wire will be completely determined if we know the form assumed by the central
                    line, and the positions taken by the lines PR and PS drawn from each point in
                    it. In their new positions P'T', P'R', and P'S' will still form (in consequence
                    of the limitations we have imposed) a rectangular system; and the nature of the
                    distortion will be clearly indicated by the change of position of this
                    rectangular system as it passes from point to point of the distorted central
                    line. The plane of rotation of P'T' is the osculating plane of the bending; its
                    rate of rotation in that plane per unit length of the central line is the amount
                    of bending; and the rate of rotation of the system P'R', Γ'S', about P'T', per
                    unit length of the central line, is the rate of twist. Suppose P' to move with
                    unit velocity along the distorted central line, and let <hi rend="italic">p, σ,
                    τ</hi> be the angular velocities of the system about Γ'R', P'S', P'T'
                    respectively, then <hi rend="italic">p</hi> represents the curvature (or
                    bending) resolved in the plane S'P'T', σ that in R'P'T', while τ represents the
                    twist.</p>
                <p>Now, if the elastic forces constitute a conservative system, the amount of work
                    done on an element of the body corresponding to a length δs of the central line
                    is to be calculated entirely from its change of form. It must therefore be
                    expressible in the form <hi rend="italic">wδs</hi> where <hi rend="italic"
                    >w</hi> is a function of <hi rend="italic">p,</hi><hi rend="italic">σ,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">τ;</hi> which must be such that the couples producing the bending
                    are <hi rend="italic">dw</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dw</hi>- <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi> and - <hi rend="subscript">

                    rend="italic">dw</hi><hi rend="italic">dr</hi></p>
                <p>These again, are functions of <hi rend="italic">p, σ,</hi> τ, and they must, on
                    account of the principle of superposition, be linear and homogeneous. For,
                    within the limits to which we have restricted ourselves, the doubling alike of
                    bending and twist must involve the doubling of each of the couples. Thus <hi
                    rend="italic">w</hi> must be a homogeneous function of <hi rend="italic">p,
                    &lt;r,</hi> τ of the second degree. Hence we may assume <hi rend="italic"
                    >w</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> ⅛(Ap <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> 4- B&lt;r
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + Cτ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + 2Dp&lt;τ +
                    2Ecrτ + 2Fτp), where A, B, C, D, E, F are quantities depending on the form of
                    the section of the wire and the nature of its material at each point. This
                    gives</p>
                <p>⅛ = Ap + D&lt;r + Fτ, <hi rend="superscript"> f</hi> ^ = Dp + B&lt;r + Eτ, ⅛ <hi

                    rend="italic">dτ</hi></p>
                <p>Hence, when the couples are assigned, the amounts of bending and twist are at
                    once calculated from them. But the expression above is much more general than we
                    require for the limited case we are considering. For, if the only couples
                    applied to a portion of the prism or cylinder considered be in planes
                    perpendicular to its length, twist only will be produced. Thus, for ^- = 0, we
                    ought to have also p=0, &lt;r = 0. Hence E and F both vanish and we have simply
                    w = ⅜(Ap <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + 2Dp&lt;r + Bσ <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> + Cτ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>). This may be reduced, by properly
                    selecting the planes originally drawn through the elastic central line, to the
                    form <hi rend="smallcaps">m&gt;</hi> =⅜( Ap <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    +B&lt;r <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + Cτ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>).</p>
                <p>Now we see that <hi rend="italic">dw</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi><hi

                <p>§ 274. In a prismatic or cylindrical wire of homogeneous isotropic material, the
                    elastic central line is thus a torsion axis simply. Equal and opposite couples,
                    applied to the ends of such a wire, in planes perpendicular to its length,
                    produce twist in direct proportion to the moments of the couples. There are two
                    planes perpendicular to one another, and passing through this line, such that,
                    if equal and opposite couples in either of these planes be applied at any parts
                    of the wire, the portion between is bent into a circular arc in that plane.
                    These are the principal planes of flexure. The quantities A and B which, when
                    multiplied by the amount of bending in either of these planes, give the moment
                    of the corresponding couple are called the principal “flexure rigidities” of the
                    wire. When they are equal (as in the case of a wire of circular, square,
                    equilateral triangular, &lt;fcc., section) any plane through the axis is a
                    principal plane of flexure. C is the torsional rigidity of the wire. In general,
                    when the wire is fixed at one end and a couple applied at the other, the wire
                    assumes the form of a circular helix. The exceptions (or rather particular
                    cases) are :—(a) when the plane of the couple contains the elastic central line,
                    and there is mere flexure, without twist; (6) when the plane of the couple is
                    perpendicular to the wire, and there is twist simply.</p>
                <p>§ 275. As an example of the preceding theory, take first <pb break="no"

                    at one end, and otherwise unsupported. This is obviously the same as the case of
                    a plank of double the length, supported by a trestle placed under its middle. We
                    assume as before that the radius of curvature is always very large compared with
                    the thickness of the plank.</p>
                <p>Tn all such cases we may at once apply the principle of § 258, and suppose one
                    portion of the plank up to a section P to be fixed in its equilibrium position.
                    The curvature immediately contiguous to'P will then be simply proportional to
                    the moment about P of the forces acting on the unfixed portion. Hence at the
                    free end there will be no curvature, and the curvature at points near that end
                    will be of the second order of infinitesimals; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> its

                <p>This is obviously the same as the amount of depression of the middle of a plank,
                    of length 2Z supported by trestles at each end.</p>
                <p>§ 276. Hence the droop of the middle of a plank resting on trestles at its ends
                    is to that of the ends when the plank rests on a single trestle at the middle in
                    the ratio of 5: 3.</p>
                <p>If the equation expressing the curvature in the first or third cases above be
                    twice differentiated, the common result is <hi rend="italic subscript">

                <p>The simplicity of this expression leads us to seek for the most general form.
                    Suppose the plank to be exposed to any system of forces in lines perpendicular
                    to its length and breadth. Then, if any transverse section be made, the stress
                    between the two portions of the plank will consist of forces ( + G) and couples
                    ( + H) in the plane of length and thickness. Let the applied forces be N per
                    unit of length. Suppose also, as before, that the radius of curvature is very
                    great compared with the thickness. Then the equations of equilibrium of an
                    element are</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">dx dx</hi></p>
                <p>We have also the condition of bending, viz.,</p>

                <p>Eliminating H and G among these equations, we have <hi rend="italic subscript">

                    of course includes all the previous particular cases. We may now determine
                    (under the limits imposed) the form of a uniform plank of any length, supported
                    in a nearly horizontal position at different points in its length, and loaded at
                    any assigned points with any weights. The importance of this in practice is
                    obvious.</p>
                <p>§ 277. But we may easily take a further step, and investigate the oscillatory
                    motion, so long at least as the acceleration parallel to the length of the plank
                    and its rotation are negligible. For in such a case, if <hi rend="italic"
                    >μ.</hi> be the mass per unit of length, the equation of motion is (§ 199)</p>

                <p>We will consider only the case in which the applied force N may be neglected.
                    This is practically the case of a uniform wire or flat rectangular spring.
                    Suppose, further, that it is fixed at one end and free at the other, like
                    Wheatstone’s “kaleidophone,” or like the tongue of a reed organ-pipe.</p>
                <p>Then, writing <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi> for

                <p>A particular integral may obviously be found in the form <hi rend="italic">y =

                <p>Now, provided the value of <hi rend="italic">i</hi> be properly determined, the

                    exist by itself; and the most general motion of which the spring is capable
                    (under the limits imposed) consists of superposition of a number of separate
                    motions of a similar character. Hence this may be treated by itself. Our
                    limiting conditions in the present case are <hi rend="superscript"> aj</hi> =0,
                    <hi rend="italic">y</hi> = 0, = 0 at the fixed end; and x=Z, ^⅛ = 0, ^=0 at the

                <p>Eliminate the ratio A∕B, which is all that these equations furnish, and we

                <p>From this equation the values of <hi rend="italic">i</hi> must be determined. It

                    arcs a little greater than but rapidly approaching to the values of (47∕i+l)⅛π∙,
                    the second consists of arcs a little less than but rapidly approaching to those

                <p>§ 278. Some of the simplest, but at the same time most practically useful, of
                    questions connected with elasticity of solids relate to the changes of form or
                    volume experienced by circular cylindrical tubes or spherical shells exposed to
                    hydrostatic pressure. A steam-boiler, the cylinders and tubes of an hydraulic
                    press, a fowling-piece or cannon and (on a much smaller scale) Orsted’s
                    piezometer, deep-sea thermometers, Ac., afford common instances. All that is
                    necessary for attacking such questions is given in §§ 45, 46 of the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Elasticity.</hi> For it is there shown that, if a homogeneous
                    isotropic elastic solid be subjected to a simple longitudinal stress P, uniform
                    and in a definite direction throughout its whole substance, the result will be
                    linear extension = P ( 4- + 4 ) in the directs 71 9⅛ <hi rend="italic smallcaps"

                <p>tions perpendicular to P. The quantities <hi rend="italic">n</hi> and Z∙, as
                    explained in the article referred to, are respectively the “rigidity” and the
                    reciprocal of the “compressibility” of the solid operated on.</p>
                <p>§ 279. The case of the piezometer, in which the vessel holding the liquid whose
                    compression is to be measured is exposed both inside and outside to the same
                    hydrostatic pressure, is seen to correspond to three equal stresses in
                    directions at right angles to one another. These directions may be any whatever,
                    and in each of them the linear extension is obviously pifi <hi rend="subscript">

                    Zk</hi></p>
                <p>P is negative, as the stress is a pressure. Hence the strain consists in a simple
                    alteration of volume measured by P∕Z∙. Every part of the walls of the vessel, as
                    well as its external bulk, and its interior content, is altered to the same
                    extent, r § 280. In the case of a cylinder, when the internal and external
                    pressures are different, it is clear from symmetry that the stresses may be
                    resolved at any point of the walls ' into three at right angles to one another,
                    the first (P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>) parallel to, the second (P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) at right angles to, the axis, and the third (P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) perpendicular to each of the other two. In a
                    transverse section of the cylinder, the second of these is radial and the third
                    is tangential to a coaxal cylinder passing through the element considered. We
                    suppose the cylinder closed at both ends, and we make the further assumption
                    (quite exact enough for practical applications, and most important from the
                    point of view of simplicity of calculation) that all transverse sections of the
                    cylinder remain, after distortion, transverse sections. This is equivalent to
                    assuming P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to be constant throughout the walls of
                    the cylinder. Hence, if there be interior pressure only, the value of this
                    stress must be p _ pressure on end of interior of cylinder ∏∕(</p>

                <p>Let us consider an element of the cylindrical wall, defined as follows in the

                <p>The shorter axis of this shear is radial, and the magnitude of the shear is
                    obviously greater for smaller values of <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> The inner
                    layer of the walls is thus the most distorted. The amount of the distortion is
                    directly as the pressure, and inversely as the area of the section of the
                    walls.</p>
                <p>When the walls are very thin the shear is practically the same throughout their
                    thickness. 'When they are very thick, the shear near the inner surface is nearly

                    is very fine. Thus it appears that, if a stout tube bursts by the shear produced
                    by internal pressure, little is gained either by making it of extremely great
                    thickness or by making it of very small bore.</p>
                <p>The diagrams A and B in fig. 66 show, necessarily on a greatly exaggerated scale,
                    the nature of the distortion produced at different parts of the wall of the
                    tube. They represent transverse sections of small, originally spherical,
                    elements made by planes at right angles to the axis. The radial diameters are
                    horizontal. A is an element close to the external surface, B an element near the
                    inner surface. The increase per unit volume of the interior of the tube is</p>

                    walls are thick enough) distinguishes this from the preceding case. For <hi

                    >n,</hi> so that <hi rend="italic">a fortiori 3k</hi> is greater than <hi

                    pressure is internal. Thus the radial effect is compression at all parts of the
                    walls. But, when the pressure is external, we may (if the walls be thick enough)
                    find a value of <hi rend="italic">r</hi> for which</p>

                <p>In glass, this occurs when r=l∙6α <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> nearly. At this

                    there_ is radial compression, and at smaller radial extension. This is indicated
                    in the diagrams C and D in fig. 66, which like the former are greatly
                    exaggerated. They represent the distortion of small spherical elements of a
                    thick tube,—the first at the inner wall, the second at the outer surface. As
                    before, these are sections made by a plane perpendicular to the axis of the
                    cylinder.</p>

                <p>§ 285. The preceding view of the subject of Abstract Dynamics has been based
                    entirely upon Newton’s Laws of Motion, which were adopted without discussion, as
                    a complete and perfectly definite foundation; and the terms employed, as well as
                    the mode of treatment in general, have somewhat closely followed Newton’s
                    system. The only considerable apparent departure from that system is connected
                    with the development of the idea of energy, and its application to the
                    simplification of many of the methods and results. This also was, as we have
                    seen, really introduced by Newton; but it has been immensely extended since his
                    time both by mathematical and by experimental processes. It is time that we
                    should now return to the laws of motion, and examine more closely, in the light
                    of what we have learned, one or two of the more prominent ideas which they
                    embody. To do so fairly we must go back to Newton’s own definitions of the terms
                    which he employs. About many of these, which have already been quoted in §§
                    97-113, there is no difference of opinion But it is otherwise when we come to
                    the definition of “force” (§§ 5, 104).</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that the proper use of the term “force” in modern science
                    is that which is implied in the statement of the first law of motion, as we
                    rendered it in § 1 from Newton’s Latin. It is thus seen to be the English
                    equivalent of the term <hi rend="italic">vis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >impressa.</hi> Newton uses the word <hi rend="italic">vis</hi> in other
                    connexions, and with a certain vagueness inevitable at a time when the
                    terminology of science was still only shaping itself ∙, but his idea of “force”
                    was perfectly definite, and when <hi rend="italic">this</hi> is in his mind the
                    vague word <hi rend="italic">vis</hi> is (when necessary) always qualified and
                    rendered precise, either by the addition of <hi rend="italic">impressa</hi> or
                    in some equally unambiguous way. To render <hi rend="italic">vis</hi> by
                    “force,” wherever it stands without the <hi rend="italic">impressa</hi> or its
                    equivalents, is to introduce a quite gratuitous confusion for which Newton is
                    not responsible. We have oιdy to think of the multitude of terms, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">vis</hi><hi rend="italic">insita</hi> (inertia), <hi rend="italic"
                    >vis accéleratrix</hi> (acceleration), <hi rend="italic">vis viva</hi> (kinetic
                    energy), &amp;c., &amp;c., to see that all such complex expressions must be
                    regarded as <hi rend="italic">wholes,</hi> and that <hi rend="italic">vis</hi>
                    does not mean “force” in any one of them.</p>
                <p>§ 286. Thus in Newton’s view <hi rend="italic">force is whatever changes</hi>
                    (but not “<hi rend="italic">or tends to change ”) a body's state of rest or of
                    uniform motion in a straight line.</hi></p>
                <p>He mentions, as instances, percussion, pressure, and central force.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Vis
                    centripeta.</hi> It has been already explained that such words as <hi
                    rend="italic">centripeta</hi> include <hi rend="italic">impressa,</hi> so that
                    the above rendering of Newton’s phrase is the obvious one.</p></note> Under the
                    last of these heads he expressly includes magnetic as well as gravitational
                    force. Thus <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n778/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0778-0747"/> force may have different origins, but it is
                    always one and the same; and it produces, in any body to which it is applied, a
                    change of momentum in its own direction, and in amount proportional to its
                    magnitude and to the time during which it acts.</p>
                <p>§ 287. Thus, from Newton’s point of view, equilibrium is not a balancing of
                    forces, but a balancing of the effects of forces. When a mass rests on a table,
                    gravity produces in it a vertically downward velocity which is continually
                    neutralized by the equal upward velocity produced by the reaction of the table;
                    and these forces, whose origins and places of application are alike so widely
                    different, are (as forces), in every respect except direction, similar and
                    equal. And they are so because they produce, in equal times, equal and opposite
                    quantities of motion.</p>
                <p>§ 288. The idea of “force” was undoubtedly suggested by the “muscular sense’';
                    and there can be no question as to the vividness of the sensation of effort we
                    experience when we try to lift a heavy weight or to open a massive gate. In
                    this, as in other cases, it is the business of science to find what objective
                    fact corresponds to the subjective data of sensation. It is very difficult to
                    realize the fact, certain as it is, that light (in the sense of <hi
                    rend="italic">brightness)</hi> is a mere sensation or subjective impression, and
                    has no objective existence. Yet we know that, beside those radiations which give
                    us the sensation of light, there are others, in endless series both higher and
                    lower in their refrangibility, to which our eyes are absolutely blind. And the
                    only difference between these and the former is one of mere wave-length or of
                    period of vibration. Similarly, it is very hard to realize the fact that sound
                    (in the sense of <hi rend="italic">noise)</hi> is only a sensation; and that
                    outside us there is merely a series of alternate compressions and dilatations of
                    the air, the great majority of which produce no sensible effect upon our ears.
                    Thus because we know that we should seek in vain for brightness or noise in the
                    external world, familiar as our senses have rendered us with these conceptions,
                    we are driven to inquire whether the idea of <hi rend="italic">force</hi> may
                    not also be a mere suggestion of sense, corresponding (no doubt) to some process
                    going on outside us, but quite as different from the sensation which suggests it
                    as is a periodic shearing of the ether from brightness, or a periodic change of
                    density of air from noise.</p>
                <p>§ 289. So far, we have treated of force as acting on a body without inquiring
                    whence or why; we have referred to the first and second laws of motion only, and
                    have thus seen only one half of the phenomenon. As soon, however, as we turn to
                    the third law, we find a new light cast on the question. Force is always dual.
                    To <hi rend="italic">every</hi> action there is <hi rend="italic">always</hi> an
                    equal and contrary reaction. Thus the weight which we lift or try to lift, and
                    the massive gate which we open or try to open, both as truly exert force upon
                    our hands as we do upon them. This looking to the other side of the account, as
                    it were, puts matters in a very different aspect. “Do you mean to tell me,” said
                    a medical man of the old school, “that, if I pull a ‘subject’ by the hand, it
                    will pull me with an equal and opposite force?” When he was convinced of the
                    truth of this statement, he gave up the objectivity of force at once.</p>
                <p>§ 290. The third law, in modern phraseology, is merely this :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Every action between two bodies is a stress.</hi></p>
                <p>When we pull one end of a string, the other end being fixed, we produce what is
                    called <hi rend="italic">tension</hi> in the string. When we push one end of a
                    beam, of which the other end is fixed, we produce what is called <hi
                    rend="italic">pressure</hi> throughout the beam. Leaving out of account, for the
                    moment, the effects of gravity, this merely amounts to saying that there is
                    stress across every transverse section of the string or beam. But, in the case
                    of the string, the part of the stress which every portion exerts on the
                    adjoining portion is a <hi rend="italic">pull</hi>; in the case of the beam it
                    is a <hi rend="italic">push.</hi> And all this distribution of stress, though
                    exerted across every one of the infinitely numerous cross sections of the string
                    or beam, disappears the moment we let go the end. We can thus, by a touch, call
                    into action at will an infinite number of stresses, and put them out of
                    existence again as easily. This, of itself, is a very strong argument against
                    the supposition that force, in any form, can have objective reality.</p>
                <p>§ 291. We must now say a word or two on thé question of the objective realities
                    in the physical world. If we inquire carefully into the grounds we have for
                    believing that matter (whatever it may be) has objective existence, we find that
                    by far the most convincing of them is what may be called the “conservation of
                    matter.” This means that, do what we will, we cannot alter the mass or quantity
                    of a portion of matter. We may change its form, dimensions, state of
                    aggregation, &amp;c., or (by chemical processes) we may entirely alter its
                    appearance and properties, but its quantity remains unchanged. It is this
                    experimental result which has led, by the aid of the balance, to the immense
                    developments of modern chemistry. If we receive this as evidence of the
                    objective reality of matter, we must allow objective .reality to anything else
                    which we find to be conserved <hi rend="italic">in the same sense</hi> as matter
                    is conserved. Now there is no such thing as negative mass; mass is, in
                    mathematical language, a signless quantity. Hence the conservation of matter
                    does not contemplate the simultaneous production of equal quantities of positive
                    and negative mass, thus leaving the (algebraic) sum unchanged. But this is the
                    nature of conservation of momentum (§ 165) and of moment of momentum. The only
                    other known’thing in the physical universe, which is conserved in the same sense
                    as matter is conserved, is energy. Hence we naturally consider energy as the
                    other objective reality in the physical universe, and look to it for information
                    as to the true nature of what we call force.</p>
                <p>§ 292. When we do so, the answer is easily obtained, and in a completely
                    satisfactory form. We give only a very simple instance. When a stone, whose mass
                    is Μ and weight W, has fallen through a space <hi rend="italic">h</hi> towards
                    the earth, it has acquired a speed <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> which (§ 28) is
                    given by the equation</p>
                <p>⅜Mv <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> =WΛ.</p>
                <p>This is a particular case of the conservation of energy, but the terms in which
                    it is expressed are those suggested by Newton’s laws of motion, and are
                    therefore based on the recognition of “force.” The first member of the equation
                    represents the kinetic energy acquired; the second the potential energy lost, or
                    the work done by gravity upon the stone during its fall. Both members therefore
                    express real things, having objective existence.</p>
                <p>But the “force” (so-called) which is said to have produced the motion, has the
                    value</p>
                <p>W=⅜Mv <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∕A, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it is the
                    <hi rend="italic">rate per unit of length,</hi> at which potential energy is
                    converted into kinetic energy during the fall. In other words, it is merely an
                    expression for the <hi rend="italic">space-rate at which energy is
                    transformed.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 293. Another mode of presenting the case will make this still more clear. The
                    average speed with which the stone falls is (§ 28) v∕2. Divide both sides of the
                    equation above by this quantity, remembering that 2Λ∕v is the time of falling,
                    which we call <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> We have thus, as another perfectly
                    legitimate deduction from our premises, W=Mr∕Z.</p>
                <p>Here the (so-called) force appears in a new light. . It is now the <hi
                    rend="italic">time-rate at which momentum is generated</hi> in the falling
                    stone.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n779/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0779-0748"/>
                <p>§ 294. The statements in the last two sections are, in f ιct, merely particular
                    cases of Newton’s two interpretations of action in the third law, which have
                    already been discussed (§§ 165, 167).</p>
                <p>Analytically, the whole affair is merely this: if s be the space described, <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> the speed of a particle, <hi rend="italic">.. . dv dv ds
                    dv</hi><hi rend="italic">s = v∙=^-.=-</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> r</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">.-</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">. =
                    v-</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">. dt ds dt
                    ds</hi></p>
                <p>Hence the equation of motion (formed by the second law) <hi rend="italic"
                    >.ms=mv=f,</hi> which gives <hi rend="italic">f</hi> as the time-rate of
                    increase of momentum, may be written in the new form <hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> mv</hi><hi rend="italic">^ds^</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    mv</hi><hi rend="italic">^∙</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> f</hi><hi rend="italic">'</hi> giving/as the space-rate of
                    increase of kinetic energy.</p>
                <p>§ 295. But a mere <hi rend="italic">rate,</hi> be it a space-rate or a time-rate,
                    is not a thing which has objective existence. No one would confound the bank
                    rate of interest with a sum of money, nor the birth or death rate of a country
                    with a group of individual human beings. These rates are, in fact, mere abstract
                    numbers, by the help of which a man may compute interest per annum from the
                    amount of capital, or the number of infants per annum from the amount of the
                    population. The gradient of temperature, in an irregularly heated body, is a
                    mere vector-rate, by the help of which we can calculate how much energy (in the
                    form of heat) passes in a given time across any assigned surface in the body. To
                    attribute objectivity to a rate is even more ridiculous than it would be to
                    attribute it to a sensation, or to a thought, or to a word or phrase which we
                    find useful in characterizing some material object.</p>
                <p>§ 296. On the other hand, all these different kinds of rates have been introduced
                    and continue to be employed, because they have been found to be useful. There is
                    no harm done by retaining them, provided those who use them know that they are
                    introduced for convenience of expression, and not because there are objective
                    realities corresponding to them. Even such a term as “centrifugal force” is
                    sometimes useful; but always under the proviso that he who employs it shall
                    remember that it is only one side of the stress under which a particle of matter
                    is compelled, in spite of its inertia, to move in a curved line. But the term
                    must be taken, like “algebra,” “theodolite,” “Abracadabra,” or any other
                    combination of letters whose derivation is uncertain or unknown, as one and
                    indivisible, to which a certain definite meaning is attached, and as having
                    nothing whatever to do with the meaning or derivation of the word centrifugal,
                    whose embodiment in it is a perennial monument to the memory of an old
                    error.</p>
                <p>§ 297. The main characteristics of energy, especially from the experimental point
                    of view, have already been discussed under <hi rend="smallcaps">Dynamics
                    (&lt;</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> -</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >∕.z&gt;.)</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Energy</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.).</hi> But there is one point of importance connected with it which comes
                    more naturally here than in either of the articles referred to.</p>
                <p>When two measurable quantities, of any kind, are equivalent to one another, their
                    numerical expressions must involve the same fundamental units, and in the same
                    manner. This is obvious from the fact that an alteration of any unit alters in
                    the inverse ratio the numerical measure of any quantity which is a mere multiple
                    of it. And equivalent quantities must always be expressed by equal numbers when
                    both are measured in terms of the same system of units. It appears, therefore,
                    from the conservation of energy directly, as well as from the special data in
                    §§111, 113, that potential energy must, like kinetic υnergy, be of dimensions
                    [ML <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> T^ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>].</p>
                <p>Now it is impossible to conceive of a truly dormant form of energy whose
                    magnitude should depend in any way on the unit of time; and we are therefore
                    forced to the conclusion that potential energy, like kinetic energy, depends (in
                    some as yet unexplained, or rather unimagined, way) upon motion. For the
                    immediate purposes of this article the question is not one of importance. We
                    have been dealing with the more direct consequences of a very compact set of
                    laws, exceedingly simple in themselves, originally based upon observation and
                    experiment, and, most certainly, true. But reason cannot content itself with the
                    mere consequences of a series of observed facts, however elegantly and concisely
                    these may be stated by the help of new terms and their definitions. We are
                    forced to inquire into what may underlie these definitions, and the laws which
                    are observed to regulate the things signified by them. And the conclusion which
                    appears inevitable is that, whatever matter may be, the other reality in the
                    physical universe, energy, which is never found unassociated with matter,
                    depends in all its widely varied forms upon motion of matter. In some cases we
                    are sure, in others we can as yet only suspect, that it depends upon motions in
                    a medium which, unlike ordinary matter, has not yet been subjected to the
                    scrutiny of the chemist. But the question, in its generality, is one of the most
                    obscure in the whole range of physics. In the articles <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Atom, Attraction, Ether,</hi> will be found nearly all that is yet known on
                    this profoundly difficult subject. But to what is there said must be added the
                    remark that a state of strain of the ether, whether associated with the
                    propagation of light and radiant heat or with a statical distribution of
                    electricity, represents so much “potential” energy, and must in its turn in some
                    way depend on motion.</p>
                <p>§ 298. The remarks of Clerk Maxwell on the nature of the evidence for Newton’s
                    <hi rend="italic">first</hi> law of motion raise a question, in some respects
                    novel, but in all respects well worthy of careful study. He says :—</p>
                <p>“Our conviction of the truth of this law may be greatly strengthened by
                    considering what is involved in a denial of it. Given a body in motion. At a
                    given instant let it be left to itself and not acted on by any force. What will
                    happen? According to Newton’s law it will persevere in moving uniformly in a
                    straight line; that is, its velocity will remain constant both in direction and
                    magnitude.</p>
                <p>“If the velocity does not remain constant let us suppose it to vary. The change
                    of velocity must have a definite direction and magnitude. By the maxim that <hi
                    rend="italic">the same causes will always produce the same effects,</hi> this
                    variation must be the same whatever be the time or place of the experiment. The
                    direction of the change of motion must therefore be determined either by the
                    direction of the motion itself, or by some direction fixed in the body. Let us,
                    in the first place, suppose the law to be that the velocity diminishes at a
                    certain rate, which, for the sake of the argument, we may suppose so slow that
                    by no experiments on moving bodies could we have detected the diminution of
                    velocity in hundreds of years. The velocity referred to in this hypothetical law
                    can only be the velocity referred to a point absolutely at rest. For if it is a
                    relative velocity, its direction as well as its magnitude depends on the
                    velocity of the point of reference. If, when referred to a certain point, the
                    body appears to be moving northward with diminishing velocity, we have only to
                    refer it to another point moving northward with a uniform velocity greater than
                    that of the body, and it will appear to be moving southward with increasing
                    velocity. Hence the hypothetical law is without meaning, unless we admit the
                    possibility of defining absolute rest and absolute velocity</p>
                <p>“It may thus be shown that the denial of Newton’s law is in contradiction to the
                    only system of consistent doctrine about space and time which the human mind has
                    been able to form.”</p>
                <p>This is a good example of a valuable application of a principle which, in its
                    widest scope, is inconsistent with the true foundations of physical science. It
                    is, in fact, the exceedingly dangerous “principle of sufficient reason ”— which
                    requires for its legitimate use the utmost talent and knowledge on the part of
                    the user.</p>
                <p>§ 299. But in all methods and systems which involve the idea of force there is
                    the leaven of artificiality. <hi rend="italic">The</hi> true laws of motion,
                    based entirely on experiments of the most extensive and most varied kinds, are
                    those of the conservation and of the transformation of energy. With the help <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n780/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0780-0749"/> of kineιnatical ideas, it is easy to base the
                    whole science of dynamics on these principles; and there is no necessity for the
                    introduction of the word “force” nor of the sense-suggested ideas on which it
                    was originally based.</p>
                <p>§ 300. Nothing beyond a mere mention has been made above of virtual velocities,
                    and of the so-called elementary machines. These belong to the subject of Applied
                    Mechanics, separately treated below.</p>
                <p>§ 301. The references which have been made to various grand theories, such as
                    action, impulse in general, &amp;c., have been illustrated by simple cases only.
                    For a detailed examination of these theories the reader is referred to Thomson
                    and Tait’s <hi rend="italic">Natural Philosophy,</hi> chap. ii. To the same work
                    he is referred for the general “theory of small oscillations,” the “dissipative
                    function,” the “ignoration of coordinates,” the treatment of “gyrostatic
                    systems” and of “kinetic stability.” All of these have been exhibited, though in
                    mere particular instances, in the preceding pages.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Treatises on Mechanics.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 302. The following works on Mechanics are indispensable :—</p>
                <p>1. Newton’s <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> (1st ed., 1687; latest ed., Glasgow,
                    1871). Here, for the first time, the fundamental principles were systematized,
                    extended (as rve have seen) in a most vital particular, and applied, by the aid
                    of a new mathematical method of immense power (based entirely on kinematical
                    considerations), to many of the most important questions of cosmical and
                    terrestrial dynamics.</p>
                <p>Newton’s system was first <hi rend="italic">taught</hi> in the university of
                    Edinburgh; and, with brief intervals, his methods also have been habitually kept
                    before the students there. From the time of Maclaurin to that of Forbes the
                    value of the quasi-geometrical methods in giving a clear insight into the
                    problems treated has rarely been overlooked. In Cambridge these methods were of
                    later introduction, but they still deservedly figure as a necessary part of the
                    reading of candidates for “mathematical honours.” It is to be feared, however,
                    that in some other British universities the study of Newton’s methods is not
                    prosecuted to anything like the same extent. But the very reverse seems to be
                    the case in America, where, probably to a considerable extent on this account,
                    mathematical physics is advancing in a most remarkable manner.</p>
                <p>2. Lagrange’s <hi rend="italic">Mécanique Analytique</hi> (1st cd., 1788). Though
                    objections may fairly be taken to the fundamental method of this work, there can
                    be no question as to the immense power and originality of its author. His
                    “generalized coordinates,” and the equations of motion of a system in terms of
                    these, form one of the most important contributions to the science since the
                    days of Newton. The method of Lagrange, though he was not aware of the fact, is
                    really based upon the consideration of energy; and when, in quite recent times,
                    experiment had shown what are the grand laws of energy, Lagrange’s magnificent
                    mathematical methods and results were ready for translation into the new
                    language of science.</p>
                <p>3. Hamilton’s papers in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions</hi> for 1833 and 1834. Here the principle of varying action, and
                    the characteristic function, were first applied to mechanics;—though they had
                    been given, some years before, to the Royal Irish Academy, in their optical
                    applications. Grand as have been the extensions of these new ideas made by
                    Hamilton himself, and by many others, among whom Jacobi and Lionville may be
                    especially mentioned, they have been mainly in a purely mathematical direction.
                    We wait for what cannot now be long delayed, the coming of the philosopher who
                    is to tell us the true <hi rend="italic">dynamical</hi> bearings of varying
                    action and of the characteristic function.</p>
                <p>4. If to these we add some of the works of Galileo, Huygens, Euler, Maclaurin,
                    and D’Alembert, we have the great landmarks in the history of the subject, as
                    distinguished from its development.</p>
                <p>5. The mere enumeration of the more important developments which the subject has
                    received, as distinguished from the absolutely new grand ideas and methods
                    introduced, would require a long article. Brilliant examples of what may be done
                    in this direction are furnished by Stokes’s “Report on Recent Researches in
                    Hydrodynamics” and by Cayley’s “Reports on Theoretical Dynamics” (printed in the
                    <hi rend="italic">British Association Reports</hi> for 1846, and for 1857 and
                    1862). These should be consulted by every student who desires to trace the
                    growth of the subject. They have been succeeded, in the same <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reports</hi> (1880, 1881) by two excellent summaries, by Hicks, of “Recent
                    Progress in Hydrodynamics.”</p>

                    Poisson’s <hi rend="italic">Mécanique,</hi> Poinsot’s <hi rend="italic">Théorie
                    Nouvelle de la Rotation,</hi><hi rend="italic">kc.,</hi> more or less parts of
                    the immediate outcome of the period when France intellectually dwarfed the rest
                    of the world, are still of far more than mere historic value.</p>
                <p>For the English-reading student of modern times, the work of Thomson and Tait
                    will be found suitable. The authors of this work claim the position of
                    “restorers,” not of innovators; and they have (since 1863, when the first short
                    sketch of their work was published) striven with success to re-establish in
                    Britain Newton’s grand yet simple foundations of the subject. But these
                    foundations, as stated above, are only temporarily the best. We have not, <hi
                    rend="italic">as yet,</hi> anything nearly so good.</p>
                <p>Other modern works of value are the <hi rend="italic">Analytic</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mechanics</hi> of the late Professor Peirce (Boston, 1855) and
                    Kirchhoffs <hi rend="italic">Vorlesungen über Mathematische Physik</hi>
                    (Leipsic, 1876). Both are rather of the nature of collections of short treatises
                    on special questions than organized wholes, but both will well repay careful
                    reading. This, in the case of Peirce’s work, is rendered extremely puzzling and
                    laborious by the peculiar notations and modes of reference adopted by the
                    author. It is particularly interesting to study the ways in which the
                    fundamental principles are introduced in these works, and to compare them with
                    the corresponding parts of the works of Newton and Lagrange. Lagrange, Peirce,
                    and Kirchhoff construct each a system as free from anything but analysis as
                    possible. In fact Lagrange prefaces his work by the characteristic statement,
                    “On ne trouvera point de Figures dans cet ouvrage. Les méthodes que j’y expose
                    ne demandent ni constructions, ni raisonnemens géométriques ou méchaniques, mais
                    seulement des opérations algébriques, assujetties à une marche régulière et
                    uniforme. Ceux qui aiment l’Analyse verront avec plaisir la Méchanique en
                    devenir une nouvelle branche.” .... How far we have considered it expedient to
                    differ from such an authority, a glance at the preceding pages will show.</p>
                <p>A part of the detailed work of several of the examples above given in <hi
                    rend="italic">Dynamics of a</hi><hi rend="italic">Particle</hi> has been taken
                    from the elementary treatise (with that title) of Tait and Steele. The English
                    reader who wishes to pursue*elementary Statics may profitably consult the
                    treatise of Minchin. The higher parts are discussed in the work of Somoff, <hi

                    An excellent introduction to the use of Generalized Coordinates has been
                    published by Watson and Burbury (1879). On Lagrange’s Generalized Equations the

                <p>1. The practical applications of mechanics may be divided into two classes,
                    according as the assemblages of material objects to which they relate are
                    intended to remain fixed or to move relatively to each other, —the former class
                    being comprehended under the term <hi rend="superscript"> 44</hi> Theory of
                    Structures,” and the latter under the term “Theory of Machines.” As the details
                    of the theory of structures are dealt with in other articles, it will be treated
                    of here to such extent only as may be necessary in order to state certain
                    general principles applicable to all these subjects. The greater part of the
                    article will relate to machines.</p>

                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Support of</hi><hi rend="italic">Structures.—</hi> Every
                    structure, as a whole, is maintained in equilibrium by the joint action of its
                    own <hi rend="italic">weight,</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">external load</hi>
                    or pressure applied to it from without and tending to displace it, and of the
                    <hi rend="italic">resistance</hi> of the material which supports it. A structure
                    is supported either by resting on the solid crust of the earth, as buildings do,
                    or by floating in a fluid, as ships do in water and balloons in air. The
                    principles of the support of a floating structure form an important part of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hydromechanics</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∖</hi> The principles of the support, as a whole, of a structure
                    resting on the land, are so far identical with those which regulate the
                    equilibrium and stability of the several parts of that structure, and of which a
                    summary will presently be given, that the only principle which seems to require
                    special mention here is one which comprehends in one statement the power both of
                    liquids and of loose earth to support structures, and which was first
                    demonstrated in a paper “On the Stability of Loose Earth,” read to the Royal
                    Society on the 19th of June 1856, and published in the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Let E represent the weight of the portion of a horizontal stratum of earth which
                    is displaced by the foundation of a structure, S the utmost weight of that
                    structure consistently with the power of the earth to resist displacement, <hi

                    as is well known.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Composition of a Structure, and Connexion of</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">its Pieces.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> A structure is composed
                    of <hi rend="italic">pieces, —</hi> such as the stones of a building in masonry,
                    the beams of a timber frame-work, the bars, plates, and bolts of an iron bridge.
                    Those pieces are connected at their <hi rend="italic">joints</hi> or surfaces of
                    mutual contact, either by simple pressure and friction (as in masonry with moist
                    mortar or without mortar), by pressure and adhesion (as in masonry with cement
                    or with hardened mortar, and timber with glue), or by the resistance of <hi
                    rend="italic">fastenings</hi> of different kinds, whether made by means of the
                    form of the joint (as dovetails, notches, mortises, and tenons) or by separate
                    fastening pieces (as trenails, pins, spikes, nails, holdfasts, screws, bolts,
                    rivets, hoops, straps, and sockets).</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Stability, Stiffness, and Strength.—</hi> A structure may be
                    damaged or destroyed in three ways :—first, by <hi rend="italic"
                    >displacement</hi> of its pieces from their proper positions relatively to each
                    other or to the earth; secondly, by <hi rend="italic">disfigurement</hi> of one
                    or more of those pieces, owing to their being unable to preserve their proper
                    shapes under the pressures to which they are subjected; thirdly, by <hi
                    rend="italic">breaking</hi> of one or more of those pieces. The power of
                    resisting displacement constitutes <hi rend="italic">stability</hi>; the power
                    of each piece to resist disfigurement is its <hi rend="italic">stiffness</hi>;
                    and its power to resist breaking, its <hi rend="italic">strength.</hi></p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Conditions of Stability.—</hi> The principles of the
                    stability of a structure can be to a certain extent investigated independently
                    of the stiffness and strength, by assuming, in the first instance, that each
                    piece has strength sufficient to be safe against being broken, and stiffness
                    sufficient to prevent its being disfigured to an extent inconsistent with the
                    purposes of the structure, by the greatest forces which are to be applied to it.
                    The condition that each piece of the structure is to be maintained in
                    equilibrium by having its gross load, consisting of its own weight and of the
                    external pressure applied to it, balanced by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >resistances</hi> or pressures exerted between it and the contiguous pieces,
                    furnishes the means of determining the magnitude, position, and direction of the
                    resistances required at each joint in order to produce equilibrium; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">conditions of stability</hi> are, first, that the <hi
                    rend="italic">position,</hi> and, secondly, that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >direction,</hi> of the resistance required at each joint shall, under all the
                    variations to which the load is subject, be such as the joint is capable of
                    exerting,—conditions which are fulfilled by suitably adjusting the figures and
                    positions of the joints, and the <hi rend="italic">ratios</hi> of the gross
                    loads of the pieces. As for the <hi rend="italic">magnitude</hi> of the
                    resistance, it is limited by conditions, not of stability, but of strength and
                    stiffness.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Principle of Least Resistance.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    Where more than one system of resistances are alike capable of balancing the
                    same system of loads applied to a given structure, it has been demonstrated by
                    Moseley that the <hi rend="italic">smallest</hi> of those alternative systems is
                    that which will actually be exerted,—because the resistances to displacement are
                    the effect of a strained state of the pieces, which strained state is the effect
                    of the load, and when the load is applied the strained state and the resistances
                    produced by it increase until the resistances acquire just those magnitudes
                    which are sufficient to balance the load, after which they increase no
                    further.</p>
                <p>This principle of least resistance renders determinate many problems in the
                    statics of structures which were formerly considered indeterminate.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Relations between Polygons of Loads and of Resistances.
                    —</hi> In a structure in which each piece is supported at two joints only, the
                    well-known laws of statics show that the directions of the gross load on each
                    piece and of the two resistances by which it is supported must lie in one plane,
                    must either be parallel or meet in one point, and must bear to each other, if
                    not parallel, the proportions of the sides of a triangle respectively parallel
                    to their directions, and, if parallel, such proportions that each of the three
                    forces shall be proportional to the distance between the other two,—all the
                    three distances being measured along one direction.</p>
                <p>Considering, in the first place, the case in which the load and the two
                    resistances by which each piece is balanced meet in one point, which may be
                    called the <hi rend="italic">centre of load,</hi> there will be as many such
                    points of intersection, or centres of load, as there are pieces in the
                    structure; and the directions and positions of the resistances or mutual
                    pressures exerted between the pieces will be represented by the sides of a
                    polygon joining those points, as in fig. 1, where Pi, 1*2, I*3&gt; I*4 represent
                    the centres of load in a structure of four pieces, and the sides of the <hi
                    rend="italic">polygon of resistances</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> P <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> P <hi rend="subscript">
                    4</hi> represent respectively the directions and position^ of the resistances
                    exerted at the joints. Further, at any one of the centres of load let PL
                    represent the magnitude and direction of the gross load, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pa, Pb</hi> the two resistances by which the piece to which that load is
                    applied is supported; then will those three lines be respectively the diagonal
                    and sides of a parallelogram; or, what is the same thing, they will be equal to
                    the three sides of a triangle; and they must be in the same plane, although the
                    sides of the polygon of resistances may be in different planes.</p>
                <p>According to a well-known principle of statics, because the loads or external
                    pressures P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> I. <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>,
                    &amp;c., balance each other, they must be proportional to the sides of a closed
                    polygon drawn respectively parallel to their directions. In fig. 2 construct
                    such a <hi rend="italic">polygon of loads</hi> by drawing the lines I. <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, &amp;c., parallel and proportional to, and joined end
                    to end in the order of, the gross loads on the pieces of the structure. Then
                    from the proportionality and parallelism of the load and the two resistances
                    applied to each piece of the structure to the three sides of a triangle, there
                    results the following theorem [originally due to Rankine];—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">If from the angles of the polygon of loads there be drawn
                    lines</hi> (R <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, R <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,
                    &amp;c.), <hi rend="italic">each of which is parallel to the resistance {as</hi>
                    P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, &amp;c.) <hi
                    rend="italic">exerted at the joint between the pieces to which the two loads
                    represented by the contiguous sides of the polygon of loads (such as</hi> I. <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, I. <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, &amp;c. ) <hi
                    rend="italic">are applied; then will all those lines meet in one point</hi> (0),
                    <hi rend="italic">and their lengths, measured from that point to the angles of
                    the polygon, will represent the magnitudes of the resistances to which they are
                    respectively parallel.</hi></p>
                <p>When the load on one of the pieces is parallel to the resistances which balance
                    it, the polygon of resistances ceases to be closed, two of the sides becoming
                    parallel to each other and to the load in question, and extending indefinitely.
                    In the polygon of loads the direction of a load sustained by parallel
                    resistances traverses the point 0.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">How the Earth's Resistance is to be treated.—</hi> When the
                    pressure exerted by a structure on the earth (to which the earth’s resistance is
                    eqval and opposite) consists either of one pressure, which is necessarily the
                    resultant of the weight of the structure and of all the other forces applied to
                    it, or of two or more parallel vertical forces, whose amount can be determined
                    at the outset of the <pb break="no"

                    treated as one or more <hi rend="italic">upward loads</hi> applied to the
                    structure. But in other cases the earth is to be treated as <hi rend="italic"
                    >one of the pieces of the structure,</hi> loaded with a force equal and opposite
                    in direction and position to the resultant of the weight of the structure and of
                    the other pressures applied to it.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Partial Polygons of Resistance.—</hi> In a structure in
                    which there are pieces supported at more than two joints, let a polygon be
                    constructed of lines connecting the centres of load of any continuous series of
                    pieces. This may be called a <hi rend="italic">partial polygon of
                    resistances.</hi> In considering its properties, the <hi rend="italic">load</hi>
                    at each centre of load is to be held to <hi rend="italic">include</hi> the

                    the partial polygon of resistances, to which the theorem of section 7 will then
                    apply in every respect. By constructing several partial polygons, and computing
                    the relations between the loads and resistances which are determined by the
                    application of that theorem to each of them, with the aid, if necessary, of
                    Moseley’s principle of the least resistance, the whole of the relations amongst
                    the loads and resistances may be found.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Line of Pressures—Centres and Line of Resistance.—</hi> The
                    <hi rend="italic">line of pressures</hi> is a line to which the directions of
                    all the resistances in one polygon are tangents. The <hi rend="italic">centre of
                    resistance</hi> at any joint is the point where the line representing the total
                    resistance exerted at that joint intersects the joint. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >line of resistance</hi> is a line traversing all the centres of resistance of a
                    series of joints,—its form, in the positions intermediate between the actual
                    joints of the structure, being determined by supposing the pieces and their
                    loads to be subdivided by the introduction of intermediate joints <hi
                    rend="italic">ad infinitum,</hi> and finding the continuous line, curved or
                    straight, in which the intermediate centres of resistance are all situated,
                    however great their number. The difference between the line of resistance and
                    the line of pressures was first pointed out by Moseley.</p>
                <p>11. <hi rend="italic">Stability of Position, and Stability of Friction.—</hi> The
                    resistances at the several joints having been determined by the principles set
                    forth in sections 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, not only under the ordinary load of the
                    structure, but under all the variations to which the load is subject as to
                    amount and distribution, the joints are now to be placed and shaped so that the
                    pieces shall not suffer relative displacement under any of those loads. The
                    relative displacement of the two pieces which abut against each other at a joint
                    may take place either by turning or by sliding. Safety against displacement by
                    turning is called <hi rend="italic">stability of position</hi>; safety against

                    of a structure were infinitely stiff and strong, stability of position at any
                    joint would be insured simply by making the centre of resistance fall within the
                    joint under all possible variations of load. In order to allow for the finite
                    stiffness and strength of materials, the least distance of the centre of
                    resistance inward from the nearest edge of the joint is made to bear a definite
                    proportion to the depth of the joint measured in the same direction, which
                    proportion is fixed, sometimes empirically, sometimes by theoretical deduction
                    from the laws of the strength of materials. That least distance is called by
                    Moseley the <hi rend="italic">modulus of stability.</hi> The following are some
                    of the ratios of the modulus of stability to the depth of the joint which occur

                <p>13. <hi rend="italic">Condition of Stability of Friction.—</hi> If the resistance
                    to be exerted at a joint is always perpendicular to the surfaces which abut at
                    and form that joint, there is no tendency of the pieces to be displaced by
                    sliding. If the resistance be oblique, let JK (fig. 3) be the joint, C its
                    centre of resistance, CR a line representing the resistance, CN a perpendicular
                    to the joint at the centre of resistance. The angle NCR is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >obliquity</hi> of the resistance. From R draw RP parallel and RQ perpendicular
                    to the joint; then, by the principles of statics, the component of the
                    resistance <hi rend="italic">normal</hi> to the joint is—</p>
                <p>CP = CR . cos^≤,PRC; and the component <hi rend="italic">tangential</hi> to the
                    joint is—</p>
                <p>CQ = CR . sin^PCR = CP . tan^≤PCR.</p>
                <p>If the joint be provided either with projections and recesses, such as mortises
                    and tenons, or with fastenings, such as pins or bolts, so as to resist
                    displacement by sliding, the question of the utmost amount of the tangential
                    resistance CQ which it is capable of exerting depends on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >strength</hi> of such projections, recesses, or fastenings, and belongs to the
                    subject of strength, and not to that of stability. In other cases the safety of
                    the joint against displacement by sliding depends on its power of exerting
                    friction, and that power depends on the law, known by experiment, that the
                    friction between two surfaces bears a constant ratio, depending on the nature of
                    the surfaces, to the force by which they are pressed together. In order that the
                    surfaces which abut at the joint JK may be pressed together, the resistance
                    required by the conditions of equilibrium, CR, must be a <hi rend="italic"
                    >thrust</hi> and not a <hi rend="italic">pull</hi>; and in that case the force
                    by which the surfaces are pressed together is equal and opposite to the normal
                    component CP of the resistance. The condition of stability of friction is that
                    the tangential component CQ of the resistance required shall not exceed the
                    friction due to the normal component; that is, that</p>
                <p>CQ&gt;∕. CP, where <hi rend="italic">f</hi> denotes the <hi rend="italic"
                    >coefficient of friction</hi> for the surfaces in question. The angle whose
                    tangent is the coefficient of friction is called <hi rend="italic">the angle of
                    repose,</hi> and is expressed symbolically by—</p>

                    rend="italic">f.</hi></p>
                <p>Now CQ = CP . tan^,PCR; consequently the condition of stability of friction is
                    fulfilled if</p>
                <p>^PCR&gt;≠5</p>
                <p>that is to say, if <hi rend="italic">the*obliquity of the resistance required at
                    the joint does not exceed the angle of repose</hi>; and this condition ought to
                    be fulfilled under all possible variations of the load.</p>
                <p>It is chiefly in masonry and earthwork that stability of friction is relied
                    on.</p>
                <p>14. <hi rend="italic">Stability of Friction in Earth.—</hi> The grains of a mass
                    of loose earth are to be regarded as so many separate pieces abutting against
                    each other at joints in all possible positions, and depending for their
                    stability on friction. To determine whether a mass of earth is stable at a given
                    point, conceive that point to be traversed by planes in all possible positions,
                    and determine which position gives the greatest obliquity to the total pressure
                    exerted between the portions of the mass which abut against each other at the
                    plane. The condition of stability is that this obliquity shall not exceed the
                    angle of repose of the earth. The consequences of this principle are developed
                    in a paper “On the Stability of Loose Earth,” already cited in sect. 2.</p>

                    referred to a system of coordinates, rectangular or oblique, and if a second
                    figure be constructed by means of a second system of coordinates, rectangular or
                    oblique, and either agreeing with or differing from the first system in
                    rectangularity or obliquity, but so related to the coordinates of the first
                    figure that for each point in the first figure there shall be a corresponding
                    point in the second figure, the lengths of whose coordinates shall bear
                    respectively to the three corresponding coordinates of the corresponding point
                    in the first figure three ratios which are the same for every pair of
                    corresponding points in the two figures, these corresponding figures are called
                    <hi rend="italic">parallel projections</hi> of each other. The properties of
                    parallel projections of most importance to the subject of the present article
                    are the following :—</p>
                <p>(1) A parallel projection of a straight line is a straight line.</p>
                <p>(2) A parallel projection of a plane is a plane.</p>
                <p>(3) A parallel projection of a straight line or a plane surface divided in a
                    given ratio is a straight line or a plane surface divided in the same ratio.</p>
                <p>(4) A parallel projection of a pair of equal and parallel straight lines, or
                    plain surfaces, is a pair of equal and parallel straight lines, or plane
                    surfaces; whence it follows</p>
                <p>(5) That a parallel projection of a parallelogram is a parallelogram, and</p>
                <p>(6) That a parallel projection of a parallelepiped is a parallelepiped.</p>
                <p>(7) A parallel projection of a pair of solids having a given ratio is a pair of
                    solids having the same ratio.</p>
                <p>Though not essential for the purposes of the present article, the following
                    consequence will serve to illustrate the principle of parallel projections
                    :—</p>
                <p>(8) A parallel projection of a curve, or of a surface of a given algebraical
                    order, is a curve or a surface of the same order.</p>
                <p>For example, all ellipsoids referred to coordinates parallel to any three
                    conjugate diameters are parallel projections of each other and of a sphere
                    referred to rectangular coordinates.</p>
                <p>16. <hi rend="italic">Parallel Projections of Systems of Forces.—</hi> If a
                    balanced system of forces be represented by a system of lines, then will every
                    parallel projection of that system of lines represent a balanced system of
                    forces.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n783/mode/1up"

                <p>For the condition of equilibrium of forces not parallel is that they shall be
                    represented in direction and magnitude by the sides and diagonals of certain
                    parallelograms, and of parallel forces that they shall divide certain straight
                    lines in certain ratios; and the parallel projection of a parallelogram is a
                    parallelogram, and that of a straight line divided in a given ratio is a
                    straight line divided in the same ratio.</p>
                <p>The resultant of a parallel projection of any system of forces is the projection
                    of their resultant; and the centre of gravity of a parallel projection of a
                    solid is the projection of the centre of gravity of the first solid.</p>
                <p>17. <hi rend="italic">Principle of the Transformation of Structures.—</hi> Here
                    we have the following theorem If a structure of a given figure have stability of
                    position under a system of forces represented by a given system of lines, then
                    will any structure whose figure is a parallel projection of that of the first
                    structure have stability of position under a system of forces represented by the
                    corresponding projection of the first system of lines.</p>
                <p>For in the second structure the weights, external pressures, and resistances will
                    balance each other as in the first structure; the weights of the pieces and all
                    other parallel systems of forces will have the same ratios as in the first
                    structure; and the several centres of resistance will divide the depths of the
                    joints in the same proportions as in the first structure.</p>
                <p>If the first structure have stability of friction, the second structure will have
                    stability of friction also, so long as the effect of the projection is not to
                    increase the obliquity of the resistance at any joint beyond the angle of
                    repose.</p>
                <p>The lines representing the forces in the second figure show their <hi
                    rend="italic">relative</hi> directions and magnitudes. To find their <hi
                    rend="italic">absolute</hi> directions and magnitudes, a vertical line is to be
                    drawn in the first figure, of s ’ jch a length as to represent the weight of a
                    particular portion of the structure. Then will the projection of that line in
                    the projected figure indicate the vertical direction, and represent the weight
                    of the part of the second structure corresponding to the beforementioned portion
                    of the first structure.</p>
                <p>The foregoing “principle of the transformation of structures” was first
                    announced, though in a somewhat less comprehensive form, to the Royal Society on
                    the 6th of March 1856. It is useful in practice, by enabling the engineer easily
                    to deduce the conditions of equilibrium and stability of structures of complex
                    and unsymmetrical figures from those of structures of simple and symmetrical
                    figures. By its aid, for example, the whole of the properties of elliptical
                    arches, whether square or skew, whether level or sloping in their span, are at
                    once deduced by projection from those of symmetrical circular arches, and the
                    properties of ellipsoidal and elliptic-conoidal domes from those of
                    hemispherical and circular-conoidal domes; and the figures of arches fitted to
                    resist the thrust of earth, which is less horizontally than vertically in a
                    certain given ratio, can be deduced by a projection from those of arches fitted
                    to resist the thrust of a liquid, which is of equal intensity, horizontally and
                    vertically.</p>

                    of the resistances over the joints.</p>
                <p>The effect of the pressures applied to a piece, consisting of the load and the
                    supporting resistances, is to force the piece into a state of <hi rend="italic"
                    >strain</hi> or disfigurement, which increases until the elasticity, or
                    resistance to strain, of the material causes it to exert a <hi rend="italic"
                    >stress,</hi> or effort to recover its figure, equal and opposite to the system
                    of applied pressures. The condition of <hi rend="italic">stiffness</hi> is that
                    the strain or disfigurement shall not be greater than is consistent with the
                    purposes of the structure; and the condition of <hi rend="italic">strength</hi>
                    is that the stress shall be within the limits of that which the material can
                    bear with safety against breaking. The ratio in which the utmost stress before
                    breaking exceeds the safe working stress is called the <hi rend="italic">factor
                    of safety,</hi> and is determined empirically. It varies from three to twelve
                    for various materials and structures.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Strength of Materials</hi> forms the subject of a
                    special article, to which the reader is referred.</p>
                <p>PART II. THEORY OF MACHINES.</p>
                <p>19. <hi rend="italic">Parts of a Machine—Frame and Mechanism.—</hi> The parts of
                    a machine may be distinguished into two principal divisions,—the <hi
                    rend="italic">frame, or</hi> fixed parts, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mechanism,</hi> or moving parts. The frame is a structure which supports the
                    pieces of the mechanism, and to a certain extent determines the nature of their
                    motions. The form and arrangement of the pieces of the frame depend upon the
                    arrangement and the motions of the mechanism; the dimensions of the pieces of
                    the frame required in order to give it stability and strength are determined
                    from the pressures applied to it by means of the mechanism. It appears therefore
                    that in general the mechanism is to be designed first and the frame afterwards,
                    and that the designing of the frame is regulated by the principles of the
                    stability of structures and of the strength and stiffness of materials,—care
                    being taken to adapt the frame to the most severe load which can be thrown upon
                    it at any period of the action of the mechanism.</p>
                <p>Each independent piece of the mechanism also is a structure, and its dimensions
                    are to be adapted, according to the principles of the strength and stiffness of
                    materials, to the most severe load to which it can be subjected during the
                    action of the machine.</p>
                <p>20. <hi rend="italic">Definition and Division of the Theory of Machines.—</hi>
                    From what has been said in the last section it appears that the department of
                    the art of designing machines which has reference to the stability of the frame
                    and to the stiffness and strength of the frame and mechanism is a branch of the
                    art of construction. It is therefore to be separated from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >theory of machines,</hi> properly speaking, which has reference to the action
                    of machines considered as moving. In the action of a machine the following three
                    things take place:—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">First,</hi> Some natural source of energy communicates motion
                    and force to a piece or pieces of the mechanism, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >receiver of poιυer</hi> or <hi rend="italic">prime mover.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Secondly,</hi> The motion and force are transmitted from the prime mover
                    through the <hi rend="italic">train of mechanism</hi> to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >working piece</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pieces,</hi> and during that
                    transmission the motion and force are modified in amount and direction, so as to
                    be rendered suitable for the purpose to which they are to be applied.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Thirdly,</hi> The working piece or pieces by their motion, or
                    by their motion and force combined, produce some useful effect.</p>
                <p>Such are the phenomena of the action of a machine, arranged in the order of <hi
                    rend="italic">causation.</hi> But in studying or treating of the theory of
                    machines, the order of <hi rend="italic">simplicity</hi> is the best; and in
                    this order the first branch of the subject is the modification of motion and
                    force by the train of mechanism; the next is the effect or purpose of the
                    machine; and the last, or most complex, is the action of the prime mover.</p>
                <p>The modification of motion and the modification of force take place together, and
                    are connected by certain laws; but in the study of the theory of machines, as
                    well as in that of pure mechanics, much advantage has been gained in point of
                    clearness and simplicity by first considering alone the principles of the
                    modification of motion, which are founded upon what is now known as Kinematics,
                    and afterwards considering the principles of the combined modification of motion
                    and force, which are founded both on geometry and on the laws of dynamics. The
                    separation of kinematics from dynamics is due mainly to Monge, Ampère, and
                    Willis.</p>
                <p>The theory of machines in the present article will be considered under the
                    following four heads :—</p>

                <p>27. <hi rend="italic">Comparative Motion.—</hi> The comparative motion of two
                    points is the relation which exists between their motions, without having regard
                    to their absolute amounts. It consists of two elements,— the <hi rend="italic"
                    >velocity ratio,</hi> which is the ratio of any two magnitudes bearing to each
                    other the proportions of the respective velocities of the two points at a given
                    instant, and the <hi rend="italic">directional relation,</hi> which is the
                    relation borne to each other by the respective directions of the motions of the
                    two points at the same given instant.</p>
                <p>It is obvious that the motions of a pair of points may be varied in any manner,
                    whether by direct or by lateral deviation, and yet that their <hi rend="italic"
                    >comparative motion</hi> may remain constant, in consequence of the deviations
                    taking place in the same proportions, in the same directions, and at the same
                    instants for both points.</p>
                <p>Willis has the merit of having been the first to simplify considerably the theory
                    of pure mechanism, by pointing out that that branch of mechanics relates wholly
                    to comparative motions.</p>
                <p>The comparative motion of two points at a given instant is capable of being
                    completely expressed by one of Sir William Hamilton’s Quaternions,—the “tensor”
                    expressing the velocity ratio, and the “versor” the directional relation.</p>

                    Fluid Mass.</hi></p>
                <p>31. <hi rend="italic">General Principle.—</hi> A mass of fluid is used in
                    mechanism to transmit motion and force between two or more movable portions
                    (called <hi rend="italic">pistons</hi> or <hi rend="italic">plungers}</hi> of
                    the solid envelope or vessel in which the fluid is contained; and, when such
                    transmission is the sole action, or the only appreciable action of the fluid
                    mass, its volume is either absolutely constant, by reason of its temperature and
                    pressure being maintained constant, or not sensibly varied.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">a</hi> represent the area of the section of a piston made
                    by a plane perpendicular to its direction of motion, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >υ</hi> its velocity, which is to be considered as positive when outward, and
                    negative when inward. Then the variation of the cubic contents of the vessel in
                    a unit of time by reason of the motion of one piston is <hi rend="italic"
                    >va.</hi> The condition that the volume of the fluid mass shall remain unchanged
                    requires that there shall be more than one piston, and that the velocities and
                    areas of the pistons shall be connected by the equation—</p>

                <p>32. <hi rend="italic">Comparative Motion of two Pistons.—</hi> If there be but

                    their velocities are opposite as to inwardness and outwardness, and inversely
                    proportional to their areas.</p>
                <p>33. <hi rend="italic">Applications—Hydraulic Press—Pneumatic
                    Power-Transmitter.—</hi> In the hydraulic press the vessel consists of two
                    cylinders, viz., the pump-barrel and the press-barrel, each having its piston,
                    and of a passage connecting them having a valve opening towards the
                    press-barrel. The action of the enclosed water in transmitting motion takes
                    place during the inward stroke of the pump-plunger, when the above-mentioned
                    valve is open; and at that time the press-plunger moves outwards with a velocity
                    which is less than the inward velocity of the pump-plunger, in the same ratio
                    that the area of the pump-plunger is less than the area of the pressplunger.
                    (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Hydromechanics.)</hi></p>
                <p>In the pneumatic power-transmitter the motion of one piston is transmitted to
                    another at a distance by means of a mass of air contained in two cylinders and
                    an intervening tube. When the pressure and temperature of the air can be
                    maintained constant, this machine fulfils equation 2, like the hydraulic press.
                    The amount and effect of the variations of pressure and temperature undergone by
                    the air depend on the principles of the mechanical action of heat, or <hi

                    Solid.</hi></p>
                <p>31. <hi rend="italic">Motions Classed.—</hi> In problems of mechanism, each solid
                    piece of the machine is supposed to be so stiff and strong as not to undergo any
                    sensible change of figure or dimensions by the forces applied to it,—a
                    supposition which is realized in practice if the machine is skilfully
                    designed.</p>
                <p>This being the case, the various possible motions of a rigid solid body may all
                    be classed under the following heads:—(1) <hi rend="italic">Shifting or
                    Translation</hi>; (2) <hi rend="italic">Turning or Rotation</hi>; (3) <hi

                    motion is simple shifting, are the straight line and the circle.</p>
                <p>Shifting in a straight line is regulated either by straight fixed guides, in
                    contact with which the moving piece slides, or by combinations of link-work,
                    called <hi rend="italic">parallel motions,</hi> which will be described in the
                    sequel. Shifting in a straight line is usually <hi rend="italic"
                    >reciprocating</hi>; that is to say, the piece, after shifting through a certain
                    distance, returns to its original position by reversing its motion.</p>
                <p>Circular shifting is regulated by attaching two or more points of the shifting
                    piece to ends of equal and parallel rotating cranks, or by combinations of
                    wflιeel-work to be afterwards described. As an example of circular shifting may
                    be cited the motion of the coupling rod, by which the parallel and equal cranks
                    upon two or more axles of a locomotive engine are connected and made to rotate
                    simultaneously. The coupling rod remains always parallel to itself, and all its
                    points describe equal and similar circles relatively to the frame of the engine,
                    and move in parallel directions with equal velocities at the same instant.</p>
                <p>35. <hi rend="italic">Rotation about a Fixed Axis—Lever, Wheel, and Axle.—</hi>
                    The fixed axis of a turning body is a line fixed relatively to the body and
                    relatively to the fixed space in which the body turns. In mechanism it is
                    usually the central line either of a rotating shaft or axle having journals,
                    gudgeons, or pivots turning in fixed bearings, or of a fixed spindle or dead
                    centre round which a rotating bush turns; but it may sometimes be entirely
                    beyond the limits of the turning body. For example, if a sliding piece moves in
                    circular fixed guides, that piece rotates about an ideal fixed axis traversing
                    the centre of those guides.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">dθ</hi></p>
                <p>Let the angular velocity of the rotation be denoted by α=^ , then the linear
                    velβcity of any point A at the distance <hi rend="italic">r</hi> from the axis
                    is <hi rend="italic">ar</hi>; and the path of that point is a circle of the
                    radius <hi rend="italic">r</hi> described about the axis.</p>
                <p>This is the principle of the modification of motion by the lever, which consists
                    of a rigid body turning about a fixed axis called a fulcrum, and having two
                    points at the same or different distances from that axis, and in the same or
                    different directions, one of which receives motion and the other transmits
                    motion, modified in direction and velocity according to the above law.</p>
                <p>In the wheel and axle, motion is received and transmitted by two cylindrical
                    surfaces of different radii described about their common fixed axis of turning,
                    their velocity-ratio being that of their radii.</p>
                <p>36. <hi rend="italic">Velocity Ratio of Components of Motion.—</hi> As the
                    distance between any two points in a rigid body is invariable, the projections
                    of their velocities upon the line joining them must be equal. Hence it follows
                    that, if A in fig. 4 be a point in a rigid body CD, rotating round the fixed
                    axis F, the component of the velocity of A in any direction AP parallel to the
                    plane of rotation is equal to the total velocity of the point <hi rend="italic"

                    that is to say, is equal to <hi rend="subscript"> α Frø</hi>.</p>
                <p>Hence also the ratio of the components of the velocities of two points A and B in
                    the directions AP and BW respectively, both in the plane of rotation, is equal
                    to the ratio of the perpendiculars <hi rend="italic">Fm</hi> and Fn.</p>

                    it follows that the only combination of translation and rotation, in which a

                <p>43. <hi rend="italic">Definitions.—</hi> An <hi rend="italic">elementary
                    combination</hi> in mechanism consists υf two pieces whose kinds of motion are
                    determined hy their connexion with the frame, and their comparative motion by
                    their connexion with each other,—that connexion being effected either by direct
                    contact of the pieces, or by a connecting piece, which is not connected with the
                    frame, and whose motion depends entirely on the motions of the pieces which it
                    connects.</p>
                <p>The piece whose motion is the cause is called the <hi rend="italic">driver</hi>;
                    the piece whose motion is the effect, the <hi rend="italic">follower.</hi></p>
                <p>The connexion of each of those two pieces with the frame is in general such as to
                    determine the path of every point in it. In the investigation, therefore, of the
                    comparative motion of the driver and follower, in an elementary combination, it
                    is unnecessary to consider relations of angular direction, which are already
                    fixed by the connexion of each piece with the frame; so that the inquiry is
                    confined to the determination of the velocity ratio, and of the directional
                    relation, so far only as it expresses the connexion between <hi rend="italic"
                    >forward</hi> and <hi rend="italic">backward</hi> movements of the driver and
                    follower. When a continuous motion of the driver produces a continuous motion of
                    the follower, forward or backward, and a reciprocating motion a motion
                    reciprocating at the same instant, the directional relation is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">constant.</hi> When a continuous motion produces a reciprocating
                    motion, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> or when a reciprocating motion
                    produces a motion not reciprocating at the same instant, the directional
                    relation is said to be <hi rend="italic">variable.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">line of action</hi> or <hi rend="italic">of connexion</hi>
                    of the driver and follower is a line traversing a pair of points in the driver
                    and follower respectively, which are so connected that the component of their
                    velocity relatively to each other, resolved along the line of connexion, is
                    null. There may be several or an indefinite number of lines of connexion, or
                    there may be but one; and a line of connexion may connect either the same pair
                    of points or a succession of different pairs.</p>
                <p>44. <hi rend="italic">General Principle.—</hi> From the definition of a line of
                    connexion it follows that <hi rend="italic">the components of the velocities of
                    a pair of connected points along their line of connexion are equal.</hi> And
                    from this, and from the property of a rigid body, already stated in sect. 36, it
                    follows, that <hi rend="italic">the components along a line of connexion of all
                    the points traversed by that line, whether in the driver or in the follower, are
                    equal</hi>; and consequently, <hi rend="italic">that the velocities of any pair
                    of points traversed by a line of connexion are to each other inversely as the
                    cosines, or directly as the secants, of the angles made by the paths of those
                    points with the line of connexion.</hi></p>
                <p>The general principle stated above in different forms serves to solve every
                    problem in which—the mode of connexion of a pair of pieces being given—it is
                    required to find their comparative motion at a given instant, or <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa.</hi></p>

                <p>48. <hi rend="italic">Classification of Elementary Combinations in
                    Mechanism.—</hi> The first systematic classification of elementary combinations
                    in mechanism was that founded by Monge, and fully developed by Lanz and
                    Betancourt, which has been generally received, and has been adopted in most
                    treatises on applied mechanics. But that classification is founded on the
                    absolute instead of the comparative motions of the pieces, and is, for that
                    reason, defective, as Willis has pointed out in his admirable treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">On the Principles of Mechanism.</hi></p>
                <p>Willis’s classification is founded, in the first place, on comparative motion, as
                    expressed by velocity ratio and directional relation, and in the second place,
                    on the mode of connexion of the driver and follower. He divides the elementary
                    combinations in mechanism into three classes, of which the characters are as
                    follows :—</p>
                <p>Class A: Directional relation constant; velocity ratio constant.</p>
                <p>Class B: Directional relation constant; velocity ratio varying.</p>
                <p>Class C: Directional relation changing periodically; velocity ratio constant or
                    varying.</p>
                <p>Each of those classes is subdivided by Willis into five divisions, of which the
                    characters are as follows:—</p>

                <p>In the present article the principle of Willis’s classification is followed; but
                    the arrangement is modified by taking the <hi rend="italic">mode of
                    connexion</hi> as the basis of the primary classification, and by removing the
                    subject of connexion by reduplication to the section of aggregate combinations.
                    This modified arrangement is adopted as being better suited than the original
                    arrangement to the limits of an article in an ençyclopaedia; but it is not
                    disputed that the original arrangement may be the best for a separate
                    treatise.</p>
                <p>49. <hi rend="italic">Rolling Contact—Smooth Wheels and Racks.</hi> —In order
                    that two pieces may move in <hi rend="italic">rolling contact,</hi> it is
                    necessary that each pair of points in the two pieces which touch each other
                    should at the instant of contact, be moving in the same direction with the same
                    velocity. In the case of two <hi rend="italic">shifting</hi> pieces this would
                    involve equal and parallel velocities for all the points of each piece, so that
                    there could be no rolling, and, in fact, the two pieces would move like one;
                    hence, in the case of rolling contact, either one or both of the pieces must
                    rotate.</p>
                <p>The direction of motion of a point in a turning piece being perpendicular to a
                    plane passing through its axis, the condition that each pair of points in
                    contact with each other must move in the same direction leads to the following
                    consequences :—</p>
                <p>I. That, when both pieces rotate, their axes, and all their points of contact,
                    lie in the same plane.</p>
                <p>II. That, when one piece rotates and the other shifts, the axis of the rotating
                    piece, and all the points of contact, lie in a plane perpendicular to the
                    direction of motion of the shifting piece.</p>
                <p>The condition that the velocity of each pair of points of contact must be equal
                    leads to the following consequences :—</p>
                <p>III. That the angular velocities of a pair of turning pieces hi rolling contact
                    must be inversely as the perpendicular distances of any pair of points of
                    contact from the respective axes.</p>
                <p>IV. That the linear velocity of a shifting piece in rolling contact with a
                    turning piece is equal to the product of the angular velocity of the turning
                    piece by the perpendicular distance from its axis to a pair of points of
                    contact.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">line of contact</hi> is that line in which the points of
                    contact are all situated. Respecting this line, the above principles III. and
                    IV. lead to the following conclusions :—</p>
                <p>V. That for a pair of turning pieces with parallel axes, and for a turning piece
                    and a shifting piece, the line of contact is straight, and parallel to the axes
                    or axis; and hence that the rolling surfaces are either plane or cylindrical
                    (the term “cylindrical” including all surfaces generated by the motion of a
                    straight line parallel to itself).</p>
                <p>VI. That for a pair of turning pieces with intersecting axes the line of contact
                    is also straight, and traverses the point of intersection of the axes; and hence
                    that the rolling surfaces are conical, with a common apex (the term “conical”
                    including all surfaces generated by the motion of a straight line which
                    traverses a fixed point).</p>
                <p>Turning pieces in rolling contact are called <hi rend="italic">smooth</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">toothless wheels.</hi> Shifting pieces in rolling contact with
                    turning pieces may be called <hi rend="italic">smooth</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >toothless racks.</hi></p>
                <p>VII. In a pair of pieces in rolling contact every straight line traversing the
                    line of contact is a line of connexion.</p>
                <p>50. <hi rend="italic">Cylindrical Wheels and Smooth Racks.—</hi> In designing
                    cylindrical wheels and smooth racks, and determining their comparative motion,
                    it is sufficient to consider a section of the pair of pieces made by a plane
                    perpendicular to the axis or axes.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n787/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0787-0756"/>
                <p>The points where axes intersect the plane of section are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >centres</hi>; the point where the line of contact intersects it, the <hi
                    rend="italic">point of contact,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pitch-point</hi>; and
                    the wheels are described as <hi rend="italic">circular, elliptical,</hi>
                    &amp;c., according to the forms of their sections made by that plane.</p>
                <p>When the point of contact of two wheels lies between their centres, they are said
                    to be in <hi rend="italic">outside gearing</hi>; when beyond their centres, in
                    <hi rend="italic">inside gearing,</hi> because the rolling surface of the larger
                    wheel must in this case be turned inward or towards its centre.</p>
                <p>From Principle III. of sect. 49 it appears that the angular velocity-ratio of a
                    pair of wheels is the inverse ratio of the distances of the point of contact
                    from the centres respectively.</p>
                <p>For outside gearing that ratio is <hi rend="italic">negative,</hi> because the
                    wheels turn contrary ways; for inside gearing it is <hi rend="italic"
                    >positive,</hi> because they turn the same way.</p>
                <p>If the velocity ratio is to be constant, as in Willis’s Class A, the wheels must
                    be circular; and this is the most common form for wheels.</p>
                <p>If the velocity ratio is to be variable, as in Willis’s Class B, the figures of
                    the wheels are a pair of <hi rend="italic">rolling curves,</hi> subject to the
                    condition that the distance between their <hi rend="italic">poles</hi> (which
                    are the centres of rotation) shall be constant.</p>
                <p>The following is the geometrical relation which must exist between such a pair of
                    curves. See fig. 10.</p>
                <p>Let C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> be the poles
                    of a pair of rolling curves; T∣, T <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> any pair of

                    for every possible pair of points of contact, the two following equations must
                    be simultaneously fulfilled:—</p>

                <p>A condition equivalent to the above, and necessarily connected with it, is, that

                <p>A rack, to work with a circular wheel, must be straight. To work with a wheel of

                    III. and VI. of sect. 49 it appears that the angular velocities of a pair of
                    wheels whose axes meet in a point are to each other inversely as the sines of
                    the angles which the axes of the wheels make with the line of contact. Hence
                    follows the following construction (figs. 11 and 12).—Let 0 be the apex or point
                    of meeting of the two axes OC <hi rend="subscript"> n</hi> OC <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. The angular velocity ratio being given, it is required

                    will be the line of contact required.</p>
                <p>When the velocity ratio is variable, the line of contact will shift its position
                    in the plane C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> OC <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and
                    the wheels will be cones, with eccentric or irregular bases. In every case which
                    occurs in practice, however, the velocity ratio is constant; the line of contact
                    is constant in position, and the rolling surfaces of the wheels are regular
                    circular cones (when they are called <hi rend="italic">bevel wheels);</hi> or

                    >BevelWheels.</hi> —An hyperboloid of revolution is a surface resembling a sheaf
                    or a dice box, generated by the rotation of a straight line round an axis from
                    which it is at a constant distance, and to which it is inclined at a constant
                    angle. If two such hyperboloids, equal or unequal, be placed in the closest
                    possible contact, as in fig. 13, they will touch each other along one of the
                    generating straight lines of each, which will form their line of contact, and
                    will be inclined to the axes AG, BH in opposite directions. The axes will not be
                    parallel, nor will they intersect each other.</p>
                <p>The motion of two such hyperboloids, turning in contact with each other, has
                    hitherto been classed - <hi rend="superscript"> ,lg</hi> t ⅛∙ JE /7 _ 1 amongst

                <p>but that classification is not strictly ( correct, for, although the component ι

                    direction at right angles to the line of contact are equal, still, y∣ ∣β</p>
                <p>as the axes are neither parallel to each other nor to the line of contact, the
                    velocities of a pair of points of contact have components along the line of
                    contact which are unequal, and their difference constitutes a <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The directions and positions of the axes being given, and the required angular
                    velocity ratio, the following construction serves to determine the line of
                    contact, by whose rotation round the two axes respectively the hyperboloids are

                    adjoin; through D parallel to OE draw DT. This will be the line of contact.</p>
                <p>A pair of thin frusta of a pair of hyperboloids are used in practice to
                    communicate motion between a pair of axes neither parallel not intersecting, and

                <p>In skew-bevel wheels the properties of a line of connexion are not possessed by
                    every line traversing the line of contact, but only by every line traversing the
                    line of contact at right angles.</p>
                <p>If the velocity ratio to be communicated were variable, the point D would alter
                    its position, and the line DT its direction, at different periods of the motion,
                    and the wheels would be hyperboloids of an eccentric or irregular cross-section;
                    but forms of this kind are not used in practice.</p>

                    adhesion or friction between a pair of smooth wheels is seldom sufficient to
                    prevent their slipping on each other, contrivances are used to increase their
                    mutual hold. One of those consists in forming the rim of each wheel into a

                    applicable to cylindrical and bevel wheels, but not to skew-bevel wheels. The
                    comparative motion of a pair of wheels so ridged and grooved is the same with
                    that of a pair of smooth wheels in rolling contact, whose cylindrical or conical
                    surfaces lie midway between the tops of the ridges and •bottoms of the grooves,

                    Pitch.—</hi> The ordinary method of connecting a pair of wheels, or a wheel and
                    a rack, and the only method which insures the exact maintenance of a given
                    numerical velocity ratio, is by means of a series of alternate ridges and
                    hollows parallel or nearly parallel to the successive lines of contact of the
                    ideal smooth wheels whose velocity ratio would be the same with that of the
                    toothed wheels. The ridges are called <hi rend="italic">teeth</hi>; the hollows,
                    <hi rend="italic">spaces.</hi> The teeth of the driver push those of the
                    follower before them, and in so doing sliding takes place between them in a
                    direction across their lines of contact.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The pitch-surfaces</hi> of a pair of toothed wheels are the
                    ideal smooth surfaces which would have the same comparative motion by rolling
                    contact that the actual wheels have by the sliding contact of their teeth. The
                    <hi rend="italic">pitch-circles</hi> of a pair of circular toothed wheels are
                    sections of their pitch-surfaces, made for <hi rend="italic">spur-wheels</hi>
                    (that is, for wheels whose axes are parallel) by a plane at right angles to the
                    axes, and for bevel wheels by a sphere described about the common apex. For a
                    pair of skew-bevel wheels the pitch-circles are a pair of contiguous rectangular
                    sections of the pitch-surfaces. The <hi rend="italic">pitch-point</hi> is the
                    point of contact of the pitch-circles.</p>
                <p>The pitch-surface of a wheel lies intermediate between the points of the teeth
                    and the bottoms of the hollows between them. That part of the acting surface of
                    a tooth which projects beyond the pitchsurface is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >face</hi>; that part which lies within the pitchsurface, the√tonfc.</p>
                <p>Teeth, when not otherwise specified, are understood to be made in’one piece with
                    the wheel,—the material being generally cast-iron, brass, or bronze. Separate
                    teeth, fixed into mortises in the rim of the wheel, are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >cogs.</hi> A <hi rend="italic">pinion</hi> is a small toothed wheel; a <hi
                    rend="italic">trundle</hi> is a pinion with cylindrical stoves for teeth.</p>
                <p>The radius of the pitch-circle of a wheel is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >geometrical radius</hi>; a circle touching the ends of the teeth is called the
                    <hi rend="italic">addendum circle,</hi> and its radius the <hi rend="italic"
                    >real radius</hi>; the difference between these radii, being the projection of
                    the teeth beyond the pitch-surface, is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >addendum.</hi></p>
                <p>The distance, measured along the pitch-circle, from the face of one tooth to the
                    face of the next, is called the <hi rend="italic">pitch.</hi> The pitch and the
                    number of teeth in wheels are regulated by the following principles :—</p>
                <p>I. In wheels which rotate continuously for one revolution or more, it is
                    obviously necessary <hi rend="italic">that the pitch should be an aliquot part
                    of the circumference.</hi></p>
                <p>In wheels which reciprocate without performing a complete revolution this
                    condition is not necessary. Such wheels are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >sectors.</hi></p>
                <p>II. In order that a pair of wheels, or a wheel and a rack, may work correctly
                    together, it is in all cases essential <hi rend="italic">that the pitch should
                    be the same in each.</hi></p>
                <p>III. Hence, in any pair of circular wheels which work together, the numbers of
                    teeth in a complete circumference are directly as the radii and inversely as the
                    angular velocities.</p>
                <p>IV. Hence also, in any pair of circular wheels which rotate continuously for one
                    revolution or more, the ratio of the numbers of teeth and its reciprocal the
                    angular velocity ratio must be expressible in whole numbers.</p>
                <p>From this principle arise problems of a kind which will be referred to in
                    treating of <hi rend="italic">Trains of Mechanism.</hi></p>
                <p>V. Let <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> N be the respective numbers of teeth in a pair
                    of wheels, N being the greater. Let <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> T be a pair of
                    teeth in the smaller and larger wheel respectively, which at a particular
                    instant work together. It is required to find, first, how many pairs of teeth
                    must pass the line of contact of the pitch-surfaces before Zand T work together
                    again (let this number be called <hi rend="italic">a)</hi>; and, secondly, with

                    uniformity of shape of the teeth of a pair of wheels, that each given tooth in
                    one wheel should work with as many different teeth in the other wheel as
                    possible. They therefore study that the numbers of teeth in each pair of wheels
                    which work together shall either be prime to each other, or shall have their
                    greatest common divisor as small as is consistent with a velocity ratio suited
                    for the purposes of the machine.</p>

                <p>This principle determines the <hi rend="italic">forms</hi> of all teeth of

                <p>The path of contact is bounded where the approach commences by the
                    addendum-circle of the follower, and where the recess terminates by the
                    addendum-circle of the driver. The length of the path of contact should be such
                    that there shall always be at least one pair of teeth in contact; and it is
                    better still to make it so long that there shall always be at least two pairs of
                    teeth in contact.</p>

                <p>In practice it is found desirable that the mean value of the obliquity of action
                    during the contact of teeth should not exceed 15* nor the maximum value 30°.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary to give separate figures and demonstrations for inside gearing.
                    The only modification required in the formula is, that in equation 26 the <hi

                    values, though not absolutely exact, are near enough to the truth for practical
                    purposes. )</p>
                <p>Suppose the base-circles to be a pair of circular pulleys connected by means of a
                    cord whose course from pulley to pulley is P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> IP <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. As the line of connexion of those pulleys is the same
                    with that of the proposed teeth, they will rotate with the required velocity
                    ratio. Now, suppose a tracing point T to be fixed to the cord, so as to be
                    carried along the path of contact P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> IP <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, that point will trace on a plane rotating along with
                    the wheel 1 part of the involute of the base-circle D <hi rend="subscript">

                    each other in the required point of contact T, and will therefore fulfil the
                    condition required by Principle I. of sect. 55.</p>
                <p>Consequently, one of the forms suitable for the teeth of wheels is the involute
                    of a circle; and the obliquity of the action of such teeth is the angle whose
                    cosine is the ratio of the radius of their base-circle to that of the
                    pitch-circle of the wheel.</p>
                <p>All involute teeth of the same pitch work smoothly together.</p>
                <p>To find the length of the path of contact on either side of the pitch-point I, it
                    is to be observed that the distance between the fronts of two successive teeth,
                    as measured along P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> IP <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi>, is less than the pitch in the ratio of cos obliquity: 1; and
                    consequently that, if distances equal to the pitch be marked off either way from
                    I towards P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    respectively, as the extremities of the path of contact, and if, according to

                    described through the points so found, there will always be at least two pairs
                    of teeth in action at once. In practice it is usual to make the path of contact
                    somewhat longer, viz., about 2 <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> ⅛th times the pitch;
                    and with this length of path, and the obliquity already mentioned of 14.⅛ <hi

                    angles equal to the complement of the obliquity of action.</p>

                    velocities bearing that relation to the component velocity of T along TI, which
                    is given by Principle II. of sect. 55, and by equation 25. This method of
                    finding the forms of the teeth of wheels forms the subject of an elaborate and
                    most interesting treatise by Mr Edward Sang.</p>
                <p>All wheels having teeth of the same pitch, traced from the same path of contact,

                    17) be rolled on the inside of the pitch-circle BB of a wheel, it appears, from
                    sect. 37, that the instantaneous axis of the rolling curve at any instant will
                    be at the point I, where it touches the pitch-circle for the moment, and that
                    consequently the line AT, traced by a tracingpoint T, fixed to the rolling curve
                    upon the plane of the wheel, will be everywhere perpendicular to the straight
                    line TI; so that the traced curve AT will be suitable for the flank of a tooth,
                    in which T is the point of contact corresponding to the position I of the
                    pitch-point. If the same rolling curve R, with the same tracing-point T, be
                    rolled on the <hi rend="italic">outside</hi> of any other pitch-circle, it will
                    have the <hi rend="italic">face</hi> of a tooth suitable to work with the <hi

                <p>In like manner, if either the same or any other rolling curve R' be rolled the

                    <hi rend="italic">inside</hi> any other pitchcircle.</p>
                <p>The figure of the <hi rend="italic">path of contact</hi> is that traced on a

                    be) at a fixed point I (or Γ).</p>
                <p>If the same rolling curve and tracing point be used to trace both the faces and
                    the flanks of the teeth of a number of wheels of different sizes but of the same

                <p>The teeth of wheels of any figure, as well as of circular wheels, may be traced
                    by rolling curves on their pitch-surfaces; and all teeth of the same pitch,
                    traced by the same rolling curve with the same tracing-point, will work together
                    correctly if their pitch-surfaces are in rolling contact.</p>
                <p>59. <hi rend="italic">Epicycloidal Teeth.—</hi> The most convenient rolling curve
                    is the circle. The path of contact which it traces is identical with itself; and
                    the flanks of the teeth are internal and their faces external epicycloids for
                    wheels, and both flanks and faces are cycloids for a rack.</p>
                <p>For a pitch-circle of twice the radius of the rolling or <hi rend="italic"
                    >describing</hi> circle (as it is called) the internal epicycloid is a straight
                    line, being, in fact, a diameter of the pitch circle, so that the flanks of the
                    teeth for such a pitch-circle are planes radiating from the axis. For a smaller
                    pitch-circle the flanks would be convex and <hi rend="italic">incurved</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">under-cut,</hi> which would be inconvenient; therefore the
                    smallest wheel of a set should have its pitch-circle of twice the radius of the
                    describing circle, so that the flanks may be either straight or concave.</p>
                <p>In fig. 18, let BB' be part of the pitch-circle of a wheel with epi-eycloidal
                    teeth; CIC' the line of centres’; I the pitch-point; <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    point; R the internal and R' the equal external describing circles, so placed as
                    to touch the pitch-circle and each other at I. Let DID' be the path of contact,
                    consisting of the arc of approach DI and the arc of recess ID'. In order that
                    there may always be at least two pairs of teeth in action, each of those arcs
                    should be equal to the pitch.</p>
                <p>The obliquity of the action in passing the line of centres is nothing; the
                    maximum obliquity is the angle EID = E'IDj and the mean obliquity is one-half of
                    that angle.</p>
                <p>It appears from experience that the mean obliquity should not exceed 15°;
                    therefore the maximum obliquity should be about 30°; therefore the equal arcs DI
                    and ID' should each be one-sixth of a circumference; therefore the circumference
                    of the describing circle should be <hi rend="italic">six'times the
                    pitch.</hi></p>
                <p>It follows that the smallest pinion of a set in which pinion the flanks are
                    straight should have twelve teeth.</p>

                    facilitate the drawing of epicycloidal teeth in practice, Willis has shown how
                    to approximate to their figure by means of two circular arcs,—one concave, for
                    the flank, and the other convex, for the face,—and each having for its radius

                    Willis’s formulae are founded on the following properties of epicycloids :—</p>

                    the obliquity of the action at T.</p>

                <p>Hence the following construction (fig. 19). Let BB be part of the pitch-circle,

                <p>To facilitate the application of this rule, Willis published tables of <hi

                    the pitch-circle of the pin-wheel or trundle on the pitch-circle of the
                    driving-wheel, with the centre of a stave for a tracing-point, and then drawing
                    curves parallel to, and within the epicycloids, at a distance from them equal to
                    the radius of a stave. Trundles having only six staves will work with large

                <p>63. <hi rend="italic">Stepped and Helical Teeth.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    Hooke invented the making of the fronts of teeth in a series of steps with a
                    view to increase the smoothness of action. A wheel thus formed resembles in
                    shape a series of equal and similar toothed disks placed side by side, with the
                    teeth of each a little behind those of the preceding disk. He also invented,
                    with the same object, teeth whose fronts, instead of being parallel to the line
                    of contact of the pitch-circles, cross it obliquely, so as to be of a screw-like
                    or helical form. In wheelwork of this kind the contact of each pair of teeth
                    commences at the foremost end of the helical front, and terminates at the
                    aftermost end; and the helix is of such a pitch that the contact of one pair of
                    teeth shall not terminate until that of the next pair has commenced.</p>
                <p>Stepped and helical teeth have the desired effect of increasing the smoothness of
                    motion, but they require more difficult and expensive workmanship than common
                    teeth; and helical teeth are, besides, open to the objection that they exert a
                    laterally oblique pressure, which tends to increase resistance, and unduly
                    strain the machinery.</p>

                    acting surfaces of the teeth of bevel-wheels are of the conical kind, generated
                    by the motion of a line passing through the common apex of the pitch-cones,
                    while its extremity is carried round the outlines of the cross section of the
                    teeth made by a sphere described about that apex.</p>
                <p>The operations of describing the exact figures of the teeth of bevel-wheels,
                    whether by involutes or by rolling curves, are in every respect analogous to
                    those for describing the figures of the teeth of spur-wheels, except that in the
                    case of btvel-wheels all those operations are to be performed on the surface of

                <p>If a screw rotates, the number of threads which pass a fixed point in one
                    revolution is the number of threads in the screw.</p>
                <p>A pair of convex screws, each rotating about its axis, are used as an elementary
                    combination to transmit motion by the sliding contact of their threads. Such
                    screws are commonly called <hi rend="italic">endless screws.</hi> At the point
                    of contact of the screws their threads must be parallel; and their line of
                    connexion is the common perpendicular to the acting surfaces of the threads at
                    their point of contact. Hence the following principles :—</p>
                <p>I. If the screws are both right-handed or both left-handed, the angle between the
                    directions of their axes is the sum of their obliquities; if one is right-handed
                    and the other left-handed, that angle is the difference of their
                    obliquities.</p>
                <p>II. The normal pitch for a screw of one thread, and the normal divided pitch for
                    a screw of more than one thread, must be the same in each screw.</p>
                <p>III. The angular velocities of the screws are inversely as their numbers of
                    threads.</p>
                <p>Hooke’s wheels with oblique or helical teeth are in fact screws of many threads,
                    and of large diameters as compared with their lengths.</p>
                <p>The ordinary position of a pair of endless screws is with their axes at right
                    angles to each other. When one is of considerably greater diameter than the
                    other, the larger is commonly called in practice a <hi rend="italic">wheel,</hi>
                    the name <hi rend="italic">screw</hi> being applied to the smaller only; but
                    they are nevertheless both screws in fact.</p>
                <p>To make the teeth of a pair of endless screws fit correctly and work smoothly, a
                    hardened steel screw is made of the figure of the smaller screw, with its thread
                    or threads notched so as to.foπn a cutting tool; the larger screw, or “wheel,”
                    is cast approximately of the required figure; the larger screw and the steel
                    screw are fitted up in their proper relative position, and made to rotate in
                    contact with each other by turning the steel screw, which cuts the threads of
                    the larger screw to their true figure.</p>
                <p>68. <hi rend="italic">Coupling of Parallel Axes—Oldham's Coupling.—A
                    coupling</hi> is a mode of connecting a pair of shafts so that they shall rotate
                    in the same direction with the same mean angular velocity. If the axes of the
                    shafts are in the same straight line, the coupling consists in so connecting
                    their contiguous ends that they shall rotate as one piece; but if the axes are
                    not in the same straight line combinations of mechanism are required. A coupling
                    for parallel shafts which acts by <hi rend="italic">sliding contact</hi> was
                    invented by Oldham, and is represented in fig.</p>
                <p>21. Cj, C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> are the axes of the two parallel shafts; D
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, D <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> two disks facing

                    fixed together at A, so as to form a rigid cross. The angular velocities of the
                    two disks and of the cross are all equal at every instant; the middle point of
                    the cross, at A, revolves in the dotted circle described upon the line of
                    centres C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> as a
                    diameter twice for each turn of the disks and cross; the instantaneous axis of

                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> diametrically opposite
                    to A.</p>
                <p>Oldham’s coupling may be used with advantage where the axes of the shafts are
                    intended to be as nearly in the same straight line as is possible, but where
                    there is some doubt as to the practicability or permanency of their exact

                    belts of leather or of gutta percha, round cords of catgut, hemp, or other

                <p><hi rend="italic">Belts</hi> (the most frequently used of all wrapping
                    connectors) require nearly cylindrical pulleys. A belt tends to move towards
                    that part of a pulley whose radius is greatest; pulleys for belts, therefore,
                    are slightly swelled in the middle, in order that the belt may remain on a
                    pulley, unless forcibly shifted. A belt when in motion is shifted off a pulley,
                    or from one pulley on to another of equal size alongside of it, by pressing
                    against that part of the belt which is moving <hi rend="italic">towards</hi> the
                    pulley.</p>

                <p>Wrapping connectors for communicating continuous motion are endless.</p>
                <p>Wrapping connectors for communicating reciprocating motion have usually their
                    ends made fast to the pulleys or drums which they connect, and which in this
                    case may be sectors.</p>
                <p>The line of connexion of two pieces connected by a wrapping connector is the
                    centre line of the belt, cord, or chain; and the comparative motions of the
                    pieces are determined by the principles of sect. 46 if both pieces turn, and of
                    sect. 47 if one turns and the other shifts, in which latter case the motion must
                    be reciprocating.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pitch-line</hi> of a pulley or drum is a curve to which the
                    line of connexion is always a tangent; that is to say, it is a curve parallel to
                    the acting surface of the pulley or drum, and distant from it by half the
                    thickness of the wrapping connector.</p>
                <p>Pulleys and drums for communicating a constant velocity ratio are circular. The
                    <hi rend="italic">effective radius,</hi> or radius of the pitch-circle of a
                    circular pulley or drum, is equal to the real radius added to half the thickness

                <p>The angular velocities of a pair of connected circular pulleys or drums are
                    inversely as the effective radii.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">crossed</hi> belt, as in fig. 22, A, reverses the direction

                <p>In order that the belt may fit accurately in every possible position on a pair of

                    according as the belt is crossed or uncrossed.</p>
                <p>For a <hi rend="italic">crossed</hi> belt, as in A and C, fig. 23, I. depends

                    of two straight lines inclined opposite ways to their respective axes at equal

                <p>For an uncrossed belt, the quantity I. in equation 32, B is to be made constant.
                    The exact fulfilment of this condition requires the solution of a transcendental
                    equation; but it may be fulfilled with accuracy sufficient for practical
                    purposes by using, instead of 32, B, the following <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The following is the most convenient practical rule for the application of this

                <p>Let the speed-cones be equal and similar conoids, as in B, fig. 23, but with

                    by linkwork, if they rotate or oscillate, are usually called <hi rend="italic"
                    >cranks, beams,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">levers.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >link</hi> by which they are connected is a rigid rod or bar, which may be
                    straight or of any other figure; the straight figure, being the most favourable
                    to strength, is always used when there is no special reason to the contrary. The
                    link is known by various names under various circumstances, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">coupling-rod, connecting-rod, crank-rod, eccentric-rod,</hi>
                    &amp;c. It is attached to the pieces which it connects by two pins, about which
                    it is free to turn. The effect of the link is to maintain the distance between
                    the axes of those pins invariable; hence the common perpendicular of the axes of
                    the pins is <hi rend="italic">the line of connexion,</hi> and its extremities
                    may be called the <hi rend="italic">connected points.</hi> In a turning piece,
                    the perpendicular let fall from its connected point upon its axis of rotation is
                    the <hi rend="italic">arm</hi> or <hi rend="italic">crank-arm.</hi></p>
                <p>The axes of rotation of a pair of turning pieces connected by a link are almost
                    always parallel, and perpendicular to the line of connexion; in which case the
                    angular velocity ratio at any instant is the reciprocal of the ratio of the
                    common perpendiculars let fall from the line of connexion upon the respective
                    axes of rotation.</p>
                <p>If at any instant the direction of one of the crank-arms coincides with the line
                    of connexion, the common perpendicular of the line of connexion and the axis of
                    that crank-arm vanishes, and the directional relation of the motions becomes
                    indeterminate. The position of the connected point of the crank-arm in question
                    at such an instant is called a <hi rend="italic">dead-point.</hi> The velocity
                    of the other connected point at such an instant is null, unless it also reaches
                    a dead-point at the same instant, so that the line of connexion is in the plane
                    of the two axes of rotation, in which case the velocity ratio is indeterminate.
                    Examples of dead-points, and of the means of preventing the inconvenience which
                    they tend to occasion, will appear in the sequel.</p>
                <p>72. <hi rend="italic">Coupling of Parallel Axes.—</hi> Two or more parallel
                    shafts (such as those of a locomotive engine, with two or more pairs of driving
                    wheels) are made to rotate with constantly equal angular velocities by having
                    equal cranks, which are maintained parallel by a coupling-rod of such a length
                    that the line of connexion is equal to the distance between the axes. The cranks
                    pass their dead-points simultaneously. To obviate the unsteadiness of motion
                    which this tends to cause, the shafts are provided with a second set of cranks
                    at right angles to the first, connected by means of a similar coupling-rod, so
                    that one set of cranks pass their dead points at the instant when the other set
                    are farthest from theirs.</p>
                <p>73. <hi rend="italic">Comparative Motion of Connected Points.—</hi> As the link
                    is a rigid body, it is obvious that its action in communicating motion may be
                    determined by finding the comparative motion of the connected points, according
                    to the principles laid down in §§ 71, 78, pp. 690, 692, and this is often the
                    most convenient method of proceeding.</p>
                <p>If a connected point belongs to a turning piece, the direction of its motion at a
                    given instant is perpendicular to the plane containing the axis and crank-arm of
                    the piece. If a connected point belongs to a shifting piece, the direction of
                    its motion at any instant is given, and a plane can be drawn perpendicular to
                    that direction.</p>
                <p>The line of intersection of the planes perpendicular to the paths of the two
                    connected points at a given instant is the <hi rend="italic">instantaneous axis
                    of the link</hi> at that instant; and the <hi rend="italic">velocities of the
                    connected points are directly as their distances from that axis.</hi></p>
                <p>In drawing on a plane surface, the two planes perpendicular to the paths of the
                    connected points are represented by two lines (being their sections by a plane
                    normal to them), and the instantaneous axis by a point (fig. 24); and, should
                    the length of the two lines render it impracticable to produce them until they
                    actually intersect, the velocity ratio of the connected points may be found by
                    the principle that it is equal to the ratio of the segments which a line
                    parallel to the line of connexion cuts off from any two lines drawn from a given
                    point, perpendicular respectively to the paths of the connected points.</p>
                <p>To illustrate this by one example. Let C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> be the
                    axis, and T <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> the connected point of the beam of a
                    steam-engine; T <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> T <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> the
                    connecting or crank-rod; T <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> the other connected
                    point, and the centre of the crank-pin; C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> the axis
                    of the crank and its shaft. Let denote the velocity of T <hi rend="subscript">

                    subscript"> 2</hi> that of T <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. To find the ratio of
                    these velocities, produce C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> T <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>, C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> T <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, till they
                    intersect in K; K is the instantaneous axis of the connecting rod, and the
                    velocity ratio is <hi rend="italic">υ</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi

                <p>Should K be inconveniently far off, draw any triangle with its sides respectively
                    parallel to C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> T <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> T <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and T <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> T <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>; the ratio of the two
                    sides first mentioned will be the velocity ratio required. For example, draw C
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> A parallel to C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> T <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, cutting T <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> T <hi

                <p>74. <hi rend="italic">Eccentric.—</hi> An eccentric circular disk fixed on a
                    shaft, and used to give a reciprocating motion to a rod, is in effect a
                    crank-pin of sufficiently large diameter to surround the shaft, and so to avoid
                    the weakening of the shaft which would arise from bending it so as to form an
                    ordinary crank. The centre of the eccentric is its connected point; and its
                    eccentricity, or the distance from that centre to the axis of the shaft, is its
                    crank-arm.</p>
                <p>An eccentric may be made capable of having its eccentricity altered by means of
                    an adjusting screw, so as to vary the extent of the reciprocating motion which

                <p>Supposing all the wheels to be in outside gearing, then, as each elementary

                <p>It is often a question of importance to determine the number of teeth in a train
                    of wheels best suited for giving a determinate velocity ratio to two axes. . It
                    was shown by Young that, to do this with the <hi rend="italic">least total
                    number of teeth,</hi> the velocity ratio of each elementary combination should
                    approximate as nearly as possible to 3 ’ 59. This would in many cases give too
                    many axes; and, as a useful practical rule, it may be laid down that from 3 to 6
                    ought to be the limit of the velocity ratio of an elementary combination in
                    wheelwork. The smallest number of teeth in a pinion for epicycloidal teeth ought
                    to be <hi rend="italic">twelve</hi> (see sect. 59),—but it is better, for
                    smoothness of møtion, not to go below <hi rend="italic">fifteen·,</hi> and for

                    purpose, and B and C will themselves be the numbers required. Should B and C be
                    inconveniently large, they are, if possible, to be resolved into factors, and
                    those factors (or if they are too small, multiples of them) used for the number
                    of teeth. Should B or C, or both, be at once inconveniently large and prime,
                    then, instead of the exact ratio , some ratio approximating to that ratio,

                    the wheels ought to be so arranged that, for each elementary combination, the

                    76 that the velocity ratio of a pair of shafts coupled by a universal joint
                    fluctuates between the limits cosø and -—-. Hence one or both <hi

                    must have a vibratory and unsteady motion, injurious to the mechanism and
                    framework. To obviate this evil a short intermediate shaft is introduced, making
                    equal angles with the first and last shaft, coupled with each of them by a
                    Hooke’s joint, and having its own two forks in the same plane. Let α <hi

                <p>82. <hi rend="italic">General Principles.—</hi> Willis has designated as
                    “aggregate combinations” those assemblages of pieces of mechanism in which the
                    motion of one follower is the <hi rend="italic">resultant</hi> of component
                    motions impressed on it by more than one driver. Two classes of aggregate
                    combinations may be distinguished which, though not different in their actual
                    nature, differ in the <hi rend="italic">data</hi> which they present to the
                    designer, and in the method of solution to be followed in questions respecting
                    them.</p>
                <p>Class I. comprises those cases in which a piece A is not carried directly by the
                    frame C, but by another piece B, <hi rend="italic">relatively</hi> to which the
                    motion of A is given,—the motion of the piece B relatively to the frame C being
                    also given. Then the motion of A relatively to the frame C is the <hi
                    rend="italic">resultant</hi> of the motion of A relatively to B and of B
                    relatively to C; and that resultant is to be found by the principles already
                    explained in division 3 of this chapter, sects. 34 to 41.</p>
                <p>Class II. comprises those cases in which the motions of three points in one
                    follower are determined by their connexions with two or with three different
                    drivers, so that the motion of the follower, as a whole, is to be determined by
                    the principles of §§ 71, 78, pp. 690, 692.</p>
                <p>This classification is founded on the kinds of problems arising from the
                    combinations. Willis adopts another classification, founded on the <hi
                    rend="italic">objects</hi> of the combinations, which objects he divides into
                    two classes, viz., (1) to produce <hi rend="italic">aggregate velocity,</hi> or
                    a velocity which is the resultant of two or more components in the same path,
                    and (2) to produce <hi rend="italic">an aggregate path,</hi> that is, to make a
                    given point in a rigid body move in an assigned path by communicating certain
                    motions to other points in that body.</p>
                <p>It is seldom that one of these effects is produced without at the same time
                    producing the other; but the classification of Willis <pb break="no"

                    supposing them to occur together, is the practical object of the mechanism.</p>

                    to guide the motion of a reciprocating piece either exactly or approximately in
                    a straight line, so as to avoid the friction which arises from the use of
                    straight guides for that purpose.</p>
                <p>Fig. 28 represents an exact parallel motion, first proposed, it is believed, by
                    Mr Scott Russell.</p>
                <p>The arm CD turns on the axis C, and is jointed at D to the middle of the bar ADB,
                    whose length is double of that of CD, and one of whose ends B is jointed to a
                    slider, sliding in straight guides along the line CB. Draw BE perpendicular to
                    CB, cutting CD produced in E, then E is the instantaneous axis of the bar ADB;
                    and the direction of motion of A is at every instant perpendicular to EA, that
                    is, along the straight line ACα. While the stroke of A is AC«, extending to
                    equal distances on either side of C, and equal to twice the chord of the arc
                    D&lt;f, the stroke of B is only equal to twice the sagitta; and thus A is guided
                    through a comparatively long stroke by the sliding ot 15 through a comparatively
                    short stroke, and by rotatory motions at the joints C, D, B. (For details, see

                <p>93. <hi rend="italic">Application of Force to Mechanism.—</hi> Forces are applied
                    in units of weight; and the unit most commonly employed in Britain is the <hi
                    rend="italic">pound avoirdupois.</hi> The action of a force applied to a body is
                    always in reality distributed over some definite space, either a volume of three
                    dimensions or a surface of two. An example of a force distributed throughout a
                    volume is the <hi rend="italic">weight</hi> of the body itself, which acts on
                    every particle, however small. The <hi rend="italic">pressure</hi> exerted
                    between two bodies at their surface of contact, or between the two parts of one
                    body on either side of an ideal surface of separation, is an example of a force
                    distributed over a surface. The mode of distribution of a force applied to a
                    solid body requires to be considered when its stiffness and strength are treated
                    of; but, in questions respecting the action of a force upon a rigid body
                    considered as a whole, the <hi rend="italic">resultant</hi> of the distributed
                    force, determined according to the principles of statics, and considered as
                    acting in a <hi rend="italic">single line</hi> and applied at a <hi
                    rend="italic">single point,</hi> may, for the occasion, be substituted for the
                    force as really distributed. Thus, the weight of each separate piece in a
                    machine is treated as acting wholly at its <hi rend="italic">centre of
                    gravity,</hi> and each pressure applied to it as acting at a point called the
                    <hi rend="italic">centre of pressure</hi> of the surface to which the pressure
                    is really applied.</p>
                <p>94. <hi rend="italic">Forces applied to Mechanism Classed.—</hi> If <hi

                    applied to a piece of a machine,—that is, the angle made by the direction of the
                    force with the direction of motion of its point of application,—then by the
                    principles of Statics, F may be resolved into two rectangular components, viz.
                    :—</p>
                <p>Along the direction of motion, P = Fcos0 )</p>
                <p>Across the direction of motion, Q = F sin <hi rend="italic">θ</hi><hi

                <p>If the component along the direction of motion acts <hi rend="italic">with</hi>
                    the motion, it is called an <hi rend="italic">effort</hi>; if <hi rend="italic"
                    >against</hi> the motion, a <hi rend="italic">resistance.</hi> The component <hi
                    rend="italic">across</hi> the direction of motion is a <hi rend="italic">lateral
                    pressure;</hi> the unbalanced lateral pressure on any piece, or part of a piece,
                    is <hi rend="italic">deflecting force.</hi> A lateral pressure may increase
                    resistance by causing friction; the friction so caused acts against the motion,
                    and is a resistance, but the lateral pressure causing it is not a resistance.
                    Resistances are distinguished into <hi rend="italic">useful</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">prejudicial,</hi> according as they arise from the useful effect
                    produced by the machine or from other causes.</p>
                <p>95. <hi rend="italic">Work. — Work</hi> consists in moving against resistance.
                    The work is said to be <hi rend="italic">performed,</hi> and the resistance <hi

                    into the distance through which its point of application is moved. The <hi

                    pound overcome through a distance of one foot, and is called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >foot-pound.</hi></p>
                <p>Work is distinguished into <hi rend="italic">useful work and prejudicial</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">lost work,</hi> according as it is performed in producing the

                    is <hi rend="italic">capable</hi> of being moved. The unit of energy is the same
                    with the unit of work.</p>
                <p>When the point of application of an effort <hi rend="italic">has been moved</hi>
                    through a given distance, energy is said to have been <hi rend="italic"

                    application through a given distance, let each different magnitude of the effort
                    P be multiplied by the length ∆s of the corresponding portion of the path of the

                <p>is the whole energy exerted. If the effort varies by insensible gradations, the

                    is an instrument which measures and records the energy exerted by an effort. It
                    usually consists essentially, first, of a piece of paper moving with a velocity
                    proportional to that of the point of application of the effort, and having a
                    straight line marked on it parallel to its direction of motion, called the zero
                    line; and, secondly, of a spring acted upon and bent by the effort, and carrying
                    a pencil whose perpendicular distance from the zero line, as regulated by the
                    bending of the spring, is proportional to the effort. The pencil traces on the

                    the first law of motion it follows that in a machine whose pieces move with

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0796-0765"/> other. Now from the laws of statics (see above)
                    it is known that, in order that a system of forces applied to a system of
                    connected points may be in equilibrium, it is necessary that the sum formed by
                    putting together the products of the forces by the respective distances through
                    which their points of application are capable of moving simultaneously, each
                    along the direction of the force applied to it, shall be zero, —products being
                    considered positive or negative according as the direction of the forces and the
                    possible motions of their points of application are the same or opposite.</p>
                <p>In other words, the sum of the negative products is equal to the sum of the
                    positive products. This principle, applied to a machine whose parts move with
                    uniform velocities, is equivalent to saying that in any given interval of time
                    <hi rend="italic">the energy exerted is equal to the work performed.</hi></p>
                <p>The symbolical expression of this law is as follows :—let efforts be applied to
                    one or any number of points of a machine; let any one of these efforts be
                    represented by P, and the distance traversed by its point of application in a
                    given interval of time by <hi rend="italic">ds</hi>; let resistances be overcome
                    at one or any number of points of the same machine; let any one of these
                    resistances be denoted by R, and the distance traversed by its point of
                    application in the given interval of time by <hi rend="italic">ds'∙,</hi>
                    then</p>

                <p>The lengths <hi rend="italic">ds, ds'</hi> are proportional to the velocities of
                    the points to whose paths they belong, and the proportions of those velocities
                    to each other are deducible from the construction of the machine by the

                    of a machine is the energy exerted, and the <hi rend="italic">effect</hi> the

                <p>The unit of power, called conventionally a <hi rend="italic">horse-power,</hi> is
                    550 foot-pounds per second, or 33,000 foot-pounds per minute, or 1,980,000
                    foot-pounds per hour.</p>
                <p>102. <hi rend="italic">Modulus of a Machine. —</hi> In the investigation of the
                    properties of a machine, the useful resistances to be overcome and the useful
                    work to be performed are usually given. The prejudicial resistances are
                    generally functions of the useful resistances of the weights of the pieces of
                    the mechanism, and of their form and arrangement; and, having been determined,
                    they serve for the computation of the <hi rend="italic">lost</hi> work, which,
                    being added to the useful work, gives the expenditure of energy required. The
                    result of this investigation, expressed in the form of an equation between this
                    energy and the useful work, is called by Moseley the <hi rend="italic"
                    >modulus</hi> of the machine. The general form of the modulus may be expressed
                    thus—</p>
                <p>E = U + ≠(U, A) + ≠(A) (54), where A denotes some quantity or set of quantities
                    depending on the form, arrangement, weight, and other properties of the
                    mechanism. Moseley, however, has pointed out that in most cases this equation
                    takes the much more simple form of</p>
                <p>E = (1+A)U + B (55), where A and B are <hi rend="italic">constants,</hi>
                    depending on the form, arrangement, and weight of the mechanism. The efficiency
                    corresponding to the last equation is</p>

                <p>103. <hi rend="italic">Trains of Mechanism.—</hi> In applying the preceding
                    principles to a train of mechanism, it may either be treated as a whole, or it
                    may be considered in sections consisting of single pieces, or of any convenient
                    portion of the train,—each section being treated as a machine driven by the
                    effort applied to it and energy exerted upon it through its line of connexion
                    with the preceding section, performing useful work by driving the following
                    section, and losing work by overcoming its own prejudicial resistances.</p>
                <p>It is evident that <hi rend="italic">the efficiency of the whole train is the
                    product of the efficiencies of its sections.</hi></p>
                <p>104. <hi rend="italic">Rotating Pieces—Couples of Forces.</hi> —It is often
                    convenient to express the energy exerted upon and the work performed by a
                    turning piece in a machine in terms of the <hi rend="italic">moment</hi> of the
                    <hi rend="italic">couples of forces</hi> acting on it, and of the angular
                    velocity. See p. 728, § 219. , . .</p>
                <p>The ordinary British unit of moment is a <hi rend="italic">foot-pound</hi>; but
                    it is to be remembered that this is a foot-pound of a different sort from the
                    unit of energy and work.</p>
                <p>If a force be applied to a turning piece in a line not passing through its axis,
                    the axis will press against its bearings with an equal and parallel force, and
                    the equal and opposite reaction of the bearings will constitute, together with
                    the first-mentioned force, a couple whose arm is the perpendicular distance from
                    the axis to the line of action of the first force.</p>
                <p>A couple is said to be <hi rend="italic">right</hi> or <hi rend="italic">left
                    handed</hi> with reference to the observer, according to the direction in which
                    it tends to turn the body, and is a <hi rend="italic">driving</hi> couple or a
                    <hi rend="italic">resisting</hi> couple according as its tendency is with or
                    against that of the actual rotation.</p>
                <p>. Let <hi rend="italic">dt</hi> be au interval of time, <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    the angular velocity of the piece; then <hi rend="italic">adt</hi> is the angle
                    through which it turns in the interval <hi rend="italic">dt,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ds=vdt*=radt</hi> is the distance through which the point of
                    application of the force moves. Let P represent an effort, so that Pr is a
                    driving couple, then <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> Rtfs—Pvtfi=Prαtfi = Mαtfi
                    (57)</p>
                <p>is the energy exerted by the couple Μ in the interval <hi rend="italic">dt</hi>;
                    and a similar equation gives the work performed in overcoming a resisting
                    couple. When several couples act on one piece, the resultant of their moments is
                    to be multiplied by the common angular velocity of the whole piece.</p>
                <p>105. <hi rend="italic">Reduction of Forces to a given Point, and of Couples to
                    the Axis of a given Piece.—</hi> In computations respecting machines it is often
                    convenient to substitute for a force applied to a given point, or a couple
                    applied to a given piece, the <hi rend="italic">equivalent</hi> force or couple
                    applied to some other point or piece; that is to say, the force or couple,
                    which, if applied to the other point or piece, would exert equal energy or
                    employ equal work. The principles of this reduction are that the ratio of the
                    given to the equivalent force is the reciprocal of the rfttio of the velocities
                    of their points of application, and the ratio of the given to the equivalent
                    couple is the reciprocal of the ratio of the angular velocities of the pieces to
                    which they are applied.</p>
                <p>These velocity ratios are known by the construction of the mechanism, and are
                    independent of the absolute speed.</p>
                <p>106. <hi rend="italic">Balanced Lateral Pressure of Guides and Bearings.—</hi>
                    The most important part of the lateral pressure on a piece of mechanism is the
                    reaction of its guides, if it is a sliding piece, or of the bearings of its
                    axis, if it is a turning piece; and the balanced portion of this reaction is
                    equal and opposite to the resultant of all the other forces applied to the
                    piece, its own weight included. There may be or may not be an unbalanced
                    component in this pressure, due to the deviated motion. Its laws will be
                    considered in the sequel.</p>
                <p>107. <hi rend="italic">Friction—Unguents.—</hi> The most important kind of
                    resistance in machines is the <hi rend="italic">friction</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">rubbing resistance</hi> of surfaces which slide over each other.
                    The <hi rend="italic">direction of</hi> the resistance of friction is opposite
                    to that in which the sliding takes place. Its <hi rend="italic">magnitude</hi>
                    is the product of the <hi rend="italic">normal pressure</hi> or force which
                    presses the Tubbing surfaces together in a direction perpendicular to themselves
                    into a specific constant already mentioned in Part I., sect. 13, as the <hi
                    rend="italic">coefficient of friction,</hi> which depends on the nature and
                    condition of the surfaces of the unguent, if any, with which they are covered.
                    The <hi rend="italic">total pressure</hi> exerted between the rubbing surfaces
                    is the resultant of the normal pressure and of the friction, and its <hi
                    rend="italic">obliquity,</hi> or inclination to the common perpendicular of the
                    surfaces, is the <hi rend="italic">angle of repose</hi> formerly mentioned in
                    sect. 13, whose tangent is the coefficient of friction. Thus, let N be the
                    normal pressure, R the friction, T the total pressure, <hi rend="italic">f</hi>
                    the coefficient of friction, and <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> the angle of repose;

                <p>It is to be understood that the above-stated law of friction is only true for dry
                    surfaces when the pressure is not sufficient to indent or abrade the surfaces,
                    and for greased surfaces when the pressure is not sufficient to force out the
                    unguent from between the surfaces. If the proper limit be exceeded, the friction
                    increases more rapidly than in the simple ratio of the normal pressure.</p>

                    The product of the force of friction by the distance at which it acts from the

                    piece rotating with an uniform velocity has four mutually balanced forces
                    applied to it :—(1) the effort exerted on it by the piece which drives it; (2)
                    the resistance of the piece which follows it,— which may be considered for the
                    purposes of the present question as useful resistance; (3) its weight; and (4)
                    the reaction of its own cylindrical bearings. There are given the following data
                    :—</p>
                <p>The direction of the effort.</p>
                <p>The direction of the useful resistance.</p>
                <p>The weight of the piece and the direction in which it acts.</p>
                <p>The magnitude of the useful resistance.</p>
                <p>The radius of the bearing <hi rend="italic">r.</hi></p>
                <p>The angle of repose <hi rend="italic">φ,</hi> corresponding to the friction of

                <p>And there are required the following:—</p>
                <p>The direction of the reaction of the bearing.</p>
                <p>The magnitude of that reaction.</p>
                <p>The magnitude of the effort.</p>
                <p>Let the useful resistance and the weight of the piece be compounded by the
                    principles of statics into one force, and let this be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >the given force.</hi></p>
                <p>The directions of the effort and of the given force are either parallel or meet
                    in a point. If they are parallel, the direction of the reaction of the bearing
                    is also parallel to them; if they meet in a point, the direction of the reaction
                    traverses the same point.</p>
                <p>Also, let AAA, fig. 30, be a section of the bearing, and C its axis; then the
                    direction of the reaction, at the point where it intersects the circle AAA, must
                    make the angle <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> with the radius of that circle; that is
                    to say, it must be a line such as PT touching the smaller circle BB, whose
                    radius is <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> sin <hi rend="italic">&lt;ρ.</hi> The side
                    on which it touches that circle is determined by the fact that the obliquity of
                    the reaction is such as to oppose the rotation.</p>
                <p>Thus is determined the direction of the reaction of the bearing; and the
                    magnitude of that reaction and of the effort are then found by the principles of
                    the equilibrium of three forces already stated in Part I., sect. 7 (see also p.
                    702, § 124).</p>
                <p>The work lost in overcoming the friction of the bearing is the same with that
                    which would be performed in overcoming at the circumference of the small circle
                    BB a resistance equal to the whole pressure between the journal and bearing.</p>
                <p>In order to diminish that pressure to the smallest possible amount, the effort,
                    and the resultant of the useful resistance, and the weight of the piece (called
                    above the “given force ”) ought to be opposed to each other as directly as is
                    practicable consistently with the purposes of the machine.</p>

                    acted upon by a force tending to shift it lengthways, that force must be
                    balanced by the reaction of a bearing against a <hi rend="italic">pivot</hi> at
                    the end of the shaft; or, if that be impossible, against one or more <hi
                    rend="italic">collars,</hi> or rings <hi rend="italic">projecting</hi> from the
                    body of the shaft. The bearing of the pivot is called a <hi rend="italic"
                    >step</hi> or <hi rend="italic">footstep.</hi> Pivots require great hardness,
                    and are usually made of steel. Theyføi pivot is a cylinder of steel having a
                    plane circular end as a rubbing surface. Let N be the total pressure sustained
                    by a flat pivot of the radius <hi rend="italic">r</hi>; if that pressure be
                    uniformly distributed, which is the case when the rubbing surfaces of the pivot
                    and its step are both true planes, the <hi rend="italic">intensity</hi> of the
                    pressure is</p>
                <p>N <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> p=^</hi> (60); and, introducing this value into
                    equation 59, the <hi rend="italic">moment of friction of the flat pivot</hi> is
                    found to be</p>
                <p>⅜∕Nr (61), or two-thirds of that of a cylindrical journal of the same radius
                    under the same normal pressure.</p>
                <p>The friction of a <hi rend="italic">conical</hi> pivot exceeds that of a flat
                    pivot of the same radius, and under the same pressure, in the proportion of the
                    side of the cone to the radius of its base.</p>
                <p>The moment of friction of a <hi rend="italic">collar</hi> is given by the
                    formula—</p>

                <p>⅜∕ <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> *⅛ (62).</p>
                <p>where <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is the external and <hi rend="italic">r'</hi> the
                    internal radius.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">cup and ball</hi> pivot the end of the shaft and the
                    step present two recesses facing each other, into which are fitted two shallow
                    cups of steel or hard bronze. Between the concave spherical surfaces of those
                    cups is placed a steel ball, being either a complete sphere or a lens having
                    convex surfaces of a somewhat less radius than the concave surfaces of the cups.
                    The moment of friction of this pivot is at first almost inappreciable from the
                    extreme smallness of the radius of the circles of contact of the ball and cups,
                    but, as they wear, that radius and the moment of friction increase.</p>
                <p>It appears that the rapidity with which a rubbing surface wears away is
                    proportional to the friction and to the velocity jointly, or nearly so. Hence
                    the pivots already mentioned wear unequally at different points, and tend to
                    alter their figures. Schiele has invented a pivot which preserves its original
                    figure by wearing equally at all points in a direction parallel to its axis. The
                    following are the principles on which this equality of wear depends :—</p>
                <p>The rapidity of wear of a surface measured in an <hi rend="italic">oblique</hi>
                    direction is to the rapidity of wear measured normally as the secant of the
                    obliquity is to unity. Let OX (fig. 31) be the axis of a pivot, and let RPC be a
                    portion of a curve such that at any point P the secant of the obliquity to the
                    normal of the curve nf a line parallel to the axis is inversely proportional to
                    the ordinate PY, to which the velocity of P is proportional. The rotation of
                    that curve round OX will generate the form of pivot required. Now let PT be a
                    tangent to the <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">× secant obliquity,</hi> and this is to be a constant quantity;
                    hence the curve is that known as the <hi rend="italic">tractory</hi> of the
                    straight line OX, in which PT=OR = constant. This curve is described by having a
                    fixed straight edge parallel to OX, along which slides a slider carrying a pin
                    whose centre is T. On that pin turns an arm, carrying at a point P a
                    tracing-point, pencil, or pen. Should the pen have a nib of two jaws, like those
                    of an ordinary drawing-pen, the plane of the jaws must pass through PT. Then,
                    while T is slid along the axis from 0 towards X, P will be drawn after it from R
                    towards C along the tractory. This curve, being an asymptote to its axis, is
                    capable of being indefinitely prolonged towards X; but in designing pivots it
                    should stop before the angle PTY becomes less than the angle of repose of the
                    rubbing surfaces, otherwise the pivot will be liable to stick in its
                    bearing.</p>
                <p>The moment of friction of “Schiele’s anti-friction pivot,” as it is called, is
                    equal to that of a cylindrical journal of the radius OR = PT the constant
                    tangent, under the same pressure.</p>

                    is useful as a means of communicating motion where sudden changes either of
                    force or velocity take place, because, being limited in amount, it may be so
                    adjusted as to limit the forces which strain the pieces of the mechanism within
                    the bounds of safety. Amongst contrivances for effecting this object are <hi
                    rend="italic">friction-cones.</hi> A rotating shaft carries upon a cylindrical
                    portion of its figure a wheel or pulley turning loosely on it, and consequently
                    capable of remaining at rest when the shaft is in motion. This pulley has fixed
                    to one side, and concentric with it, a short frustum of a hollow cone. At a
                    small distance from the pulley the shaft carries a short frustum of a solid cone
                    accurately turned to fit the hollow cone. This frustum is made always to turn
                    along with the shaft by being fitted on a square portion of it, or by means of a
                    rib and groove, or otherwise, but is capable of a slight longitudinal motion, so
                    as to be pressed into, or withdrawn from, the hollow cone by means of a lever.
                    When the cones are pressed together or engaged, their friction causes the pulley
                    to rotate along with the shaft; when they are disengaged, the pulley is free to
                    stand still. The angle made by the sides of the cones with the axis should not
                    be less than the angle of repose. In <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    cause the hoop to rotate and to communicate its rotation to the pulley by
                    friction. There are many other contrivances of the same class, but the two just

                    materials, solid, liquid, and gaseous, are comparatively recent achievements of

                    velocity of rubbing is about 4 or 5 feet per second, the elevation of
                    temperature has been found by some recent experiments to be, with good fatty and
                    soapy unguents, 40° to 50’ Fahr.; with good mineral unguents, about 30®.</p>

                    When a force acts on a machine alternately as an effort and as a resistance, it
                    may be called a <hi rend="italic">reciprocating force. Of</hi> this kind is the
                    weight of any piece in the mechanism whose centre of gravity alternately rises
                    and falls; for during the rise of the centre of gravity that weight acts as a
                    resistance, and energy is employed in lifting it to an amount expressed by the
                    product of the weight into the vertical height of its rise; and during the fall
                    of the centre of gravity the weight acts as an effort, and exerts in assisting
                    to perform the work of the machine an amount of energy exactly equal to that
                    which had previously been employed in lifting it. Thus that amount of energy is
                    not lost, but has its operation deferred; and it is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >stored</hi> when the weight is lifted, and <hi rend="italic">restored</hi> when
                    it falls.</p>
                <p>In a machine of which each piece is to move with a uniform velocity, if the
                    effort and the resistance be constant, the weight of each piece must be balanced
                    on its axis, so that it may produce lateral pressure only, and not act as a
                    reciprocating force. But if the effort and the resistance be alternately in
                    excess, the uniformity of speed may still be preserved by so adjusting some
                    moving weight in the mechanism that when the effort is in excess it maybe
                    lifted, and so balance and employ the excess of effort, and that when the
                    resistance is in excess it may fall, and so balance and overcome the excess of
                    resistance,—thus <hi rend="italic">storing</hi> the periodical excess of energy,
                    and <hi rend="italic">restoring</hi> that energy to perform the periodical
                    excess of work.</p>
                <p>Other forces besides gravity may be used as reciprocating forces for storing and
                    restoring energy,—for example, the elasticity of a spring or of a mass of
                    air.</p>
                <p>In most of the delusive machines commonly called “perpetual motions,” of which so
                    many are patented in each year, and which are expected by their inventors to
                    perform work without receiving energy, the fundamental fallacy consists in an
                    expectation that some reciprocating force shall restore more energy than it has
                    been the means of storing.</p>

                    and acts in a plane passing through the axis of rotation and the centre of
                    gravity of the body.</hi></p>
                <p>The particles of a rotating body exert centrifugal forces on each other, which
                    strain the body, and tend to tear it asunder; but these forces balance each

                <p>It is essential to the steady motion of every rapidly rotating piece in a machine
                    that its axis of rotation should not merely traverse its centre of gravity, but
                    should be a permanent axis; for otherwise the centrifugal couples will increase

                    where its prolongation cuts the vertical axis.</p>
                <p>A revolving pendulum is an essential part of most of the contrivances called <hi
                    rend="italic">governors,</hi> for regulating the speed of prime movers.</p>
                <p>The earlier kinds of governors act on the prime mover by the variations of their
                    altitude. Thus in Watt’s steam-engine governor the rods, through a combination
                    of levers and linkwork C, <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> D, <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    (fig. 32), act on a lever EF, which acts upon the throttle-valve for the
                    admission of steam so as to enlarge or contract its opening when the speed
                    becomes too small or too great.</p>
                <p>In a more recent kind of governors invented by the Messrs Siemens, which may be
                    called <hi rend="italic">differentialgovernors,</hi> the regulation of the prime
                    mover is effected by means of the difference between the velocity of a wheel
                    driven by it and that of a wheel regulated by a revolving pendulum. Fig. 34
                    illustrates this class of governors. A is a vertical dead-centre or fixed shaft,
                    about which the after-mentioned pieces turn; C is a pulley driven by the prime
                    mover, and fixed to a bevel-wheel, which is seen below it; E is a bevel-wheel
                    similar to the first, and having the same apex. To this wheel are hung the bobs
                    B, of which there are <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n800/mode/1up"

                    bobs form sectors of a ring, and are surrounded by a cylindrical casing F. When
                    the bobs revolve with their proper velocity, they are adjusted so as nearly to
                    touch this casing; should they exceed that velocity, they fly outwards and touch
                    the casing, and are retarded by the friction. For practical purposes their
                    velocity of rotation about the vertical axis may be considered constant. G, G
                    are horizontal arms projecting from a socket which is capable of rotation about
                    A, and carrying vertical bevel wheels which rest on E and support C, and
                    transmit motion from C to E. There are usually four of the arms G, G with their
                    wheels, though two only are shown. H is one of those arms which projects, and
                    has a rod attached to its extremity to act on the throttle-valve of a
                    steam-engine, the sluice of a water-wheel, or the regulator of the prime mover,
                    of whatever sort it may be.</p>
                <p>When C rotates with an angular velocity equal and contrary to that of E with its
                    revolving pendulums, the arms G, G remain at rest; but should C deviate from
                    that velocity, those arms rotate in one direction or the other, as the case may
                    be, with an angular velocity equal to one half of the difference between the
                    angular velocity of C and that of E, and continue in motion until the regulator
                    is adjusted so that the prime mover shall impart to C an angular velocity
                    exactly equal to that of the revolving pendulums.</p>
                <p>There are various modifications of the differential governor, but they all act on
                    the same principle.</p>

                <p>124. <hi rend="italic">General Principles.—</hi> In order that the velocity of
                    every piece of a machine may be uniform, it is necessary that the forces acting
                    on each piece should be always exactly balanced. Also, in order that the forces
                    acting on each piece of a machine may be always exactly balanced, it is
                    necessary that the velocity of that piece should be uniform.</p>
                <p>An excess of the effort exerted on any piece, above that which is necessary to
                    balance the resistance, is accompanied with accelera tion; a deficiency of the
                    effort, with retardation.</p>
                <p>When a machine is being started from a state of rest, and brought by degrees up
                    to its proper speed, the effort must be in excess; when it is being retarded for
                    the purpose of stopping it, the resistance must be in excess.</p>
                <p>An excess of effort above resistance involves an excess of energy exerted above
                    work performed; that excess of energy is employed in producing acceleration.</p>
                <p>An excess of resistance above effort involves an excess of work performed above
                    energy expended; that excess of work is performed by means of the retardation of
                    the machinery.</p>
                <p>When a machine undergoes alternate acceleration and retardation, so that at
                    certain instants of time, occurring at the end of intervals called <hi
                    rend="italic">periods</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cycles,</hi> it returns to its
                    original speed, then in each of those periods or cycles the alternate excesses
                    of energy and of work neutralize each other; and at the end of each cycle the
                    principle of the equality of energy and work stated in sect. 96, with all its
                    consequences, is verified exactly as in the case of machines of uniform
                    speed.</p>
                <p>At intermediate instants, however, other principles have also to be taken into
                    account, which are deduced from the second law of motion, sect. 89, as applied

                <p>The latter of these equations may be thus expressed in words :— <hi rend="italic"
                    >The actual energy due to the rotation of the fly, with its mean angular
                    velocity, is equal to one-half of the periodical excess of energy multiplied by
                    the steadiness.</hi></p>
                <p>In ordinary machinery S = about 32; in machinery for fine purposes S = from 50 to
                    60.</p>
                <p>The periodical excess <hi rend="italic">e</hi> may arise either from variations
                    in the effort exerted by the prime mover, or from variations in the resistance
                    of the work, or from both these causes combined. When but one fly-wheel is used,
                    it should be placed in as direct connexion as possible with that part of the
                    mechanism where the greatest amount of the periodical excess originates; but
                    when it originates at two or more points, it is best to have a fly-wheel in
                    connexion with each of those points. For example, in a machinework, the
                    steam-engine, which is the prime mover of the various tools, has a fly-wheel on
                    the crank-shaft to store and restore the periodical excess of energy arising
                    from the variations in the effort exerted by the connecting-rod upon the crank;
                    and each of the slotting machines, punching machines, rivetting machines, and
                    other tools has a fly-wheel of its own to store and restore energy, so as to
                    enable the very different resistances opposed to those tools at different times
                    to be overcome without too great unsteadiness of motion.</p>
                <p>According to the computation of General Morin, the periodical excess <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> in steam-engines with single cranks is from <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛th to nearly 4th of the energy exerted during one
                    revolution of the crank. For a pair of steam-engines driving one shaft, with a
                    pair of cranks at right angles to each other, the value of <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> is one-fourth of its value for a single cranked engine of the same kind,
                    and of the same power with the two combined.</p>
                <p>The ordinary radius of gyration of a steam-engine fly-wheel is from three to five
                    times the length of the crank-arm. (For further particulars on this subject, see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Steam-Engine.)</hi></p>
                <p>For tools performing useful work at intervals, and having only their own friction
                    to overcome during the intermediate intervals, <hi rend="italic">e</hi> should
                    be assumed equal to the wlιole work performed at each separate operation.</p>

                    diminishing the velocity of a machine by friction, such as the friction-strap
                    already referred to in sect. 112. To find the distance s through which a brake,
                    exerting the friction F, must rub in order to stop a machine having the total
                    actual energy E at the moment when the brake begins to act, reduce, by the
                    principles of sect. 105, the various efforts and other resistances of the
                    machine which act at the same time with the friction of the brake to the rubbing

                    Propulsion.—</hi> Hitherto the effort by which a machine is moved has been
                    treated as a force exerted between a movable body and a fixed body, so that the
                    whole energy exerted by it is employed upon the movable body, and none upon the
                    fixed body. This conception is sensibly realized in practice when one of the two
                    bodies between which the effort acts is either so heavy as compared with the
                    other, or has so great a resistance opposed to its motion, that it may, without
                    sensible error, be treated as fixed. But there are cases in which the motions of
                    both bodies are appreciable, and must be taken into account,—such as the
                    projection of projectiles, where the velocity of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >recoil</hi> or backward motion of the gun bears an appreciable proportion to
                    the forward motion of the projectile; and such as the propulsion of vessels,
                    where the velocity of the water thrown backward by the paddle, screw, or other
                    propeller bears a very considerable proportion to the velocity of the water
                    moved forwards and sideways by the ship. In cases of this kind the energy
                    exerted by the effort is <hi rend="italic">distributed</hi> between the two
                    bodies between which the effort is exerted in shares proportional to the
                    velocities of the two bodies during the action of the effort; and those
                    velocities are to each other directly as the portions of the effort unbalanced
                    by resistance on the respective bodies, and inversely as the weights of the

                    quoted in a note to sect. 121, that the mutual actions of a system of bodies do
                    not affect the motion of their common centre of gravity.</p>
                <p>For example, if the weight of a gun be 160 times that of its ball, τ⅛τ °f thθ
                    energy exerted by the powder in exploding will be employed in propelling the
                    ball, and <hi rend="subscript"> γ</hi> ⅞ <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> in
                    producing the recoil of the gun, provided the gun up to the instant of the
                    ball’s quitting the muzzle meets with no resistance to its recoil except the
                    friction of the ball.</p>
                <p>135. <hi rend="italic">Centre of Percussion.—</hi> It is obviously desirable that
                    the deviations or changes of motion of oscillating pieces in machinery should,
                    as far as possible) be effected by forces applied at their centres of
                    percussion.</p>
                <p>If the deviation be a <hi rend="italic">translation,—</hi> that is, an equal
                    change of motion of all the particles of the body,—the centre of percussion is
                    obviously the centre of gravity itself; and, according to the second law of
                    motion, if <hi rend="italic">dv</hi> be the deviation of velocity to be produced
                    in the interval <hi rend="italic">dt,</hi> and W the weight of the body,
                    then</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic">dt</hi> is the unbalanced effort
                    required.</p>
                <p>If the deviation be a rotation about an axis traversing the centre of gravity,
                    there is no centre of percussion; for such a deviation can only be produced by a
                    <hi rend="italic">couple</hi> of forces, and not by any single force. Let <hi
                    rend="italic">da</hi> be the deviation of angular velocity to be produced in the
                    interval <hi rend="italic">dt,</hi> and I the moment of the inertia of the body;
                    then ⅜Ii∕(α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>) = Iαtfα is the variation of the
                    body’s actual energy. Let Μ be the moment of the unbalanced couple required to
                    produce the deviation; then, by equation 57, sect. 104, the energy exerted by
                    this couple in the interval <hi rend="italic">dt</hi> is Macfø, which, being
                    equated to the variation of energy, gh <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> es <hi

                <p>Now (fig. 35), let the required deviation be a rotation of the body BB about an
                    axis O, not traversing the centre of gravity G, <hi rend="italic">da</hi> being,
                    as before, the deviation of angular velocity to be produced in the interval <hi

                    translation with the velocity <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> OG, OG being the
                    perpendicular distance between the two axes. Hence the required deviation may be
                    regarded as compounded of a deviation of translation <hi rend="italic">dv —
                    OG.da,</hi> to produce which there would be required, according to equation 82,
                    a force applied at G perpendicular to the plane OG—</p>
                <p>P = — . OG . ⅛ (84), <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic">dt</hi> and a
                    deviation <hi rend="italic">da</hi> of rotation about an axis drawn through G
                    parallel to O, to produce which there would be required a couple of the moment Μ
                    given by equation 83. According to the principles of statics, the resultant of
                    the force P, applied at G perpendicular to the plane OG, and the couple Μ is a
                    force equal and parallel to P, but applied at a distance GO from G, in the
                    prolongation of the perpendicular OG, whose value is</p>
                <p>-÷⅛ Ä</p>
                <p>Thus is determined the position of the centre of percussion C, corresponding to
                    the axis of rotation O. It is obvious from this equation that, for an axis of
                    rotation parallel to 0 traversing 0, the <pb break="no"

                    perpendicular OG meets 0.</p>
                <p>136. <hi rend="italic">Impact.—</hi> Impact or collision is a pressure of short
                    duration exerted between two bodies. For the detailed investigation of its laws
                    the reader is referred to <hi rend="smallcaps">Mechanics,</hi> p. 719, § 180 <hi
                    rend="italic">sg.</hi></p>
                <p>The effects of impact are sometimes an alteration of the distribution of actual
                    energy between the two bodies, and always a loss of a portion of that energy,
                    depending on the imperfection of the elasticity of the bodies, in permanently
                    altering their figures, and producing heat. The determination of the
                    distribution of the actual energy after collision and of the loss of energy is
                    effected by means of the following principles :—</p>
                <p>I. The motion of the common centre of gravity of the two bodies is unchanged by
                    the collision.</p>
                <p>II. The loss of energy consists of a certain proportion of that part of the
                    actual energy of the bodies which is due to their motion relatively to their
                    common centre of gravity.</p>
                <p>Unless there is some special reason for using impact in machines, it ought to be
                    avoided, on account not only of the waste of energy which it causes, but from
                    the damage which it occasions to the frame and mechanism.</p>

                <p>137. <hi rend="italic">Observing Machines and Working Machines.—</hi> The present
                    chapter must necessarily be limited to some very general observations on the
                    principal classes into which machines may be divided, with reference to their
                    purposes and effects, leaving details of particular examples for treatment under
                    the respective special headings.</p>
                <p>Machines may be divided, in the first instance, into two great divisions, viz.
                    :—</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Observing Machines,</hi> in which either the modification of
                    motion alone, or the balancing of forces alone, is the object in view,—the
                    performance of work being either null or incidental, and being limited to that
                    which arises from the resistance of the machine.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Working machines,</hi> in which the performance of work is
                    the main object.</p>
                <p>138. <hi rend="italic">Classification of Observing Machines.—</hi> Observing
                    machines might very properly have been classed as <hi rend="italic"
                    >instruments,</hi> being designed to aid the human senses and memory in
                    obtaining and recording information. They may be divided, in the first instance,
                    into four classes, according as the subject of observation by their ajd is
                    number, measure, or weight, into—</p>
                <p>A. Counting machines.</p>
                <p>B. Measuring machines.</p>
                <p>C. Copying and drawing machines.</p>
                <p>D. Weighing machines.</p>
                <p>And to these may be added a fifth class, in which the functions of the first four
                    are more or less combined, viz. :—</p>
                <p>E. Recording machines.</p>
                <p>139. (A. ) <hi rend="italic">Counting Machines. —</hi> The most important as well
                    as the most common of counting machines are <hi rend="italic">time-keepers,</hi>
                    which count and indicate the numbers of oscillations of bodies which oscillate
                    isochronously (viz., pendulums for clocks, balance-wheels for watches and marine
                    Chronometern) so as to measure time. In constructing such machines, the objects
                    to be aimed at are the exact isochronism of the pendulum or balance, and the
                    equable action of the motive power, so that it shall overcome the friction of
                    the mechanism without affecting the rate.</p>
                <p>Other counting machines count the oscillations of the beam of a steam-engine, or
                    the revolutions of the cylinder of a gas-meter or of the wheel of a
                    water-meter.</p>
                <p>Others perforin additions, subtractions, and multiplications, and of these the
                    most elaborate kind (as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> that of Babbage) compute
                    tables of functions by the addition of differences.</p>
                <p>140. (B.) <hi rend="italic">Measuring Machines.—</hi> Measuring machines are
                    pieces of mechanism, by means of which the motion of some body of the nature of
                    an index through some geometrical magnitude, such as a distance or an angle, is
                    connected with some other motion, either equal or greater or smaller in some
                    given ratio, and capable of being more readily compared with some standard of
                    measure.</p>
                <p>To this class belong all those astronomical and surveying instruments in which
                    the motion of a line of sight (generally the line of collimation of a telescope)
                    through a given angle is connected with the motion of an index or vernier round
                    a corresponding arc of a graduated circle; also those micrometers in which the
                    advance of the end of a screw of fine pitch is measured by observing the
                    simultaneous arc of rotation of a graduated circle attached to it.</p>
                <p>Such micrometers have attained increased importance by the discovery of
                    Whitworth,—that the mechanical magnifying of small distances by a train of
                    screws affords a more accurate means of measurement than optical magnifying by
                    the microscope,—and by the perfection to which that engineer has brought that
                    art of accurate workmanship which is necessary in order to render mechanical
                    magnifying possible.</p>
                <p>Amongst measuring machines are included the <hi rend="italic">platometers</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">planimeters</hi> of Sang, Morin, and Clerk Maxwell, which
                    measure areas by means of mechanism. The amount of resistance in a measuring
                    machine should be perfectly uniform, and sufficiently great to prevent
                    accidental forces from disturbing the machine, without being so great as to
                    render it inconveniently stiff. To combine these objects requires great accuracy
                    of workmanship, together with strength and rigidity in the structure of the
                    frame and mechanism.</p>
                <p>141. (C.) <hi rend="italic">Copying and Drawing Machines.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> In copying machines for enlarging or reducing drawings there is usually
                    a combination of levers and linkwork connecting a tracing-point, which is moved
                    over the lines of the original figure, with a drawing-point, which draws the
                    copy in such a manner that the velocity ratio of their motions is a given
                    constant quantity, and that the directions of their motions make a constant
                    angle.</p>
                <p>Mechanism depending for its principle on the theory of the composition of
                    rotations is used to draw ellipses, epicycloids, epitrochoids, and other
                    curves.</p>
                <p>142. (D. ) <hi rend="italic">Weighing Machines.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> In
                    weighing machines the motion of the mechanism is used only for the purpose that
                    its cessation, or its becoming an oscillation about a certain position, may
                    indicate the equilibrium of the forces applied to the machine. Those forces may
                    either be weights, which are to be compared with each other, or forces of other
                    kinds, to be compared directly or indirectly with weights.</p>
                <p>The machine for comparing weights which is capable of the most minute accuracy is
                    also the simplest, being the <hi rend="italic">balance,</hi> in which the
                    equality of two weights is ascertained by their balancing each other at the ends
                    of a lever of equal arms. In the <hi rend="italic">steelyard,</hi> consisting
                    either of one lever or of a train of levers, the unknown weight has an
                    unchangeable point of application, and is compared with a known weight by
                    shifting the latter along the lever to v hich it is applied until the machine is
                    balanced; the ratio of the weights is then the reciprocal of the velocity ratio
                    of their points of application. The steelyard is more convenient for weighing
                    very heavy loads than the balance, but is not capable of such minute
                    accuracy.</p>
                <p>It is essential to accuracy in balances and steelyards that the friction should
                    be less than the smallest admissible amount of error. To diminish <hi
                    rend="subscript">:</hi> the friction as much as possible, the axes of motion are
                    all <hi rend="italic">knife-edges,</hi> as they are termed, of steel or hardened
                    ircn, resting on hard surfaces of hardened iron or steel for ordinary purposes,
                    and of some hard mineral, such as agate, for scientific purposes.</p>
                <p>The weight of a∙ column of fluid is determined by balancing it against a column
                    of fluid λvhose weight is known, as in the barometer, where the weight of a
                    column of the atmosphere is balanced against that of a column of mercury.</p>
                <p>Weights are compared with each other indirectly, and other forces compared with
                    weights, by means of their effects in bending a spring,—a convenient method, but
                    not susceptible of minute accuracy.</p>
                <p>The elastic pressure exerted by a fluid may be compared with weight, either by
                    balancing the pressure against the weight of a column of a liquid, or by
                    maintaining a piston in equilibrium against that pressure, by means of a weight
                    pressing it directly, or of a weight acting through a steelyard, or of the
                    elasticity of a spring which has been compared with weights.</p>
                <p>143. (E.) <hi rend="italic">Recording</hi><hi rend="italic">Machines.—</hi>
                    Recording machines may be divided into two classes :— <hi rend="italic"
                    >self-registering instruments,</hi> which, by the aid of clockwork, record
                    measurements either of space or of force, together with the instants of time at
                    which these measurements were made; and <hi rend="italic">dynamometers,</hi>
                    already mentioned in Chap. II. of this article, which register measurements of
                    force, together with the space through which it has acted, thus recording energy
                    or work.</p>

                    from the writings of Young and of Babbage) exhausts all kinds of machines; it is
                    brought forward merely as an attempt to introduce method to a certain extent
                    into a subject which would otherwise be exceedingly confused.</p>

                <p>They are usually worked by manual labour, but sometimes by hydraulic engines, or
                    by steam-engines. The useful resistance, when a load is lifted, being the weight
                    of that load, is in general greater than the effort exerted by the prime mover,
                    so that the mechanism has to be adapted to giving the working-piece a less
                    velocity than the piece to which the effort is applied. In lowering solid loads
                    the weight of the load acts as the effort, and the energy exerted by it is
                    expended in overcoming the friction of a brake in order that the speed of
                    descent may not be excessive.</p>

                    machines which perform processes, especially in the preparation of textile
                    fabrics for the market, which it would be almost impossible to class. Examples

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chapter</hi> IV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Applied Energetics, or
                    Theory of Prime Movers.</hi></p>
                <p>157. <hi rend="italic">Prime Movers in general—Their Efficiency.—</hi> Prime
                    movers, or receivers of power, are those pieces or combinations of pieces of
                    mechanism which receive motion and force directly from some natural source of
                    energy. The point where the mechanism belonging to the prime mover ends and that
                    belonging to the train for modifying the force and motion begins is somewhat
                    arbitrary; in general, however, the mechanism belonging to the prime mover may
                    be held to include all pieces which regulate or assist in regulating the
                    transmission of energy from the source of energy. Thus, in the ordinary rotative
                    steam-engine, the crank-shaft belongs to the prime mover, because it carries the
                    eccentric which moves the valves and the fly-wheel which stores and restores the
                    periodical excess of energy of the engine, and drives the governor (when there
                    is one) which regulates the admission of steam.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">usefibl work</hi> of the prime mover is the energy exerted
                    by it upon that piece which it directly drives; and the ratio which this bears
                    to the energy exerted by the source of energy is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >efficiency</hi> of the prime mover.</p>
                <p>It is often convenient to divide the prime mover into sections, and resolve its
                    efficiency into factors, each factor being the efficiency of one of those
                    sections. Thus the efficiency of a steam-engine may be resolved into the
                    following factors :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Efficiency of the furnace and boiler,—</hi> being the
                    proportion of the total heat of combustion of the fuel which takes effect in
                    heating and evaporating the water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Efficiency of the steam in driving the piston,—</hi> being the
                    proportion of the energy exerted by the steam on the piston (called the <hi
                    rend="italic">indicated</hi> energy or power, as being measured by an indicator)
                    to the mechanical equivalent of the heat received by the water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Efficiency of the mechanism from the piston to the crank-shaft
                    inclusive,—</hi> being the proportion of the effective energy transmitted by the
                    crank-shaft to the indicated energy.</p>
                <p>The product of those three factors is the efficiency of the engine as a
                    whole.</p>
                <p>In all prime movers the loss of energy may be distinguished into two parts,—one
                    being the unavoidable effect of the circumstances under which the machine
                    necessarily works in the case under consideration; the other the effect of
                    causes which are, or may be, capable of indefinite diminution by practical
                    improvements. Those two parts may be distinguished as <hi rend="italic"
                    >necessary loss</hi> and <hi rend="italic">waste.</hi></p>
                <p>The efficiency which a prime mover would have under given circumstances if the
                    <hi rend="italic">waste</hi> of energy were altogether prevented, and the loss
                    reduced to necessary loss alone, is called the <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi> or
                    the <hi rend="italic">theoretical</hi> efficiency under the given
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>For some prime movers there is a combination of circumstances which makes the
                    theoretical efficiency greater than any other combination does. The theoretical
                    efficiency under those circumstances is the <hi rend="italic">absolute maximum
                    efficiency.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">duty</hi> of a prime mover is its useful work in some given
                    unit of time, as a second, a minute, an hour, a day. In some cases, such as that
                    of the work of animals, the duty can be ascertained, while the efficiency can
                    only be inferred indirectly or conjecturally from the want of precise data as to
                    the whole energy expended.</p>

                <p>159. (A.) <hi rend="italic">Strength of Men and Animals.—</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">mechanical daily duty</hi> of a man or of a beast is the product
                    of three quantities—the effort, the velocity, and the number of units of time
                    per day during which work is continued. It is well known that for each
                    individual man or animal there is a certain set of values of those three
                    quantities which make their product, the daily duty, a maximum, and that any
                    departure from those values diminishes the daily duty. Attempts have been made
                    to represent by a formula the law of this diminution; but they have met with
                    imperfect success. That which agrees on the whole best with the facts is the
                    formula of Maschek, which is as follows :—let P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> be
                    the effort, V <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> the velocity, and T <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> the time of working per day, which give the maximum
                    daily duty, and let P, V, T, be any other set of values of those quantities;

                <p>One consequence of this formula is, that the best time of working per day for
                    men, and for all animals, is <hi rend="italic">one-third part of a day,</hi> or
                    eight hours,—a conclusion in accordance with experience.</p>

                    their true mean values for particular species being rendered very great by the
                    differences, not only between individuals, but between races or varieties of the
                    same species. The following table of values is proposed by Maschek as

                <p>Of the numbers in this table those for the draught horse are probably the most

                    1</hi> much less, than for the draught horse,—the effect being probably that the

                <p>160. <hi rend="italic">Horizontal Transport.—</hi> When men and animals carry
                    burdens, or draw or propel loads in certain vehicles, it is difficult, and
                    sometimes impossible, to determine the duty performed in footpounds of work,
                    because of the uncertainty of the amount in pounds of the resistance overcome.
                    In this ease, for the purpose of comparing performances of the same kind with
                    each other, a unit is employed called a <hi rend="italic">foot-pound of
                    horizontal transport,</hi> meaning the conveying of a load of 1 pound 1 foot
                    horizontally. The following table, compiled from the sources referred to in
                    sect. 159, gives some examples of the daily duty of men and horses in units of
                    horizontal transport, I. denoting the load in lb, V the velocity in feet per
                    second, and T the number of seconds per day of working:—</p>

                    explained.</p>
                <p>Heat acts on bodies in two ways—to elevate temperature and make the bodies
                    hotter, and to produce mechanical changes. Heat employed in producing mechanical
                    changes disappears or becomes <hi rend="italic">latent,</hi> as it is termed,
                    and can be reproduced by reversing those mechanical changes. When a cycle of
                    mechanical changes, ending by the restoration of the body to its original
                    condition, produces mechanical energy, heat disappears to an amount equal to
                    that which would be generated by employing the mechanical energy in overcoming
                    friction,—that is to say, a British unit of heat (or one degree Fahr, in one fb
                    of liquid water) for every 772 foot-pounds of energy (being the constant already
                    mentioned in sect.'115 as <hi rend="italic">Joule’s</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">efliciency of the fluid</hi> in a heat-engine is the
                    proportion which the heat converted into mechanical energy bears to the whole

                    depends solely upon the respective temperatures at which the fluid receives heat

                    >Magnetism.—</hi> Electricity developed by chemical action in a galvanic battery
                    has been to a small extent used to produce mechanical energy by alternately
                    magnetizing and unmagnetizing soft-iron bars.</p>
                <p>The data for determining the actual efficiency of such engines are deficient.
                    Their theoretical efficiency depends on the following law demonstrated by Joule
                    :—</p>
                <p>Let γ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> denote the strength of the electric current
                    which would be developed in the conducting wire of the battery if there were no
                    iron bar to be magnetized; γ <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> the strength to which
                    the current is reduced by the reaction of the iron bar, tending to induce a
                    contrary current. Then the theoretical efficiency of the engine is</p>
                <p>71-72 (89).</p>
                <p>7ι</p>
                <p>The proportion of the energy expended which is <hi rend="italic">necessarily
                    lost</hi> is 7,∕7 <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, and is employed in producing
                    heat in the conducting cn cuit.</p>
                <p>This law is exactly analogous to that of the theoretical efliciency of
                    heat-engines given in equation 88.</p>
                <p>There is reason to believe that electromagnetic engines are capable of a higher
                    efficiency than heat-engines; but the greater cost of the materials consumed
                    renders them much less economical commercially. (W.J. Μ. R.) <pb break="no"
