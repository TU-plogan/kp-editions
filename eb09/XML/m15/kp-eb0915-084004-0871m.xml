                    (1798-1854), a distinguished physicist, was born at Parma on April 11, 1798.
                    From 1824 to 1831 he was professor at Parma, but in the latter year he was
                    compelled to escape to France, having taken part in the revolution. In 1839 he
                    went to Naples as director of the conservatory of arts and handicrafts. Hθ was
                    likewise director of the Vesuvius observatory, a post which he held until 1848.
                    Melloni received the Rumford medal of the Royal Society in 1834. In 1835 he was
                    elected correspondent of the Paris Academy, and in 1839 a foreign member of the
                    Royal Society. He died from an attack of cholera on August 11, 1854.</p>
                <p>From the Royal Society catalogue of papers we find that Melloni produced
                    eighty-six memoirs byhimself, as well as three in connexion with other
                    physicists. These embrace a wide range of subjects, but the reputation of
                    Melloni as a physicist rests more especially upon his discoveries in radiant
                    heat. Men of science were, in the early part of this century, very much in the
                    dark with regard to the nature of the invisible heat rays. Leslie and others had
                    indeed advanced the subject by means of the differential thermometer, but such
                    an instrument was at the best a very poor substitute for the human eye. It was
                    necessary to invent an instrument more nearly capable of doing for the dark rays
                    what the eye does for those of light before any great increase in our knowledge
                    of this subject could be expected to take place. This step was taken (shortly
                    after Seebeck’s discovery of thermo-electricity) in the construction of the
                    thermo-multiplier or combination of thermopile and galvanometer which formed the
                    subject of a joint memoir by Nobili and Melloni in 1831. In this memoir, after
                    describing their instrument, these physicists confirmed the experiments of
                    Leslie and others. They tried screens of glass, sulphate of lime, mica, and ice,
                    also of water, oil, alcohol, and nitric acid enclosed in glass, and found an
                    instantaneous effect produced in the index of their instrument except for ice
                    and water, the source of heat being an iron ball below redness. After finding
                    that most substances when used as screens stopped a much larger proportion of
                    dark heat than they did of light, Melloni set himself to discover some body that
                    might be transparent for dark heat. In this search he was rewarded with complete
                    success. Rock-salt was found to possess this property; and he immediately
                    proceeded to construct prisms and lenses of rock-salt with which he proved the
                    refraction of dark heat, that is to say, of the heat proceeding from bodies
                    below incandescence.</p>
                <p>Melloni was likewise very successful in studying the action upon dark heat of
                    screens of various substances. His experiments in this and other directions are
                    described by Baden Powell in his report to the British Association on <hi
                    rend="italic">Radiant Heat</hi> (1840). The rays of the lamp were thrown upon
                    screens of various materials in such a manner that the effect transmitted from
                    all the screens was of a certain uniform amount. This constant radiation was
                    then intercepted by a plate of alum, and it was found that very different
                    quantities of heat were transmitted through the alum in the different cases.
                    Melloni concludes that the calorific rays issuing from the various diaphanous
                    screens are, therefore, of different qualities, and possess what may be termed
                    the diathermancy peculiar to each of the substances through which they have
                    passed. One of his screens was made of green glass, and he found that a piece of
                    alum transmitted only 1 per cent, of the heat which had passed through this
                    screen. Green glass and alum form, therefore, an antagonistic combination.</p>
                <p>These experiments suggest naturally a new analogy between dark heat and light
                    which could not fail to strike Melloni, and accordingly we soon find him
                    describing an experiment with the solar rays transmitted through green glass and
                    then intercepted by other <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n872/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0872-0841"/> media. They pass copiously through rock-salt, he
                    tells us, but feebly through alum, and hence Melloni concludes that there are
                    amongst the solar rays some which resemble those of terrestrial heat, and in
                    general that the differences observed between solar and terrestrial heat in the
                    transmission of rays are to be attributed merely to the mixture in different
                    proportions of these several species of rays. Λn instrument like the
                    thermo-multiplier could not of course remain a monopoly, and shortly after its
                    completion we find Professor James Forbes making use of it to prove the
                    polarization of heat as well as to extend our knowledge of refraction. The
                    brilliant researches of this experimentalist were, like those of Melloni,
                    crowned with the Rumford medal of the Royal Society. On September 2, 1839, Arago
                    communicated to the academy of sciences a letter by Melloni, who had found that
                    rock-salt acquires by being smoked the power of transmitting most easily heat of
                    low temperature, or dark heat. Forbes had discovered a similar property in mica
                    split by heat, and he now showed that rock-salt roughened and mica scratched
                    possess similar properties to blackened rock-salt. Melloni on his part took up
                    the subject of polarization, and decided in favour of the equal polarizability
                    of heat from different sources, a conclusion that did not then appear to Forbes
                    to be in conformity with his experiments. It is very instructive to notice the
                    loyalty which held both these experimentalists to the results of their
                    observations. While Melloni differs from Forbes with regard to polarization, he
                    will not allow the truth of a generalization proposed by Ampère, who had
                    endeavoured to explain on the theory of undulations the identity of light and
                    heat,—the difference of effect being dependent solely on the different
                    wave-lengths, those producing heat being larger than those giving rise to light.
                    Melloni admits that many phenomena may be explained by this hypothesis, but he
                    mentions some experiments in which he thinks that this theory will not hold. The
                    brilliant generalize!· from without has of course a different point of view from
                    the laborious experimentalist within. They are all worthy of scientific
                    honour—for it is by the seeming conflict, but in reality the united efforts of
                    workers such as these that the essential element of stability in the structure
                    of scientific knowledge is finally secured.</p>
