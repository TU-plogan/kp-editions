                    occupied with his work; he had no vices, however, and would always do a good
                    turn to an acquaintance. From childhood he showed a great inclination for the
                    arts of design, and he is said to have studied under his contemporary Masolino
                    da Panicale. In 1421, or perhaps 1423, he was enrolled in the guild of the
                    speziali (druggists) in Florence, in 1424 in the guild of painters. His first
                    attempts in painting were made in Florence, and then in Pisa. Next he went to
                    Rome, still no doubt very young; although the statement that he returned from
                    Rome to Florence, in 1420, when only eighteen or nineteen, seems incredible,
                    considering what were the works which he undertook in the papal city. These
                    included a series of frescos still extant in a chapel of the church of S.
                    Clemente, a Crucifixion, and scenes from the life of St Catherine and of St
                    Clement, or perhaps some other saint. Though much inferior to his later
                    productions, these paintings are, for naturalism and propriety of
                    representation, in advance of their time. Some critics, however, consider that
                    the design only, if even that, was furnished by Masaccio, and the execution left
                    to an inferior hand; this appears highly improbable, as Masaccio, at his early
                    age, can scarcely have held the position of a master laying out work for
                    subordinates; indeed Vasari says that Lubberly Tom was held in small esteem at
                    all times of his brief life. In the crucifixion subject the group of the Maries
                    is remarkable; the picture most generally admired is that of <pb break="no"

                    against and converting eight learned doctors. After returning to Florence,
                    Masaccio was chiefly occupied in painting in the church of the Carmine, and
                    especially in that “Brancacci cliapel” which he has rendered famous almost
                    beyond rivalry in the annals of painting.</p>
                <p>The chapel had been built early in the 15tlι century by Felice Michele di
                    Piuvichese Brancacci, a noble Florentine. Masaccio’s work in it began probably
                    in 1423, and continued at intervals until he finally quitted Florence in 1428.
                    There is a whole libraryshelf of discussion as to ∖yhat particular things were
                    done by Masaccio and what by Masolino, and long afterwards by Filippino Lippi,
                    in the Brancacci chapel, and also as to certain other paintings by Masaccio in
                    the Carmine. He began with a trial piece, a majestic figure of St Paul, not in
                    the chapel; this has perished. A monochrome of the Procession for the
                    Consecration of the Chapel, regarded as a wonderful example, for that early
                    period, of perspective and of grouping, has also disappeared, though there is
                    some suspicion that it might yet, with due pains and research, be recovered; it
                    contained portraits of Brunelleschi, Donatello, and many others. In the cloister
                    of the Carmine was discovered in recent years a portion of a fresco by Masaccio
                    representing a procession; but this, being in colours and not in monochrome,
                    does not appear to be the Brancacci procession. As regards the works in the
                    Brancacci chapel itself, the prevalent opinion now is that Masolino, who used to
                    be credited with a considerable portion of them, did either nothing, or at the
                    utmost the solitary compartment which represents St Peter restoring Tabitha to
                    life, and the same saint healing a cripple. The share which Filippino Lippi bore
                    in the work admits of little doubt; to him are due various items on which the
                    fame of Masaccio used principally to be based—as for instance the figure of St
                    Paul addressing Peter in prison, which Raphael partly appropriated; and hence it
                    may be observed that an eloquent and often-quoted outpouring of Sir Joshua
                    Reynolds in praise of Masaccio ought in great part to be transferred to
                    Filippino. What Masaccio really painted in the chapel appears with tolerable
                    certainty to be as follows, and is ample enough to sustain the high reputation
                    he has always enjoyed: —(1) The Temptation of Adam and Eve; (2) Peter and the
                    Tribute-Money; (3) The Expulsion from Eden; (4) Peter Preaching; (5) Peter
                    Baptizing; (6) Peter Almsgiving; (7) Peter and John Curing the Sick; (8) Peter
                    Restoring to Life the Son of King Theophilus of Antioch was begun by Masaccio,
                    including the separate incident of Peter Enthroned, but a large proportion is by
                    Filippino; (9) the double subject already allotted to Masolino may perhaps be by
                    Masaccio, and in that case it must have been one of the first in order of
                    execution. A few words may be given to these pictures individually. (1) The
                    Temptation shows a degree of appreciation of nude form, corresponding to the
                    feeling of the antique, such as was at that date unexampled in painting. (2) The
                    Tribute-Money, a full, harmonious, and expressive composition, contains a head
                    reputed to be the portrait of Masaccio himself, —one of the apostles, with full
                    locks, a solid resolute countenance, and a pointed beard. (3) The Expulsion was
                    so much admired by Raphael that, with comparatively slight modifications, he
                    adopted it as his own in one of the subjects of the Logge of the Vatican. (5)
                    Peter Baptizing contains some nude figures of strong naturalistic design; that
                    of the young man, prepared for the baptismal ceremony, who stands halfshivering
                    in the raw air, has always been a popular favourite, and an object of artistic
                    study. (8) The restoration of the young man to life has been open to much
                    discussion as to what precise subject was in view, but the most probable opinion
                    is that the legend of King Theophilus was intended.</p>
                <p>In 1427 Masaccio was living in Florence with his mother, then for the second time
                    a widow, and with his younger brother Giovanni, a painter of no distinction; he
                    possessed nothing but debts. In 1428 he was working, as we have seen, in the
                    Brancacci chapel. Before the end of that year he disappeared from Florence,
                    going, as it would appear, to Rome, to evade the importunities of creditors.
                    Immediately afterwards, in 1429, when his age was twenty-seven, he was reported
                    dead. Poisoning by jealous rivals in art was rumoured, but of this nothing is
                    known. The statement that several years afterwards, in 1443, he was buried in
                    the Florentine church of the Carmine, without any monument, seems to be
                    improbable, and to depend upon a confused account of the dates, which have now,
                    after long causing much bewilderment, been satisfactorily cleared up from extant
                    documents.</p>
                <p>It has been said that Masaccio introduced into painting the plastic boldness of
                    Donatello, and carried out the linear perspective of Paolo Uccello and
                    Brunelleschi (who had given him practical instruction), and he was also the
                    first painter who made some considerable advance in atmospheric perspective. He
                    was the first to make the architectural framework of his pictures correspond in
                    a reasonable way to the proportions of the figures. In the Brancacci chapel he
                    painted with extraordinary swiftness. The contours of the feet and articulations
                    in his pictures are imperfect ∙. and his most prominent device for giving
                    roundness to the figures (a point in which he made a great advance upon his
                    predecessors) was a somewhat mannered way of putting the high lights upon the
                    edges. His draperies were broad and easy, and his landscape details natural, and
                    superior to his age. In fact, he led the way in representing the objects of
                    nature correctly, with action, liveliness, and relief Soon after his death, his
                    work was recognized at its right value, and led to notable advances; and all the
                    greatest artists of Italy, through studying the Brancacci chapel, became his
                    champions and disciples.</p>
                <p>Of the works attributed to Masaccio in public or private galleries hardly any are
                    authentic. The one in the Florentine Academy, the Virgin and Child in the Lap of
                    St Anna, is an exception. The so-called portrait of Masaccio in the Uffizi
                    Gallery is more probably Filippino Lippi; and Filippino, or Botticelli, may be
                    the real author of the head, termed a Masaccio, in the London National
                    Gallery.</p>
