                    separated from the northern shores of Africa by the Mediterranean Sea. It
                    extends in a generally east and west direction from longitude 5° 2Γ W. to 36 10'
                    E. Its length from Gibraltar to its eastern extremity in Syria is about 2100
                    miles. Its breadth is very various, being 400 miles from the mouth of the Rhone
                    to the Algerian coast, 500 miles from the Gulf of Sidra to the entrance to the
                    Adriatic, and 250 miles from the mouth of the Nile to the south coast of Asia
                    Minor. From lhe very indented nature of its coasts, the general mass of the
                    water is much cut up into separate seas, which have long borne distinctive
                    names, as the Adriatic, the Aegean, the Sea of Marmora, the Black Sea, àc. T lie
                    area of the whole system, including the Sea of Azoff, is given by Admiral Smythe
                    as 1,149,287 square miles. If we deduct that of the Black Sea and Sea of Azoff,
                    172,506 square miles, we have for the area of the Mediterranean proper 976,781,
                    or, roughly speaking, a million of square miles.</p>
                <p>The Mediterranean is sharply divided into two great principal basins, the western
                    and the eastern or Levant <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0851-0820"/> basin. The western possesses a comparatively
                    smooth and unindented coast-line. It is bounded on the south by the coast of
                    Africa and the north coast of Sicily, and it is further enclosed by the coasts
                    of Spain, France, and Italy, which form a roughly arc-shaped coast-line. There
                    are comparatively few small islands in this basin, though some of the more
                    important large ones occur in it. The eastern basin is by far the larger of the
                    two, and extends from Cape Bon to the Syrian coast, including as important
                    branches the Adriatic and the Aegean. The latter is connected directly, through
                    the "Hellespont, the Sea of Marmora, and the Bosphorus, with the Black Sea. The
                    entrance to the western basin and to the sea generally from the ocean is through
                    the Straits of Gibraltar in 36° N. lat. If this parallel be drawn out through
                    the sea it will be found that the western basin lies almost wholly to the
                    northward, and the main body of the eastern one to the southward of it, the mean
                    latitude of the western basin being about 39° 30', and that of the eastern basin
                    35°. They communicate with each other by the channels separ ating Sicily from
                    Italy and from Africa. The former is known as the Strait of Messina, and is of
                    insignificant size, the latter is a wide channel apparently without any
                    distinctive name, and generally shallow. The greatest depth on the shallowest
                    ridge reaching from the African to the Sicilian coast is under 200 fathoms, and
                    agrees very closely with the corresponding depth at the entrance to the Straits
                    of Gibraltar.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Depth.—</hi> So far as is at present known, the maximum depth
                    is pretty nearly alike in the two basins, being 2040 fathoms in the western and
                    2150 fathoms in the eastern. Many lines of soundings have been run in the
                    Mediterranean for telegraph purposes, and they afford a very good idea of the
                    general configuration of the bottom. Between Marseilles and Algiers the depth
                    ranges generally from 1200 to 1600 fathoms; between Naples and Sardinia from
                    1500 to 2000; between Alexandria and Rhodes from 1200 to 1600; and between
                    Alexandria and Cyprus from 900 to 1100. The basin of the Mediterranean really
                    begins about 50 miles to the westward of Gibraltar. It is here that the
                    shallowest ridge stretches across from Africa to Spain; the maximum depth on it
                    is probably not more than 180, and certainly less than 200 fathoms. From this
                    ridge the bottom slopes quickly westward into the depths of the Atlantic, and
                    gently eastward into the Mediterranean. The depth nowhere reaches 1000 fathoms
                    until beyond Alboran Island, 120 miles east of Gibraltar. This is a small low
                    island separated from the mainland on all sides by water of more than 400
                    fathoms; it must therefore be considered an oceanic as distinguished from a
                    continental island.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Continental islands are those separated from the mainland by comparatively
                    shallow seas, generally under 100 fathoms.</p></note> Further to the north, and
                    off the coast of Valencia, we have the Balearic Islands,—namely, Majorca,
                    Minorca, Iviza, and Formentera. These also must be considered oceanic islands,
                    and indeed two groups of oceanic islands. Iviza and Formentera are isolated both
                    from the Spanish coast and from the other two islands by water of over 300
                    fathoms depth; Majorca and Minorca are connected by a bank with no more than 50
                    fathoms of water on it. Thirty miles east of Minorca there are more than 1400
                    fathoms; beyond that there are no soundings between the Baleares and the large
                    and important group of Corsica and Sardinia. These islands are continental,
                    being connected with the Italian mainland by the bank on which Elba occurs, and
                    which is covered by little over 50 fathoms of water. The Straits of Bonifacio,
                    which separate Corsica from Sardinia, are also quite shallow, so that Corsica
                    and Sardinia may be looked on as a secondary peninsula attached to the Tuscan
                    shore of Italy by a shallow bank not more than 15 or 20 miles broad, the deep
                    water coming close up all round it. Almost the same may be said of Sicily,
                    including the Malta group, but excluding the Lipari group, which is purely
                    volcanic. From Cape Passaro, in the south-east end of Sicily, a line can be
                    drawn connecting it with the town of Tripoli, and without passing over water of
                    more than 300 fathoms. As has already been said, the west end of Sicily is
                    connected with the coast of Tunis by a ridge in no part covered by more than 200
                    fathoms of water. Between these two ridges lies a small but comparatively deep
                    basin of 600 to 700 fathoms. At the western extremity of it lies the mountainous
                    island of Pantellaria. The bank on which Malta is situated stretches for nearly
                    100 miles in a southerly direction from Cape Passaro in Sicily. Opposite, on the
                    African shore, is a similar bank of much larger dimensions, on which are the
                    small islands Lampion and Lampedusa belonging to Italy. In the deep channel
                    between them and Malta is the small but lofty island Limosa. It is entirely
                    volcanic, with an extinct crater on its north-eastern side, and three smaller
                    ones to the southward. It resembles the Lipari group off the north coast of
                    Sicily, which rise abruptly out of deep water, being connected by no bank either
                    with the African or the Sicilian coasts. Some of the Lipari group are still
                    active, Stromboli and Vulcano being of the number. Off the south coast of
                    Sicily, and between it and the island of Pantellaria, occurs the famous Graham’s
                    shoal, the remains of what was for a few weeks an island.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>With regard to its appearance and
                    disappearance Admiral Smythe <hi rend="italic">{Mediterranean,</hi> p. Ill) says
                    :—“It seems that, as early as the 28th of June 1831, Captain Swinburne, in
                    passing nearly over the spot, felt several shocks of a sea-quake, proving that
                    the cause was then in operation; but on the 19th of the following July the
                    crater had accumulated to a few feet above the level of the sea, and was in
                    great activity, emitting vast volumes of steam, ashes, and scoriae. From that
                    time it gradually increased in all its dimensions till towards the end of August
                    its circumference was about 3240 feet and its height 107; then from October
                    various changes took place, and it entirely disappeared in December.” Since that
                    time it has changed considerably. In 1863 the least water on it was 15 feet. It
                    has two heads close together, and at the distance of about 20 yards all round
                    there are from 7 to 9 fathoms of water.</p></note></p>
                <p>The deepest water of the Mediterranean is found in its widest part between Malta
                    and Crete, and the deep water comes close up to the Italian and Greek coasts,
                    while on the African shore the water shoals more gradually. In the Strait of
                    Messina, close to Reggio, there are depths of over 500 fathoms, and similar
                    depths are found inside gulfs such as those of Taranto (nearly 1000 fathoms), of
                    Corinth, Kalamata, and others. Also all through the Aegean in its many bights
                    and channels very deep water is met with; in the Sea of Marmora we have 500
                    fathoms, and in the Black Sea over 1000 fathoms. All along the south coast of
                    Asia Minor the water is very deep, and the large islands of Cyprus and Crete are
                    both separated by very deep water from the mainland. If we take the eastern
                    basin, and run along its western and southern coasts from the mouth of the Po
                    along the shore of Italy, Sicily, and Africa to the mouth of the Nile, and even
                    further along the Syrian shore, we do not find a single off-lying island of any
                    importance except the Malta group, while all along the eastern and northern
                    coasts from Trieste to Asia Minor the coast is deeply indented, and the water
                    broken up by many large and important islands. These islands are grouped along
                    the west coast of Turkey and Greece, and irregularly throughout the Aegean. The
                    east coast of the Adriatic is studded with islands and inlets, and resembles in
                    this respect the Aegean; the west coast, on the other hand, is low, and the
                    water off it shallow, and there are few harbours. The Adriatic stretches in a
                    north-westerly direction for about 460 miles from its entrance between <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n852/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0852-0821"/> Cape Sta Maria cli Leuca and the island of Corfu
                    to the Venetian shore in the Gulf of Trieste. Its average width is about 100
                    miles. A ridge with little over 400 fathoms appears to run across its entrance.
                    Inside this the water reaches a depth of 765 fathoms, but shoals again rapidly
                    towards Pelagosa Island, from which to the northward, including quite two-thirds
                    of the sea, the depth is under 100 fathoms; indeed no part of the sea within 150
                    miles of its northern extremity is over 50 fathoms deep. There is authentic
                    historical evidence of the encroachment of the Italian shores on the Adriatic,
                    causing thereby a diminution of its area. As a consequence many towns which were
                    once thriving seaports are now many miles inland; thus Adria, which was a
                    station of the Roman fleet, is now 15 miles inland, and there are many similar
                    examples. The large rivers Po and Adige, which bring the drainage of the
                    southern slopes of the Alps to the sea, deliver large quantities of sediment in
                    the course of the year. The distribution of this mud is affected, not only by
                    its own weight tending to make it sink to the bottom, but also by the set of the
                    currents, which, running up the eastern coast, turn to the westward and
                    southward at the upper end of the sea, and so tend to distribute the river mud
                    along the bottom in the neighbourhoo 1 of the Italian coasts. The fact that
                    towns which were formerly seaports are now i il·and does not therefore
                    necessitate the assumption of a general rise of the land, it is merely a
                    reclamation by natural agencies of land from the sea at the expense of the
                    inland mountainous country. Precisely similar phenomena are observed in the
                    neighbourhood of the mouths of the Rhone and of the Nile.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">S])ecific Gravity, Currents, &lt;I.∙c. —</hi> On the specific
                    gravity Dr Carpenter reports many and interesting observations. In round
                    numbers, that of the surface-water of the Atlantic off the Straits of Gibraltar
                    is 1Ό260 to 1Ό27Ο, that of the western basin of the Mediterranean 1Ό280 to
                    1Ό290, and that of the eastern basin 1Ό290 to 1Ό300, while that of the Black Sea
                    is 1Ό120 to 1Ό140. It will thus be seen that the water of the Mediterranean
                    proper is very much salter than either the Atlantic on the west or the Black Sea
                    on the east, and this great density of the water affords a useful means of
                    recognizing it when investigating the interchange of waters which takes place at
                    the two extremities of the sea. Both the temperature and the specific gravity of
                    the water are evidences of the local climate. The great concentration of the
                    water shows how dry the atmosphere at the surface must be, and how insignificant
                    the contributions of fresh water. With regard to the balance existing between
                    the two factors, evaporation and precipitation, it would be impossible to give
                    figures with any claim to accuracy, but a rough estimate may be formed by taking
                    such data as Fischer has given. He puts the rainfall over the whole
                    Mediterranean drainage area at 759 ’ 4 millimetres, or almost exactly 30 inches.
                    If we remember that the average rainfall of the eastern slopes of Great Britain
                    is less than 30 inches, and that therefore this may be taken as the maximum
                    yearly supply to the North Sea, we may be sure that the Mediterranean does not
                    receive more than 30 inches of fresh water in the year. With regard to the rate
                    of evaporation over the area of the Mediterranean there is but very meagre
                    information, but wherever it has been observed it has been found to exceed the
                    rainfall, even as much as three times. Thus at Madrid it is 65 inches, or more
                    than four times the rainfall, at Rome 105 inches, and at Cairo 92 inches. It may
                    therefore without exaggeration be assumed that the evaporation is at least twice
                    as great as the precipitation. Putting the latter at 30 inches, we should have
                    60 inches for the yearly evaporation, and a balance of 30 inches evaporation
                    over precipitation. Were there no provision for making good this deficiency, the
                    level of the Mediterranean would sink until its surface was so far contracted as
                    to lose no more by evaporation than would be supplied by rain. This condition
                    would probably not be fulfilled before all the Aegean and Adriatic and the whole
                    of the western basin west of the island of Sardinia were laid dry, and what is
                    now the Mediterranean would be reduced to two “Dead Seas,” one between Sardinia
                    and Naples and the other between Africa and the mouth of the Adriatic. That the
                    level and the salinity of the Mediterranean remain constant is due to the supply
                    of water which enters at the Straits of Gibraltar. The currents in this passage
                    have frequently engaged attention both from their scientific and their nautical
                    interest. The most detailed investigation was that carried out by Captain Nares
                    and Dr Carpenter in II.M.S. “Shearwater” in the year 1871.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Proc. Roy. Soc.</hi>
                    (1872), xx. 97, 414.</p></note> From these investigations it appears that there
                    are usually two currents in the Straits at the same time, one superposed on the
                    other. Both are affected by tidal influence, but, after allowing for it, there
                    is still a balance of inflow’ in the upper and of outflow’ in the under current.
                    The waters of the two currents are sharply distinguished from each other by
                    their' salinity. Further, the upper current appears to affect by preference the
                    middle of the channel and the African coast, while the under current appears to
                    crop out at the surface on the Spanish coast. This distribution, however, is
                    much modified by the state of the tide, and it must be remembered that in such
                    places the surface separating the upper and under currents is rarely, if ever, a
                    horizontal plane. That there is a balance of outflow over inflow at the bottom
                    was well shown by the result of soundings as much as 200 miles north-west of the
                    entrance of the Straits, where, in a depth of 1560 fathoms, water of decided
                    Mediterranean origin was got from the bottom. There can be no doubt that this
                    outflow of warm and dense Mediterranean water is largely instrumental in causing
                    the comparatively very high bottom temperature in the eastern basin of the North
                    Atlantic.</p>
                <p>We have assumed that the balance of water removed by evaporation is 30 inches, or
                    2’5 feet. If we take the area of the Mediterranean to be 1,000,000 square miles,
                    we have the volume of water removed—</p>

                    rend="superscript"> 12</hi> cubic feet.</p>
                <p>This quantity of water has to be supplied from the Atlantic without raising the
                    total quantity of salt in the sea. We have seen that the only provision for the
                    removal of the surplus salt is the outward under current in the Straits. Hence
                    the inward upper current must be sufficient to replace the water lost both by
                    evaporation and by the outflow of the under current. We may take the Atlantic
                    water to contain 3’6 per cent, and the Mediterranean to contain 3’9 per cent, of
                    salt. In order that the under current may remove exactly as much salt as is
                    brought in by the upper one, their volumes must be in the inverse ratio of their
                    saline contents, or the volume of the upper current must be to that of the under
                    one in the ratio 39 :36 or 1000: 923; so that only 7'7 per cent, of the inflow
                    goes to replace the water removed by evaporation, while the remaining 92 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 3 per cent, replaces the water of the under current.
                    "We have then for the total volume of the inward current per annum y = lθθv =

                <p>The width of the Straits from Tarifa to Point Cires is 8 miles, or 48,000 feet,
                    and the average depth of the stream may fairly be taken as 100 fathoms; hence
                    the sectional area is in round numbers 29,000,000 square feet.</p>

                <p>Reducing this to miles per day, we find that if the above data are correct the
                    inflowing current at the Straits of Gibraltar ought to be equivalent to a
                    current 8 miles wide, 100 fathoms deep, and running with the uniform velocity of
                    18 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 3 miles in twenty-four hours. As the currents
                    are reversed with the tides this is the balance of inflow over outflow in the
                    upper current. It is worthy of remark that the flood tide runs to the westward
                    at the surface and the ebb to the eastward. The following table of tides at
                    places inside and outside the Straits will show that the mere differences of
                    level due to the different tidal ranges at adjacent localities are sufficient to
                    cause strong local currents.</p>

                <p>A similar phenomenon is witnessed at the other end of the sea. Here the fresher
                    waters of the Black Sea rush in through the narrow channel of the Dardanelles,
                    causing a surface inflow of comparatively fresh water, while there is an outflow
                    below of denser Mediterranean water. The dimensions of the Straits are too small
                    to make the phenomenon of any importance for the supply of the Mediterranean.
                    The conditions both in the Dardanelles and in the Bosphorus were examined very
                    carefully in the year 1872 by Captain Wharton, R.N., of H.M.S. “Shearwater,” and
                    his results are published in an interesting report to the admiralty, of that
                    date. It is remarkable that the comparatively fresh water of the Black Sea
                    persists without sensible mixture through the Sea of Marmora and into the
                    Dardanelles, while there is constantly a current of Mediterranean water running
                    underneath, and the depth in the two channels is only from 30 to 50 fathoms.
                    There can be little doubt that the saltness of the Black Sea ∙is due wholly to
                    the return current of Mediterranean water entering through the Bosphorus. Were
                    the exit of the Black Sea a channel with sufficient fall to bring the surface of
                    the Sea of Marmora below the level of the highest part of its bottom, so that no
                    return current could take place, the waters of the Black Sea would be fresh.</p>
                <p>In the body of the sea the rise and fall are much less than at any of the places
                    in the above table. At Algiers a self-recording tide gauge was set up by Aimé,
                    and from its records he deduced a rise and fall of 88 millim. (say 3⅛ in.) at
                    springs and half that amount at neaps, a fluctuation which would escape ordinary
                    observation, as it would be masked by the effects of atmospheric disturbances.
                    At Venice and in the upper reaches of the Adriatic, the true lunisolar tide
                    seems to be more accentuated than in other parts; but here also its effects are
                    subordinate to those of the wind. In summer the Mediterranean is within the
                    northern limit of the north-east trade wind; consequently, throughout a great
                    part of the year, the winds are tolerably constant in direction; and, blowing as
                    they do over large areas of water, they are instrumental in moving large masses
                    of it from one point to another, and so producing streams and currents.</p>
                <p>The effect of wind on a surface of water is twofold: it produces the rhythmic
                    motion of waves and the motion of translation of currents. Besides the motion
                    produced by the direct action of the wind on the surface-water, there are
                    currents due in the first instance to the accumulation of water produced by a
                    wind which has been blowing constantly in one direction. The phenomenon of an
                    abnormally high tidal rise with a gale of wind blowing on shore is one with
                    which inhabitants of the British Islands are familiar. It is also a matter of
                    frequent observation that, for instance, a south-west gale which exaggerates the
                    height of high water on the western coasts of Britain reduces it on the east
                    coasts. It blov.’s the water on the west coast and off the east coast, so that
                    the difference in the high-water levels on the two coasts is very pronounced.
                    Supposing free communication were quickly made between the two coasts, a current
                    would be the result, and its violence would be much greater than would be due to
                    the local action of the wind on its surface. In the Mediterranean the winds blow
                    during a great portion of the year very constantly from one direction or
                    another, and generally from north and east. The extent of the sea is so great
                    that the slope produced by the transference of the surface water constantly in
                    one direction might have a sine or arc capable of being measured in feet and
                    inches when the radius is as much as 200 miles long. Thus at Port Mahon, in the
                    island of Minorca, according to the <hi rend="italic">Admiralty Sailing
                    Directions,</hi> the water rises and falls according to the direction of the
                    wind. With wind from south-east or south-west the water rises, but from
                    northwest or north-east it falls. When northerly or northwesterly winds prevail,
                    and this is the case for two-thirds of the year, a strong current sets to the
                    south-west off Ayre Island, which is reversed in seasons when south-westerly
                    winds prevail. This current is due to the water escaping round the end of
                    Minorca having been driven southward so as to raise a head on the north coasts
                    of the island. Similarly in the Faro or Strait of Messina the currents, of which
                    the famous Scylla and Charybdis are swirls or eddies, are the evidence of a
                    tendency towards equalizing the levels of the eastern extremity of the western
                    basin and of the western extremity of the eastern basin. In addition to this
                    peculiarity of position with reference to the two basins, it has been found that
                    there is a very strong purely tidal influence at work which alone produces an
                    alteration in the direction of the currents, and thus adds to the confusion of
                    the waters. At Capo di Faro the rise is scarcely perceptible, at Messina it may
                    attain a maximum of 10 to 13 inches. In the Straits of Bonifacio, between
                    Corsica and Sardinia, the currents follow entirely the direction of the
                    prevailing winds, and are at times very rapid. In the channel between Sicily and
                    the African coast the currents also follow the winds. In long periods of calm
                    weather a steady easterly set is observed, no doubt a prolongation or
                    reproduction of the Gibraltar current.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Temperature.—</hi> Nothing whatever was known of the
                    temperature of the deep water of the Mediterranean until Saussure extended to it
                    his classical investigation into that of the Swiss lakes. In October 1780 he
                    sank his thermometer to a depth of 160 fathoms off Genoa and of 320 fathoms off
                    Nice, and at both depths he found the temperature of the water to be 55° ∙8 F.
                    These observations have a special value, for, owing to Saussure’s method of
                    experimenting, his results were not affected by the pressure obtaining at great
                    depths in the sea. Fifty years elapsed before any similar experiments were made,
                    when D’Urville, in the “Astrolabe,’ made a few observations at the beginning and
                    the end of his famous expedition. There is some uncertainty about his
                    observations in 182δ and 1829, and also about the later ones of Berard in 1831,

                    critically discussed all the older deep-sea temperature observations, concludes,
                    from a comparison of their results with those obtained by Aimé with protected
                    instruments, that they were so protected, and admits their results into his
                    tables without correction. In the deep water to the northward of the Balearic
                    Islands D’Urville found in April 182 6 54° 5 F. in 270 fathoms, and in March
                    1829 54° ’ 7 at the same depth, and the same temperature (54° *7) in 530
                    fathoms. Berard, experimenting in the sea between the Balearic Islands and
                    Algeria, found the temperature of the deep water nearly a degree higher, namely
                    55° <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 4 F., in depths of 500 to 1000 fathoms.

                    experiments on the temperature of both surface and deeper water in the
                    neighbourhood of Algiers, and discusses them in connexion with those of other
                    observers with very great ability. He concludes from his own observations and
                    those of Berard that the uniform temperature at great depths is 54° '86.F. From
                    a consideration of the general climate of the Mediterranean, he comes to the
                    conclusion that the temperature in the deeper layers of the sea ought to be
                    lower than the annual mean of the surface, and that it ought to be not very
                    different from the mean surface temperature in the winter months. From
                    observations at Toulon and Algiers, he finds that at neither place does the
                    surface temperature fall below <hi rend="italic">50° F.,</hi> and that the mean
                    surface temperatures in the months December, January, February, March, and April
                    is at Toulon 53° Ό6 F. and at Algiers 56 <hi rend="superscript"> o-</hi> 84 F.
                    The mean of these two temperatures is 54 <hi rend="superscript"> o-</hi> 9 F.,
                    which is almost exactly what he finds to be the mean annual temperature of the
                    deepest water of the western basin. During the forty years which have elapsed
                    since Aimé made his experiments and speculations, further observations have only
                    tended to confirm his theory. It is true that the temperatures observed in the
                    many soundings which have been made of late years have not shown absolute
                    identity of temperature, and it is probable that the greater the refinement in
                    the instruments used the more decided will the local differences appear.
                    Especially it will be apparent that the bottom temperature varies with the
                    climate of the preceding winter, and the distribution of temperature varies much
                    with the prevalence of the winds. At the few stations where the temperature of
                    the sea-water and that of the air are regularly examined, it appears that the
                    water is generally for the greater part of the year warmer than the air, and in
                    winter considerably so. The existing observations, however, are too few to
                    justify any very definite statement on the subject. At Palermo the sea is warmer
                    than the air throughout the whole year with the exception of the months May and
                    June. In Algiers Aimé found but little difference; in autumn and winter the
                    water was slightly warmer, in spring and summer slightly colder, than the air.
                    In the eastern basin we have first Admiral Spratt’s observations in July 1815 in
                    Aegina Gulf. In all his experiments made previous to the year 1860 he determined
                    the temperature of the bottom water by taking that of the mud brought up in the
                    dredge. This is a very excellent method; in fact it is probably the best of all
                    methods if a sufficient quantity of mud be obtained. From 1860 he used
                    self-registering unprotected thermometers, which gave results necessarily too
                    high, and it is impossible to apply any reliable correction to them without
                    experimentally determining it on each thermometer which was used. By the first
                    method Admiral Spratt found 55°'5 F. at depths between 100 and 200 fathoms.</p>
                <p>From these observations it seemed reasonable to conclude, as Aimé had done, that
                    all over the Mediterranean a practically uniform temperature is found at all
                    depths greater than 100 or 200 fathoms, and that this temperature is 54° to 56°
                    F. In order thoroughly to investigate this matter, as well as the biological
                    conditions of the deep water of the Mediterranean, H.M.S. “Porcupine,” Captain
                    Calver, with Messrs Carpenter and Gwyn Jeffreys, visited the western basin of
                    the Mediterranean in the autumn of 1870. A large number of temperature
                    observations were made in the western basin near its southern coasts, and one
                    sounding with temperature observation in the eastern basin a short distance from
                    the Sicilian coast, the result of which was to confirm the conclusion arrived at
                    from earlier observations, that, however high the temperature of the surface may
                    be (and it may reach 90° F.), the water becomes rapidly cooler as we go below
                    the surface until we reach a depth of about 100 fathoms, where a temperature of
                    54° to 56° F. is found, and persists without sensible variation to the greatest
                    depths. The average of all the bottom temperatures in the western basin was
                    54°’88 F. Three soundings were made in the intermediate basin to the eastward of
                    Pantellaria in depths of 266, 390, and 445 fathoms, and in each case the bottom
                    temperature was found to be 56° ’ 5 F., or about a degree and a half warmer than
                    in the deeper western basin. This is precisely what might have been expected
                    from what we know of inland seas divided into several basins. In summer the
                    shallower basin has usually a higher temperature at the bottom than is found at
                    the same depth in the deeper one. Only one observation was made in the eastern
                    basin, namely off Cape Passai o, in 1743 fathoms, with a bottom temperature of
                    56° <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 0 F. That the temperature in this basin
                    should be lower than in the Pantellaria basin is due to its greater depth, and
                    that it should be higher than is found in the western basin is due to its lower
                    latitude. These researches were further prosecuted in the autumn of 1871 in the
                    “Shearwater,” Captain Nares, accompanied by Dr Carpenter. At two stations in the
                    eastern basin “serial temperatures” were taken. At the first, 35° 54' N. lat.,
                    16° 23' E. long., depth 1650 fathoms, the bottom temperature was 56°, or the
                    same as had been observed the year before in 1743 fathoms; at the second, 32°
                    17⅜' N. lat., 26° 44' E. long., depth 1970 fathoms, the bottom temperature was
                    56° <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7, and the temperature at all intermediate
                    depths was much higher than at the first station. The mean temperature of the
                    water from the surface to a depth of 200 fathoms was, at the first station,
                    63°'75 F., and + the second 66° <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 78 F., or three
                    degrees higher. At the first station all the temperatures down to 100 fathoms
                    are higher than were observed in 1870 in the western basin, but it must be
                    remembered that temperature observations made in different years cannot with
                    justice be closely compared, as the climates of the two years are sure to differ
                    considerably, and in the present case the difference in climate between the
                    summers of 1870 and 1871 appeal’s to have been very considerable.</p>
                <p>In the autumn of 1881 a very interesting series of observations were made by
                    Captain Magnaghi, hydrographer of the Italian navy, and Professor Giglioli, on
                    board the Italian surveying ship “Washington,” in that part of the western basin
                    which is enclosed between the islands Corsica and Sardinia on the one side and
                    the Italian coasts on the other. It is here that the deepest water of the
                    western baiin was found; and, apart from the great interest attaching to the
                    physical results obtained, the collections made with the dredge in the
                    comparatively lifeless waters were of the very highest importance, showing, as
                    they did, a practical identity in the abyssal fauna with that of the open ocean.
                    This is the more remarkable as we have hitherto been accustomed to consider the
                    similarity in the fauna of portions of the ocean remotely distant from each
                    other as being due to the likeness of their temperatures. In the Mediterranean,
                    however, the bottom temperature is quite 20° F. higher than is found in great
                    depths anywhere in the open ocean.</p>
                <p>For determining the temperature of the deep water Captain Magnaghi used the
                    half-turn reversing thermometer of Negretti and Zambra, which in itself is a
                    very beautiful instrument. The mechanical arrangement, however, for reversing,
                    even as improved by Magnaghi, was not so satisfactory, and from certain
                    irregularities in the temperature observations reported the writer is inclined
                    to think that some of the remarkable results obtained, for instance on the 11th
                    August, are due to this instrumental imperfection. On that day the water at 70
                    metres was found to have a temperature of 25°Ί C., while that at 50 metres was
                    20°'1 C., and that at 90 metres was 16°’7 C. The results obtained in the deep
                    water are no doubt quite reliable, for the temperature is so uniform that a few
                    fathoms more or less in the depth at which it turned would make no difference in
                    the temperature registered. In the more northern parts of this portion of the
                    western basin, off the coast of Corsica, we find a practically uniform
                    temperature from 250 metres down to the bottom in 2800 metres, the mean bottom
                    temperature being 55°’96 F. Further to the south the temperature of the abyssal
                    water appears to be distinctly higher. Thus between the south end of Sardinia
                    and the Bay of Naples, in the deepest water, the practical uniformity of
                    temperature is not reached until a depth of 1000 metres has been passed, and it
                    is there 56°’7 F. It is unfortunate that we do not know what the bottom
                    temperature in other parts of the Mediterranean was. In this summer of 1881 it
                    was quite one degree higher than that observed by Dr Carpenter in 1870.</p>
                <p>The great value of such a volume of water as an equalizer of temperature on its
                    shores must be apparent, though in this respect it is inferior to the Atlantic
                    Ocean in its immediate neighbourhood. Places on the west coast of Spain and
                    Portugal have a much higher winter temperature and lower summer temperature than
                    places in the same latitude in Italy. The reason of this is simple: on the
                    Atlantic coast the principal winds in winter are from the south-west, and have a
                    warming effect, while in summer the source of the northeast trade wind is pushed
                    back into the Bay of Biscay, cansing in this season constant northerly winds
                    along the coast of Portugal. '1 he winds of the Mediterranean have no seas of
                    remote latitudes to draw on either for heating or cooling purposes, though the
                    sandy deserts of Africa which bound its southern coasts have at certain seasons
                    a very decided influence on the climate, fhe tempering action of the sea does
                    not extend very far inland, as is evident from the climate of inland towns in
                    Italy. As the Mediteιτanean shores have so much importance as health-ι esorts,
                    the data ^presented in the following table are of interest. They are taken

                <p>To the student of the physical conditions of the sea the Mediterranean possesses
                    a very high interest; its size is such as to entitle it to rank among oceans,
                    while it is so completely cut off from the remaining world of water that it
                    presents us with a type which is purely local, and one might almost say
                    provincial. (J. Y. B. )</p>
