                    on the eastern shore of a circular bay 120 nautical miles in circumference, 14°
                    36' N. lat. and 120° 52' E. long. The country around the bay is more or less
                    flat in character, and in the dry season almost bare of vegetation, so that,
                    excepting the Mafonso and Matéo mountains behind Manila, and the chains of
                    mountains running north and south of the entrance to the bay, there is really
                    nothing attractive about the harbour. It is unsafe in the north-east and
                    south-west monsoons, and vessels over 300 tons have to run for shelter to the
                    naval port of Cavité, the smaller craft finding a safe anchorage behind a
                    breakwater facing the mouth of the Pasig. A new breakwater, however, was
                    commenced in 1880 for large vessels. This river Pasig, which is about 14 miles
                    long, is fed by an inland lake called the Laguna de Bayo, and on its way into
                    the harbour it divides Manila into two parts. On its northern bank are large
                    commercial warehouses, a bazaar occupied chiefly by Chinese, known as the
                    Escolta, and trending eastwards an extensive suburb of native dwellings
                    extending some miles up the Pasig. Beyond the Escolta lie Binondo, the business
                    part of Manila, and San Miguel, the fashion able quarter where Spaniards and
                    foreigners have their residence, and where since the earthquake of 1880 two
                    palaces <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n511/mode/1up"

                    captain-general and for the admiral of the fleet. There are numerous churches
                    and barracks in this part of the town, and several public buildings, of which
                    the following may be mentioned,—the hospital of St Lazarus, the <hi
                    rend="italic">garn,ero</hi> or large military storehouse, and the famous cigar
                    factory, covering a space of about 6 acres, and employing daily 10,000 women.
                    Beyond and blending as it were with Binondo are villages in which the governor
                    has his country house, and where Europeans have bhilt pretty villa residences. A
                    stone bridge and a new suspension bridge connect Binondo or modern Manila with
                    the suburb opposite and the old fort of St Iago, situated on the south bank and
                    about a mile from the mouth of the Pasig. Within the fort wall lies the old
                    city, or, as it is commonly called, the Plaza de Manila. It is approached by
                    several gates—the principal being the Entrada, near which stands the
                    custom-house. It has several squares, and the streets running at right angles
                    with each other are fairly broad and clean, but, as no trade is carried on in
                    this part of the town, they are dull by day, and, as only oil lamps are used,
                    gloomy by night. The public edifices, such as the governor’s palace, the
                    town-hall, and the cathedral, are in a large square, in the centre of which is a
                    statue of Charles IV. surrounded by a garden of flowers. To these may be added
                    the civil and military hospitals, the mint and museum, the university and the
                    academy of arts, the arsenal, the prison, and numerous barracks, convents, and
                    monasteries. Beyond the walls is the <hi rend="italic">calzada</hi> or
                    esplanade, with a small <hi rend="italic">paseo</hi> or promenade facing the
                    bay, where three or four military bands play twice a week to a large concourse
                    of people. This forms the chief out-door attraction for the élite of Manila.
                    There are two theatres—occasionally visited by European companies; but there is
                    a want of the cafés and bull fights so associated with Spanish life. Evening
                    receptions are given by the Spaniards, where cards and music serve to while away
                    the time, and the well-to-do <hi rend="italic">Tagalo,</hi> besides imitating
                    his masters in all their amusements, has another to which he is passionately
                    addicted, viz., cockfighting. This is under Government control, and in town can
                    only be held in licensed cockpits, which in 1878 yielded above £33,000 to the
                    revenue. The native officials may sometimes be a little officious and
                    overbearing; but the natives generally, especially those out of Manila, are as
                    hospitable to the stranger as the Spaniard.</p>
                <p>The population in the walled town, inclusive of the garrison, is given in the
                    consular reports for 1880 as 12,000, and that of Binondo and the suburbs as
                    250,000 to 300,000. In 1842 the total was rather more than 150,000. ·</p>
                <p>The climate is healthy, and though hot is not unbearably so, the mean temperature
                    being about 82° ∙6 Fahr. The hot season prevails from March to the end of June;
                    the rest of the year may be said to be showery and stormy. The chief climatic
                    drawbacks to a residence in Manila are hurricanes, earthquakes, and fearful
                    thunderstorms. Great damage was done to property by a tornado of exceptional
                    severity in October 1882.</p>
                <p>The cemetery of Manila is well suited for a hot climate and the backward
                    condition of its sanitary arrangements. It is a large circular area, surrounded
                    by an outer and an inner wall, with horizontal recesses between them placed one
                    above another in tiers. On the arrival of a body for sepulture it is taken out
                    of its coffin and put into one of these recesses; quicklime is then spread upon
                    it and the mouth of the recess bricked up. If the recess is the property of the
                    relatives of the dead, the body remains undisturbed for ever. If otherwise, it
                    remains until the recess is absolutely required for another inmate, when the
                    bones, the only remains left of the deceased, are collected and carefully
                    deposited in a large hollow or fosse kept for that purpose.</p>
                <p>For two centuries after the Spanish settlement the trade of Manila with the
                    Western world was carried on <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Acapulco and Mexico; and
                    it was not till 1764 that even the Spanish vessels began to come round by the
                    Cape. The port, however, was opened with some restrictions to foreign vessels in
                    1789; permission for the establishment of an English commercial house was
                    granted in 1809; the same liberty was before long extended to other
                    nationalities; and in 1834 the privileges of the Royal Company of the
                    Philippines expired and left the commercial movement to its natural tendencies.
                    Since that time the trade of Manila has greatly increased. While in 1840 the
                    port was entered by 187 vessels with a burden of about 57,000 tons, the
                    corresponding figures for 1881 are, including 182 steamers, 317 vessels
                    (British, 118; Spanish, 95; German, 38), with a burden of 244,000 tons. Manila
                    hemp <hi rend="italic">(abaca),</hi> sugar, cigars, and coffee are the chief
                    articles of export; and sapan wood, mother of pearl, and gum are regular though
                    secondary items. The quantity of hemp shipped at Manila has increased from
                    528,206 picul’s (1 picul = 139 lb) in 1877 to 662,886 in 1881, and in the same
                    period the quantity of sugar has risen from 1,215,066 piculs to 2,001,310.
                    Britain and the United States are the great markets for both. The average number
                    of cigars exported is 92,620,000, the greater proportion going to Singapore and
                    China. The total value of the exports was £5,460,000 in 1881, against £2,679,000
                    in 1864; and a corresponding increase has taken place in the imports.</p>
                <p>Telegraphic communication between Manila and Hong-Kong was established in
                    1880.</p>
