                    external payments whatever. Now, however, under Philip III. and Philip IV., the
                    exactions, heavy in themselves, were made more oppressive by being farmed out to
                    contractors, while the sums raised were usually conveyed to Spain and spent on
                    purposes often having no connexion with Naples. Meantime the industrial classes
                    were scourged by the excesses of the nobility and the lawlessness of banditti.
                    At length, at the end of 1646, the duke of Arcos demanded a million ducats in
                    gold; and it was resolved after much opposition to raise it from fruit, one of
                    the most important articles of food to a southern people. Petitions delayed but
                    did not remove the tax; on June 6 a toll-house was actually blowιi up, but the
                    viceroy did not give way. The discontent was fomented by Genovino, who had been
                    chosen “elect of the people” (that is, of the district of the city where the
                    common people had the right of? voting) in 1619 by the duke of Osuna’s
                    influence, and had been employed by him as an agitator. After the duke’s recall
                    he had been long in prison, and then returned to Naples and became a priest. He
                    selected for his purpose Masaniello, a fisherman of Naples, then twenty-seven
                    years old, well built, intelligent, and very popular in the city. He was so
                    poor, we are told, that he was usually obliged to content himself with selling
                    paper to wrap up the fish that others sold. He had special cause too for hatred
                    to the taxes: his wife had tried to smuggle a bag of flour into the city as an
                    infant; she had been imprisoned, and his scanty possessions had barely sufficed
                    to pay her fine. The temporary success of a rising at Palermo had stirred the
                    people to a sense of their power, and very little was wanted to produce an
                    explosion. On July 16, the feast of S. Maria del Carmine, it was customary to
                    make a sort of castle which was defended by one body of youths armed with sticks
                    and stormed by another. Masaniello had been chosen captain of one of these
                    parties, and got together four hundred young men, with whom he had already
                    raised the cry of “Down with the taxes” when the crisis was precipitated by a
                    quarrel. On Sunday the 7th a dispute arose in the market (on which Masaniello’s
                    house looked) whether the gardeners or the buyers of their <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n636/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0636-0607"/> fruit should pay the tax. Finally the owner of
                    the fruit (said to have been a kinsman of Masaniello) upset his basket, saying
                    he would sooner let the people have it for nothing than pay the tax. Masaniello
                    came up; the tax collectors were pelted with fruit and then with stones, and the
                    toll-house was burnt with cries of—“The king of Spain and plenty; down with
                    misgovernment and taxes.” The viceroy attempted without effect to quiet the
                    people by promises; his carriage was surrounded, and he escaped with difficulty
                    to St Elmo. Meanwhile the populace broke open the prisons, and released all
                    charged with offences against the customs. In the evening, by advice of
                    Genovino, a meeting elected officere, and decided on their demands. Masaniello
                    was chosen captain, with one Perrone, who had been in the service of Maddaloni,
                    and at another time a captain of banditti, as his lieutenant. Next day the
                    people went in search of arms; many houses of persons who had made themselves
                    obnoxious to the people, and especially of tax farmers, were sacked, and their
                    contents burnt; but most of the historians of the time state that there were few
                    attempts to appropriate anything, and those few were immediately punished. The
                    duke of Maddaloni, a man of lawless life, but a decided opponent of the viceroy,
                    was selected as a likely intermediary with the people. The latter demanded the
                    original charter granted by Charles V., which was said to have wrongfully come
                    into the viceroy’s own hands, the removal of all taxes imposed since Charles
                    V.’s death, and that the elect of the people should have as many votes as the
                    representatives of the nobles. Λll was granted; but the viceroy made
                    entrenchments to guard the approaches to the castle. Next day the sacking of tax
                    farmers’ houses went on. The viceroy attempted to cheat the people by sending
                    documents simply drawn up by himself; and then their rage burst out. Maddaloni
                    was seized and given into custody, but escaped in the night by Perrone’s
                    connivance. The people were summoned to arms. The cardinal archbishop
                    Filomarino, who did his best to mediate between the parties all through, came to
                    them from the viceroy, and it was arranged that he should bring them the
                    document. The seizure of arms went on, and Masaniello marching out of the city
                    disarmed and took prisoners four hundred soldiers, while another body of people
                    did the same with six hundred German mercenaries. On Wednesday Perrone made his
                    appearance at the head of three hundred bandits partly mounted, and fired upon
                    Masaniello, but without injuring him. The people rushed upon them, and they were
                    killed almost without exception. Some confessed to having been instigated by
                    Maddaloni, and a price was set upon his head. His brother Giuseppe Caraffa was
                    found in a monastery and killed, and his head and foot were set upon pikes. A
                    new elect of the people was chosen, Arpaia, who had been a partisan of
                    Genovino’s in the duke of Osuna’s time, and had been condemned to the galleys.
                    On Thursday Maddaloni’s house was plundered and his property placed in a heap in
                    the market under guard. The castle being short of provisions, Masaniello sent
                    some as a present to the viceroy. The Neapolitan galleys, under Gianettino
                    Doria, arrived the same day, and Masaniello refused permission to land or to
                    come nearer than a mile to the shore, but sent provisions on board. In fact he
                    was now undisputed master of the city, not only organizing the military force in
                    it with surprising ability, but dispensing strict though severe justice. Often
                    he sat inside his little house on the market, sword or loaded gun in hand, while
                    petitions and complaints were handed to him on the end of a pike through the
                    window; yet he still went barefoot, dressed as a simple fisherman. The people
                    having assembled consulted together on the terms of agreement; it was settled by
                    the advice of Genovino that Masaniello should show the articles agreed on to the
                    duke at the palace (he would not risk himself in the castle), and that the
                    viceroy should afterwards swear to them in the cathedral. Towards evening the
                    procession set out, Masaniello in a dress of cloth of silver pressed upon him by
                    the archbishop. An immense concourse of armed men, estimated at one hundred and
                    forty thousand, lined the way or accompanied him. Before them went a trumpet
                    proclaiming <hi rend="italic">Viva</hi><hi rend="italic">il rè</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">di Spagna ed</hi><hi rend="italic">il</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fedelissimo popolo di Napoli.</hi> Before entering the palace he exhibited the
                    charter brought by the archbishop, and charged them not to lay down their arms
                    till they had received the confirmation of their rights from the king of Spain.
                    “If I do not return in an hour,” he added, “wreck the city.” He was received by
                    the viceroy as an equal. All the conditions were agreed to, the chief being—that
                    the elect of the people should have as many votes as the nobles; that all taxes
                    should be removed except those already existing in Charles V.’s time; that the
                    viceroy should get the articles ratified by the king within three months; that
                    no punishment should be inflicted on those who had taken part in the rising; and
                    that the people should keep their arms till the ratification. On the Friday
                    Masaniello dismissed most of his followers to their work, keeping a patrol of
                    four men and a corporal in each street. Next day the ceremony in the cathedral
                    took place; the duke of Canjano read the articles, Masaniello meanwhile
                    correcting and explaining, and the viceroy solemnly swore to observe them. Then
                    Masaniello tore off his rich dress; it was time, he said, to return to his fish.
                    And indeed from this time began his ruin. For a week the care of a city, with
                    hundreds of thousands of inhabitants, had rested upon him; he had been general,
                    judge, legislator, and during the whole time he had hardly slept or eaten, the
                    latter through dread of poison; no wonder if the fisherman’s brain reeled under
                    all this. His justice had been severe, but hitherto it had struck men who
                    deserved punishment, the oppressor, the robber, the hired cut-throat; henceforth
                    every one who ventured to contradict him risked his life, and the only man who
                    could persuade him to mercy was the good archbishop. Five hundred in all, it is
                    said, were put to death by his order; though it is probable that they were few
                    compared to the lives taken a short time afterwards by the viceroy in defiance
                    of his plighted word. Next day in fact the duke set to work; Genovino was made
                    president of the chamber in order to detach him from Masaniello, for which he
                    was the more ready as Masaniello was no longer the tool he wanted. Genovino had
                    already prevented the demand for the surrender of St Elmo, which could easily
                    have been enforced, as the fort was not provisioned. Carlo and Salvatore Cataneo
                    with two others offered to the viceroy to murder Masaniello, and he welcomed
                    their services. On Sunday Masaniello gave orders for laying down arms and
                    submitting to the viceroy, which were obeyed in some quarters of the city before
                    they could be recalled. He tried in vain to get the viceroy to accompany him to
                    Posilippo, where he drank deeply, and in reckless extravagance threw gold into
                    the water to be dived for. Next day his violence continued; he struck his
                    followers in the street, and condemned several of his officers to death for not
                    immediately executing his orders. He cut out the head from a picture of
                    Maddaloni and set it on a pike. Vitale his secretary, sent on a message to the
                    viceroy, talked of his intention to raise a million ducats for the king by means
                    of forced gifts from the rich; Vitale was detained in the castle on some
                    pretext, and on leaving next morning was killed by the people of the quarter,
                    who had returned to their allegiance. On Tuesday the 16th, the feast of S. Maria
                    del Carmine, Masaniello went up into the pulpit, and in a wild harangue
                    recapitulated his services. He knew, ho <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n637/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0637-0608"/> said, his death was near at hand; then tearing
                    open his dress lie showed his body emaciated by fatigue and want of food. After
                    some more wild talk he was disarmed and confined in a cell in the monastery.
                    There the quiet seems to have restored him; but his assassins soon broke in; he
                    turned to meet them; five shots were at once fired, and he fell dead. His head
                    was cut off and carried through the streets, while his body was dragged about
                    for a while and then buried outside the city. Next day some boys went and dug up
                    the body, washed it, and took the head from the guard in charge of' it. The
                    Neapolitans forgot the excesses of the last few days, and only remembered the
                    leader who had won them their great victory. People plucked out his hairs and
                    preserved them as relics, some even prayed to him as a saint. All the priests of
                    the city officiated at the funeral, and even the viceroy was represented by
                    eight of his pages. <hi rend="smallcaps">(g. h. b.)</hi></p>
                <p>Μ AS AY A, a town in Nicaragua, Central America, on the east side of the Lake of
                    Masaya, about 55 miles southeast of Managua, and 25 miles north-west of Granada.
                    The population, mostly of Indian blood, is estimated at 15,000 or 18,000; but,
                    as nearly every house has its orchard or garden, the buildings are spread over a
                    much larger area than this would suggest. Previous to 1871, when a steampump was
                    Greeted, all the water required had to be carried from the lake, which lies 340
                    feet below the level of the town. The volcano of Masaya on the opposite side of
                    the lake was active at the time of the conquest of Nicaragua in 1522, and the
                    conquerors, thinking the lava they saw was gold, had themselves lowered into the
                    crater at the risk of their lives; it had a great eruption in 1670, and began to
                    smoke again in 1860.</p>
