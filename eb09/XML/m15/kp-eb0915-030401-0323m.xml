                    queen of France for the last thirty years of his reign, was born in a prison at
                    Niort on November 27, 1635. Her father Constant d’Aubigné, was the son of
                    Agrippa d’Aubigné, the famous friend and general of Henry IV., and had been
                    imprisoned as a Huguenot malcontent, but her mother, a fervent Catholic, had the
                    child baptized in her religion, her sponsors being the Due de la Rochefoucauld,
                    father of the author of the <hi rend="italic">Maxims,</hi> and the Comtesse de
                    Neuillant. In 1639 Constant d’Aubigné was released from prison and took all his
                    family with him to Martinique, where he died in 1645, after having lost what
                    fortune remained to him at cards. Madame d’Aubigné returned to France, and from
                    sheer poverty unwillingly yielded her daughter to her sister-in-law, Madame de
                    Villette, who made the child very happy, but, unfortunately for her, converted
                    or pretended to convert her to Protestantism. When this was known, an order of
                    state was issued that she should be entrusted to Madame de Neuillant, her
                    godmother. Every means, every indignity even, was now used to convert her back
                    to Catholicism, but at the last she only yielded on the condition that she need
                    not believe that the soul of Madame de Villette was lost. Once reconverted, she
                    was neglected, and sent home to live with her mother, who had only a small
                    pension of 200 livres a year, which ceased on her death in 1650. The Chevalier
                    de Meré, a man of some literary distinction, who had made her acquaintance at
                    Madame de Neuillant’s, discovered her penniless condition, and introduced his
                    “young Indian,” as he called her, to Scarron, the famous wit and comic writer,
                    at whose house all the literary society of the day assembled. The wit, who was
                    of good legal family, and had a kind heart, took a fancy to the friendless girl,
                    and offered either to pay for her admission to a convent, or, though he was
                    deformed and an invalid, to marry her himself. She accepted his offer of
                    marriage, and became Madame Scarron in 1651. For nine years she was not only his
                    most faithful nurse, but an attraction to his house, where she tried to bridle
                    the licence of the conversation of the time. On the death of Scarron in 1660,
                    Anne of Austria continued his pension to his widow, and even increased it to
                    2000 livres a year, which enabled her to entertain and frequent the literary
                    society her husband had made her acquainted with; but on the queen-mother’s
                    death in 1666 the king, in spite of all the efforts of her friends, refused to
                    continue her pension, and she prepared to leave Paris for Lisi on as lady
                    attendant to the queen of Portugal But before she started, she met Madame de
                    Montespan, who was already, though not avowedly, the king’s mistress, at the
                    Hôtel d’Albret, and the lady in question took such a fancy to her that she
                    obtained the continuance of her pension, which put off for ever the question of
                    going to Portugal Madame de Montespan did yet more for her, for when, in 1669,
                    her first child by the king was born Madame Scarron was established with a large
                    income and a large staff of servants at Vaugirard to bring up the king’s
                    children in secrecy as they were born. In 1674 the king determined to have his
                    children at court, and their governess, who had now made sufficient fortune to
                    buy the estate of Maintenon, accompanied them. The king had now many
                    opportunities of seeing Madame Scarron, and, though at first he was prejudiced
                    against her, her even temper showed so advantageously against the storms of
                    passion and jealousy exhibited by Madame de Montespan that she grew steadily in
                    his favour, and had in 1678 the gratification of having her estate at Maintenon
                    raised to a marquisate, and herself entitled Madame de Maintenon by the king
                    himself. Such favours brought down the fury of Madame de Montespan’s jealousy,
                    and Madame de Maintenon’s position was almost unendurable, until, in 1680, the
                    king severed their connexion by making the latter second lady in waiting to the
                    dauphiness, and soon after Madame de Montespan left the court. The new “amie”
                    used her influence on the side of decency, and the queen openly declared she had
                    never been so well treated as at this time, and eventually died in Madame de
                    Maintenon’s arms in 1683. The queen’s death opened the way to yet greater
                    advancement; in 1684 she was made first lady in waiting to the dauphiness, and
                    in the winter of 1685, or, Voltaire says, in January 1686, she was privately
                    married to the king by Harlay, archbishop of Paris, in the presence, it is
                    believed, of Père la Chaise, the king’s confessor, the Marquis de Montchevreuil,
                    the Chevalier de Forbin, and Bontemps. No written proof of the marriage is
                    extant, but that it took place is nevertheless certain. Her life during the
                    thirty years of her second married life must be studied from more than one side,
                    and can be so fully from her letters, which are masterpieces even of an age <pb

                    authentic examples are extant. As a wife she is wholly admirable; she had to
                    entertain a man who would not be amused, and had to submit to that terribly
                    strict court etiquette of absolute obedience to the king’s inclinations which
                    Saint-Simon so vividly describes, and yet be always cheerful, and never complain
                    of weariness or ill-health. Her political influence has probably been
                    overstated, but it was supreme in matters of detail. The ministers of the day
                    used to discuss and arrange all the business to be done with the king beforehand
                    with her, and it was all done in her cabinet and in her presence, but the king
                    in more important matters often chose not to consult her. Such mistakes as, for
                    instance, the replacing of Catinat by Villeroi may be attributed to her, but not
                    whole policies,—notably, according to Saint-Simon, not the policy with regard to
                    the Spanish succession. Even the revocation of the edict of Nantes and the
                    Dragonnades have been laid to her charge, but there can be no doubt that, in
                    spite of ardent Catholicism, she retained a liking for her father’s religion,
                    and opposed, if not very vigorously, the cruelties of the Dragonnades. She was
                    probably afraid to say much, or peril her great reputation for devotion, which
                    had in 1692 obtained for her from Innocent XII. the right of visitation over all
                    the convents in France. Where she deserves blame is in her use of her power for
                    personal patronage, as in compassing the promotions of Chamillart and Villeroi,
                    and the frequent assistance given to her brother Comte Charles d’Aubigné. Her
                    influence was on the whole a moderating and prudent force, and the king, when he
                    wanted her advice, used to say, “Qu’en pensez votre Solidité <hi rend="italic"
                    >1” or</hi> “Consultons la Raison.” Her social influence was not as great as it
                    might have been owing to her holding no recognized position at court, but it was
                    always exercised on the side of decency and morality, and it must not be
                    forgotten that from her former life she was intimate with the literary people of
                    the day, and never deserted her old friends. Side by side with this public life,
                    which wearied her with its shadowy power, occasionally crossed by a desire to be
                    recognized as queen, she passed a nobler and sweeter private existence as the
                    foundress of St Cyr. Madame de Maintenon was a born teacher; she had so won the
                    hearts of her first pupils that they preferred her to their own mother, and was
                    similarly successful later with the young and impetuous Duchesse de Bourgogne,
                    and she had always wished to establish a home for poor girls of good family
                    placed in such straits as she herself had experienced. As soon as her fortunes
                    began to mend she started a small home for poor girls at Ruel, which she
                    afterwards moved to Noisy, and which was the nucleus of the splendid institution
                    of St Cyr, which the king had endowed in 1686 at her request out of the funds of
                    the Abbey of St Denis. She was in her element there. She herself drew up the
                    rules of the institution; she examined every minute detail; she befriended her
                    pupils in every way; an‘d her heart often turned from the weariness of
                    Versailles or of Marly to her “little girls” at St Cyr. It was for the girls at
                    St Cyr that Racine wrote his <hi rend="italic">Esther</hi> and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Athalie,</hi> and it was because he managed the affairs of St Cyr
                    well that Chamillart became controller-general of the finances. The later years
                    of her power were marked by the promotion of her old pupils, the children of the
                    king and Madame de Montespan, to high dignity between the blood royal and the
                    peers of the realm, and it was doubtless under the influence of her dislike for
                    the Duc d’Orleans that the king drew up his will, leaving the personal care of
                    his successor to the Due de Maine, and hampering the Due d’Orleans by a council
                    of regency. On or even before her husband’s death she retired to St Cyr, and had
                    the chagrin of seeing all her plans for the advancement of the Due de Maine
                    overthrown by means of the parlement of Paris. However, the regent Orleans in no
                    way molested her, but on the contrary visited her at St Cyr, and continued her
                    pension of 48,000 livres. She spent her last years at St Cyr in perfect
                    seclusion, but an object of great interest to all visitors to France, who,
                    however, with the exception of Peter the Great, found it impossible to get an
                    audience with her. On April 15, 1719, she died, and was buried in the choir at
                    St Cyr, bequeathing her estate at Maintenon to her niece, the only daughter of
                    her brother Charles, and wife of the Maréchal de Noailles, to whose family it
                    still belongs. Such was the life of the extraordinary woman who kept till the
                    last the heart of Louis XIV., marked by a virtue almost amounting to prudery, in
                    strong contrast to the generations which preceded and followed her, by a love of
                    power, and a use of it which can indeed be excused by her early life, but which
                    was not exercised for the good of France, and by a religious devotion which was
                    narrow, if not violently fanatical, but sweetened throughout by her ardent love
                    for her “little girls,” whom she had saved from the difficulties of life, and
                    whom she loved with all a mother’s love.</p>
