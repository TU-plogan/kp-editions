                    Ille-et-Vilaine. The capital, St Lô, is 159 miles west of Paris. The extreme
                    length from north-west to south-east <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n482/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0482-0459"/> is 81 miles, the mean breadth from east to west
                    about 28 miles, and the area 2289 square miles.</p>
                <p>The department is traversed from south to north by a range of hills, in many
                    parts picturesque, and connected in the south with those of Maine and Brittany.
                    In the country round Mortain, which has been called the Switzerland of Normandy,
                    they rise to a height of 1200 feet, and at Cherbourg their altitude is still
                    from 500 to 600 feet. As a whole the department has an English aspect, with its
                    broken and tide-beaten shores often enveloped in mist, and its ever-verdant
                    meadows. The coast-line, running northward along the bay of the Seine from the
                    rocks of Grand Camp to Cape Barfieur, thence westward to Cape la Hague, and
                    finally southward to the Bay of Mont St Michel, has a length of 200 miles. The
                    Vire and the Taute (which receives the Ouve as a tributary on the left) fall
                    into the sea at the Calvados border, and are united by a canal some miles above
                    their mouths. From the mouth of the Taute a low beach runs to St Vaast la
                    Hougue, where the coast becomes rocky, with sandbanks. Between Cape Barfieur and
                    Cape la Hague lie the roads of Cherbourg, protected by the famous breakwater.
                    The whole western coast is inhospitable; its petty havens, lying behind
                    formidable barriers and reefs, are almost dry at low tide. Great cliffs like the
                    points of Jobourg (420 feet high) and Flamanville alternate with long strands
                    such as that which extends for 30 miles from Cape Carteret to Granville. Between
                    this coast and the Channel Islands the tide, pent up between numerous sandbanks,
                    flows with a terrific force that has given these passages such ill-omened names
                    as <hi rend="italic">Passage de</hi><hi rend="italic">la Déroute</hi> and the
                    like. The only important harbours are Granville and the haven of refuge of
                    Diélette between Granville and Cherbourg. The chief stream is the Sienne with
                    its tributary the Soulle flowing by Coutances. South of Granville the sands of
                    St Pair are the commencement of the great Bay of Mount St Michel, whose area of
                    60,000 acres was covered with forest till the terrible tide of the year 709. The
                    equinoctial tides reach a vertical height of nearly 50 feet. Amidst the foam
                    rise the picturesque walls of the abbey, from the summit of a rock 400 feet
                    high. The Sée, which waters Avranches, and the Couesnon (separating Manche from
                    Ille-et-Vilaine) disembogue in the bay.</p>
                <p>The climate of Manche is mild and humid from its propinquity to the sea. At
                    Cherbourg, in spite of the northerly exposure, the mean temperature is 3° Fahr,
                    above the mean for that latitude over France. Frosts are never severe; myrtles
                    and fuchsias flourish in the open air. Excessive heat is also unusual; the
                    predominant winds are south-west. Rains are frequent, as the verdure of the
                    country testifies, but they are not violent, the annual rainfall varying from 30
                    to 34 inches.</p>
                <p>Of the entire area more than the half is arable, 198,000 acres are meadow land,
                    52,000 are under wood, and 82,000 are heath. The soil is not naturally fertile,
                    but vegetation is promoted by the humidity of the climate and by artificial
                    improvements. The characteristic industry of the department is the rearing of
                    horses and other live stock; the horses number 92,839, besides several thousands
                    of asses and mules, and there are 270,000 horned cattle, 277,000 sheep, upwards
                    of 100,000 pigs, and 40,000 beehives. In 1876 the department yielded 1,458,476
                    hectolitres of wheat, 83,393 of meslin, 1,014,662 of barley, 427,360 of
                    sarrasin, 484,365 of oats, 52,236 of rye, 683,834 of potatoes, 72,401 of dried
                    legumes, 363,372 of beetroot, and 8758 quintals of hemp; and in the same year
                    there were manufactured 86,088 kilogrammes of linseed oil and 39,380 kilogrammes
                    of colza oil. The arable and meadow lands occupy the eastern portion of the
                    department; legumes are grown in the west, where lands adapted for market
                    gardening purposes are worth as much as 15,000 francs per hectare. Manche has a
                    larger production of cider than any other department of France (upwards of
                    28,000,000 gallons). Besides apples, pears, plums, cherries, and figs are grown.
                    The fields are lined with rows of oak, elm, and beech, which furnish good timber
                    for building purposes. The aspen, poplar, walnut, and chestnut are also common.
                    Some attempts at reclamation have been made along the sea-shore. The department
                    contains valuable granite quarries in the Cherbourg arrondissement and the
                    Chausay Islands; there are also deposits of carboniferous marble, kaolin, talc,
                    and of calcareous sand (“tangue”) used as manure. There are smiths’ forges and
                    iron foundries, important brass foundries, and establishments for the
                    manufacture of tools, needles, and other kinds of hardware. The port and arsenal
                    of Cherbourg is very complete in all its appointments. The department has 45
                    wool-spinning factories with 13,123 spindles, and 6 cotton-spinning mills with
                    50,000 spindles; and cloth-making, paper-making, tanning, and other industries
                    are carried on. On the coast there are important beds for oyster culture, and
                    the maritime population, when not engaged in the pursuit of the herring,
                    mackerel, or lobster, collect ware and sea-grass. The shipping of Manche amounts
                    to some 4600 vessels, with an aggregate tonnage of 29,000 tons; the exports
                    consist of butter, eggs, poultry, live stock, legumes, meat, fish, horses,
                    grain, stone, brasiery, and hardware. The population in 1876 was 539,910. There
                    are six arrondissements (St LÔ, Avranches, Cherbourg, Coutances, Mortain,
                    Valognes), 48 cantons, and 643 communes; the capital is St Lδ.</p>
