                <p><label type="entry">MANDAMUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Writ of</hi></label>, in
                    English law, is usually described as a high prerogative writ, containing a
                    command in the name of the king, and issuing from the King’s Bench, directed to
                    persons, corporations, and inferior courts, ordering them to do a specific act
                    within the duty of their office. Direct orders from the sovereign to subjects
                    commanding the performance of particular acts were common in early times, and to
                    this class of orders mandamus originally belonged. It became customary for the
                    Court of King’s Bench, in cases where a legal duty was established but no
                    sufficient means existed for enforcing it, to order performance by this writ. At
                    all times, accordingly, mandamus has been regarded as of the nature of an
                    equitable interference supplementing the deficiencies of the common law. When
                    the object sought could be •equally well obtained by other means, as by an
                    action, or by any other form of proceedings, then mandamus would not lie. A
                    further condition of mandamus at common law was that it lay only for the
                    performance of acts of a public or official character. The enforcement of merely
                    private obligations, such as those arising from contracts, was not within its
                    scope. Further, the interference of the court could only be obtained when there
                    was no doubt of the existence of the duty, or when performance had been demanded
                    and refused. Nor would the writ be issued when performance had become
                    impossible. By the Common Law Procedure Act, 1854, the plaintiff in any action
                    other than replevin and ejectment was entitled to claim a writ of mandamus to
                    compel the defendant to discharge any duty in which the plaintiff might show
                    that he was personally interested, or from the non-performance of which he might
                    sustain damage. The duties so enforceable must, however, be of a public
                    character. By the Judicature Act, 1873, a mandamus may be granted by an
                    interlocutory order of the court in all cases in which it shall appear to the
                    court to be just and convenient, and subject to such terms and conditions, if
                    any, as the court shall think just. Under this section it has been held that the
                    court (which now includes what was formerly the Court of Chancery) has power to
                    issue a writ of mandamus in auy cause or matter pending before it, but when the
                    cause is at an end the power is gone. And it has also been held that, when the
                    circumstances are such as would form ground for an application for the old
                    prerogative writ of mandamus, the application must be made to the Queen’s Bench
                    division, which has taken the place of the Court of Queen’s Bench on the old
                    system. The jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery to compel specific performance
                    of contracts has some resemblance to mandamus in the domain of semi-public law.
                    For a collection of the cases in which the prerogative writ of mandamus will or
                    wi∏ not lie, reference may be made to Tapping <hi rend="italic">On
                        Mandamus,</hi> and to Selwyn’s <hi rend="italic">Nisi Prius,</hi> art.
                    “Mandamus.”</p>
                <p>The writ has passed into the law of the United States. ’ ‘ There is in the
                    federal judiciary an employment of the writ substantially as the old prerogative
                    writ in the King’s Bench practice, also as a mode of exercising appellate
                    jurisdiction, also as a proceeding ancillary to a judgment previously rendered,
                    in exercise of original jurisdiction, as when a circuit court having rendered a
                    judgment against a county issues a mandamus requiring its officers to levy a tax
                    to provide for the payment of the judgment.” And in the various States mandamus
                    is used under varying regulations, mandate being in some cases substituted aS
                    the name of the proceeding. See Abbott’s <hi rend="italic">Law
