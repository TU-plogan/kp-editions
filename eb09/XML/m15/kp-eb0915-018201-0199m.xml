                    relatives. His father was the owner of large landed estates in Orange county,
                    Virginia, and was a man of distinction in the county. In 1769 Madison entered
                    Princeton College in New Jersey, and graduated as B.A. in 1771; but he remained
                    another year at Princeton studying under the direction of President Witherspoon.
                    His close application to study had seriously impaired his health, which
                    continued delicate for many years. Returning to Virginia in 1772, he pursued his
                    reading and studies, however, with the same zeal as before, the subjects chosen
                    being particularly those of philosophy, theology, and law.</p>
                <p>Madison had as yet taken no active part in the exciting politics of the time. In
                    1775, however, he was chairman of the committee of public safety for Orange
                    county, and in the spring of 1776 he was chosen a delegate to the new Virginia
                    convention, which formed a constitution for the State. Failing to be re-elected
                    in 1777, he was chosen in that year a member of the council of State, in which
                    he took a prominent part until the end of 1779, at which time he was elected a
                    delegate to the Continental Congress, later the Congress of the Confederation.
                    It was in this assembly that Madison first displayed those powers which
                    ultimately made him the founder of the constitution of the United States. He was
                    in Congress during the final stages of the revolutionary war, and one year after
                    the establishment of peace, at a time when the confederation was in a
                    chronic‘state of collapse, occasioned by the neglect or the refusal of the
                    States to respond to the requisitions of Congress for supplies for the federal
                    treasury, Madison was among the first to advocate the granting of additional
                    powers to Congress. In 1781 he favoured the amendment of the articles of
                    confederation, giving to Congress the ]&gt;ower to enforce its requisitions;
                    andin 1783 he zealously advocated the proposed plan by which the States should
                    grant to Congress for a period of twenty-five years the authority to levy an
                    impost duty. Accompanying this plan was an address to the States drawn up by
                    Madison. This address is one of the ablest of his state papers, and with others
                    of this period placed him in the front rank of American statesmen.</p>
                <p>In November 1783, the constitutional limit of his term as deputy having expired,
                    Madison returned to Virginia, and the next year he again took a seat in the
                    legislature of that State. As chairman of the judiciary committee, he was
                    particularly instrumental in revising the statute laws of the State. He opposed
                    the further issue of paper money by the State, and tried to induce the
                    legislature to repeal the law confiscating British debts.</p>
                <p>As a member of the legislature of Virginia, Madison did not lose sight of the
                    interests of the confederacy. Ho looked beyond mere local interests, believing
                    that the highest good of the State would best be advanced through a respected
                    central Government. Virginia and Maryland possessing a common jurisdiction over
                    the waters of the Potomac river and the Chesapeak Bay, it became necessary to
                    come to some agreement between them as to the commerce and navigation upon those
                    waters. On Madison’s proposal, commissioners of the two States met at Mount
                    Vernon in March 1785. Maryland having proposed to invite the States of
                    Pennsylvania and Delaware to join in the arrangement, Madison saw an opportunity
                    for a more extended and general concert in regard to commerce and trade, and
                    proposed that all the States should be invited to send commissioners to take
                    into consideration the trade of the United States. This resolution was adopted
                    by the legislature of Virginia; and thus was inaugurated the movement which led
                    to the meeting at Annapolis in 1786, and later to the convention at Philadelphia
                    in 1787. The palpable defects in the government of the confederation had led
                    Madison to make an extended study of confederacies, ancient and modern. Among
                    his papers was-found one bearing the title <hi rend="italic">Notes on
                    Confederacies,</hi> but he gave the results of these researches more at length
                    in Nos. 17, 18, and 19 of <hi rend="italic">The Federalist.</hi> His conclusion
                    was that no confederacy could be long successful which acted upon States only,
                    and not directly upon individuals.</p>
                <p>As the time for the meeting of the convention approached, he drew up an outline
                    of a new system of government to take the place of the articles of
                    confederation.</p>
                <p>As expressed in a letter to General Washington of the 16th of April 1787, it was
                    in substance that the individual sovereignty of the States is totally
                    irreconcilable with the aggregate sovereignty, and that a consolidation of the
                    whole into one simple republic would be as inexpedient as it was unattainable.
                    He sought therefore some middle ground, which might at once support a due
                    supremacy of the national authority and not exclude the local authorities
                    whenever they might be subordinately useful. He proposed, to this end, to change
                    the basis of representation in Congress from States to the population.</p>
                <p>The national government should have authority in all cases requiring uniformity.
                    In addition to this positive power, the national government should have a
                    negative on all State laws “as heretofore exercised by the kingly prerogative.”
                    This negative, he thought, would best be vested in the senate, which should be a
                    comparatively permanent body.</p>
                <p>The national supremacy should extend to the judiciary department and to the
                    militia. The legislature should be composed of two branches—one, the more
                    numerous, elected for a short term, the other, few in number, for a longer term.
                    A national executive should be provided for, and the States should be guaranteed
                    against both internal and external dangers. The right of coercion should be
                    expressly declared. ‘ ‘ But the difficulty and awkwardness of operating by force
                    on the collective will of a State rendered it desirable that the necessity of it
                    should be precluded.” He thought the negative on State laws might answer the
                    purpose. This was a weak point in Madison’s theory of government. He thought,
                    with Jefferson, that there could be found some means of governing without
                    resorting to force. Lastly, ‘ ‘ to give the new system its proper validity and
                    energy, a ratification must be obtained from the people, and not merely from the
                    legislatures.”</p>
                <p>These ideas, somewhat modified and extended in details, formed the Virginia plan
                    of government, presented in the convention by Edmund Randolph; and this plan,
                    again, became the basis of the extended deliberations in the convention which
                    resulted in the constitution adopted in that body on the 17th of September 1787.
                    In the convention, as a delegate from Virginia, Madison took a leading part in
                    the debates, of which he kept notes which were afterwards published by order of
                    Congress. It was his influence which largely shaped the form of the final draft
                    of the constitution. But the labour was not finished with this draft; the
                    constitution<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n200/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0200-0183"/> was yet to be accepted by the people; that it was
                    accepted was due in an eminent degree to the efforts of Madison. In order to
                    place the new constitution before the people in its true light, and to meet
                    objections brought against it, he joined Hamilton and Jay in the publication of
                    a series of essays, which were published in a collected form in 1788 under the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">The Federalist,</hi> and which are still worthy of
                    careful study.</p>
                <p>In the Virginia convention for ratifying the constitution he was again called
                    upon to defend that instrument, and against such staunch patriots as Patrick
                    Henry and George Mason. Madison here appeared at his best. He answered every
                    objection in detail, calmly, yet with an eloquence and zeal that carried
                    conviction to his audience. The result was a victory against an adverse public
                    opinion, as well as against the eloquence of his opponents.</p>
                <p>Although he remained in the public service for nearly twenty-five years longer,
                    his greatest work was finished with the adoption of the constitution. He had
                    gained the well-earned title of “father of the constitution.” The part he had
                    taken, however, alienated from him the support of a majority of the people of
                    his State. He was defeated as a candidate for United States senate, though he
                    was chosen in his own district as representative to Congress. Taking his seat in
                    the Lower House in April 1789, he assumed a leading part in the legislation
                    necessary to the organization of the new government. To Hamilton’s measures,
                    however, for the funding of the debt, the assumption of the State debts, and the
                    establishment of a national bank, he was opposed. On other questions, too, he
                    sided with the Anti-Federalists, and gradually assumed the leadership of the
                    opposition in the House of Representatives.</p>
                <p>One would have expected to find him advocating with Washington, Hamilton,
                    Marshall, Jay, and others those measures which would strengthen still more the
                    federal government. On the contrary, we find him labouring to confine the powers
                    of the national government within the narrowest possible limits.</p>
                <p>Much has been said in regard to Madison’s change of principles at this time. It
                    has been intimated that he was influenced, perhaps unconsciously, by the decided
                    attitude of his State, but especially by the dominating mind of his most
                    intimate friend, Jefferson. Probably there is something of truth in this charge,
                    yet it must be said that Madison had shown on many previous occasions an
                    aversion to a liberal construction of granted powers. Timid by nature, he was
                    frightened at the bold and comprehensive measures of the secretary of the
                    treasury. He thought he saw in them a constructive latitude of interpretation
                    and a centralization of interests dangerous to republican principles.</p>
                <p>Madison opposed also the foreign policy of the administration in 1793-96, in its
                    attempts to maintain a neutral position between Great Britain and France, then
                    at war with each other. And under the signature of “Helvidius” he published in
                    the public journals five papers of great power and acuteness, criticizing the
                    “monarchical prerogative of the executive” as exercised in the proclamation of
                    neutrality of 1793, and the right of the recognition by the president of foreign
                    states. So far as the question of international law was concerned, Madison was
                    essentially right, but in regard to the authority of the executive, and the
                    question of the expediency of Washington’s neutral policy, the subsequent
                    practice of the Government and the general verdict of history condemn his view.
                    In 1794 Madison introduced in the House of Representatives resolutions based
                    upon Jefferson’s report on commerce, advising retaliatory measures against Great
                    Britain and a discrimination in commercial and navigation laws in favour of
                    France. Again, in 1796 he strenuously opposed the appropriation of money for the
                    purpose of carrying into effect the treaty of 1794 with Great Britain. He
                    scouted the idea as visionary that Great Britain would go to war on a refusal to
                    carry the treaty into effect. It was not conceivable, he thought, that she would
                    “make war upon a country which was the best market she had for her
                    manufactures.” It had been a favourite theory with Madison, as with Jefferson,
                    that foreign nations could be coerced through their commercial interests. The
                    fallacy of this doctrine was well exemplified by its utter inefficiency when put
                    in practice by them in 1807-12.</p>
                <p>In 1797 Madison withdrew to private life, though not to a life of inactivity. In
                    1798 he was induced by Jefferson to join in a movement in opposition to the
                    Alien and Sedition Laws passed by the Federalists in that year, and was himself
                    the author of the Virginia resolutions, which declared—</p>
                <p>“That the constitution of the United States was a compact, to which the States
                    were parties, granting limited powers of government; that in case of a
                    deliberate, palpable, and dangerous exercise of other powers, not granted by the
                    compact, the States had the right, and were in duty bound, to <hi rend="italic"
                    >interpose</hi> for arresting the progress of the evils and for maintaining
                    within their respective limits, the authorities, rights, and liberties
                    pertaining to them; that the Alien and Sedition Laws were such infractions of
                    'the compact;· . . . and finally that the State of Virginia declared those laws
                    unconstitutional and not law, but utterly null, void, and of no effect, and
                    invited the other States to join her in this action.”</p>
                <p>These resolutions, with those of Kentucky drawn by Jefferson, met with decided
                    objections from the other States. Upon these objections Madison made a report to
                    the legislature of Virginia, consisting of an elaborate and carefully considered
                    argument sustaining in every point the resolutions of 1798. Thirty years later
                    these arguments were freely made use of by Calhoun and his school of nullifiers
                    as the basis of their doctrine. But Madison, in 1830, repudiated the idea that
                    the resolutions of 1798 involved the principles of nullification. He wrote at
                    that time many letters to public men, and especially one to Edward Everett, in
                    August 1830, to prove this position. The nullifiers were not convinced, however,
                    by this reasoning, and continued to use his arguments in favour of their
                    doctrine, till it became a source of great annoyance to him.</p>
                <p>With the rise of the republican party to power in 1801, Madison became secretary
                    of state in Jefferson’s cabinet,— a position for which he was well fitted both
                    by his temperament and his training, well versed as he was in constitutional and
                    international law, and practising a calmness and fairness in discussion which
                    are essential qualities of the diplomatist. In defending the neutral rights of
                    the United States against the encroachments of European belligerents (1801-9),
                    there was almost constant need of the use of all those qualities. The most
                    important of his papers during this period was <hi rend="italic">An Examination
                    of the British Doctrine which subjects to capture a neutral trade not open in
                    time of peace,</hi> that is, the so-called “rule of the war of 1756,” as
                    extended by Great Britain in 1793 and 1803. This treatise, published in 1806,
                    was an argument against the British doctrine, drawn from a careful investigation
                    of authorities on international law, and was a valuable contribution to the
                    discussion of a question which, for various reasons, has now lost its
                    importance.</p>
                <p>In 1809 Madison was elected president to succeed Jefferson, whose peace policy—a
                    policy of commercial restrictions to coerce Great Britain and France—he
                    continued to follow until, in 1812, he was forced by his party to change it for
                    a policy of war. He had been, under the lead of Jefferson, a great lieutenant;
                    he had for the most part furnished the arguments in support of the republican
                    policy since 1790; but he did not possess the qualities of a leader. His cabinet
                    was in part forced upon him in 1809 by a senatorial clique, and his
                    administration lacked vigour, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n201/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0201-0184"/> particularly during the war of 1812-15. He had
                    never been a partisan in politics, and was averse to forcing his views upon
                    others, except in so far as he could do so by impartial arguments. In argument,
                    he was not satisfied with generalities; his reasoning went to the foundation of
                    principles—to the minutest details, sometimes almost painfully so. His analysis
                    of the arguments was powerful and searching. In this he resembled Hamilton: but
                    his conclusions were reached through a laborious process of induction, whilst
                    those of Hamilton seemed more the result of intuition. Madison, moreover, lacked
                    Hamilton’s boldness of conception and courage in assuming the responsibility of
                    his theories. The difference between them was the difference between great
                    talent and genius.</p>
                <p>Madison served two terms as president, and in 1817 retired to Montpellier, his
                    country seat in Virginia. For nearly twenty years thereafter he was engaged in
                    agricultural pursuits, but was ever interested in literature and politics. To
                    the time of his death he continued to be consulted by statesmen as an oracle on
                    all constitutional questions.</p>
