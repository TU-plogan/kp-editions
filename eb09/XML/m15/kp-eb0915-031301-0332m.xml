                    has often been doubted whether Malachi is the real name of the author, or only
                    an epithet assumed by himself, or attached by the collector to a work which he
                    found anonymous (so Ewald), with reference to iii. 1.<note anchored="true"

                    tradition given in the Targum of Jonathan, and approved by Jerome, identifies
                    Malachi with Ezra the priest and scribe; but, though this opinion is ingeniously
                    supported by reference to ii. 7, where the priest and custodian of the law is
                    called the messenger of Jehovah of hosts, it is unlikely that Ezra’s name would
                    have been lost had he been the real author.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    angelic apparition. The same book will have it that Malachi was of the tribe of
                    Zebulon, born in a town Sopha or Soplιera, had his name from his great beauty,
                    and died young.</p></note></p>
                <p>The tradition, however, may at least be taken as implying the perception of a
                    real affinity between the prophet and the great restorer of the law. The
                    religious spirit of Malachi’s prophecy is that of the prayers of Ezra and
                    Nehemiah. A strong sense of the unique privileges of the children of Jacob, the
                    objects of electing love (i. 2), the children of the Divine Father (ii. 10). is
                    combined with an equally strong assurance of Jehovah’s righteousness amidst the
                    many miseries that pressed on the unhappy inhabitants of Judaea. At an earlier
                    date the prophet Haggai had taught that the people could not expect Jehovah’s
                    blessing while the temple lay in ruins. In Malachi’s time the temple was built
                    (i. 10) and the priests waited in their office, but still a curse seemed to rest
                    on the nation’s labours (iii 9). To Malachi the reason of this is plain. The
                    “law of Moses” was forgotten (iv. 4 [iii. 22]); let the people return to
                    Jehovah, and He will return to them. It was vain to complain, saying, “Every one
                    that doeth evil is good in the eyes of Jehovah,” or “Where is the God of
                    judgment?’"—vain to ask “Wherein shall we return ?” Obedience to the law is the
                    sure path to blessing (ii 17-iii. 12).</p>

                <p>It is not e⅞sy to say whether the law to which Malachi recalls the people is that
                    which was established by the covenant taken under Ezra, or whether the prophet
                    wrote before that event. It is at least the Deuteronomic law that is most
                    familiar to him, as appears from his use of the name Horeb for the mountain of
                    the law, and the Deuteronomic phrase “statutes and judgments "<note

                    given to Moses for Israel upon Horeb. This description would not hold good of

                    was a modification of the Deuteronomic law naturally called for under the
                    circumstances of the return from Babylon, and Neh. x. and xiii. produce the
                    impression that it was not introduced for the first time by Ezra and Nehemiah,
                    though the collection of the tithe was enforced by them.</p></note> and
                    especially from his conception of the priesthood as resting on a covenant with
                    Levi (ii. 4 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> The abuses of which he particularly
                    complains are such as were found rampant by Ezra and Nehemiah,—marriage with
                    foreign women (ii. 11, comp. Ezra ix., Neh. xiii. 23 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi>
                    Deut. vii. 3) and failure in payment of sacred dues (iii. 8 <hi rend="italic"

                    shall be disposed to conclude that, if Malachi’s work did not precede the
                    reformation of Ezra, it must have fallen very little later, and before the new
                    order was thoroughly established.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    afresh.</p></note> The prophecy of Joel shows the new theocracy in much fuller
                    development.</p>
                <p>The object of Ezra and Nehemiah was to establish the law by means of the organs
                    of government under warrant from the Great King. Malachi looks for reformation
                    in another direction. He calls the people to repentance, and he enforces the
                    call by proclaiming the approach of Jehovah in judgment agιinst the sorcerers,
                    the adulterers, the false swearers, the oppressors of the poor, the orphan, and
                    the stranger. Then it shall be seen that He is indeed a God of righteous
                    judgment, distinguishing between those that serve Him and those that serve Him
                    not. The Sun of Righteousness shall shine forth on those that fear Jehovah’s
                    name; they shall go forth with joy, and tread the wicked under foot. The
                    conception of the day of final decision, when Jehovah shall come suddenly to His
                    temple (iii. 1) and confound those who think the presumptuous godless happy
                    (iii. 15), is taken from earlier prophets, but it receives a special character
                    from an application of a thought based on Isa. xl. 3. The day of Jehovah would
                    be a curse not a blessing if it found the nation in its present state, the
                    priests listlessly performing a fraudulent service (i. 7-ii. 9), the people
                    bound by marriage to heathen women, while the tears of the daughters of Israel,
                    thrust aside to make way for strangers, cover the altar (ii. 11-16), all faith
                    in divine justice gone (ii. 17, iii. 14 <hi rend="italic">sq.),</hi> sorcery,
                    uncleanness, falsehood, and oppression rampant (iii. 5), the house of God
                    deprived of its dues (iii. 8), and the true fearers of God a little flock
                    gathered together in private exercises of religion (perhaps the germ of the
                    later synagogue) in the midst of a godless nation (iii. 16). That the day of
                    Jehovah is delayed in such a state of things is but a new proof of His
                    unchanging love (iii. 6), which refuses to consume the sons of Jacob. Meantime
                    He is about to send His messenger to prepare His way before Him. The prophet
                    Elijah must reappear to bring back the hearts of fathers and children before the
                    great and terrible day of Jehovah come. Elijah was the advocate of national
                    decision in the great concerns of Israel’s religion; and it is such decision, a
                    clear recognition of what the service of Jehovah means, a purging of His
                    professed worshippers from hypocritical and half-hearted service (iii 3) that
                    Malachi with his intense religious earnestness sees to be the only salvation of
                    the nation. In thus looking to the return of an ancient prophet to do the work
                    for which later prophecy is too weak, Malachi unconsciously signalizes the decay
                    of the order of which he was one of the last representatives; and the somewhat
                    mechanical measure which he applies to the people’s sins, as for example when he
                    teaches that if the sacred dues were rightly paid prosperous seasons would at
                    once return (iii. 10), heralds the advent of that system of formal legalism
                    which thought that all religious duty could be reduced to a system of set rules.
                    It was left to a greater Teacher to show that hypocrisy and vain religion might
                    coexist with Pharisaic exactness in the observance of the whole letter of the
                    law. Yet Malachi himself is no mere formalist. To him, as to the Deuteronomic
                    legislation, the forms of legal observance are of value only as the fitting
                    expression of Israel’s peculiar sonship and service, and he shows himself a true
                    prophet when he contrasts the worthless ministry of unwilling priests with the
                    pure offering of prayer and praise that rises from all corners of the Hebrew
                    dispersion (i. 11), or when he asserts the brotherhood of all Israelites under
                    their one Father (ii. 10), not merely as a ground of separation from the
                    heathen, but as inconsistent with the selfish and cruel freedom of divorce
                    current in his time. It is characteristic of later Judaism that an arbitrary
                    exegesis transformed this anticipation of the doctrine of marriage laid down in
                    the gospel into an express sanction of the right of thé husband to put away his
                    wife at will.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In ii. 16
                    the Targum renders <hi rend="italic">“If</hi> thou hatest her put her away,” and

                <p>The style of Malachi, like his argument, corresponds in its generally prosaic
                    character to that transformation or decay of prophecy which began with Ezekiel;
                    and Ewald has rightly called attention to the fact that the conduct of the
                    argument already shows traces of the dialectic manner of the schools. Yet there
                    is a simple dignity in the manner not unworthy of a prophet, and rising from
                    time to time to poetical rhythm.</p>
