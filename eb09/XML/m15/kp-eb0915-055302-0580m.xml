                    of</hi></label> (1650- 1722). In the small manor house of Ashe, situated in the
                    parish of Musbury in Devonshire, but hardly a stone’s throw beyond the parish of
                    Axminster, John Churchill the first duke of Marlborough was born 24th of June
                    1650. Arabella Churchill, his eldest sister, and the mother of the duke of
                    Berwick, was born in the same house on the 28th of February 1648. They were the
                    children of Winston Churchill of Glanville Wotton in Dorset and Elizabeth the
                    fourth daughter of Sir John Drake, who after the close of the civil war received
                    his son-in-law into his own house. For a year or two after the Restoration John
                    Churchill went to St Paul’s school, and there is a tradition that during this
                    period he showed the bent of his taste by reading and re-reading Vegetius <hi
                    rend="italic">De Re Militem.</hi> When fifteen years old he obtained a place in
                    the household of the duke of York, and about the same time his sister Arabella
                    became maid of honour to the duchess, two events which contributed greatly to
                    the advancement of the Churchills. Next year, in 1666, he received, through the
                    influence of his master, a commission in the guards, and left England for
                    service at Tangiers. Such fighting as was waged with the Moors did not accord
                    with bis feelings, and he soon returned to his own country. For a few years
                    afterwards Churchill remained in attendance at the court, and it was during this
                    period that the natural carefulness of his disposition was shown by his
                    investing in an annuity a present of £5000 given him by a court beauty. In 1672,
                    when England to her shame sent six thousand troops to aid Louis XIV. in his
                    attempt to subdue the Dutch, Churchill formed one of the company, and soon
                    attracted the attention of Turenne, by whose profound military genius the whole
                    army was directed. At the siege of Nimeguen Churchill acquitted himself with
                    such success that the French commander predicted his ultimate rise to
                    distinction. When Maestricht was besieged he saved the life of the duke of
                    Monmouth, and received the thanks of Louis XIV. for his services. Early in 1678
                    he was married to Sarah Jennings, the favourite attendant on the Princess Anne,
                    the younger daughter of the duke of York. Her father Richard Jennings, a
                    Hertfordshire squire, had twenty-two brothers and sisters; one of the latter
                    married a London tradesman called Hill, and their daughter Abigail Hill
                    afterwards succeeded her cousin the duchess of Marlborough as favourite to Queen
                    Anne. Sarah Jennings had as little money as her husband, but this deficiency was
                    more than compensated for by an abundance of energy and ambition.</p>
                <p>On the accession of James II. the Churchills received a great increase in
                    fortune. Colonel Churchill had been created a Scotch peer in 1682, and as a
                    reward for his services in going on a special mission from the new monarch to
                    Louis XIV. he was advanced to the English peerage under the title of Baron
                    Churchill of Sandridge in Hertfordshire, the village in which the Jennings’s
                    property was situated. A step in the army was at the same time conferred upon
                    him, and when the duke of Monmouth attempted his ill-fated enterprise in the
                    western counties the second position in command was bestowed on Lord Churchill.
                    Through his vigilance and energy victory declared itself on· the king’s side.
                    After the death of Monmouth he withdrew as far as possible from the
                    administration of public business. Whilst on his embassy to the French court he
                    had declared with emphasis that if the king of England should change the
                    religion of the state he should at once leave his service, and it was not long
                    before the design of James became apparent to the world. Churchill was one of
                    the first to send overtures of obedience to the prince of Orange. Although he
                    continued in a high position under James, and drew the emoluments of his places,
                    he promised William of Orange to use every exertion to bring over the troops to
                    his side. James had been warned against putting any trust in the loyalty of the
                    man on whom he had showered so many favours, but the warnings were in vain, and
                    on the landing of the Dutch prince at Brixham Churchill was sent against him
                    with five thousand men. When the royal army had advanced to the downs of
                    Wiltshire and a battle seemed imminent, James was disconcerted by learning that
                    in the dead of night his general had stolen away like a thief into the opposite
                    camp. For this timely act of treachery Churchill received another advancement in
                    the peerage. He had now become the earl of Marlborough and a member of the privy
                    council, a mark of royal favour which during this and the next reign was more
                    than an unmeaning honour. William felt, however, that he could not place
                    implicit reliance in his friend’s integrity; and, with a clear sense of the
                    manner in which Marlborough’s talents might be employed without any detriment to
                    the stability of his throne, he sent him with the army into the Netherlands and
                    into Ireland. For some time there was no open avowal of any distrust in
                    Marlborough’s loyalty, but in May 1692 the world was astonished at the news that
                    he had been thrown into the Tower on an accusation of treason. Though the
                    evidence which could be brought against him was slight, and he was soon set at
                    liberty, there is no doubt that Marlborough was in close relations with the
                    exiled king at St Germains, and that he even went so far as to disclose to his
                    late master the intention of the English to attack the town of Brest. The
                    talents of the statesmen of this reign were chiefly displayed in their attempts
                    to convince both the exiled and the reigning king of England of their attachment
                    to his fortunes. The sin of Marlborough lay in the fact that he had been
                    favoured above his fellows by each in turn, and that he betrayed both alike
                    apparently without scruple or without shame. Once again during the Fenwick plot
                    he was charged with treason, but William, knowing that if he <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n581/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0581-0554"/> pushed Marlborough and his friends to extremities
                    there were no other statesmen on whom he could rely, contented himself with
                    ignoring the confessions of Sir John Fenwick, and with executing that
                    conspirator himself. Not long afterwards the forgiven traitor was made governor
                    to the young duke of Gloucester, the only one of Anne’s numerous children who
                    gave promise of attaining to manhood. During the last years of William’s reign
                    Marlborough once more was placed in positions of responsibility. His daughters
                    were married into the most prominent families of the land: the eldest became the
                    wife of the eldest son of Lord Godolphin; the second, the loveliest woman at the
                    court, with her father’s tact and temper and her mother’s beauty, married the
                    only son of Lord Sunderland. Higher honours were in store for his family, and
                    they came on the accession of Queen Anne in March 1702. She had not been more
                    than three days upon the throne before the knighthood of the Garter was
                    conferred upon Marlborough. He was made captain-general of the English troops
                    both at home and abroad, and master-general of the ordnance. The new queen did
                    not forget the life-long service of his wife; three positions at the court by
                    which she was enabled to continue by the side of the sovereign as closely as she
                    had lived with the princess were united in her person. The queen showed her
                    devotion to her friend by another signal mark of favour. The rangership of
                    Windsor Park was granted her for life, with the especial object of enabling Lady
                    Marlborough to live in the Great Lodge. These were the opening days of many
                    years of fame and power. A week or two after the death of William it was agreed
                    by the three great powers, England, Holland, and Austria, which formed the grand
                    alliance, that war should be declared against France on the same day, and on May
                    4, 1702, the declaration was made by the three countries. Marlborough was made
                    commander-in-chief of the united armies of England and Holland, but throughout
                    the war his plans were impeded by th© jealousy of the commanders who were
                    nominally his inferiors, and by the opposite aims of the various countries that
                    were striving to break the power of France. He himself wished to penetrate into
                    the French lines; the anxiety of the Dutch was for the maintenance of their
                    frontier and for an augmentation of their territory; the desire of the Austrian
                    emperor was to ensure his son’s rule over Spain. To secure concerted action by
                    these different powers taxed all the diplomacy of Marlborough, but he succeeded
                    for the most part in his desires. In the first year of the campaign it was shown
                    that the armies of the French were not invincible. Several fortresses which
                    Louis XIV. had seized upon surrendered themselves to the allies. Kaiserswerth on
                    the Rhine and Venloo on the Meuse soon passed from the hands of the French to
                    the English. The prosperous commercial town of Liège with its commanding citadel
                    quickly capitulated. The successes of Marlborough caused much rejoicing in his
                    own country, and for these brilliant exploits he was raised to the highest rank
                    in the peerage, and rewarded with a handsome annuity. In the spring of the
                    following year a crushing blow fell upon the duke and duchess. Their eldest and
                    only surviving son, the marquis of Blandford, was seized whilst at King’s
                    College, Cambridge (under the care of Hare, afterwards bishop of Chichester),
                    with the small-pox, and died on the 20th February 1703, in his seventeenth year.
                    If the character of the youth which is given by Cole, the Cambridge antiquary,
                    can be accepted as true, and Cole was not likely to be prejudiced in favour of
                    the family of Churchill, his talents had already justified the prediction that
                    he would rise to the highest position in the state.</p>
                <p>The result of the campaign of 1703 inspired the French king with fresh hopes of
                    ultimate victory. The dashing plans υf Marlborough were frustrated by the
                    opposition of his Dutch colleagues. When he wished to invade the French
                    territory they urged him to besiege Bonn, and he was compelled to accede to
                    their wishes. After this digression from his first purpose he returned to his
                    original plan of attacking Antwerp; but, in consequence of the incapacity of the
                    Dutch leaders, the generals (Villeroi and Bouffiers) of the French army
                    surprised the Dutch division and inflicted on it a loss of many thousands of
                    men. Marlborough was forced to abandon his enterprise, and all the compensation
                    which he received was the capture of the insignificant forts of Huy and Limburg.
                    After a year of comparative failure for the allies, Louis XIV. was emboldened to
                    enter upon an offensive movement against Austria; and Marlborough, smarting
                    under the misadventures of 1703, and conscious that the war could only be
                    brought to an end by more decisive measures, was eager to meet him. A
                    magnificent army was sent by the French king under the command of Marshal
                    Tallard, with instructions to strike a blow at Vienna itself. Marlborough
                    divined the intention of the expedition, and, without communicating his
                    intentions to his colleagues, led his troops into Bavaria. The two armies (that
                    under Marlborough and Prince Eugène numbering more than fifty thousand men,
                    whilst Tailard’s forces were nearly ten thousand stronger) met in battle array
                    near the village of Blenheim. The French commander made the mistake of supposing
                    that the enemy’s attack would be directed against his position in the village,
                    and he concentrated an excessive number of his troops at that point. The early
                    part of the fight was in favour of the French. Three times were the troops led
                    by Prince Eugène driven back in confusion; Marlborough’s cavalry failed on their
                    first attack in breaking the line of the enemy. But in the end the victory of
                    the allies was conclusive. Nearly thirty thousand of the French and Bavarians
                    were killed and wounded, and in Blenheim alone ten thousand were made prisoners.
                    Never was a victory more eagerly welcomed than this, and never was a conquering
                    leader more rewarded than Marlborough. On his return to his own country he was
                    received with enthusiasm on all sides. Poets and prose writers were employed to
                    do him honour, and the lines of Addison comparing the English commander to the
                    angel who passed over “pale Britannia” in the storm of 1703 have been famous for
                    nearly two centuries. The manor of Woodstock, which was transferred by Act of
                    Parliament from the crown to the duke, was a reward more after his own heart.
                    The gift even in that form was a noble one, but the queen heightened it by
                    instructing Sir John Vanbrugh to build a palace in the park at the royal
                    expense, and, although the works subsequently caused much anxiety to the duke
                    and duchess, £240,000 of public money was spent on the buildings.</p>
                <p>The following year was not marked by any stirring incident. Marlborough was
                    hampered by tedious formalities at the Hague and by jealousies at the German
                    courts. The armies of the French were again brought up to their full standard,
                    but the generals of Louis were instructed to entrench themselves behind
                    earthworks and to act on the defensive. In the darkness of a July night these
                    lines were broken through, and the French were forced to take shelter under the
                    walls of Louvain. Marlborough urged an attack upon them in their new position,
                    but his passionate arguments were spent in vain, and when 1705 had passed away
                    the forces of the French king had suffered no diminution. This immunity from
                    disaster tempted Villeroi in the next spring into meeting the allied forces in
                    an open fight, but his assurance proved his ruin. The battle of Ramillies (23d
                    May 1706) ended in the total rout of the French, and caused the transference of
                    nearly <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n582/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0582-0555"/> the whole of Brabant and Flanders to the allies.
                    Five days afterwards the victor entered Brussels in state, and the inhabitants
                    acknowledged the rule of the archduke. Antwerp and Ostend surrendered themselves
                    with slight loss. Menin held out until three thousand of the soldiers of the
                    allies were laid low around its walls, but Dender-ιnonde, which Louis had forty
                    years previously besieged in vain, quickly gave itself up to the resistless
                    Marlborough. Again a year of activity and triumph was succeeded by a period of
                    languor and depression. During the whole of 1707 fortune inclined to the other
                    side, with the result that early in the next year Ghent and Bruges returned to
                    the allegiance of the French, and Marlborough, fearing that their example might
                    be followed by the other cities, advanced with his wdιole army towards
                    Oudenarde. Had the counsels of Vendome, one of the ablest of the French
                    generals, prevailed, the fight might have had a different issue, but his
                    suggestions were disregarded by the duke of Burgundy, the grandson of Louis, and
                    the battle, like its predecessor, ended in their defeat. After this victory
                    Marlborough, ever anxious for decisive measures, wished to advance on Paris, but
                    he was overruled. The allied army invested the town of Lille, on the
                    fortifications of which Vauban had expended an immensity of thought; and after a
                    struggle of nearly four months, and the loss of thirty thousand men, the citadel
                    surrendered. By the end of the year Brabant was again subject to the rule of the
                    allies. The suffering in France at this time weighed so heavily upon the people
                    that its proud king humbled himself to sue for peace. Each of the allies in turn
                    did he supplicate, and his minister endeavoured by promises of large sums of
                    money to obtain the support of Marlborough to his proposals. These attempts were
                    in vain, and when the winter passed away a French army of one hundred and ten
                    thousand, under the command of Villars, took the field. On the 3d of August 1709
                    Tournay capitulated, and the two leaders, Marlborough and Eugène, led their
                    forces to Mons, in spite of the attempt of Villars to prevent them. For the last
                    time during the protracted war the two armies met in fair fight at Malplaquet,
                    11th September 1709, where the French leader had strengthened his position by
                    extensive earthworks. The fight was long and doubtful, and, although the French
                    ultimately retreated under the direction of Bouffiers, for Villars had been
                    wounded on the knee, it was in good order, and their losses were less than those
                    of their opponents. The campaign lasted for a year or two after this indecisive
                    contest, but it was not signalized by any such “glorious victory” as Blenheim.
                    All that the English could plume themselves on was the acquisition of a few such
                    fortresses as Douai and Bethune, and all that the French had to fear was the
                    gradual tightening of the enemy’s chain until it reached the walls of Paris. The
                    energies of the French were concentrated in the construction of fresh lines of
                    defence, until their commander boasted that his position was impregnable. In
                    this way the war dragged on until the conclusion of the peace of Utrecht.</p>
                <p>All that Marlborough had effected on the battlefield during these years of war
                    had not prevented his position from being undermined by party intrigues at home.
                    In the early part of Queen Anne’s reign his political friends were to be found
                    among the Tories, and the ministry was chiefly composed of members of that
                    party. After a year or two, however, the more ardent Tories withdrew, and two
                    younger adherents of the same cause, Harley and St John (both of whom were at
                    present content to conceal their animosity to Marlborough), were introduced into
                    the ministry. The duchess, partly through the influence of her son-in-law, the
                    earl of Sunderland, and partly through the opposition of the Tories to the
                    French war, had gone over to the Whig cause, and she pressed her views on the
                    sovereign with more vehemence than discretion. She had obtained for her indigent
                    cousin, Abigail Hill, a small position at court, and the poor relation very soon
                    began to injure the benefactor who had befriended her. With Hill’s assistance
                    Harley and St John widened the breach with the queen which was commenced by the
                    imperious manner of the duchess. The love of the two friends changed into hate,
                    and no opportunity for humiliating the family of Marlborough was allowed to pass
                    away neglected. Sunderland and Godolphin were the first to fall (July-August
                    1710); a few months later the duchess was dismissed from her offices; and,
                    although Marlborough himself was permitted to continue in his position a short
                    time longer, his full was only delayed until the last day of 1711. Life in
                    England had become so unpleasant that he went to the Continent, and he remained
                    abroad until the death of Anne (1st August 17Id). Then he once more returned to
                    the shores of England and resumed his old military posts, but he took little
                    part in public affairs. Even if he had wished to regain his commanding position
                    in the country,-ill health would have prevented him from obtaining his desires.
                    Johnson, indeed, says, in the <hi rend="italic">Vanity of Human Wishes,</hi>
                    that “the streams of-dotage” flowed from his eyes; but it is not desirable to
                    examine too critically the assertions of a poem which relied for its success
                    upon the strength of its comparisons. It is certain that at the time of his
                    death he was able to understand the remarks of others and to express his own
                    wishes. At four o’clock on the morning of the 16th June 1722, he died at
                    Cranbourn Lodge near Windsor. His remains were at first deposited in Westminster
                    Abbey, in the vault at the east end of King Henry VII.’s chapel, but they now
                    rest at Blenheim.</p>
                <p>His widow, to whom must be assigned a considerable share both in his rise and in
                    his fall, survived till October 1744. Those years were spent in bitter animosity
                    with many within and without her own family. Left by her husband with the
                    command of boundless wealth, she used it for the vindication of his memory and
                    for the justification of her own resentment. Two of the leading opponents of the
                    ministry, Chesterfield and Pitt, were especially honoured by her attentions. To
                    Pitt she left ten thousand pounds, to the other statesman twice that sum and a
                    reversionary interest in her landed property at Wimbledon. Whilst a widow, she
                    received numerous offers of marriage from many titled suitors. She refused them
                    all: from her marriage to her death her heart had no other inmate than the man
                    as whose wife she had become almost a rival to royalty.</p>
                <p>Marlborough obtained his first start in life through a handsome pension, and his
                    rapid rise to the highest position in the state was due to his singular tact and
                    to his skill in the management of men. In an age remarkable for grace of manner
                    and for adroitness of compliment, his courteous demeanour and the art with which
                    he refused or granted a favour extorted the admiration of every one with whom he
                    came in contact. Through his consideration for the welfare of his soldiers he
                    held together for years an army drawn from every nation in Christendom. His
                    talents may not have been profound (he possessed “an excellent plain
                    understanding and sound judgment” is the opinion of Lord Chesterfield); but they
                    were such as Englishmen love. Alike in planning and in executing, he took
                    infinite pains in all points of detail. Nothing escaped his observation, and in
                    the hottest moment of the fight the coolness of his intellect shone conspicuous.
                    His enemies indeed affected to attribute his uniform success in the field, to
                    fortune, and they magnified his love of money by drawing up balance sheets which
                    included every penny which he had received, but omitted the pounds which he had
                    spent in the cause he had sincerely at heart. All that can be·</p>

                <p>alleged in excuse of his attempt to serve two masters, the king whom he had
                    deserted and the king who had received him into favour, is that not one of his
                    associates was without sin in this respect.</p>
                <p>The books on Marlborough are very numerous. Under his name in the catalogue of
                    the British Museum there are 121 entries, and 32 under that of his wife. The
                    chief works are Lediard’s, Coxe’s, and Alison’s <hi rend="italic">Lives</hi>; a
                    French memoir in 3 volumes, 1808; Marlborough’s <hi rend="italic">Letters and
                    Despatches,</hi> edited by Sir George Murray (5 volumes); and Mrs Creighton’s
                    interesting summary. The descriptions in Mr John Hill Burton’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reign of Queen Anne</hi> of the battle scenes of Marlborough are from personal
                    observation. A good account of his birthplace and country will be found in
                    Pulman’s <hi rend="italic">Rook of the Axe District</hi>; and for the home of
                    the duchess the reader can refer to Mr Cussan’s <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Hertfordshire.</hi> Long after the death of the duke there were many pamphlets
                    written on the conduct of his wife from her appearance at court; but they relate
                    to matters of little interest at the present time. (W. P. C.)</p>
