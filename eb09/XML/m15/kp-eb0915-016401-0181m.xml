                    1811-1870), subject and history painter, was born at Cork, the son of a Highland
                    soldier.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The year of his
                    birth is uncertain; he himself used to assert that the 25th of January 1811 was
                    the correct date, but research in the register of the old Presbyterian church in
                    Cork seems to prove that he was born on 2d February 1806.</p></note> His
                    education was of the plainest kind, but he was eager for culture, fond of
                    reading, and anxious to become an artist. His father, however, placed him, in
                    1820, in Newenham’s Bank, where he remained for two years, and then left to
                    study in the Cork school of art. In 1825 it happened that Sir Walter Scott was
                    travelling in Ireland, and young Maclise, having seen him in a bookseller’s
                    shop, made a surreptitious sketch of the great man, which he afterwards
                    lithographed. It was exceedingly popular, and the artist became celebrated
                    enough to receive many commissions for portraits, which he executed, in pencil,
                    with very careful treatment of detail and accessory. Various influential friends
                    perceived the genius and promise of the lad, and were anxious to furnish him
                    with the means of studying in the metropolis; but with rare independence he
                    refused all aid, and by careful economy saved a sufficient sum to enable him to
                    leave for London. There he made a lucky hit by a sketch of the younger Kean,
                    which, like his portrait of Scott, was lithographed and published. He entered
                    the Academy schools in 1828, and carried off the highest prizes open to the
                    students, including, in 1829, the gold medal for the best historical
                    composition. In the same year he exhibited for the first time in the Royal
                    Academy. Gradually he began to confine himself more exclusively to subject and
                    historical pictures, varied occasionally by portraits of Campbell, Miss Landon,
                    Dickens, and other of his celebrated literary <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0182-0165"/> friends. In 1833 he exhibited Snap Apple Night,
                    or All Hallow Eve in Ireland, and Mokanna Unveiling his Features to Zelica,
                    which greatly increased his reputation, and were followed in the succeeding year
                    by the powerfully dramatic subject of the Installation of Captain Rock, and in
                    1835 by the Chivalric Vow of the Ladies and the Peacock, a work which procured
                    his election as associate of the Academy, of which he became full member in
                    1840. The years that followed were occupied with a long series of figure
                    pictures, deriving their subjects from history and tradition, and from the works
                    of Shakespeare, Goldsmith, and Le Sage. He also designed illustrations for
                    Moore’s <hi rend="italic">Irish Melodies,</hi> Lytton’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pilgrims of the Rhine,</hi> and several of Dickens’s Christmas books, and for
                    <hi rend="italic">The Story of the Norman Conquest</hi> and Shakespeare’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Seven Ages,</hi> published by the Art Union. Between the years
                    1830 and 1836 he contributed to <hi rend="italic">Fraser's Magazine,</hi> under
                    the <hi rend="italic">nοm-de crayon</hi> of Alfred Croquis, a very remarkable
                    series of portraits of the literary and other celebrities of the time,—character
                    studies, etched or lithographed in outline, and touched more or less with the
                    emphasis of the caricaturist, which have been since reproduced and published in
                    a volume. In 1858 Maclise commenced one of the two great monumental works of his
                    life, the Meeting of Wellington and Blücher, on the walls of Westminster Palace,
                    where he had previously painted his Spirit of Religion and his Spirit of
                    Chivalry. It was begun in fresco, a process which proved unmanageable. The
                    artist wished to resign the task; but, encouraged by Prince Albert, he studied
                    in Berlin the new method of “water-glass’’painting, and carried out the subject
                    and its companion, the Death of Nelson, in that medium, completing the latter
                    painting in 1864. The intense application which he gave to these great historic
                    works, and the various depressing and discouraging circumstances connected with
                    the commission, had a serious effect on the artist’s health. He began to shun
                    the company in which he formerly delighted; his old buoyancy of spirits was
                    gone; and when, in 1865, the presidentship of the Academy was offered to him, he
                    declined the honour. In 186S he exhibited the Sleep of Duncan, and in 1869 his
                    King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid. Having finished the Earls of Desmond and
                    Ormond, he was attacked by acute pneumonia, which carried him off, after a brief
                    illness, on the 25th April 1870.</p>
                <p>The works of Maclise are distinguished by powerful intellectual and imaginative
                    qualities, but most of them are marred by harsh and dull colouring, by metallic
                    hardness of surface and texture, and by frequent touches of the theatrical in
                    the action and attitudes of the figures. His fame rests most securely on his two
                    greatest works at Westminster. A memoir of the artist by his friend W. J.
                    O’Driscoll was published in 1871.</p>
