                <p><label type="entry">MARNE</label>, a department of the north-east of France, made
                    up from Champagne-Pouilleuse, Rémois, Perthois, Vallage, and La
                    Brie-Charnpenoise, districts formerly belonging to Champagne. Its chief town,
                    Châlons-sur-Marne, is 92 miles in a direct line east of Paris. Bounded on the W.
                    by Seine-et-Marne and Aisne, on the N. by Ardennes, on the E. by Meuse, on the
                    S. by Haute-Marne and Aube, it is situated between 48° 3Γ and 49° 26' N. lat.,
                    and 3° 25' and 5° E. long. Its greatest length front north-east to south-west is
                    73 miles, and the area 3159 square miles. About one half of this consists of
                    Champagne-Pouilleuse, a monotonous and barren plain covering a bed of chalk 1300
                    feet in thickness. On the west and on the east it is commanded by two ranges of
                    hills. The highest point in the department (920 feet) is in the hill district of
                    Rheims, which rises to the south-west of the town of the same name, between the
                    Vesle and the Marne. The lowest level (164 feet), where the Aisne leaves the
                    department, is not far distant. To the south of the Marne the hills of Rheims
                    are continued by the heights of La Brie (700 to 800 feet). All these belong
                    geologically to the basin of Paris. They slope gently towards the west, but
                    command the plain of Champagne-Pouilleuse by a steep descent on the east. On the
                    further side of the plain are the heights of Argonne (860 feet), formed of beds
                    of the Lower Chalk, and covered by forests; they unite the calcareous formations
                    of Langres to the schists of Ardennes, and a continuation of them stretches
                    southward into Perthois and the marshy Bocage. The department belongs entirely
                    to the Seine basin, but of that river there are only 13 miles, in the
                    south-west; it there receives the Aube, which has 10 miles within the
                    department. The principal river is the Marne, which runs through the department
                    for 105 miles in a great sweep concave to the south-west, passing
                    Vitry-le-François, Châlons, Épernay, and Dormans. In its course through the
                    department it falls from 410 to 213 feet. The principal tributaries are the
                    Saulx (which receives the Ornain) on the right, and on the left the Blaise,
                    which waters Vassy, the Somme Soude, and the Surmeliu (with its tributary the
                    Dhuis), whence Paris is supplied; besides the Petit Morin and the Grand Morin.
                    Of the last three only the upper courses lie within the department. The Aisne
                    enters the department at a point 12 miles from its source, and traverses it for
                    35 miles, watering Ste Menehould. Two of its affluents on the left, the Suippe
                    and the Vesle, on which stands Rheims, have a longer course from south-east to
                    north-west across the department.</p>
                <p>Marne lias the climate of the region of the Seine; the annual mean temperature is
                    50° Fahr., the rainfall about 24 inches. Of the total area about three-fourths
                    consists of arable land, and a sixth is under forest, whilst a twenty-fifth is
                    meadow land. Vineyards cover 63’7 square miles. The department is largely
                    stocked with sheep (536,000, of which 133,000 are a mixed merino breed, whose
                    wool is used in the manufacture of merinoes, flannels, and cashmeres). Cattle
                    are estimated to number 95,260; horses, 53,000; pigs, 62,000; goats, 6000; and
                    asses, 6000; these last are used in the narrow pathways which intersect the
                    vineyards. About 600,000 ft&gt; of honey and 240,000 lb of wax are produced. The
                    vineyards, though not of great extent, are of high value from the quality of
                    their products. The manufacture of the sparkling wines of Champagne is an
                    important industry, of which Épernay, Rheims, and Chalons are the chief centres.
                    The yearly exportation is about 20,000,000 bottles, at the average value of half
                    a crown a bottle. Cereals are grown in excess of the local consumption. Corn,
                    hay, rye, barley, potatoes, and beetroot are the chief crops. Several communes
                    supply the more valuable vegetables. In 1881 the produce of wine was more than
                    14⅜ million .gallons. The principal orchard fruits are the apple, plum, and
                    cherry. Pine woods are largely planted in Champagne-Pouilleuse. The department
                    produces iron ore, phosphate of lime, quantities of turf, and excellent
                    millstones and stone for building.</p>
                <p>The chief industry is that in wool, which has brought together, in the
                    neighbourhood of Rheims, establishments for spinning, carding, dyeing, and
                    weaving. The materials wrought are flannels, merinoes, tartans, shawls, rugs,
                    and fancy articles. In 1879 the aggregate length of the various stuffs measured
                    at Rheims was 12,198 miles. This business alone occupies 30,000 operatives in
                    the department, and produces annually nearly 800,000 pieces, valued at
                    £18,000,000. Hosiery in woollen employs 420 looms, and in cotton 1800. Marne
                    contains blast-furnaces, iron, copper, and bell foundries, and manufactories of
                    agricultural implements. Besides these there are tanyards, currying and
                    leather-dressing establishments, and glassworks, which, with sugar-works and
                    breweries, complete the list of the most important industries. Biscuits and
                    gingerbread are a specialty of Rheims. The chief imports are wool, coal, and
                    colonial wares; the exports are wine, grain, live stock, stone, whiting,
                    pit-props, and woollen stuffs. Transport is supplied by the river Marne and the
                    canal connecting it with the Rhine and with the Aisne, and by 300 miles of
                    railway. The population in 1881 was 421,027, an increase of 116,371 since 1801.
                    There are five arrondissements—those of Chalons (the chef-lieu), Épernay,
                    Rheims, Ste Menehould, and Vitry-le-François. The department belongs partly to
                    the archbishopric of Rheims and partly to the see of Chalons. Chalons is the
                    headquarters of the 6th army corps; to the north of the town is the great camp
                    devoted to military exercises.</p>
