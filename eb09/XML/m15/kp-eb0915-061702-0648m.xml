                    the Siècle de Louis Quatorze. It is noteworthy that, like the majority of the
                    great pulpit orators of his own and the preceding generation, he was a
                    southerner. His father, François Massillon, was a notary, and he appears to have
                    been well educated. In 1681 he joined the congregation of the Oratory, which at
                    that time had a high reputation. But, although he had thus chosen <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n649/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0649-0618"/> an order where the rules were by no means strict,
                    he was not anxious for easy living or secular renown. The credit which he
                    received for his first efforts at preaching startled him, and he sought a much
                    more severe discipline, one indeed which is said to have been of Trappist
                    rigour. Accident, however, made his literary and oratorical talents known to the
                    Cardinal de Noailles, who determined that,the church should not lose so well
                    qualified a defender. In obedience to the cardinal, Massillon left the abbey of
                    Septfonds, rejoined the Oratory, and was introduced to the Parisian seminary of
                    Saint Magloire in 1696 He was soon set to work to preach in the Paris churches,
                    and his reputation spread rapidly from city to court. He preached before Louis
                    XIV, for the first time in Advent 1699. He made a profound impression, and it is
                    reported that his generous elder, Bourdaloue, from whom Massillon himself had
                    learnt much, said of him, “He must increase, but I must decrease.” His fame,
                    however, did not lead to immediate preferment. In the first place, the
                    Oratorians were on bad terms with the Jesuits, and were considered too liberal
                    to suit the reign of gloomy pietism and severe orthodoxy in which Louis’s
                    dissolute life closed. In the second, Massillon was neither a flatterer, nor did
                    he resort to the abrupt denunciation of vice which had succeeded in the case of
                    some of his predecessors. Indeed, in the last years of the reign there was
                    nothing (so far as the king was concerned) to denounce, unless it were an excess
                    of orthodoxy. Louis’s famous saying that other preachers made him pleased with
                    them, but that Massillon made him displeased with himself, may have been merely
                    a <hi rend="italic">mot,</hi> but it may also have expressed an involuntary
                    truth. However this may be, Massillon, who perhaps desired no office, received
                    none as long as the old king lived. The regency was much more favourable to him,
                    and in 1717 he was nominated to the see of Clermont, with the additional honour
                    of being commissioned to preach the next year’s <hi rend="italic">Petit</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Carême</hi> or series of short Lent sermons before the young Louis
                    XV. Bishop in 1717, Lent preacher in 1718, Massillon received in 1719 a yet
                    further honour, though this time a secular one, by being elected to the Academy.
                    Various causes, however, combined to remove him from Paris. His own standard of
                    duty was high, and he was not likely in any case to have acquiesced in the
                    position of a non-resident bishop; the court grew more and more dissolute; and
                    his advance in years must have somewhat disqualified him from preaching and
                    travelling. He delivered but few sermons in Paris after the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Petit</hi><hi rend="italic">Carême,</hi> and preached there for the last time
                    in 1723, when he pronounced the funeral oration of the duchess-dowager of
                    Orleans. The twenty years of life which remained to him were spent at Clermont,
                    where he was distinguished for all good works, especially for exacting the
                    minimum of episcopal dues and expending the maximum on charity.</p>
                <p>Massillon’s works are made up for the most part of sermons, lectures, synodal
                    addresses, and the like. They have been repeatedly edited, and are easily
                    accessible in two large volumes published by Didot. As a pulpit orator, if not
                    as a theologian, Massillon probably deserves the highest rank among Frenchmen.
                    His style is very nearly perfect, uniting the polish of the later age of Louis
                    XIV. with the vigour of the earlier. His thoughts are original and just, and the
                    arrangement of his discourses lucid and orderly without being unduly scholastic.
                    He has usually been contrasted with his predecessor Bourdaloue, the latter
                    having the credit of vigorous denunciation, Massillon of gentle persuasiveness.
                    But few preachers can have excelled him in vigour when he chose to be stern.
                    Besides the <hi rend="italic">Petit</hi><hi rend="italic">Carême,</hi> his
                    sermons on the Prodigal Son, on Death, for Christmas Day, for the Fourth Sunday
                    in Advent, may be cited as perhaps his masterpieces. But in truth Massillon is
                    singularly free from inequality. His great literary power, his reputation for
                    benevolence, and his known toleration and dislike of doctrinal disputes caused
                    him to be much more favourably regarded than most churchmen by the <hi
                    rend="italic">philosophes</hi> of the 18th century. He acquired the surname of
                    the Racine of the pulpit, but extreme purity of style is almost the only point
                    of contact between the two writ es.</p>
