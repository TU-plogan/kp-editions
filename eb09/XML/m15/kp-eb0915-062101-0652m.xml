                <p><label type="entry">MASTIC, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Mastich</hi></label>, a
                    resinous exudation obtained from the lentisk, <hi rend="italic">Pistacia
                    Lentiscus,</hi> an evergreen shrub of the natural order <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anacardiacex.</hi> Thelentisk or mastic plantis indigenous to the Mediterranean
                    coast region from Syria to Spain, but grows also in Portugal, Morocco, and the
                    Canaries. Although experiments have proved that excellent mastic might be
                    obtained in other islands in the archipelago, the production of the drug has
                    been, since the time of Dioscorides, almost exclusively confined to the island
                    of Scio. The mastic districts of that island are for the most part flat and
                    stony, with little hills and few streams. The shrubs are about 6 feet high. The
                    resin is contained in the bark and not in the wood, and in order to obtain it
                    numerous vertical incisions are made, during June, July, and August, in the stem
                    and chief branches. The resin speedily exudes and hardens into roundish or oval
                    tears, which are collected, after about fifteen days, by women and children, in
                    little baskets lined with white paper or cotton wool. The ground around the
                    trees is kept hard and clean, and flat pieces of stone are often laid beneath
                    them to prevent any droppings of resin from becoming contaminated with dirt. The
                    collection is repeated three or four times between June and September, a fine
                    tree being found to yield about 8 or 10 ft&gt; of mastic during the season.
                    Besides that obtained from the incisions, mastic of very fine quality
                    spontaneously exudes from the small branches. The harvest is affected by showers
                    of rain during the period of collection, and the trees are much injured by
                    frost, which is, however, of rare occurrence in the districts where they
                    grow.</p>
                <p>Four qualities of mastic are recognized by the dealers in Scio.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Cake,</hi> consisting of large pieces, sold chiefly for use
                    in the seraglios, being chewed by women of all ranks throughout the Turkish
                    empire, for the purpose of imparting an agreeable odour to the breath. This
                    quality is worth 120 to 130 piastres per oke (of 2‘83 lb) or even more.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Large tears,</hi> worth 90 to 100 piastres.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Small tears,</hi> valued at 75 to 80 piastres.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">4.</hi> Mastic mixed with fragments of leaves and sand, chiefly
                    consumed in the manufacture of the Turkish liqueur, or mastic brandy, called <hi
                    rend="italic">raki,</hi> and other cordials.</p>
                <p>The third sort, in small tears, is that which is chiefly exported to England, the
                    first and second qualities being sent to Turkey, especially Constantinople, also
                    to Trieste, Vienna, and Marseilles.</p>
                <p>These varieties are known to the dealers as κυλιστό, φλ&lt;σκcfp&lt;, πijττα, and
                    &lt;∕&gt;λoυδα respectively.</p>
                <p>Mastic still forms the principal revenue of Scio. In 1871, 28,000 lb of picked
                    and 42,000 lb of common were exported from that island, the former being worth
                    6s. 10d. and the latter 2s. 10d. per lb. The average price in London varies from
                    2s. 6d. to 4s. 6d. per lb.</p>
                <p>During the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries mastic enjoyed a high reputation as a
                    medicine, and formed an ingredient in a large number of medical compounds, but
                    its use in medicine is now almost obsolete.</p>
                <p>Mastic occurs in English commerce in the form of roundish tears about the size of
                    peas, some of them, however, being oblong or pear-shaped. They are transparent,
                    with a glassy fracture, of a pale yellow or faint greenish tinge, which darkens
                    slowly by age. When chewed they rapidly soften, by which character they are
                    easily distinguished from Sandarac resin, which while bearing a strong
                    resemblance to mastic occurs in tears of a more cylindrical shape. The mastic
                    which has been imported of late years presents a bright glassy appearance from
                    having been washed free from dust.</p>
                <p>Mastic is soluble in turpentine, chloroform, ether, acetone, and oil of cloves;
                    but cold alcohol dissolves only 90 per cent, of it. The soluble portion is
                    called <hi rend="italic">Alpha resin</hi> (C <hi rend="superscript"> 20</hi> H
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 32</hi> O <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>), and possesses
                    acid properties. The insoluble portion, <hi rend="italic">Beta resin or
                    Masticin,</hi> is somewhat less rich in oxygen, and is a translucent colourless
                    tough substance insoluble in caustic alkali.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pistacia</hi><hi rend="italic">Khinjuk,</hi> Stocks, and <hi
                    rend="italic">P. cabuliea,</hi> St., trees growing throughout Sindh,
                    Baluchistan, and Cabul, yield a kind of mastic which is met with in the Indian
                    bazaars under the name of <hi rend="italic">Mustagi-τunιi, i.e.,</hi> Roman
                    mastic. This when met with in the European market is known as East Indian or
                    Bombay mastic. In Algeria <hi rend="italic">P. atlantica,</hi> Desf., yields a
                    solid resin, which is collected and used by the Arabs as a masticatory. Cape
                    mastic, used by the colonists, but not exported to England, is the produce of
                    <hi rend="italic">Eτtryops</hi><hi rend="italic">multifidus,</hi> the resin
                    bush, or <hi rend="italic">lιarpuis bosch,</hi> of the Boers,·—a plant of the
                    composite order growing abundantly in the Clanwilliam district. Dammar resin is
                    sometimes sold under the name of mastic. The West Indian mastic tree is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bursera gummifera,</hi> and the Peruvian mastic is <hi
                    rend="italic">Schinus</hi><hi rend="italic">Molle,</hi> but neither of these
                    furnishes commercial resins.</p>
