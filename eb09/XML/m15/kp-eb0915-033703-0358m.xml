                    (1628—1694), of Bologna, was one of the first to apply the microscope to the
                    study of animal and vegetable structure; his discoveries are so numerous and
                    important that he may be considered to be the founder of microscopic anatomy.
                    Shortly before his death, he drew up a long account of his academical and
                    scientific labours, correspondence, and controversies, and committed it to the
                    charge of the Royal Society of London, a body with which he had been in intimate
                    relations for more than twenty years. The autobiography, along with some other
                    posthumous writings, was published in London in 1696, at the cost of the
                    Society. The personal details left by Malpighi are few and dry. His narrative is
                    mainly occupied with a summary of his scientific contributions and an account of
                    his relations to contemporary anatomists, and is entirely without graces of
                    style or elements of ordinary human interest. He was born in the country, about
                    20 miles to the north of Bologna, on the 10th of March 1628. At the age of
                    seventeen he began the study of the Aristotelian philosophy, and continued it
                    for four years; it appears from another statement that he was in the habit of
                    amusing himself with the microscope during this period. Owing to domestic
                    circumstances, it became necessary for him, in 1649, to choose a profession, and
                    he elected to study medicine; after four years study at Bologna he graduated
                    there as doctor. He at once applied to be admitted to lecture in the university,
                    but it was not till after three years (1656) that his request was granted. A few
                    months later he was appointed to the chair of theoretical medicine at Pisa,
                    where he enjoyed the friendship and countenance of Borelli. At the end of four
                    years he left Pisa, on the ground of ill-health, and returned to Bologna. A call
                    to be professor primarius at Messina (procured for him through Borelli, who had
                    in the meantime become professor there) induced him to leave Bologna in 1662.
                    His engagement at Messina was for a term of four years, at an annual stipend of
                    1000 scudi. An attempt was made to retain him at Messina beyond that <pb

                    native university, and he spent the next twenty-five years there. In 1691, being
                    then in his sixty-fourth year, and in failing health, he removed to Rome to
                    become private physician to Pope Innocent XII., and he died there of apoplexy
                    three years later. In the portrait prefixed to his autobiography, the features
                    are those of the phlegmatic type. His addiction to the microscope brought him
                    into conflict with the respectabilities of the medical profession, including two
                    of his colleagues at Bologna, whose names have been preserved from oblivion; it
                    was felt by those who affected to watch over the future welfare of medicine that
                    the study of microscopic anatomy was adverse to the true interests of medical
                    practice, and that feeling is said to have found expression in a duel that was
                    fought between the brother of Malpighi and a near relative of one of his
                    conservative colleagues, in which the latter combatant was killed. Amid such
                    incidents was the fruitful microscopic era of medical and biological science
                    ushered in.</p>
                <p>The compound, microscope (invented in the Netherlands) had been used in Italy
                    (Rome) to study the parts and organs of the bee as early as 1625, and it was
                    employed by Malpighi and by his contemporaries Hooke (botanist) and Leeuwenhoek;
                    the illuminatiβn of the objects was always direct, the mirror being a much later
                    addition, and the tube was of unwieldy length. Owing to the inability to
                    overcome spherical and chromatic aberration in compound lenses, the simple
                    microscope came again into common use, and continued to be the chief instrument
                    in the study of minute anatomy until the introduction of flint-and-crown glass
                    lenses by English opticians about a century later. It was Malpighi’s practice to
                    open animals alive, and some of his most striking discoveries were made under
                    those circumstances. Although Harvey had correctly inferred the existence of the
                    capillary circulation, he had never seen it; it was reserved for Malpighi in
                    1661 (four years after Harvey’s death) to see for the first time the marvellous
                    spectacle of the blood coursing through a network of small tubes on the surface
                    of the lung and of the distended urinary bladder of the frog. We are enabled to
                    measure the difficulties of microscopic observation at the time by the fact that
                    it took Malpighi four years longer to reach a clear understanding of the
                    corpuscles in the frog’s blood, although they are the parts of the blood by
                    which its movement in the capillaries is made visible. His discovery of the
                    capillary circulation was given to the world in the form of two letters <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Pulmonibus,</hi> addressed to Borelli,
                    published at Bologna in 1661 and reprinted at Leyden and other places in the
                    years following; the letters to Borelli contained also the first account of the
                    vesicular structure of the human lung, and they made a theory of respiration for
                    the first time possible. The achievement that comes next both in importance and
                    in order of time was a demonstration of the plan of structure of secreting
                    glands; against the current opinion (revived by Ruysch forty years later) that
                    the glandular structure was essentially that of a closed vascular coil from
                    which the secretion exuded, he maintained that the secretion was formed in
                    terminal acini standing in open communication with the ducts. The name of
                    Malpighi is still associated with his discovery of the soft or mucous character
                    of the lower stratum of the epidermis, of the vascular coils in the cortex of
                    the kidney, and of the follicμlar bodies in the spleen. He was the first to
                    attempt the finer anatomy of the brain, and his descriptions of the distribution
                    of grey matter and of the fibre-tracts in the cord, with their extensions to the
                    cerebrum and cerebellum, are distinguished by accuracy; but his microscopic
                    study of the grey matter conducted him to the opinion that it was of glandular
                    structure and that it secreted the “vital spirits.” At an early period he
                    applied himself to vegetable histology as an introduction to the more difficult
                    study of the animal tissues, and he was acquainted with the spiral vessels of
                    plants in 1662. It was not till 1671 that he wrote his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anatome</hi><hi rend="italic">Plantarum</hi> and sent it to the Royal Society,
                    who published it in the following year. An English work under a similar title
                    <hi rend="italic">(Anatomy of Vegetables)</hi> had been published in London a
                    few months earlier, by Nehemiah Grew; so that Malpighi’s priority as a vegetable
                    histologist is not so incontestable as it is in animal histology. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Anatome</hi><hi rend="italic">Plantarum</hi> contained an
                    appendix, <hi rend="italic">Observationes</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ovo incubato,</hi> which gave an account (with good plates) of the
                    development of the chick (especially of the later stages) in many points more
                    complete than that of Harvey, although the observations were needlessly lessened
                    in value by being joined to the metaphysical notion of “praedelinea-tion” in the
                    undeveloped ovum. His works are— <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
