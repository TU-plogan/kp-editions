                    rend="italic">Sapindaceae.</hi> The genus includes about fifty species, natives
                    of Europe, North America, North Asia, especially the Himalayas and Japan (Benth.
                    and Hook., <hi rend="italic">Gen. Pl.,</hi> i. 409). Maples are for the most
                    part trees with palmately-lobed leaves. The flowers are in corymbs or
                    racemes,—the lowermost mostly male, the terminal bisexual. The fruit is a
                    two-winged “samara.”</p>
                <p>The earliest known maples occur in the Miocene strata of Oeningen, where nineteen
                    species have been discovered, —a greater number than occurs in any one district
                    at the present day (Lyell’s <hi rend="italic">El. of Geol.,</hi> 6th ed. p.
                    250). A typical species appears to have been <hi rend="italic">Acer

                    >{Flora Tert. IIelv.,</hi> pl. 114). This had many marked varieties, of which
                    leaves, flowers, and fruit have all been discovered. The foliage was even
                    attacked by a fungus, <hi rend="italic">Rhytisma</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The common maple, <hi rend="italic">A. campestre,</hi> I.., is the only species
                    indigenous to Great Britain. This and the sycamore were described by Gerard in
                    1597 <hi rend="italic">(Herball,</hi> p. 1299), the latter being “a stranger to
                    England.” Many species have been introduced, especially from Japan, for
                    ornamental purposes. The following are more especially worthy of notice.</p>

                    I.., the common maple, is common in hedgerows, but not often seen as a tree
                    (see, however, Loudon, <hi rend="italic">Arboretum,</hi> vol. i. p. 430). Loudon
                    gives four varieties,— the downy-fruited, the variegated, the hill-inhabiting,
                    and the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n551/mode/1up"

                    Caucasus, and northern Asia. The wood is excellent fuel, and makes the best
                    charcoal. It is compact, of a tine grain, sometimes beautifully veined, and
                    takes a high polish. Hence it has been celebrated from antiquity for tables,
                    &amp;c. The wood of the roots is frequently knotted, and valuable for small
                    objects of cabinet work. The young shoots, being flexible and tough, are
                    employed in France as whips. <hi rend="italic">A. pseudo-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Platanus,</hi> I.., the sycamore, or great maple, is a handsome tree of quick
                    growth, with a smooth bark. The leaves are large, with finely acute and serrated
                    lobes, affording abundant shade. Its longevity is from one hundred and forty to
                    two hundred years. 11 is found in variou⅛ parts of Europe in wooded mountainous
                    situations. The wood when young is white, but old heart-wood is yellow or
                    brownish. Like the common maple it is hard and takes a high polish. It is much
                    prized by wheelwrights, cabinetmakers, sculptors, &amp;c., on the Continent,
                    while knotted roots are used for inlaying. Sugar has been obtained from the sap
                    of this as from other species, the most being one ounce from a quart of sap. The
                    latter has also been made into wine in the Highlands of Scotland. There are many
                    varieties, the variegated and cut-leaved being the most noticeable (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Gard. Chron.,</hi> 1881, p. 229). For remarkable variations in the
                    number of cotyledons arising from fusion, see a paper by the ]ate Prof. J. S.
                    Henslow in <hi rend="italic">Mag. Nat. Hist.,</hi> vol. v. p. 346. <hi
                    rend="italic">A. Platanoides,</hi> I.., the Norway maple (Loudon, <hi
                    rend="italic">l.c.,</hi> p. 408; <hi rend="italic">Gard. Chron.,</hi> 1881, p.
                    564), is met with from Norway to Italy, Greece, central and south Russia. It was
                    introduced into Britain in 1683. It is a lofty tree (from 40 to 70 feet),
                    resembling the sycamore, but with yellow flowers, and more spreading wings to
                    the fruit. There are several varieties. The wood is used for the same purposes
                    as that of the sycamore. Sugar has been made from the sap in Norway and Sweden.
                    The leaves of this species, in common with those of the sycamore especially, and
                    perhaps all others, are liable to produce honeydew, which appears to be
                    extravasated cell-sap. The present writer suggests that the starch formed in the
                    leaves may be rapidly converted into sugar, which is then condensed on the
                    surface of the leaf under excessive transpiration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Asiatic Species.—</hi> Thirteen species are described by Hiern,

                    some species is used, as that of <hi rend="italic">A. laevigatum,</hi> Wall.,
                    for building; that of <hi rend="italic">A. caesium,</hi> Wall., being soft,

                    >A.</hi><hi rend="italic">pictum,</hi> Thunb., is white, light, and
                    fine-grained.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Japanese Species.—</hi> Species, and many varieties, especially
                    of <hi rend="italic">A.</hi><hi rend="italic">palmatum,</hi> Thunb., generally
                    known as <hi rend="italic">polymorphum,</hi> with variously laciniated and more
                    or less coloured foliage, have lately been introduced as ornamental shrubs. The
                    original species was introduced in 1832. The branches and corolla are purple,
                    the fruit woolly. The foliage of the typical form is bright green with very
                    pointed lobes. It occurs in the central mountains of Nippon and near Nagasaki.
                    Beautiful varieties have been introduced under the names <hi rend="italic">A. P.
                    ampelopsifolium, atropurpurcum,</hi><hi rend="italic">dissectum,</hi> &amp;c.
                    They are remarkable for the coppery purple tint that pervades the leaves and
                    young growths of some of the varieties (for figs., see <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catalogue of Hardy Trees,</hi> &amp;c., by Messrs Veitch). Of other Japanese

                <p><hi rend="italic">North American Species.—A. saccharinum,</hi> I.., the sugar,
                    rock, or bird’s-eye maple, was introduced in 1735. It sometimes attains to 70 or
                    even over 100 feet, more commonly 50 to 60 feet. It is remarkable for the
                    whiteness of the bark. The wood is white, but acquires a rosy tinge after
                    exposure to light. The grain is fine and close, and when polished has a silky
                    lustre. The timber is used instead of oak where the latter is scarce, and is
                    employed for axletrees and spokes, as well as for Windsor chairs, &amp;c. It
                    exhibits two accidental forms in the arrangement of the fibres, an undulated one
                    like those of the curled maple <hi rend="italic">(A. rubrum),</hi> and one of
                    spots which gives the name bird’s-eye. to the wood of this species. Like the
                    curled maple, it is used for inlaying mahogany. It is much prized for bedsteads,
                    writing desks, shoe lasts, &amp;c. The wood forms excellent fuel and charcoal,
                    while the ashes are rich in alkaline principles, furnishing a large proportion
                    of the potash exported from Boston and New York. Sugar is principally extracted
                    from this species, the sap being boiled and the syrup when reduced to a proper
                    consistence run into moulds to form cakes. Trees growing in low and moist
                    situations afford the most sap but least sugar. A cold north-west wind, with
                    frosty nights and sunny days in alternation, tends to incite the flow, which is
                    more abundant during the day than the night. A thawing night is said to promote
                    the flow, and it ceases during a south-west wind and at the approach of a storm;
                    and so sensitive are the trees to aspect and climatic variations that the flow
                    of sap on the south and east side has been noticed to be earlier than on the
                    north and west side of the same tree. The average quantity of sap per tree is
                    from 12 to 24 gallons in a season. For full details of the preparation, &amp;c.,
                    see Loudon, <hi rend="italic">l.c.,</hi> p. 413; and <hi rend="italic">Gard.
                    Chron.</hi> 1878, p. 137.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A. rubrum,</hi> I.., the red-flowering or scarlet maple, is a
                    middlesized tree, and was introduced in 1656. It is the first tree to blossom in
                    spring in North America. The wood, like that of other species, is applicable to
                    many purposes, as for the seats of Windsor chairs, turnery, &amp;c. The grain in
                    very old trees is sometimes undulated, which suggested the name of curled maple,
                    and gives beautiful effects of light and shade on polished surfaces. The most
                    constant use of curled maple is for the stocks of fowling pieces and rifles, as
                    it affords toughness and strength combined with lightness and elegance. The
                    inner bark is dusky red. On boiling, it yields a purple colour which with
                    sulphate of iron affords a black dye. The wood is inferior to that of the
                    preceding species in strength and as fuel. Sugar was made from the sap by the
                    French Canadians, but the production is only half as great as that from the
                    sugar maple (Michaux). In Britain it is cultivated as an ornamental tree, as
                    being conspicuous for its flowers in spring, and for its reel fruit and foliage
                    in autumn. <hi rend="italic">A. macrophyllum,</hi> Γursch., furnishes material
                    for hats, baskets, mats, &amp;c., from its inner bark, and the sap gives sugar.
