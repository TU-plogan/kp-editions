                    (French, <hi rend="italic">Pie),</hi> the prefix being the abbreviated form of a

                    animals, as this bird once was throughout Great Britain, though of late years
                    almost exterminated in many parts, and now nearly everywhere scarce. Its
                    pilfering habits have led to this result, yet the injuries it causes are
                    unquestionably exaggerated by common report; and in many countries of Europe it
                    is still the tolerated or even the cherished neighbour of every farmer, as it
                    formerly was in England if not in Scotland also. There is ample evidence<note

                    appeared there within a hundred years later, when Swift mentions its occurrences
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> to Stella, under date of 9th July 1711. It
                    is now common enough in that country, and there is a widespread but of course
                    unfounded belief that it was introduced by the English out of spite. It is a
                    species that when not molested is extending its range, as Wolley ascertained in
                    Lapland, where within the last century it has been gradually pushing its way
                    along the coast and into the interior from one fishing-station or settler’s
                    house to the next, as the country has been peopled.</p>
                <p>Since the persecution to which the Pie has been subjected in Great Britain, its
                    habits have undoubtedly altered greatly in character. It is no longer the merry,
                    saucy hanger-on of the homestead, as it was to writers of former days, who were
                    constantly alluding to its disposition, but is become the suspicious thief,
                    shunning the gaze of man, and knowing that danger may lurk in every bush. Hence
                    opportunities of observing it fall to the lot of few, and most persons know it
                    only as a curtailed captive in a wicker cage, where its vivacity and natural
                    beauty are lessened or wholly lost. At large few European birds possess greater
                    beauty, the pure white of its scapulars and inner web of the flightfeathers
                    contrasting vividly with the deep glossy black on the rest of its body and
                    wings, while its long tail is lustrous with green, bronze, and purple
                    reflexions. The Pie’s nest is a wonderfully ingenious structure, placed either
                    in high trees or low bushes, and so massively built that it will stand for
                    years. Its foundation consists of stout sticks, turf, and clay, wrought into a
                    deep, hollow cup, plastered with earth, and lined with fibres; but around this
                    is erected a firmly-interwoven, basket-like outwork of thorny sticks, forming a
                    dome over the nest, and leaving but a single hole in the side for entrance and
                    exit, so that the whole structure is rendered almost impregnable. Herein are
                    laid from six to nine eggs, of a pale bluish-green freckled with brown and
                    blotched with ash-colour. Superstition as to the appearance of the Pie still
                    survives even among many educated persons, and there are several versions of a
                    rhyming adage as to the various turns of luck which its presenting itself,
                    either alone or in company with others, is supposed to betoken, for some of
                    these versions contradict one another in details, though all agree in this that
                    the sight of a single Pie unquestionably presages sorrow.</p>
                <p>The Pie belongs to the same Family of birds as the <hi rend="smallcaps">Crow</hi>
                    (vol. vi. p. 617), and is the <hi rend="italic">Corvus pica</hi> of Linnaeus,

                    a distinct genus, but the number of species thereto belonging has been a
                    fruitful source of discussion. Examples from the south of Spain differ slightly
                    from those inhabiting the rest of Europe, and in some points more resemble the
                    <hi rend="italic">P. mauritanica</hi> of north-western Africa; but that species
                    has a patch of bare skin of a fine blue colour behind the eye, and much shorter
                    wings. No fewer than five species have been discriminated from various parts of
                    Asia, extending to Japan; but only one of them, the <hi rend="italic">P.
                    leucoptera</hi> of Turkestan and Tibet, has of late been admitted as valid. In
                    the west of North America, and in some of its islands, a Pie is found which
                    extends to the upper valleys of the Missouri and the Yellowstone, and has long
                    been thought entitled to specific distinction as <hi rend="italic">P.
                    hudsonia</hi>; but its claim thereto is now disallowed by some of the best
                    ornithologists of the United States, and it can hardly be deemed even a
                    geographical variety of the Old-World form. In California, however, there is a
                    permanent race if not a good species, <hi rend="italic">P. nuttalli,</hi> easily
                    distinguishable by its yellow bill and the bare yellow skin round its eyes; and
                    it is a curious fact that on two occasions in the year 1867 a bird apparently
                    similar was observed in Great Britain <hi rend="italic">(Zoologist,</hi> ser. 2,
