                        Frédéric</hi></label><hi rend="smallcaps">Louis Viesse de</hi> (1774-1852),
                    duke of Ragusa, and marshal of France, one of Napoleon’s earliest friends and
                    most trusted generals, was born at Châtillon-sur-Seine, on July 20, 1774. He was
                    the son of an ex-officer in the army, who belonged to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >i)etite noblesse,</hi> and had adopted the principles of the Revolution.
                    His love of soldiering soon showing itself, his father took him to Dijon to
                    learn mathematics prior to entering the artillery, and there he made the
                    acquaintance of Bonaparte, which he renewed after obtaining his commission when
                    he served in Toulon. The acquaintance ripened into intimacy; Marmont became
                    General Bonaparte’s aide-de-camp, and accompanied him to Italy and Egypt,
                    winning distinction and promotion as general of brigade. In 1799 he left Egypt
                    with Bonaparte to the mercy of the English; he was present at the revolution of
                    the 18th Brumaire, and organized the artillery for the expedition to Italy,
                    which he commanded with great effect at Marengo. For this he was at once made
                    general of division. In 1801 he became inspector-general of artillery, and in
                    1804 grand officer of the Legion of Honour. In 1805 he received the command of a
                    corps, with which he did good service at Ulm. He was then directed to occupy
                    Dalmatia with his army; he defeated the Russians on October 30 at Castel Nuovo,
                    and occupied Ragusa. The next five years were the most creditable in his life;
                    he was both military and civil governor of Dalmatia, and has still left traces
                    there both in great public works and in the memories of the people. In 1807 he
                    was made duke of Ragusa, and in 1809, being summoned up to the help of Napoleon,
                    who was closely beset in the island of Lobau, earned the marshal’s baton by his
                    conduct at Wagram. In July 1810 he was hastily summoned from his palace, where
                    he lived in Eastern luxury, to succeed Masséna in the command of the French army
                    in the north of Spain, called the army of Portugal. The skill with which he
                    manoeuvred his army during the year he commanded it has been always
                    acknowledged. His relief of Ciudad Rodrigo in the autumn of 1811 in spite of the
                    presence of the English army was a great feat, and in the tactics which preceded
                    the battle of Salamanca he had the best of it. The extension of his left on the
                    22d July 1812 was, however, fatal, and its result was the great defeat of
                    Salamanca, in which Marmont was severely wounded in the right arm and side. He
                    retired to France to recover, and was still hardly cured when in April 1813
                    Napoleon gave him the command of the 6th corps. With <pb break="no"

                    Bautzen, and Dresden, and throughout the great defensive campaign of 1814, until
                    the last desperate battle before the walls of Paris, from which he drew back his
                    forces to the commanding position of Essonne. Here he had 20,000 men in splendid
                    condition, and was the pivot of all thoughts. Napoleon said of Essonne, “C’est
                    là que viendront s’addresser toutes les intrigues, toutes les trahisons; aussi y
                    ai-je placé Marmont, mon enfant élevé sous ma tente.” Marmont betrayed this
                    trust and suffered for it. On the restoration of the Bourbons he was made a peer
                    of France, and a majorgeneral of the royal guard, and in 1820 a knight of St
                    Esprit and a grand officer of the order of St Louis, but he was never trusted,
                    never popular. He was the majorgeneral of the guard on duty in July 1830, and
                    was ordered to put down with a strong hand any opposition to the ordinances (see
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">France).</hi> After persevering some time he gave way,
                    and allowed the republicans to succeed in their revolution. This defection
                    brought more obloquy upon him, and the Due d’Angouleme even ordered him under
                    arrest, saying, “Will you betray us, as you betrayed him?” After this Marmont
                    left France and wandered about the Continent for twenty years, publishing many
                    volumes of travels, an edition of Caesar and of Xenophon, and his <hi

                    Much of his time was spent upon his <hi rend="italic">Mémoires,</hi> which are
                    of real value for the military history of his time, though they must be read as
                    a personal defence of himself in various junctures rather than as an unbiassed
                    account of his times. They show Marmont, as he really was, an embittered man,
                    who never thought his services sufficiently requited, a great artillery general
                    indeed, but without the fire of genius which is so striking in several of his
                    contemporaries, and above all, a man too much in love with himself and his own
                    glory to be a true friend or a faithful servant.</p>
