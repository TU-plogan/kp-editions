                <p>PART I.—SYNOPTICAL VIEW OF MEDICINE.</p>
                <p><hi> MEDICINE</hi>, the subject-matter of one of the learned professions,
                    includes, as it now stands, a wide range of scientific knowledge and practical
                    skill. The history of its growth from small beginnings in Greece is traced in
                    the second section of the present article; it remains here to give a synoptical
                    view of medicine, including its scientific or philosophical position, its
                    subdivisions or ramifications as an art and discipline, and its relations to the
                    body politic.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scientific Position of Medicine.—</hi> The science of medicine
                    is the theory of diseases and of remedies. While the notion of disease is
                    necessarily or inevitably correlated with the notion of health, there is no
                    necessary and invariable relation, but, on the other hand, a merely conventional
                    association, between a disease and a remedy. That part of the science of
                    medicine which corresponds to the theory of remedies is not therefore in a
                    position scientifically inferior to the theory of diseases; for each article of
                    the materia medica—apart from a few inert substances—has a certain effect on the
                    organism in health and in disease, which is ascertainable with scientific
                    precision. Those properties and actions of drugs are the subject of pharmacology
                    and toxicology; the circumstances under which the several articles of the
                    materia medica become remedial are the subject of therapeutics, and therapeutics
                    is dependent for its scientific position upon the completeness of the theory of
                    diseases, or pathology.</p>
                <p>Disease is the correlative of health, and the word is not capable of a more
                    penetrating definition. From the time of Galen, however, it has been usual to
                    speak of the life of the body either as proceeding in accordance with nature <hi
                    rend="italic">(κατά</hi><hi rend="italic">φvσι,v, secundum nal·uram)</hi> or as
                    overstepping the bounds of nature <hi rend="italic">(παρά</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >φvσιv,</hi><hi rend="italic">praeter</hi><hi rend="italic">naturam').</hi>
                    Taking disease to be a deflexion from the line of health, the first requisite of
                    medicine is an extensive and intimate acquaintance with the norm of the body.
                    The normal condition of the body is capable of being determined without
                    ambiguity; it is the absence from its structures and functions of every disease
                    hitherto known. The structure and functions of the body form the subject of
                    anatomy and physiology.</p>
                <p>Physiology is, strictly speaking, the science of that which is κατά <hi
                    rend="italic">φvσιv,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">secundum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >naturam,</hi> and it is usual to say that the theory of diseases is based upon
                    physiology. But, although all that was implied in the Hippocratic term <hi
                    rend="italic">φvσις (natιιra)</hi> may be claimed as the subject-matter of
                    physiology, yet, in the ordinary connotation of the term, physiology divides the
                    empire with anatomy. To physiology the functions of the body are usually
                    assigned, and to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n826/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0826-0795"/> anatomy its form and structure. But, as a matter
                    of fact, the structures and functions of the organism are not separable;
                    structure is correlated to function, whether active, dormant, or extinguished,
                    and in like manner function is the twin notion of structure. In the ultimate
                    analysis neither term means anything without the other, and both together mean
                    life. It is owing mostly to its name that physiology is supposed to have a
                    preponderant interest for the theory of disease; the word anatomy is not well
                    adapted to carry its own half of the structure* and-function dualism. Both in
                    the historical development and in the logical connotation, anatomy is as much
                    associated with the living and moving body as physiology itself; but its
                    etymology has always been against it, and it has become more and more difficult
                    to retain for anatomy anything beyond the technicalities of the dissecting-room.
                    The subject of general anatomy has for the most part disappeared from modern
                    text-books, its place being taken by histology, which deals with the minute
                    structure of the simple tissues, and, in a wider acceptation, with the finer
                    anatomy of all the organs and parts of the body. Histology, like anatomy, has
                    had a somewhat technical or descriptive rôle assigned to it; and it is now
                    mainly under physiology that the processes, activities, or living mechanisms of
                    the body fall to be considered. The development of the body as a whole, and of
                    its several tissues and organs, forms the subject of embryology; many of the
                    physiological types of diseased processes, especially the cellular, are
                    discoverable in the embryological period. For the-period of development, no
                    arbitrary separation has been attempted hitherto between structure and function,
                    and embryology is, in theory at least, as much physiological as anatomical. The
                    development of function is a legitimate and even desirable subject of scientific
                    study, and a more distinctive place is probably awaiting it in the future; but
                    so indissoluble does the union of structure and function present itself in the
                    period of genesis and growth that the function has hardly as yet come to be
                    abstracted from the structure, or the structure from the function.</p>
                <p>The theory of disease rests, therefore, upon physiology, with its more or less
                    technical adjuncts. Pathology is all that physiology is, with the engrossing and
                    difficult element of perturbation, deflexion, or shortcoming added. By virtue of
                    this element of deviation from the line of health, pathology is a discipline
                    apart, with an abundant literature of its own, and with separate academical
                    institutes and chairs. But pathology is also a discipline apart by virtue of
                    concepts proper to itself. A great part of the theory of disease deals with
                    changes or defects of structure and perturbations or failings of function, which
                    may be intricate or difficult to analyse, but are still well within sight of the
                    line of health. Such are the common diseases of the organs and systems—the
                    inflammations, catarrhs, degenerations, hypertrophies, and functional
                    derangements without lesion of the respiratory, circulatory, nervous,
                    genito-urinary, locomotor, and cutaneous systems. Constitutional or general
                    diseases belong also to the province of perturbations from the physiological
                    course,—such diseases as chlorosis, leukaemia, diabetes, gout, rheumatism,
                    scurvy, rickets, Addison’s disease, exophthalmic goitre, and the febrile state.
                    Again, congenital deficiencies or malformations, non-cancerous tumours, and the
                    repairing of injuries exemplify no other laws than those of development and
                    growth.</p>
                <p>But with those examples the catalogue of physiological diseases is exhausted. We
                    are left with a vast residue of diseases, which have always bulked largely in
                    the popular mind, and have carried the most terrible associations with them.
                    Such are the pestilences or diseases of peoples: — the plague, sweating
                    sickness, cholera, yellow fever, typhus fever, relapsing fever, typhoid fever,
                    diphtheria, small-pox, measles, scarlet fever, influenza, dengue. Such also are
                    the cancers, consumptions, leprosies, and other loathsome infections. This
                    enormous residue is more than the half of disease, and the definition of disease
                    or the scheme of pathology is brought to a test in finding room within its
                    scientific categories for such maladies as those. The popular imagination in all
                    countries has personified them; medicine in its metaphysical period has regarded
                    them as entities or things in themselves; and it remains to be seen in what way
                    or to what extent medicine in its scientific period will bring them within the
                    category of perturbations of the physiological life.</p>
                <p>In considering, for a moment, where to place cancer in the pathological scheme,
                    we shall arrive at a point of view from which the relation of the acute and
                    chronic infections (or contagions) to diseases of the physiological order may be
                    contemplated at least provisionally. Taking cancers, in a generic sense, to mean
                    tumours that have acquired or are possessed of malignancy, we find that such
                    tumours have many points in common with simple tumours,—that they have grown out
                    of the tissues of particular organs or parts under particular (functional)
                    circumstances, and that they may, in general terms, be traced back to that point
                    at which they left the line of health (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pathology).</hi>
                    The tracing back of tumours along the physiological track is often difficult and
                    laborious; but there is no tumour of the body whose origins are not at length
                    discoverable within the limits of physiological action. That which makes any
                    tumour a cancer is something over and beyond; it is a remarkable acquired
                    property of reproducing its structure in manifold copies, or of infecting the
                    organism of which it is itself a part. The tumour thus becomes a
                    semi-independent power within the body; it may be said, in a political figure,
                    to have acquired <hi rend="italic">autonomy,</hi> or to have become <hi
                    rend="italic">imperium in impei'io.</hi> A due consideration of such a
                    phenomenon as the infectiveness or cancerousness of some tumours will satisfy
                    one that there are concepts in pathology which carry the investigator entirely
                    beyond physiological bounds or out of sight of the line of health, which bring
                    him face to face with the notion of a disease as a thing in itself, and which
                    thus constitute a peculiar subject-matter. There is nothing that we know among
                    biological phenomena altogether analogous to the semiindependence which an
                    integral part of the body, or condition of the body, manifests towards the
                    organism as a whole, and that, too, strictly in respect of its acquired devious
                    or rebellious habit. The familiar definition of disease, <hi rend="italic"
                    >morbus</hi><hi rend="italic">est</hi><hi rend="italic">vita</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">praeter</hi><hi rend="italic">naturam,</hi> which embodies the
                    notion of divergence from the line of health, makes no provision for an acquired
                    autonomy of a morbid state; and that definition has to be supplemented by
                    another, which will recognize the possibility of a disease becoming a thing in
                    itself. The old definition of Van Helmont, <hi rend="italic">morbus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">est</hi><hi rend="italic">ens</hi><hi rend="italic">reale</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">subsistens</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >corpore,</hi> appears to satisfy the requirement; but that definition, although
                    it grew out of the phenomena of disease as observed in fevers, was made too
                    general, and has now associations that are too exclusively ontological and
                    metaphysical. The supplementary definition should be as far as possible in the
                    terms of the principal definition; and we shall provide best in the pathological
                    scheme for such a disease as cancer if, in addition to tho formula <hi
                    rend="italic">morbus</hi><hi rend="italic">est</hi><hi rend="italic">vita
                    prseter</hi><hi rend="italic">naturam,</hi> we construct a secondary formula,
                    <hi rend="italic">morbus</hi><hi rend="italic">est vivum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >in vivo.</hi></p>
                <p>The notion of autonomy acquired by a morbid state implies, naturally, a
                    pre-autonomous stage of the disease, which had been a mere perturbation of the
                    norm of tho body, capable of being measured by the physiological standard. The
                    autonomous stage and the pre-autonomous <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n827/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0827-0796"/> stage, which may be demonstrated, in individual
                    cases, for cancers, are a philosophical necessity for all other infective
                    diseases that are marked by morphological features, or by structural characters
                    rooted in and growing out of the proper textures of the body. Thus the peculiar
                    skin eruption of small-pox, which is communicable from person to person, along
                    with a distinctive course of fever, must have had pre-autonomous antecedents
                    (not altogether historically vague) in certain casual conditions of the skin and
                    associated constitutional disturbance, which had recurred and become inveterate,
                    and had so attained to a degree of individuality or a point of autonomy at which
                    they began to be propagated as an organic unit. Again, a second group of
                    infections, exemplified by glanders, bovine tubercle, and syphilis, are rooted
                    in deeper textural processes, which must have been at one time (and may still
                    be) set up by the casual operation of ordinary causes, and at length became the
                    occasion of infective mimicry. It is not so easy to picture (and it is not
                    difficult, with a modern dominant school, to ignore) the casual morbid
                    conditions or ordinary physiological perturbations out of which powerful
                    infections like cholera, typhoid fever, or yellow fever may have arisen; but if
                    the rise and consolidation of their autonomy be a subtle or even untraceable
                    history, yet there are diseases, such as dysentery and erysipelas, which are apt
                    to occur both as casual or spontaneous conditions and as specific infections
                    side by side. Ophthalmia is an example of a purulent catarrh which is constantly
                    arising <hi rend="italic">de novo</hi> in Egypt from local causes in a
                    non4nfective manner, and yet has become, on at least one memorable occasion, a
                    powerful and widespread infection for British troops returning from that country
                    and for the home garrisons for many years subsequently. Infective pneumonia in
                    cattle, and more rarely in man, is an analogous case. In such an episode we
                    observe the actual rise of the disease-autonomy. Again, all the infective
                    diseases have degrees of intensity, at one extreme of which there must occur the
                    vanishing point of their infective property; and those gradations of
                    infectiveness are nowhere more noticeable than in the relation of cholera to
                    choleraic diarrhoea. Further, the remarkable group of climatic fevers are not
                    communicable from person to person (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Malakia)</hi>; in
                    that respect, and for the reason that the liability of the patient is anything
                    but exhausted by one attack, they are examples of fevers without autonomy. There
                    is not one of the infections that may not be profitably studied from the point
                    of view of its autonomy, and of its more or less obscure pre-autonomous stage.
                    That is a point of view from which even the pestilences and other specific
                    diseases may be regarded as coming within the physiological categories. The
                    large residue of diseases, which are more than perturbations of the
                    physiological life, may still be joined by natural descent to the class of
                    simple perturbations, if we can show for them how their autonomy was acquired,
                    or what was their origin as diseasespecies.</p>
                <p>There is an established place in the history of medicine, and there ought
                    therefore to be room in the definition of &lt;lisease, for epidemic outbreaks of
                    purely psychical diseased states, such as the dancing madness <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Tanzwuth),</hi> and the boys’ crusades; the epidemic diffusion of such morbid
                    states is best approached from the point of view of an acquired autonomy (fixed
                    idea) and an infective mimicry.</p>
                <p>The physiological definition of disease, <hi rend="italic">morbus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">est</hi><hi rend="italic">vita prater</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >naturam,</hi> affords no place for parasitic diseases. However, the
                    supplementary formula that has been proposed to meet the case of diseases
                    existing autonomously in the body, <hi rend="italic">morbus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">est vivum</hi><hi rend="italic">in vivo,</hi> will meet the case
                    of parasitic diseases also. According to many pathologists of the present
                    generation, the whole class of pestilences, fevers, and specific infections
                    generally are caused by certain species of minute parasites invading the body;
                    according to one form of that hypothesis the distinctive characters or specific
                    marks (morphological and other) of those diseases are neither more nor less than
                    the appropriate effects wrought upon the textures and fluids of the body by the
                    respective species of parasites. In this way the great group of infective
                    diseases, which are apt to be the stumbling-block of a scientific definition and
                    logical scheme of disease, are easily disposed of by placing them beside the
                    otherwise insignificant group of parasitic diseases. Whether all or any of those
                    diseases are due in a sense to the invasion of parasites, or wholly caused by
                    parasites, are questions that naturally fall to be settled by a careful sifting
                    of a mass of evidence which has already proved to be peculiarly rich in
                    opportunities for mistake. It may be expected that the facts of infective
                    parasitism and the facts of acquired disease-autonomy will in the end find their
                    place in a common theory of specific diseases, which might be expressed in terms
                    of the physiological formula <hi rend="italic">morbus</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The theory of remedies, which forms the second division of the science of
                    medicine, is chiefly based upon pharmacology or toxicology. If pharmacology be
                    considered as not co-extensive with toxicology, it will be taken tobe in great
                    part pharmacographia, or the systematic description of articles of the materia
                    medica—their source, preparation, physical properties, and the like. Toxicology
                    is in its general sense the investigation of the physiological action of drugs,
                    a science which is largely dependent upon experiments on the lower animals; in a
                    more technical sense toxicology relates to the effects of poisons and the art of
                    detecting them (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Poisons).</hi> The physiological action
                    of drugs is the key to their therapeutical action. Therapeutics has been defined
                    as “the discovery of the means by which a system of forces competent to
                    eliminate any given perturbation may be introduced into the economy.” The
                    adaptation of remedies to diseases is, however, greatly wanting in precision,
                    and continues to be in large part empirical and traditional. It may be objected
                    to the above definition that all diseases are not reducible to the category of
                    “perturbations,” and that there is a certain scientific justification for the
                    doctrine of specifics. Besides the articles of the materia medica proper,
                    agencies such as electricity, baths, sea-voyages, and changes of climate
                    generally, enter into the consideration of therapeutics, and two of those form
                    the subject of special departments, viz., electro-therapeutics and hydropathy.
                    Regimen and diet are also important factors in the treatment of disease;
                    according to a contention of Hippocrates, it was in the dietetic needs of
                    mankind that the medical art had its origin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Subdivisions of Medicine as an Ai t and, Discipline.—</hi> The
                    medical art <hi rend="italic">(ars medendi)</hi> breaks away at once from the
                    unity of the theory of disease. While there is but one body of pathological
                    doctrine for either sex, for every period of life, and for every region and part
                    of the organism, the practical art divides itself into departments and
                    subdepartments. The most fundamental division is into internal and external
                    medicine, or into medicine proper and surgery. The treatment of wounds,
                    injuries, and deformities, with operative interference in general, is the
                    special department of surgical practice (the corresponding parts of pathology,
                    including inflammation, repair, and removable tumours, are sometimes grouped
                    together as surgical pathology); and where the work of the profession is highly
                    subdivided, surgery becomes the exclusive province of the surgeon, while
                    internal medicine remains to the physician. A third great department of practice
                    is <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n828/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0828-0797"/> formed by obstetric medicine or midwifery, and
                    with obstetrics there is usually associated gynaecology, or the diseases
                    peculiar to women. Diseases of children are the subject of a voluminous separate
                    literature. Dermatology (diseases of the skin) is an important province of
                    practice which, like the diseases of women and children, pertains as much to
                    medicine as to surgery. The greatest of the so-called special departments of
                    practice is ophthalmology (diseases and injuries of the eye). Laryngology is a
                    department that owes its existence mainly to the invention of the laryngoscope,
                    its special province being the treatment of the inflammations (ordinary and
                    specific), tumours, and the like, to which the larynx is liable in common with
                    other parts. Diseases of the ear (otology) form even a more restricted
                    department of practice, owing to the comparative inaccessibility of the chief
                    part of the organ of hearing. The congenital condition of deaf-mutism may or may
                    not be taken as falling within the province of the last-mentioned subdivision.
                    Dentistry or odontology is extremely limited in the range of its subject-matter;
                    but it affords great opportunities for refinements of technical skill, and it is
                    given up to a distinct branch of the profession.</p>
                <p>The care of the weak-minded and the insane (psychological medicine) is an
                    integral part of medical practice, inasmuch as it is concerned with diseases of
                    the nervous system and with numerous correlated states of other organs; but it
                    occupies a unique place by reason of the engrossing interest of the subjective
                    phenomena. Habitual drunkenness is also a subject of special treatment.</p>
                <p>' A state of war, actual or contingent, gives occasion to special developments of
                    medical and surgical practice (military hygiene and military surgery). Wounds
                    caused by projectiles, sabres, &amp;c., are the special subject of naval and
                    military surgery; while under the head of military hygiene we may include the
                    general subject of ambulances, the sanitary arrangements of camps, and the
                    various forms of epidemic camp sickness.</p>
                <p>The administration of the civil and criminal law involves frequent relations with
                    medicine, and the professional subjects most likely to arise in that connexion,
                    together with a summary of <hi rend="italic">causes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >célèbret,</hi> are formed into the department of medical jurisprudence. It is
                    the practice in Great Britain to call independent medical evidence on both sides
                    of a cause, whether the proceedings be civil or criminal.</p>
                <p>The system of life assurance is based upon the co-operation of the medical
                    profession. Heredity, constitution, and diathesis are here the chief subjects of
                    general consideration, while prognosis is the skilled faculty specially called
                    into play.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Relations of Medicine to the Body Politic.—</hi> The statutes
                    of the United Kingdom which have direct relation to medicine are (1) those
                    relating to the public health; (2) those relating to lunacy (and habitual
                    drunkenness); (3) those relating to the status of the medical profession, to
                    dentists, and to pharmaceutical chemists; (4) those relating to restrictions on
                    the “practice” of anatomy and physiology. There are, besides, several statutes
                    in which medicine is concerned indirectly,—such as the Poor Laws, the Prisons
                    Acts, the Shipping Acts, the Registration of Births and Deaths Act, the Sale of
                    Food and Drugs Act, the Sale of Poisons Act, the Factory and Workshops Act, the
                    Artisans’ Dwellings (Metropolitan) Act, the Rivers Pollution Prevention Act, the
                    Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act (1878), and the Public Health (Water) Act.</p>
                <p>1. Most of the statutes relating to the public health in England and Wales were
                    consolidated by an Act of 1875, the Acts relating to the metropolis being
                    excepted; there are separate statutes of about the same period for Ireland and
                    Scotland. The system of administration is by local sanitary authorities, in
                    correspondence with the local government boards in London and Dublin and the
                    board of supervision in Edinburgh. The board in London has a medical department,
                    consisting of a chief medical officer, assistant medical officer, and
                    inspectors, while the Dublin and Edinburgh boards are professionally advised on
                    a somewhat different system. The sanitary authorities throughout the United
                    Kingdom are divided into rural, urban, port, and metropolitan (sanitary and
                    nuisance); they are formed out of pre-existing bodies, either the corporations
                    of cities and towns, the improvement commissioners, or the local authorities. A
                    medical officer of health is attached to most of the several sanitary
                    authorities, or to the combined sanitary authorities of a large district; his
                    duties include making reports on the death-rate and the causes of mortality, the
                    denunciation of nuisances and unwholesome dwellings, workshops, &amp;c.,
                    inquiries into the local causes or favouring circumstances of epidemic outbreaks
                    of disease, measures to prevent the spread of contagion (by disinfection,
                    isolation, and otherwise), and other more occasional duties arising under a
                    variety of statutes. Each sanitary authority is required by law to appoint an
                    inspector of nuisances, who practically carries out the instructions of the
                    medical officer when there is one.</p>
                <p>The Vaccination Acts (consolidated 1871) are an important part of the public
                    health law of the kingdom; they are administered by the local government board,
                    for the most part through the agency of the medical profession at large, but in
                    some populous parishes also by means of public vaccination stations.
                    Prosecutions under the Acts are instituted by the parochial authorities. The
                    practice formerly (and not unsuccessfully) resorted to of inoculating with the
                    small-pox has been, made a criminal offence; but there is still much uncertainty
                    as to the theory of vaccination, and, in particular, as to the relation of
                    vaccinia to variola.</p>
                <p>Other statutes which were not consolidated in the Public Health Act of 1875 are
                    the Burials Act, the Contagious Diseases Act, and the Quarantine Act. The first
                    of these is administered by a department of the home office, with a medical
                    inspector. The second (1866 and 1869) relates, under a too general title, to the
                    regulation of prostitution in certain garrison towns, the surgeons under the act
                    being appointed by the board of admiralty or the secretary of state for war, and
                    the administration otherwise carried out by the police.</p>
                <p>The quarantine laws stand in the somewhat anomalous position of statutes which it
                    is not thought desirable to repeal, while yet they are stripped bare of all
                    their executive machinery. The Quarantine Act can be set in motion, as occasion
                    arises, by an order of council; not only, however, is there no official medical
                    advice at the disposal of the privy council, upon which action under the act
                    might be taken, but there is not even the framework remaining (except the ghost
                    of a quarantine station on the Motherbank between Portsmouth and the Isle of
                    Wight) of the once considerable quarantine establishment, by which the
                    provisions of the Act might be enforced. On the other hand, port sanitary
                    authorities enjoy certain limited powers under the Public Health Acts of
                    isolating vessels arriving with contagious sickness on board. A quarantine at
                    British ports has not been put in force for many years, opinions being divided
                    as to the abstract efficacy and suitableness of quarantine measures to prevent
                    the importation and diffusion of plague, cholera, or yellow fever (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Quarantine).</hi></p>
                <p>Numerous instances having occurred of the extensive diffusion of scarlet fever,
                    typhoid fever, and diphtheria by means of milk, the privy council has issued an
                    order, under the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act of 1878, called the Dairies,
                    Milkshops, and Cowsheds Order, with the object of enforcing extreme cleanliness
                    in the premises and appurtenances<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n829/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0829-0798"/> of the milk, trade, and particularly of guarding
                    against the well-known liability of milk to take up effluvia existing or arising
                    near it. The order of council having remained inoperative, it is proposed to
                    deal with the matter by a new Act of Parliament, to be administered by the local
                    government board. While cows’ milk has thus been recognized by the sanitary law
                    as a carrier of certain of the human contagia, the milk of diseased cows, and
                    more especially of tuberculous cows, continues to be sold with impunity, the
                    alleged, communication of tubercular disease from the cow to man being difficult
                    to prove to the satisfaction of the legislature. The want of constant
                    supervision of the slaughter-houses is thought by many to be a serious defect in
                    the sanitary law of the country; and there is no doubt that much flesh of
                    diseased animals (especially the tuberculous) is sold merely as inferior
                    meat.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Public Health Law of the United States.—</hi> Questions of
                    public health in the United States come under the common law and the statute
                    law. In the larger part of the Union they are subject to the common law only; in
                    a certain number of the States there is statute law; and there has been since
                    1879 a national board of health and a quarantine law established by Act of
                    Congress. Generally speaking, the public health procedure of the United States
                    suffers from the want of organization. Decisions at common law relate chiefly to
                    nuisances, and to the recovery of damages for loss caused by the same. The first
                    attempt at statute law was an Act of 1866 creating a metropolitan sanitary
                    district and board of health for the city of New York; in 1869 a board of health
                    was created by the State legislature for Massachusetts; the District of Columbia
                    obtained its board of health in 1870; and other States have followed at
                    intervals, so that there are now at least nineteen State boards of health, New
                    York State and Pennsylvania having health boards only for their respective
                    capitals and other individual towns. Besides the municipal boards in those
                    States, there are very few others for towns in the Union, and still fewer for
                    counties. The powers and activity of the boards of health are very various; the
                    Massachusetts board has powers amounting to that of a court, while the function
                    of several of the State boards is hardly more than advisory. The sanitary
                    statutes made by the State legislatures are in some cases very numerous.
                    Wherever questions of quarantine for yellow fever have arisen, as in Louisiana
                    (New Orleans), Georgia, and Alabama, the State board of health has acquired
                    vigour and has enlisted popular support, in the capitals at least; but in most
                    of the States <hi rend="italic">laissez faire</hi> is the ordinary feeling
                    towards the board and its operations. The medical profession in each State is
                    the most powerful force, and the State medical society is not unfrequently in a
                    semi-official connexion with the sanitary board; on the other hand, it is
                    alleged that the unfortunate sectarian differences in medicine (represented
                    chiefly by homoeopathy) have on several occasions prevented the formation of a
                    State board of health, or have tended to paralyse the action of a board already
                    existing. It is a charge also against boards of health, or at least against
                    those in the great political centres, that their efficiency is apt to be
                    impaired by the introduction of irrelevant political considerations in such
                    matters as the making of appointments. The first step towards a national public
                    health law was gained by the Act (approved 3d March 1879) “to prevent the
                    introduction of infectious or contagious diseases into the United States, and to
                    establish a national board of health.” The board consists of seven members
                    appointed by the president and of four officials detached from the public
                    departments of State. Its duties are “to obtain information upon all matters
                    affecting the public health, to advise the several departments of the
                    government, the executives of the several States, and the commissioners of the
                    District of Columbia, on all questions submitted to them, or whenever, in the
                    opinion of the board, such advice may tend to the preservation and improvement
                    of the public health.” Quarantine was to be a special object of the board’s
                    attention, especially the establishment, if possible, of a federal quarantine
                    system which would preserve the legitimate commercial interests of the several
                    States and their seaports. A quarantine law passed in 1879 provides that all
                    vessels coming from any foreign port where contagious or infectious diseases
                    exist shall obtain a bill of health from the consular officer of the United

                    board of health hitherto has been to institute scientific inquiries into the
                    nature and causation of diseases of national importance, such as malarial fever.
                    Among the acknowledged desiderata in the national sanitary law of the United
                    States are a uniform carrying out of the practice of vaccination—there is no
                    vaccination law in certain States, and in others it is imperfectly applied—and a
                    uniform system of registration of births and deaths. See Bowditch, <hi

                    a council of health for each district, composed of medical practitioners,
                    pharmacists, engineers, and other experts, its function being purely advisory
                    with respect to nuisances, unwholesome dwellings, schools, food, drugs,
                    epidemics, and the like. The executive power rests with the prefect (to be
                    carried out by the police), and is often not put in motion even when advice is
                    tendered. In Paris there are two heads of executive, the prefect of the Seine
                    and the prefect of police. The minister of agriculture and commerce is
                    responsible to the chambers. In Prussia there is a certain amount of
                    bureaucratic care of the public health under the ministry for ecclesiastical,
                    educational, and medical affairs. The minister is advised by a scientific

                <p>3. The Acts relating to the status of the medical profession are known as the
                    Medical Acts. The principal measure, passed in 1858, created a body of
                    twenty-four, called the general council of medical education and registration;
                    by a subsequent Act the council received a charter of incorporation, so that it
                    might draw up, and become the publisher and proprietor of, a list and
                    description of officinal drugs, which should be called the British
                    Pharmacopoeia, and should supersede previous pharmacopoeias. The principal duty
                    of the medical council is to keep a register of qualified medical practitioners.
                    The preamble of the Act by which the medical register was created asserts the
                    desirability of those in want of medical aid being able to distinguish qualified
                    from unqualified practitioners; and those whose names are on the register are
                    alone presumably qualified. To be a registered medical practitioner confers a
                    certain positive legal status (right to sue for fees, hold appointments, give
                    certificates, &amp;c.); but there is nothing in the English law to prevent any
                    person whomsoever from practising medicine and taking fees, provided he does not
                    assume misleading titles. Those who are entitled (on payment of five pounds) to
                    have their names inserted in the medical register are graduates in medicine or
                    surgery of the universities of the United Kingdom, licentiates, members, or
                    fellows of the Royal Colleges of Physicians or Surgeons in London, Dublin, and
                    Edinburgh, licentiates or fellows of the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons of
                    Glasgow, and licentiates of the Apothecaries’ Halls of London and Dublin. The
                    council consists of the representatives of those bodies, of six crown nominees,
                    and the president. The medical council possesses certain judicial and executive
                    powers over the names on its register; if, after due inquiry, a registered
                    practitioner be judged by the medical council to have been guilty of infamous
                    conduct in any professional respect, the medical council may, if they see fit,
                    direct their registrar to erase the practitioner’s name from the register. The
                    medical council keeps also a register (unpublished) of medical students; whoever
                    has passed a recognized <hi rend="subscript"> β</hi> examination in arts, and
                    has forwarded a certificate signed by a teacher of medicine that he has <hi
                    rend="italic">bona fide</hi> begun the study of medicine, is entitled to have
                    his name entered in the register of students of medicine, with the date of his
                    commencement. The object of the students’ register is merely to provide a common
                    and convenient record of the date of commencement of medical study, and, by
                    implication, of the fact that the examination in arts has been passed.</p>
                <p>The medical council owes its title of a “council of education<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n830/mode/1up"

                    the examinations of the universities and corporations, and certain ill-defined
                    powers of visiting the medical schools. The council may, if they see fit, report
                    to the privy council any deficiencies that they may have discovered in the
                    teaching or examining, and the privy council may proceed to further steps. But,
                    beyond publishing the reports of their visitations, the medical council do not
                    appear to have had occasion to put the machinery in force. The state has not
                    otherwise interfered to prescribe the subjectmatter or the minimum standard of
                    medical education, although there has been at least one unsuccessful attempt by
                    the Government of the day to establish a uniform minimum. By an Act of 1876
                    parliament has interposed to affirm the principle that women are entitled to
                    become registered practitioners of medicine.</p>
                <p>Under the Dentists’ Act of 1878 the profession of dentistry acquired a legal
                    status corresponding to that of the medical profession, the general medical
                    council having charge of its register also.</p>
                <p>Pharmaceutical chemists are now licensed under an Act passed in 1876; since that
                    date licences are granted only to those who pass either the minor or the major
                    examination of the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, a Pharmacy Act for
                    Ireland (1876) having corresponding provisions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Medical Profession in other Countries.—</hi> In the United
                    States there are usually no restrictions upon the practice of medicine, and in
                    only a few of the States has the medical profession any legal standing. The
                    ordinary medical title is that of doctor of medicine, and that degree is
                    conferred by a large number of institutions after a curriculum of study that
                    varies much in length, and after examinations that are equally various as tests
                    of proficiency. In France the medical profession is divided into two grades:
                    those in the higher grade are all doctors of medicine of the faculties of Paris,
                    Lille, Nancy, Bordeaux, Lyons, or Montpellier; those in the lower grade are <hi
                    rend="italic">officiers de santé.</hi> In Germany the right to practise is
                    conferred by a state licence granted on passing the <hi rend="italic"
                    >staats-examen-,</hi> the examination, which is almost entirely oral and
                    practical, may be passed in stages at any one of the universities in the empire,
                    the professors of anatomy, physiology, and pathological anatomy being
                    practically <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> examiners, while the other
                    examiners are very frequently also professors in the medical faculty. The <hi
                    rend="italic">staats-examcn</hi> is usually passed before the candidate seeks
                    the degree of doctor of medicine; that degree is almost always taken by those
                    who j&gt;ass the examination for the state licence, and it is usually conferred
                    after a more or less formal examination of the candidate before the medical
                    faculty, and on the approval of his thesis. In Austria, the right to practise is
                    carried by the degree of doctor of medicine; there is no separate state licence,
                    and no examination except that of the medical faculty of the universities (see
                    Billroth’s <hi rend="italic">Lehren</hi><hi rend="italic">and</hi><hi

                    there are penalties directed in effect against practising medicine without the
                    state licence, or the university degree equivalent thereto, and in France the
                    law now extends to resident foreign practitioners who have qualified only in
                    their own country. The regulations for the practice of pharmacy in Germany and
                    other Continental countries have long l&gt;een of a very stringent kind. The
                    training and licensing of midwives is also under state control.</p>
                <p>4. Lastly, the state has interposed to restrict the “practice” of anatomy and
                    physiology. By the Anatomy Act of 1832 (amended in 1871) licences are required
                    for schools of anatomy, as well as licences for teachers, “to practise anatomy.”
                    Licensed teachers of anatomy are empowered to receive subjects for dissection
                    under certain conditions. The Act is administered by the home office, with a
                    staff of four inspectors of anatomy, one for the metropolis, one for provincial
                    medical schools in England, and one each for Ireland and Scotland. The Act
                    restricting the practice of physiology is the Vivisection Act of 1876; it is
                    intended for the protection of vertebrate animals liable to be employed alive in
                    physiological experiments, and it resorts to a controlling machinery of licence
                    and inspection similar to that of the Anatomy Act, and under the same Government
                    department. (c. c.)</p>
                <p>PART II.—HISTORY.</p>
                <p>The history of medicine falls naturally under two heads, or might be conceivably
                    written from two different points of view. It might be a history of the medical
                    profession or a history of medical doctrine,—in other words, the history of
                    medicine in its relation to society or in its relation to science. We shall here
                    deal chiefly with the history of medical knowledge, remembering also that the
                    histories of anatomy, of physiology, and of surgery are dealt with in the
                    articles referring to those subjects. But a still more trenchant limitation is
                    necessary to preserve the unity of the subject. Attention can be given to so
                    much only of the history as is directly antecedent to and leads up to the
                    medical science of modern Europe. For this purpose, the history of medicine must
                    start with the earlier period of Greek civilization.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Medicine as Portrayed in the Homeric Poems.—</hi> In the state
                    of society pictured by Homer it is clear that medicine has already had a
                    history. We find a distinct and organized profession; we find a system of
                    treatment, especially in regard to injuries, which it must have been the work of
                    long experience to frame; we meet with a nomenclature of parts of the body
                    substantially the same (according to Daremberg) as that employed long afterwards
                    in the writings of Hippocrates: in short, we find a science and an organization
                    which, however imperfect as compared with those of later times, are yet very far
                    from being in their beginning. The Homeric heroes themselves are represented as
                    having considerable skill in surgery, and as able to attend to ordinary wounds
                    and injuries, but there is also a professional class, represented by Machaon and
                    Podalirius, the two sons of Asclepius, who are treated with great respect. It
                    would appear, too, from the <hi rend="italic">Aethiopis</hi> of Archinus (quoted
                    by Weicker and Haeser) that the duties of these two were not precisely the same.
                    Machaon’s task was more especially to heal injuries, while Podalirius had
                    received from his father the gift of “recognizing what was not visible to the
                    eye, and tending what could not be healed.” In other words, a rough indication
                    is seen of the separation of medicine and surgery. Asclepius appears in Homer as
                    a Thessalian king, not as a god, though in later times divine honours wer« paid
                    to him. There is no sign in the Homeric poems of the subordination of medicine
                    to religion which is seen in ancient Egypt and India, nor are priests charged,
                    as they were in those countries, with medical functions,—all circumstances which
                    throw grave doubts on the commonly received opinion that medicine derived its
                    origin in all countries from religious observances.</p>
                <p>Although the actual organization of medicine among the Homeric Greeks was thus
                    quite distinct from religion, the worship of Asclepius (or Aesculapius) as the
                    god of healing demands some notice. This cult spread very widely among the
                    Greeks; it had great civil importance, and lasted even into Christian times; but
                    there is no reason to attribute to it any special connexion with the development
                    of the science or profession of medicine. Sick persons repaired, or were
                    conveyed, to the temples of Asclepius in order to be healed, just as Jn modern
                    times relief is sought by a devotional pilgrimage or from the waters of some
                    sacred spring, and then as now the healing influence was sometimes sought by
                    deputy. The sick person, or his representative, after ablution, prayer, and
                    sacrifice, was made to sleep on the hide of the sacrificed animal, or at the
                    feet of the statue of the god, while sacred rites were performed. In his sleep
                    (incubatio, cγκoi-pycrtç<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n831/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0831-0800"/>) the appropriate remedy was indicated by a dream.
                    Moral or dietetic remedies were more often prescribed than drugs. The record of
                    the cure was inscribed on the columns or walls of the temple; and it has been
                    thought that in this way was introduced the custom of “recording cases,” and
                    that the physicians of the Hippocratic school thus learnt to accumulate clinical
                    experience. But the priests of Asclepius were not physicians. Although the
                    latter were often called Asclepiads, this was in the first place to indicate
                    their real or supposed descent from Asclepius, and in the second place as a
                    complimentary title. No medical writing of antiquity speaks of the worship of
                    Asclepius in such a way as to imply any connexion with the ordinary art of
                    healing. The two systems appear to have existed side by side, but to have been
                    distinct, and if they were ever united it must have been before the times of
                    which we have any record. The. theory of a development of Greek medicine from
                    the rites of Asclepius, though defended by eminent names, must accordingly be
                    rejected.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Development of Medicine in Greece.—</hi> It is only from
                    non-nιedical writers that anything is known of the development of medicine in
                    Greece before the age of Hippocrates. The elaborate collections made by
                    Daremberg of medical notices in the poets and historians illustrate the
                    relations of the profession to society, but do little to prepare us for the
                    Hippocratic period. Nor is much importance to be attached to the influence of
                    the philosophical sects on medicine except as regards the school of Pythagoras.
                    That philosopher and several of his successors were physicians, but we do not
                    know in what relation they stood to later medical schools. We must therefore
                    hasten onward to the age of Pericles, in which Hippocrates, already called “the
                    Great,” was in medicine as complete a representative of the highest efforts of
                    the Greek intellect as were his contemporaries the great philosophers, orators,
                    and tragedians. The medical art as we now practise it, the character of the
                    physician as we now understand it, both date for us from Hippocrates. The
                    justification of this statement is found in the literary collection of writings
                    known by his name. Of these certainly many are falsely ascribed to the
                    historical Hippocrates of Cos; others are almost as certainly rightly so
                    ascribed; others again are clearly works of his school, whether from his hand or
                    not. But which are to be regarded as the “genuine works” is still uncertain, and
                    authorities are conflicting. There are clearly two schools represented in the
                    collection,—that of Cnidus in a small proportion, and that of Cos in far the
                    larger number of the works. The latter was that to which Hippocrates belonged,
                    and where he gave instruction; and accordingly it may be taken that works of
                    this school, when not obviously of a different date, are Hippocratic in doctrine
                    if not in actual authorship.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hippocratic Medicine.—</hi> The first grand characteristic of
                    Hippocratic medicine is the high conception of the duties and status of the
                    physician, shown in the celebrated “Oath of Hippocrates” and elsewhere,—equally
                    free from the mysticism of a priesthood and the vulgar pretensions of a
                    mercenary craft. So matured a professional sentiment may perhaps have been more
                    the growth of time and organization than the work of an individual genius, but
                    certainly corresponds with the character universally attributed to Hippocrates
                    himself. The second great quality is the singular artistic skill and balance
                    with which the Hippocratic physician used such materials and tools as he
                    possessed. Here we recognize the true Greek <hi rend="italic">σωφpaσwη.</hi> But
                    this artistic completeness was closely connected with the third cardinal virtue
                    of Hippocratic medicine,—the clear recognition of disease as being equally with
                    life a process governed by what we should now call natural laws, which could be
                    known by observation, and which indicated the spontaneous and normal direction
                    of recovery, by following which alone could the physician succeed. In the fourth
                    place, these views of the “natural history of disease” (in modern language) led
                    to habits of minute observation and accurate interpretation of symptoms, in
                    which the Hippocratic school was unrivalled in antiquity, and has been the model
                    for all succeeding ages, so that even in these days, with our enormous advances
                    in knowledge, the true method of clinical medicine may be said to be the method
                    of Hippocrates.</p>
                <p>The actual science of the Hippocratic school was of course very limited. In
                    anatomy and physiology little advance had been made, and so of pathology in the
                    sense · of an explanation of morbid processes or knowledge of diseased
                    structures there could be very little. The most valuable intellectual possession
                    was a large mass of recorded observations in individual cases and epidemics of
                    disease. "Whether these observations were systematic or individual, and how they
                    were recorded, are points of which we are quite ignorant, as the theory that the
                    votive tablets in the temples supplied such materials must be abandoned.</p>
                <p>Though the Hippocratic medicine was so largely founded on observation, it would
                    be an error to suppose that dogma or theory had no place. The dominating theory
                    of disease was the <hi rend="italic">humoral,</hi> which has never since ceased
                    to influence medical thought and practice. According to this celebrated theory,
                    the body contains four humours,—blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile, a
                    right proportion and mixture of which constitute health; improper proportions or
                    irregular distribution, disease. It is doubtful whether the treatise in which
                    this theory is fully expounded (τrep'ι φvσιoς αr0pω7roυ) is as old as
                    Hippocrates himself; but it was regarded as a Hippocratic doctrine, and, when
                    taken up and expanded by Galen, its terms not only became the common property
                    ’of the profession, but passed into general literature and common language.
                    Another Hippocratic doctrine, the influence of which is not even yet exhausted,
                    is that of the healing power of nature. Not that Hippocrates taught, as he was
                    afterwards reproached with teaching, that nature is sufficient for the cure of
                    diseases; for he held strongly the efficacy of art. But he recognized, at least
                    in acute diseases, a natural process which the humours went through,—being first
                    of all <hi rend="italic">crude,</hi> then passing through <hi rend="italic"
                    >coction</hi> or digestion, and finally being expelled by resolution or <hi
                    rend="italic">crisis</hi> through one of the natural channels of the body. The
                    duty of the physician was to foresee these changes, “to assist or not to hinder
                    them,” so that “the sick man might conquer the disease with the help of the
                    physician.” The times at which crises were to be expected were naturally looked
                    for with anxiety; and it was a cardinal point in the Hippocratic system to
                    foretell them with precision. Hippocrates, influenced as is thought by the
                    Pythagorean doctrines of number, taught that they were to be expected on days
                    fixed by certain numerical rules, in some cases on odd, in others on even
                    numbers,—the celebrated doctrine of “critical days.” This false precision can
                    have had no practical value, but may have enforced habits of minute observation.
                    It follows from what has been said that <hi rend="italic">prognosis,</hi> or the
                    art of foretelling the course and event of the disease, was a strong point with
                    the Hippocratic physicians. In this they have perhaps never been excelled.
                    Diagnosis, or recognition of the disease, must have been necessarily imperfect,
                    when no scientific nosology, or system of disease, existed, and the knowledge of
                    anatomy was quite inadequate to allow of a precise determination of the seat of
                    disease; but symptoms were no doubt observed and interpreted skilfully. The
                    pulse is not spoken of in any of the works now attributed to Hippocrates
                    himself, though it is mentioned in other works of the collection.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n832/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0832-0801"/>
                <p>In the treatment of disease, the Hippocratic school attached great importance to
                    diet, the variations necessary-in different diseases being minutely defined.
                    Medicines were regarded as of secondary importance, but not neglected, two
                    hundred and sixty-five drugs being mentioned at different places in the
                    Hippocratic works. Blood-letting was known, but not greatly practised. The
                    highest importance was attached to applying all remedies at the right moment,
                    and the general principle enforced of making all influences—internal and
                    external—co-operate for the relief of the patient. The principles of treatment
                    just mentioned apply more especially to the cure of acute diseases; but they are
                    the most salient characteristics of the Hippocratic school. In chronic cases
                    diet, exercise, and natural methods were chiefly relied upon.</p>
                <p>The school of Cnidus, as distinguished from that of Cos, of which Hippocrates is
                    the representative, appears to have differed in attaching more importance to the
                    differences of special diseases, and to have made more use of drugs. A treatise
                    on the diseases of women, contained in the Hippocratic collection, and of
                    remarkable practical value, is attributed to this school.</p>
                <p>The above sketch of Hippocratic medicine will make it less necessary to dwell
                    upon the details relating to subsequent medical schools or sects in ancient
                    times. The general conception of the physician’s aim and task remained the same,
                    though, as knowledge increased, there was much divergence both in theory and
                    practice,— even opposing schools were found to be developing some part of the
                    Hippocratic system. Direct opponents or repudiatore of the authority of
                    Hippocrates were rare, all generally appealing to his authority. But,
                    insensibly, the least valuable part of the Hippocratic work, the theory, was
                    made permanent; the most valuable, the practical, neglected.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Post-Hippocratic Medicine.—</hi> After Hippocrates the progress
                    of medicine in Greece does not call for any special remark in such a sketch as
                    this, but mention must be made of one great name. Though none of Aristotle’s
                    writings are strictly medical, he has by his researches in anatomy and
                    physiology contributed greatly to the progress of medicine. It should also be
                    remembered that he was of an Asclepiad family, and received that partly medical
                    education which was traditional in such families, and also himself is said to
                    have practised medicine as an amateur. Moreover, his works on natural history
                    doubtless furthered the progress among the Greeks of sciences tributary to
                    medicine, though the only specimens of such works which have come down to us
                    from the Peripatetic school are those of Theophrastus, who may be considered the
                    founder of the scientific study of botany. Among his encyclopaedic writings were
                    some on medical subjects, of which fragments only have been preserved. The
                    Peripatetic school may have been more favourable to the development of medicine,
                    as of other departments of natural knowledge, than any other; but there is no
                    evidence that any of the philosophical schools had important influence on the
                    progress of medicine. The fruit of Aristotle’s teaching and example was seen
                    later on in the schools of Alexandria.</p>
                <p>The century after the death of Hippocrates is a time almost blank in medical
                    annals. It is probable that the science, like others, shared in the general
                    intellectual decline of Greece after the Macedonian supremacy; but the works of
                    physicians of the period are almost entirely lost, and were so even in the time
                    of Galen. Galen classes them all as of the dogmatic school; but, whatever may
                    have been their characteristics, they are of no importance in the history of the
                    science.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Alexandrian School of Medicine.—</hi> The dispersion of Greek
                    science and intellectual activity through the world by the conquests of
                    Alexander and his successors led to the formation of more than one learned
                    centre, in which medicine among other sciences was represented. Pergamum was
                    early distinguished for its medical school; but in this as in other respects its
                    reputation was ultimately effaced by the more brilliant fame of Alexandria. It
                    is here that the real continuation and development of Hippocratic medicine can
                    be traced.</p>
                <p>In one department the Alexandrian school rapidly surpassed its Greek original,
                    namely, in the study of anatomy The dissection of the human body, of which some
                    doubtful traces or hints only are found in Greek times, was assiduously carried
                    out, being favoured or even suggested perhaps by the Egyptian custom of
                    disembowelling and embalming the bodies of the dead. There is no doubt that the
                    organs were also examined by opening the bodies of living persons,—criminals
                    condemned to death being given over to the anatomists for this purpose.</p>
                <p>Two eminent names stand in the first rank as leaders of the two earliest schools
                    of medicine which arose in Alexandria, Herophilus and Erasistratus.</p>
                <p>Herophilus was a Greek of Chalcedon, a pupil of the schools both of Cos and of
                    Cnidus. He was especially noted for his profound researches in anatomy (see vol.
                    i. p. 802), and in the knowledge and practice of medicine he appears to hâve
                    been equally renowned. He professed himself a close adherent of Hippocrates, and
                    adopted his theory of the humours. He also made extensive use of drugs, and of
                    bleeding. The reputation of Herophilus is attested by the fact that four
                    considerable physicians wrote works about him and his writings, and he is
                    further spoken of with the highest respect by Galen and Celsus. By the general
                    voice of the medical world of antiquity be was placed only second to
                    Hippocrates.</p>
                <p>Erasistratus was the contemporary and rival of Herophilus. Little is known of his
                    life, except that he spent some time at the court of Seleucus Nicator at Antioch
                    before coming to Alexandria, and that he cultivated anatomy late in life, after
                    he had taken up his abode in the latter city. His numerous works are also almost
                    entirely lost, fragments only being preserved by Galen and others. Erasistratus,
                    instead of following Hippocrates as Herophilus did, depreciated him, and seems
                    to have been rather aggressive and independent in his views. He appears to have
                    leaned to mechanical explanations of the symptoms of disease, as was especially
                    the case with inflammation, of which he gave the first rational, though
                    necessarily inadequate, theory.</p>
                <p>The two schools composed of the followers of Herophilus and Erasistratus
                    respectively long divided between them the medical world of Alexandria. The
                    names of many prominent members of both sects have been preserved, but it would
                    be useless to repeat them. The Herophilists still reverenced the memory of
                    Hippocrates, and wrote numerous commentaries on his works. They produced many
                    eminent anatomists, but in the end seem to have become lost in theoretical
                    subtleties, and to have maintained too high a standard of literary cultivation.
                    The school of Erasistratus was less distinguished in anatomy than that of
                    Herophilus, but paid more attention to the special symptoms of diseases, and
                    employed a great variety of drugs. It was longer-lived than that of Herophilus,
                    for it still numbered many adherents in the 2d century after Christ, a century
                    after the latter had become extinct.</p>
                <p>The Erasistrateans paved the way for what was in some respects the most important
                    school which Alexandria produced, that known as the empiric, which, though it
                    recognized no master by name, may be considered to have been founded by Philinus
                    of Cos (280 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.),</hi> a pupil of Herophilus; but
                    Serapion, a great name in antiquity, and Glaucias of Tarentum, who traced the

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0833-0802"/> back to the writings of Hippocrates, are also
                    named among its founders. The most striking peculiarity of the empirics was that
                    they rejected anatomy, regarding it as useless to inquire into the causes of
                    things, and thus, as they contended, being the more minute in their observation
                    of the actual phenomena of disease. They professed that their whole practice was
                    based upon experience, to which word they gave a special meaning. Three sources,
                    and three only, could experience draw from :—observation, history <hi
                    rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> recorded observation), and judgment by analogy. These
                    three bases of knowledge were known as the “tripod” of the empirics. It should
                    not, however, be forgotten that the empirics read and industriously commented on
                    the works of Hippocrates. They were extremely successful in practical matters,
                    especially in surgery and in the use of drugs, and a large part of the routine
                    knowledge of diseases and remedies which became traditional in the times of the
                    Roman empire is believed to have been derived from them. In the 2d century the
                    school became closely connected with the philosophical sect of the Sceptics,
                    whose leader, Sextus, was an empirical physician. It lived and flourished far
                    beyond this time, when transplanted to Rome, not less than in its native
                    Alexandria, and appears to be recognizable even up to the beginning of the
                    Middle Ages.</p>
                <p>If we look at the work of the Alexandrian schools in medicine as a whole, we must
                    admit that the progress made was great and permanent. The greatest service
                    rendered to medicine was undoubtedly the systematic study of anatomy. It is
                    clear that the knowledge of function (physiology) did not by any means keep pace
                    with the knowledge of structure, and this was probably the reason why the
                    important sect of the empirics were able entirely to dispense with anatomical
                    knowledge. The doctrines of Hippocrates, though lightly thought of by the
                    Erasistra-teaus, still were no doubt very widely accepted, but the practice of
                    the Hippocratic school had been greatly improved in almost every
                    department,—surgery and obstetrics being probably those in which the Alexandrian
                    practitioners could compare most favourably with those of modern times. We have
                    now to trace the fortunes of this body of medical doctrine and practice when
                    transplanted to Rome, and ultimately to the -whole Roman world.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Roman Medicine.—</hi> The Romans cannot be said to have at any
                    time originated or possessed an independent school of medicine. They had from
                    early times a very complicated system of superstitious medicine, or religion,
                    related to disease and the cure of disease, borrowed, as is thought, from the
                    Etruscans; and, though the saying of Pliny that the Roman people got on for six
                    hundred years without doctors was doubtless an exaggeration, and not, literally
                    speaking, exact, it must be accepted for the broad truth which it contains. When
                    a medical profession appears, it is, so far as we are able to trace it, as an
                    importation from Greece.</p>
                <p>The first Greek physician whose name is preserved as having migrated to Rome was
                    Archagathus, who came over from the Peloponnesus in 218 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b</hi> c.; but there were probably others before him. When Greece was made a
                    Roman province, the number of such physicians who sought their fortunes in Rome
                    must have been very large. The bitter words of Μ. Porcius Cato, wflιo disliked
                    them as he did other representatives of Greek culture, are evidence of this. The
                    most eminent of these earlier Greek physicians at Rome was Asclepiades, the
                    friend of Cicero (born 124 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> at Prusa in Bithynia).
                    He came to Rome as a young man, and soon became distinguished both for his
                    medical skill and his oratorical power. He introduced a system which, so far as
                    we know, was his own, though founded upon the Epicurean philosophical creed; on
                    the practical side it conformed pretty closely to the Stoic rule of life, thus
                    adapting itself to the leanings of the better stamp of Romans in the later times
                    of the republic. According to Asclepiades all diseases depended upon alterations
                    in the size, number, arrangement, or movement of the “atoms,” of which,
                    according to the doctrine of Epicurus, the body consisted. These atoms were
                    united into passages (7r0p0ι) through which the juices of the body were
                    conveyed. This doctrine, of which the developments need not further be followed,
                    was important chiefly in so far that it was perfectly distinct from, and opposed
                    to, the humoral pathology of Hippocrates. In the treatment of disease
                    Asclepiades attached most importance to diet, exercise, passive movements or
                    frictions, and the external use of cold water,—in short, to a modified athletic
                    training. He rejected the <hi rend="italic">vis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >medicatrix</hi><hi rend="italic">naturae,</hi> pointing out that nature in many
                    cases not only did not help but marred the cure. His knowledge of disease and
                    surgical skill were, as appears from the accounts given by Celsus and Coelius
                    Aurelianus, very considerable. Asclepiades had many pupils, who adhered more or
                    less closely to his doctrines, but it was especially one of them, Themison, who
                    gave permanence to the teachings of his master by framing out of them, with some
                    modifications, a new system of medical doctrine, and founding on this basis a
                    school which lasted for some centuries in successful rivalry with the
                    Hippocratic tradition, which, as we have seen, was up to that time the
                    prevailing influence in medicine.</p>
                <p>This system was known as methodism, its adherents as the methodici or methodists.
                    Its main principles were that it was useless to consider the causes of a
                    disease, or even the organ affected by the disease, and that it was sufficient
                    to know what was common to all diseases, viz., their common qualities
                    (communitates, <hi rend="italic">κοινότητες).</hi> Of these there were three
                    possible forms—(1) relaxation, (2) contraction of the minute passages or <hi
                    rend="italic">πόροι,</hi> and (3) a mixed state, partly lax, partly constricted.
                    The signs of these morbid states were to be found in the general constitution of
                    the body, especially in the excretions. Besides this it was important only to
                    consider whether the disease was acute or chronic, whether it was increasing,
                    declining, or stationary. Treatment of disease was directed not to any special
                    organ, nor to producing the crises and critical discharges of the Hippocratic
                    school, but to correcting the morbid common condition or “community,” relaxing
                    the body if it was constricted, causing contraction if it was too lax, and in
                    the “mixed state” acting according to the predominant condition. This simple
                    rule of treatment was the system or “method” from which the school took its
                    name.</p>
                <p>The methodists agreed with the empirics in one point, in their contempt for
                    anatomy; but, strictly speaking, they were dogmatists, though with a dogma
                    different from that of the Hippocratic school. Besides Themison, its systematic
                    founder, the school boasted many physicians eminent in their day, among whom
                    Thessalus of Tralles, a half-educated and boastful pretender, was one of the
                    most popular. He reversed the Hippocratic maxim “art is long,” promising his
                    scholars to teach them the whole of medicine in six months, and had inscribed
                    upon his tomb <hi rend="italic">ίατρονίκης,</hi> as being superior to all living
                    and bygone physicians.</p>
                <p>In the 2d century a much greater name appears among the methodists, that of
                    Soranus of Ephesus, a physician mentioned with praise even by Tertullian and
                    Augustine, who practised at Rome in the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian. Soranus is
                    known by a work, still extant in the Greek original, on the diseases of women,
                    and also by the Latin work of Coelius Aurelianus, three centuries later, on
                    acute and chronic diseases, which is based upon, if not, as some think, an
                    actual translation of, the chief <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n834/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0834-0803"/> work of Soranus, and which is the principal
                    source of our knowledge of the methodic school. The work on diseases of women is
                    the only complete work on that subject which has come down to us from antiquity,
                    and shows remarkable fulness of practical knowledge in relation to its subject.
                    It is notable that an important instrument of research, the speculum, which has
                    been reinvented in modern times, was used by Soranus; and specimens of still
                    earlier date, showing great mechanical perfection, have been found among the
                    ruins of Pompeii. The work on acute and chronic diseases is also full of
                    practical knowledge, but penetrated with the theories of the methodists.</p>
                <p>The methodic school lasted certainly for some centuries, and influenced the
                    revival of medical science in the Middle Ages, though overshadowed by the
                    greater reputation of Galen. It was the first definite product of Greek medicine
                    on Roman soil, but was destined to be followed by others, which kept up a more
                    or less successful rivalry with it, and with the Hippocratic tradition.</p>
                <p>The so-called pneumatic school was founded by Athenaeus, in the 1st century after
                    Christ. According to its doctrines the normal as well as diseased actions of the
                    body were to be referred to the operation of the pneuma or universal soul. This
                    doctrine, crudely transferred from philosophical speculation, was intended to
                    reconcile the humoral (or Hippocratic) and solidist (or methodic) schools; but
                    the methodists seem to have claimed Athenaeus as one of themselves.</p>
                <p>The conflicts of the opposing schools, and the obvious deficiencies of each, led
                    many physicians to try and combine the valuable parts of each system, and to
                    call themselves eclectics. Among these were found many of the most eminent
                    physicians of Graeco-Roman times. It may be sufficient to name Rufus of Ephesus,
                    and Archigenes, who is mentioned by Juvenal.</p>
                <p>Although no system or important doctrine of medicine was originated by the Roman
                    intellect, and though the practice of the profession was probably almost
                    entirely in the hands of the Greeks, the most complete picture which we have of
                    medical thought and activity in Roman times is due to a Latin pen, and to one
                    who was, in all probability, not a physician. A. Cornelius Celsus, a Roman
                    patrician, who lived probably in the first century, appears to have studied
                    medicine as a branch of general knowledge. Whether he was a practising physician
                    or not has been a matter of controversy. The conclusion supported by most
                    evidence seems to be that he practised on his friends and dependants, but not as
                    a remunerative profession. His well-known work, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Medicina,</hi> was one of a series of treatises intended to
                    embrace all knowledge proper for a man of the world. It was not meant for the
                    physicians, and was certainly little read by them, as Celsus is quoted by no
                    medical writer, and when referred to by Pliny is spoken of as an author, not a
                    physician. There is no doubt that his work is chiefly a compilation; and
                    Daremberg, with other scholars, has traced a large number of passages of the
                    Latin text to the Greek originals from which they were translated. In the
                    description of surgical operations the vagueness of the language seems sometimes
                    to show that the author had not performed such himself; but in other parts, and
                    especially in his historical introduction, he speaks with more confidence; and
                    everywhere he compares and criticizes with learning and judgment. The whole body
                    of medical literature belonging to the Hippocratic and Alexandrian times is ably
                    summarized, and a knowledge of the state of medical science up to and during the
                    times of the author is thus conveyed to us which can be obtained from no other
                    source. The work of Celsus is thus for us only second in importance to the
                    Hippocratic writings and the works of Galen; but it is valuable rather as a part
                    of the history <hi rend="italic">oi</hi> medicine than, as the subject of that
                    history. It forms no link in the general chain of medical tradition, for the
                    simple reason that the influence of Celsus (putting aside a few scanty allusions
                    in mediaeval times) commenced in the 15th century, when his works were first
                    discovered in manuscript or committed to the press. Since then, however, he has
                    been almost up to our own times the most popular and widely-read of all medical
                    classics, partly for the qualities already indicated, partly because he was one
                    of the few of those classics accessible to readers of Latin, and partly also
                    because of the purity and classical perfection of his language.</p>
                <p>Of Pliny, another encyclopaedic writer, a few words must be said, though he was
                    not a physician. In his <hi rend="italic">Natural History</hi> we find as
                    complete a summary of the popular medicine of his time as Celsus gives of the
                    scientific medicine. Pliny disliked doctors, and lost no opportunity of
                    depreciating regular medicine; nevertheless he has left many quotations from,
                    and many details about, medical authors which are of the highest value. He is
                    useful to us for what he wrote about the history of medicine, not for what he
                    contributed. Like Celsus, he had little influence on succeeding medical
                    literature or practice.</p>
                <p>We now come to the writer who, above all others, gathered up into himself the
                    divergent and scattered threads of ancient medicine, and out of whom again the
                    greater part of modern European medicine has flowed. Galen (see vol. i. 803 and
                    x. 23) was a man furnished with all the anatomical, medical, and philosophical
                    knowledge cf his time; he had studied all kinds of natural curiosities, and had
                    stood in near relation to important political events; he possessed enormous
                    industry, great practical sagacity, and unbounded literary fluency. He had, in
                    fact, every quality necessary for an encyclopaedic writer, or even for a
                    literary and professional autocrat. He found the medical profession of his time
                    split up into a number of sects, medical science confounded under a multitude of
                    dogmatic systems, the social status and moral integrity of physicians degraded.
                    He appears to have made it his object to reform these evils, to reconcile
                    scientific acquirements and practical skill, to bring back the unity of medicine
                    as it had been understood by Hippocrates, and at the same time to raise the
                    dignity of medical practitioners.</p>
                <p>Galen was as devoted to anatomical and, so far as then understood, physiological
                    research as to practical medicine. He worked enthusiastically at dissection,
                    though, the liberty of the Alexandrian schools no longer existing, he could
                    dissect only animals, not the human body. In his anatomical studies Galen had a
                    twofold object,—a philosophical, to show the wisdom of the Creator in making
                    everything fit to serve its purpose, and a practical, to aid the diagnosis, or
                    recognition, of disease. The first led him into a teleological system so minute
                    and overstrained as to defeat its own end; the second was successfully attained
                    by giving greater precision and certainty to medical and surgical practice in
                    difficult cases. His general physiology was essentially founded upon the
                    Hippocratic theory of the four elements, with which he combined the notion of
                    spirit (pneuma) penetrating all parts, and mingled with the humours in different
                    proportions. It was on this field that he most vehemently attacked the
                    prevailing atomistic and materialistic views of the methodic school, and his
                    conception of the pneuma became in some respects half metaphysical. His own
                    researches in special branches of physiology were important, but do not strictly
                    belong to our present subject.</p>
                <p>The application of physiology to the explanation of diseases, and thus to
                    practice, was chiefly by the theory of the temperaments or mixtures which Galen
                    founded upon <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n835/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0835-0804"/> the Hippocratic doctrine of humours, but
                    developed with marvellous and fatal ingenuity. The normal condition or
                    temperament of the body depended upon a proper mixture or proportion of the four
                    elements—hot, cold, wet, and dry. From faulty proportions of the same arose the
                    <hi rend="italic">intemperies</hi> (“distempers ”), which, though not diseases,
                    were the occasions of disease. Equal importance attached to faulty mixtures or
                    dyscrasiae of the blood. By a combination of these morbid predispositions with
                    the action of deleterious influences fromwithout all diseases were produced.
                    Galen showed extreme ingenuity in explaining all symptoms and all diseases on
                    his system. No phenomenon was without a name, no problem without a solution.
                    And, though it was precisely in his fine-spun subtlety that he departed farthest
                    from scientific method and practical utility, it was this very quality which
                    seems in the end to have secured his popularity and established his pre-eminence
                    in the medical world.</p>
                <p>Galen’s use of drugs was influenced largely by the same theories. In drugs were
                    to be recognized the same elementary qualities—hot, cold, moist, dry, &amp;c.—as
                    in the human body; and, on the principle of curing by contraries, the use of one
                    or other was indicated. The writings of Galen contain less of simple objective
                    observation than those of several other ancient physicians, all being swept into
                    the current of dogmatic exposition. But there is enough to show the thoroughness
                    and extent of his practical knowledge. Unfortunately it was neither this nor his
                    zeal for research that chiefly won him followers, but the completeness of his
                    theoretical explanations, which fell in with the mental habits of succeeding
                    centuries, and were such as have flattered the intellectual indolence of all
                    ages. But the reputation of Galen grew slowly; he does not appear to have
                    enjoyed any pre-eminence over other physicians of his time, to most of whom he
                    was strongly opposed in opinion. In the next generation he began to be esteemed
                    only as a philosopher; gradually his system was implicitly accepted, and it
                    enjoyed a great though not exclusive predominance till the fall of Roman
                    civilization. When the Arabs possessed themselves of the scattered remains of
                    Greek culture, the works of Galen were more highly esteemed than any others
                    except those of Aristotle. Through the Arabs the Galenical system found its way
                    back again to Western Europe. Even when Arabian medicine gave way before the
                    direct teaching of the Greek authors rescued from neglect, the authority of
                    Galen was increased instead of being diminished; and he assumed a position of
                    autocracy in medical science which was only slowly undermined by the growth of
                    modern science in the 17th and 18 th centuries.</p>
                <p>But the history of medicine in Roman times is. by no means the same thing as the
                    history of the fate of the works of Galen. For some centuries the methodic
                    school was popular at Rome, and produced one physician, Coelius Aurelianus, who
                    must be pronounced, next to Celsus, the most considerable of the Latin medical
                    writers. His date was in all probability the end of the 4th or beginning of the
                    5th century. The works bearing his name are, as has been said, entirely based
                    upon the Greek of Soranus, but are important both because their Greek originals
                    are lost, and because they are evidence of the state of medical practice in his
                    own time. The popularity of Ccelius is evidenced by the fact that in the 6th
                    century an abridgment of his larger work was recommended by Cassiodorus to the
                    Benedictine monks for the study of medicine.</p>
                <p>Before quitting this period the name of Aretaeus of Cappadocia must be mentioned.
                    So little is known about him that even ħis date cannot be fixed more closely
                    than as being between the second half of the 1st century and the beginning of
                    the 3d. His works have been much admired for the purity of the Greek style, and
                    his accurate descriptions of disease; but, as he quotes no medical author, and
                    is quoted by none before Alexander of Aphrodisias at the beginning of the 3d
                    century, it is clear that he belonged to no school and founded none, and thus
                    his position in the chain of medical tradition is quite uncertain. Alexander of
                    Aphrodisias, who lived and wrote at Athens in the time of Septimius Severus, is
                    best known by his commentaries on Aristotle, but also wrote a treatise on
                    fevers, still extant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ancient Medicine after Galen.—</hi> The Byzantine school of
                    medicine, which closely corresponds to the Byzantine literary and historical
                    schools, followed closely in Galen’s footsteps, and its writers were chiefly
                    compilers and encyclopaedists. The earliest is Oribasius (326-403), whose date
                    and position are fixed by his being the friend and court physician of Julian the
                    Apostate. He was a Greek of Pergamum, educated in Alexandria, and long resident
                    in Byzantium. His great work Svvαγωγαι <hi rend="italic">ιaτpικal,</hi> of which
                    only about one-third has been preserved, was a medical encyclopaedia founded on
                    extracts from Hippocrates, Galen, Dioscorides, and certain Greek writers who are
                    otherwise very imperfectly known. The work is thus one of great historical value
                    but of no originality. The next name which requires to be mentioned is that of
                    Aetius (550 A.D.), a compiler who closely followed Oribasius, but with inferior
                    powers, and whose work also has an historical but no original value. A higher
                    rank among medical writers is assigned to Alexander of Tralles (525-605), whose
                    doctrine was that of an eclectic. His practical and therapeutical rules are
                    evidently the fruit of his own experience, though it would be difficult to
                    attribute to him any decided advance in medical knowledge. But the most
                    prominent figure in Byzantine medicine is that of Paul of Aegina (Paulus
                    Aegineta), who lived probably in the early part of the 7th century. His skill,
                    especially in surgery, must have been considerable, and his ’Ιατρικά gives a
                    very complete picture of the achievements of the Greeks in this department.
                    Another work, on obstetrics, now lost, was equally famous, and procured for him,
                    among the Arabs, the name of “the Obstetrician.” His reputation lasted through
                    the Middle Ages, and was not less in the Arabian schools than in the West. In
                    this respect Paulus is a most important influence in the development of
                    medicine. His great work on surgery was early translated into Arabic, and became
                    the foundation of the surgery of Abulcasis, which in turn (to anticipate) was
                    one of the chief sources of surgical knowledge to Europe in the Middle Ages. The
                    succeeding period of Byzantine history was so little favourable to science that
                    no name worthy of note occurs again (though many medical works of this period
                    are still extant) till the 13th century, when we meet with a group of
                    writers;—Demetrius Pepagomenus, Nicolaus Myrepsus, and Johannes, called
                    Actuarius, who flourished under the protection of the Palaeologi. The work of
                    the last has some independent merit; but all are interesting as showing a fusion
                    of Greek and Arabian medicine, the latter having begun to exercise even in the
                    11th century a reflex influence on the schools of Byzantium. Something was
                    borrowed even from the school of Salerno, and thus the close of Byzantine
                    medicine is brought into connexion with the dawn of science in modern
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>In the West the period after Galen affords little evidence of anything but a
                    gradual though unvarying decline in Roman medicine. Ccelius Aurelianus, already
                    referred to as the follower of Soranus, must be mentioned as showing the
                    persistence of the methodic school. An abridgment of one of his writings, with
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">A urelius,</hi> became the most popular of all
                    Latin medical works. As a writer he <pb break="no"

                    literature. Little else was produced in these times but compilations, of the
                    most meagre kind, chiefly of the nature of herbals, or domestic receipt-books;
                    among the authors of which it may be sufficient to name Serenus Sammonicus (3d
                    century), Gargilius Martialis (3d century), and Marcellus Empiricus (5th
                    century). Certain compilations still extant bear the falsely-assumed names of
                    eminent writers, such as Pliny and Hippocrates. A writer with the (perhaps
                    assumed) name of Apuleius Platonicus produced a herbal which held its ground
                    till the 15th century at least, and was in the 9th translated into Anglo-Saxon.
                    These poor compilations, together with Latin translations of certain works of
                    Galen and Hippocrates, formed a medical literature, meagre and unprogressive
                    indeed, but of which a great part survived through the Middle Ages till the
                    discovery of printing and revival of learning. It is important to remember that
                    this obscure stream of tradition flowed on, only partially affected by the
                    influx of Arabian, or even the early revival of purer classical learning.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Arabian Medicine.—</hi> The rise of the Mohammedan empire,
                    which influenced Europe so deeply both politically and intellectually, made its
                    mark also in the history of medicine. As in the parallel case of the Roman
                    conquest of Greece, the superior culture of the conquered race asserted its
                    supremacy over their Arab conquerors. After the Mohammedan conquests became
                    consolidated, and learning began to flourish, schools of medicine, often
                    connected with hospitals and schools of pharmacy, arose in all the chief seats
                    of Moslem power. At Damascus Greek medicine was zealously cultivated with the
                    aid of Jewish and Christian teachers. In Baghdad, under the rule of Hârün el
                    Rashid and his successors, a still more flourishing school arose, where numerous
                    translations of Greek medical works were made. The names of Mesua, or Yahyâibn

                    translator and commentator of Hippocrates and Galen, belong to this period.
                    Certain writings of Joan-ιιitius, translated into Latin, were popular in the
                    Middle Ages in Europe, and were printed in the 16th century. At the same time
                    the Arabs became acquainted with Indian medicine, and Indian physicians lived at
                    the court of Baghdad. The Islamite rulers in Spain were not long behind those of
                    the East in encouraging learning and medical science, and developed culture to a
                    still higher degree of perfection. In that country much was due to the Jews, who
                    had already established schools in places which were afterwards the seats of
                    Moslem dominion. From the 10th to the 13th century was the brilliant period of
                    ∕irabian medicine in Spain.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The classical period of Arabian medicine begins with Rhazes (Abri Bakr Mohammed
                    ibn Zakariyâ el-Râzf, 313 A.H., 925-26 A.D.), a native of Ray in the province of
                    Dailam (Persia), who practised with distinction at Baghdad; he followed the
                    doctrines of Galen, but learnt much from Hippocrates. He was the first of the
                    Arabs to treat medicine in a comprehensive and encyclopaedic manner, surpassing
                    probably in voluminousness Galen himself, though but a small proportion of his
                    works are extant. Rhazes is deservedly remembered as having first described
                    small-pox and measles in an accurate manner. Haly, 7.c.,' <hi rend="superscript"

                    Book,” which was the standard authority among the Arabs up to the time of
                    Avicenna, and was more than once translated into Latin and printed. Other
                    writers of this century need not be mentioned here; but the next, the 11th
                    century, is given as the probable though uncertain date of a writer who had a
                    great influence on European medicine, Mesua the younger of Damascus, whose
                    personality is obscure, and of whose very existence some historians have
                    doubted, thinking that the name was assumed by some mediaeval Latin writer. The
                    work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Simplicibus,</hi> which bears
                    his name, was for centuries a standard authority on what would now be called
                    materia medica, was printed in twenty-six editions in the 15th century and
                    later, and was used in the formation of the first London pharmacopoeia, issued
                    by the College of Physicians in the reign of James I. Either to the 10th or the
                    11th century must be referred the name of another Arabian physician who has also
                    attained the position of a classic, Abu’l Kâsim, or Abulcasis, of El-Zahra, near
                    Cordova in Spain. His great work, <hi rend="italic">Altasrif</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> y</hi> a medical encyclopaedia, is chiefly valued for
                    its surgical portion (already mentioned), which was translated into Latin in the
                    12th century, and was for some centuries a standard if not the standard
                    authority on surgery in Europe. Among his own countrymen the fame and position
                    of Abulcasis were soon eclipsed by the greater name of Avicenna (Ibn Sinà).</p>
                <p>Avicenna (see vol. iii. p. 152 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> has always been
                    regarded as the chief representative of Arabian medicine. He wrote on philosophy
                    also, and in both subjects acquired the highest reputation through the whole of
                    Eastern Islam. In Mohammedan Spain he was less regarded, but in Europe his works
                    even eclipsed and superseded those of Hippocrates and Galen. His style and
                    expository power are highly praised, but the subject-matter shows little
                    originality. The work by which he is chiefly known, the celebrated <hi
                    rend="superscript"> tt</hi> canon,” is an encyclopaedia of medical and surgical
                    knowledge, founded upon Galen, Aristotle, the later Greek physicians, and the
                    earlier Arabian writers, singularly complete and systematic, but is thought not
                    to show the practical experience of its author. As in the case of Galen, the
                    formal and encyclopaedic character of Avicenna’s works was the chief cause of
                    his popularity and ascendency, though in modern times these very qualities in a
                    scientific or medical writer would rather cause him to become more speedily
                    antiquated.</p>
                <p>In the long list of Arabian medical writers none can here be mentioned except the
                    great names of the Hispano-Moorish school, a school both philosophically and
                    medically antagonistic to that of Avicenna. Of these the earliest is Avenzoar,
                    or Abumeron, that is, Abù Merw.4n ’Abd el-Malik Ibn Zohr (1113-62), a member of
                    a family which gave several distinguished members to the medical profession. His
                    chief work, <hi rend="italic">Al-Teysîr</hi> (facilitatio), is thought to show
                    more practical experience than the writings of Avicenna, and to be less based
                    upon dialectical subtleties. It was translated into Latin, and more than once
                    printed, as were some of his lesser works, which thus formed a part of the
                    contribution made by the Arabians to European medicine. His friend and pupil <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Averroes</hi> of Cordova <hi rend="italic">(q.v.</hi> ∖ so well
                    known for his philosophical writings, was also an author in medical subjects,
                    and as such widely read in Latin. The famous Rabbi <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Maimonides</hi> (&lt;2 ’.v.) closes for us the roll of medical writers of the
                    Arabian school. His works exist chiefly in the original Arabic or in Hebrew
                    translations; only some smaller treatises have been translated into Latin, so
                    that no definite opinion can be formed as to their medical value. But, so far as
                    is known, the independent and rationalistic spirit which the two last-named
                    writers showed in philosophy did not lead them to take any original point of
                    view in medicine.</p>
                <p>The works of the Arabian medical writers who have now been mentioned form a very
                    small fraction of the existing literature. Three hundred medical writers in <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n837/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0837-0806"/> Arabic are enumerated by Wüstenfeld, and other
                    historians have enlarged the list (Haeser), but only three have been printed in
                    the original; a certain number more are known through old Latin translations,
                    and the great majority still exist in manuscript. It is thus evident that the
                    circumstance of having been translated (which may have been in some cases almost
                    an accident) is what has chiefly determined the influence of particular writers
                    on Western medicine. But it is improbable that further research will alter the
                    general estimate of the value of Arabian medicine. There can be no doubt that it
                    was in the main Greek medicine, modified to suit other climates, habits, and
                    national tastes, and with some important additions from Oriental sources. The
                    greater part is taken from Hippocrates, Galen, Dioscorides, and later Greek
                    writers. The Latin medical writers were necessarily unknown to the Arabs; and
                    this was partly the cause that even in Europe Galenic medicine assumed such a
                    preponderance, the methodic school and Celsus being forgotten or neglected. In
                    anatomy and physiology the Arabians distinctly went back; in surgery they showed
                    no advance upon the Greeks; in practical medicine nothing new can be traced,
                    except the description of certain diseases <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi>
                    small-pox and measles) unknown or imperfectly known to the Greeks; the only real
                    advance was in pharmacy and the therapeutical use of drugs. By their relations
                    with the further East, the Arabs became acquainted with valuable new remedies
                    which have held their ground till modern times; and their skill in chemistry
                    enabled them to prepare new chemical remedies, and form many combinations of
                    those already in use. They produced the first pharmacopoeia, and established the
                    first apothecaries’ shops. Many of the names and many forms of medicines now
                    used, and in fact the general outline of modern pharmacy, except so far as
                    modified by modern chemistry, started with the Arabs. Thus does Arabian medicine
                    appear as judged from a modern standpoint; but to mediaeval Europe, when little
                    but a tradition remained of the great ancient schools, it was invested with a
                    far higher degree of originality and importance.</p>
                <p>It is now necessary to consider what was the state of medicine in Europe after
                    the fall of the Western empire and before the influence of Arabian science and
                    literature began to be felt. This we may call the pre-Arabian or Salernitan
                    period.</p>

                    medical as in civil history there is no real break. A continuous thread of
                    learning and practice must have connected the last period of Roman medicine
                    already mentioned with the dawn of science in the Middle Ages. But the
                    intellectual thread is naturally traced with greater difficulty than that which
                    is the theme of civil history; and in periods such as that from the 5th to the
                    10th century in Europe it is almost lost. The chief homes of medical as of other
                    learning in these disturbed times were the monasteries. Though the science was
                    certainly not advanced by their labours, it was saved from total oblivion, and
                    many ancient medical works were preserved either in Latin or vernacular
                    versions. The “Anglo-Saxon Leechdoms” of the 11th century, published in the
                    Master of the Rolls series of mediaeval chronicles and memorials, admirably
                    illustrate the mixture of magic and superstition with the relics of ancient
                    science which constituted monastic medicine. Similar works, in Latin or other
                    languages, exist in manuscript in all the great European libraries. It was among
                    the Benedictines that the monastic study of medicine first received a new
                    direction, and aimed at a higher standard. The study of Hippocrates, Galen, and
                    other classics was recommended by Cassiodorus (6th century), and in the original
                    mother-abbey of Monte Cassino medicine was studied; but there was not there what
                    could be called a medical school <hi rend="italic">; nor</hi> had this
                    foundation any connexion (as has been supposed) with the famous school of
                    Salerno.</p>
                <p>The origin of this, the most important source of medical knowledge in Europe in
                    the early Middle Ages, is involved in obscurity. It is known that Salerno, a
                    Roman colony, in a situation .noted in ancient times for its salubrity, was in
                    the Gth century at least the seat of a bishopric, and at the end of the 7th
                    century of a Benedictine monastery, and that some of the prelates and higher
                    clergy were distinguished for learning, and even for medical acquirements. But
                    it has by recent researches been clearly established that the celebrated <hi
                    rend="italic">Schola Salernitana</hi> was a purely secular institution. All that
                    can with certainty be said is that a school or collection of schools gradually
                    grew up in which especially medicine, but also, in a subordinate degree, law and
                    philosophy were taught. In the 9th century Salernitan physicians were already
                    spoken of, and the city was known as <hi rend="italic">Ci citas</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Hippocratica.</hi> A little later we find great and royal
                    personages resorting to Salerno for the restoration of their health, among whom
                    was William of Normandy, afterwards the Conqueror. The number of students of
                    medicine must at one time have been considerable, and in a corresponding degree
                    the number of teachers. Among the latter many were married, and their wives and
                    daughters appear also in the lists of professors. The most noted female
                    professor was the celebrated Trotula in the 11th century. The Jewish element
                    appears to have been important among the students, and possibly among the
                    professors. The reputation of the school was great till the 12th or 13 th
                    century, when the introduction of the Arab medicine was gradually fatal to it.
                    The foundation of the university of Naples, and the rise of Montpellier, also
                    contributed to its decline.</p>
                <p>The teachings of the Salernitan doctors are pretty well known through existing
                    works, some of which have only recently been discovered and published. The
                    best-known is the anonymous rhyming Latin poem on health, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Regimen</hi><hi rend="italic">Sanitatis Salerni,</hi> professedly written for
                    the use of the “king of England,” supposed to mean Robert, son of William the
                    Conqueror; it had an immense reputation in the Middle Ages, and was afterwards
                    many times printed, and translated into most European languages. This was a
                    popular work intended for the laity; but there are others strictly professional.
                    Among the writers it may be sufficient to mention here Gariopontus; Coρho, who
                    wrote the <hi rend="italic">Anatome</hi><hi rend="italic">Porci,</hi> a
                    well-known mediaeval book; Joannes Platearius, first of a family of physicians
                    bearing the same name, whose <hi rend="italic">Practica,</hi> or medical
                    compendium, was afterwards several times printed; and Trotula, believed to be
                    the wife of the last-named. All of these fall into the first period before the
                    advent of Arabian medicine. In the transitional period, when the Arabian school
                    began to influence European medicine, but before the Salernitans were
                    superseded, comes Nicolaus Praepositus, who wrote the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antidotarium,</hi> a collection of formulae for compound medicines, which
                    became tL·e standard work on the subject, and the foundation of many later
                    compilations. An equally popular writer was Gilles de Corbeil (Aegidius
                    Corboliensis), at one time a teacher at Salerno, afterwards court physician to
                    Philip Augustus of France, who composed several poems in Latin hexameters on
                    medical subjects. Two of them, on the urine and the pulse respectively, attained
                    the position of medical classics.</p>
                <p>None of these Salernitan works rise much above the rank of compilations, being
                    founded on Hippocrates, Galen, and later Greek writers, with an unmistakable
                    mixture of the doctrines of the methodists. But they often show much practical
                    experience, and exhibit the naturalistic method of the Hippocratic school. The
                    general plan of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0838-0807"/> treatment is dietetic rather than pharmaceutical,
                    though the art of preparing drugs had_reached a high degree of complexity at
                    Salerno. Anatomy was as little regarded as it was in the later ancient schools,
                    the empiric and methodic, but demonstrations of the parts of the body were given
                    on swine. Although it cannot be said that the science of medicine was advanced
                    at Salerno, still its decline was arrested at a time when every other branch of
                    learning was rapidly falling into decay; and there can be no doubt that the
                    observation of patients in hospitals, and probably clinical instruction, were
                    made use of in learning and teaching. The school of Salerno thus forms a bridge
                    between the ancient and the modern medicine, more direct though less conspicuous
                    than that circuitous route, through Byzantium, Baghdad, and Cordova, by which
                    Hippocrates and Galen, in Arabian dress, again entered the European world.
                    Though the glory of Salerno had departed, the school actually existed till it
                    was finally dissolved by an edict of the emperor Napoleon I. in the year
                    1811.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Introduction of Arabian Medicine: The Scholastic Period.—</hi>
                    About the middle of the 11th century the Arabian medical writers began to be
                    known by Latin translations in the Western world. Constantinus Africanus, a
                    monk, was the author of the earliest of such versions (1050 A.D.); his labours
                    were directed chiefly to the less important and less bulky Arabian authors, of
                    whom Haly was the most noted; the real classics were not introduced till later.
                    For some time the Salernitan medicine held its ground, and it was not till the
                    conquest of Toledo by Alρhonso of Castile that any large number of Western
                    scholars came in contact with the learning of the Spanish Moors, and systematic
                    efforts were made to translate their philosophical and medical works. Jewish
                    scholars, often under the patronage of Christian bishops, were especially active
                    in the work. In Sicily also the Oriental tendencies of Frederick Barbarossa and
                    Frederick II. worked in the same direction. Gerard of Cremona, a physician of
                    Toledo (1114-87), made translations, it is said by command of Barbarossa, from
                    Avicenna and others. It is needless to point out the influence of the crusades
                    in making Eastern ideas known in the Western world. The influence of Arabian
                    medicine soon began to be felt even in the Hippocratic city of Salerno, and in
                    the 13th century is said to have held an even balance with the older medicine.
                    After this time the foreign influence predominated; and by the time that the
                    Aristotelian dialectic, in the introduction of which the Arabs had so large a
                    share, prevailed in the schools of Europe, the Arabian version of Greek medicine
                    reigned supreme in the medical world. That this movement coincided with the
                    establishment of some of the older European universities is well known. The
                    history of medicine in the period now opening is closely combined with the
                    history of scholastic philosophy. Both were infected with the same dialectical
                    subtlety, which was, from the nature of the subject, especially injurious to
                    medicine.</p>
                <p>At the same time, through the rise of the universities, medical learning was much
                    more widely diffused, and the first definite forward movement was seen in the
                    school of Montpellier, where a medical faculty existed early in the 12th
                    century, afterwards united with faculties of law and philosophy. The medical
                    school owed its foundation largely to Jewish teachers, themselves educated in
                    the Moorish schools of Spain, and imbued with the intellectual independence of
                    the Averroists. Its rising prosperity coincided with the decline of the school
                    of Salerno. Montpellier became distinguished for the practical and empirical
                    spirit of its medicine, as contrasted with the dogmatic and scholastic teaching
                    of Paris and other universities. In Italy, Bologna and Padua were earliest
                    distinguished for medical studies,—the former preserving more of the Galenical
                    tradition, the latter being more progressive and Averroist. The northern
                    universities contributed little,— the reputation even of Paris being of later
                    growth.</p>
                <p>The supremacy of Arabian medicine lasted till the revival of learning, when the
                    study of the medical classics in their original language worked another
                    revolution. The medical writers of this period, who chiefly drew from Arabian
                    sources, have been called Arabists (though it is difficult to give any clear
                    meaning to this term), and were afterwards known as the neoterics.</p>
                <p>The medical literature of this period is extremely voluminous, but essentially
                    second-hand, consisting mainly of commentaries on Hippocrates, Galen, Avicenna,
                    and others, or of compilations and <hi rend="italic">compendia</hi> still less
                    original than commentaries. Among these may be mentioned the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conciliator</hi> of Peter of Abano (1250-1315), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aggregator</hi> of Jacob de Dondi (1298-1359), both of the school of Padua, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Pandectae</hi><hi rend="italic">Medicinae</hi> of the
                    Salernitan Matthaeus Sylvaticus <hi rend="italic">(pb.</hi> 1342), a sort of
                    medical glossary and dictionary. But for us the most interesting fact is the
                    first appearance of Englishmen as authors of medical works having a European
                    reputation, distinguished, according to the testimony of Haeser, by a practical
                    tendency characteristic of <hi rend="subscript"> v</hi> the British race, and
                    fostered in the school of Montpellier.</p>
                <p>The first of these works is the <hi rend="italic">Compendium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Medicinae,</hi> also called <hi rend="italic">Laurea</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Rosa</hi><hi rend="italic">Anglicana,</hi> of Gilbert (Gilbertus
                    Anglicus, about 1290), said to contain good observations on leprosy. A more
                    important work, the <hi rend="italic">Practica</hi><hi rend="italic">seu
                    Lilium</hi><hi rend="italic">Medicinae,</hi> of Bernard Gordon, a Scottish
                    professor at Montpellier (written in the year 1307), was more widely spread,
                    being translated into French and Hebrew, and printed in several· editions. Of
                    these two physicians tho first probably, the latter certainly, was educated and
                    practised abroad, but John Gaddesden, the author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rosa</hi><hi rend="italic">Anglica</hi><hi rend="italic">seu</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Practica</hi><hi rend="italic">Medicinae</hi> (between 1305 and
                    1317), was a graduate in medicine of Merton College, Oxford, and court
                    physician. His compendium is entirely wanting in originality, and perhaps
                    unusually destitute of common sense, but it became so popular as to be reprinted
                    up to the end of the 16th century. Works of this kind became still more abundant
                    in the 14th and in the first half of the 15th century, till the wider
                    distribution of the medical classics in the original put them out of
                    fashion.</p>
                <p>In surgery this period was far more productive than in medicine, especially in
                    Italy and France, but the limits of our subject only permit us to mention
                    Gulielmus de Saliceto of Piacenza (about 1275), Lanfranchi of Milan (died about
                    1306), the French surgeon, Guy de Chauliac (about 1350), and the Englishman,
                    John Ardern (about 1350). In anatomy also the beginning of a new epoch was made
                    by Mondino de Liucci, or Mundinus (1275- 1326), and his followers. Some advance
                    was made in chemistry by the celebrated Arnold de λ illanova (1235- 1312), whose
                    medical writings (if the <hi rend="italic">Breviarium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Practices</hi> be rightly ascribed to him) rise above the rank of compilations.
                    Finally, in the 13th and especially the 14th century, we find, under the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">consilia,</hi><hi rend="italic">the</hi> first mediaeval
                    reports of medical cases which are preserved in such a form as to bo

                    among others, by Gentilis Fulgineua before 1348, by Bartolomeo Moιιtagnana (died
                    in 1470), and by Baverius de Baveriis of Imola (about 1450). The last-named, we
                    can say from experience, contains much that is interesting and readable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Period of the Revival of Learning.—</hi> The impulse which all
                    departments of intellectual activity received from the revival of Greek
                    literature in Europe was felt by medicine among the rest. Not that the spirit of

                    been literary and dogmatic, and it was literary and dogmatic still; but the
                    medical literature now brought to light, including as it did the more important
                    works of Hippocrates and Galen, many of them hitherto unknown, and in addition
                    the forgotten element of Latin medicine, especially the work of Celsus, was in
                    itself far superior to the second-hand compilations and incorrect versions which
                    had formerly been accepted as standards. The classical works, though still
                    regarded with unreasoning reverence, were found to have a germinative and
                    vivifying power that carried the mind out of the region of dogma, and prepared
                    the way for the scientific movement which has been growing in strength up to our
                    own day.</p>
                <p>Two of the most important results of the revival of learning were indeed such as
                    are excluded from the scope of this brief sketch, namely, the reawakening of
                    anatomy, which to a large extent grew out of the study of the works of Galen,
                    and the investigation of medicinal plants, to which a fresh impulse was given by
                    the revival of Dioscorides and other ancient naturalists. The former brought
                    with it necessarily a more accurate conception of physiology, and thus led up to
                    the great discovery of Harvey, which was the turning-point in modern medicine.
                    The latter gave rise, on the one hand, to the modern science of botany, on the
                    other to a more rational knowledge of drugs and their uses. At the same time,
                    the discovery of America, and increased intercourse with the East, by
                    introducing a variety of new plants, greatly accelerated the progress both of
                    botany and pharmacology.</p>
                <p>But it was not in these directions that improvement was first looked for. It was
                    at first very naturally imagined that the simple revival of classical and
                    especially of Greek literature would at once produce the same brilliant results
                    in medicine as in literature and philosophy. The movement of reform started, of
                    necessity, with scholars rather than practising physicians,—more precisely with
                    a group of learned men, whom we may be permitted, for the sake of a name, to
                    call the medical humanists, equally enthusiastic in the cause of letters and of
                    medicine. From both fields they hoped to expel the evils which were summed up in
                    the word barbarism. Nearly all mediaeval medical literature was condemned under
                    this name; and for it the humanists proposed to substitute the originals of
                    Hippocrates and Galen, thus leading back medicine to its fountain-head. Since a
                    knowledge of Greek was still confined to a small body of scholars, and a still
                    smaller proportion of physicians, the first task was to translate the Greek
                    classics into Latin. To this work several learned physicians, chiefly Italians,
                    applied themselves with great ardour. Among the earliest were Nicolaus
                    Leonicenus of Vicenza (1428-1524), Giovanni de Monte or Montanus (1498-1552),
                    and many others in Italy. In northern Europe should be mentioned Gulielmus Copus
                    (1471- 1532) and Gunther of Andernach (1487-1584) better known as Guinterius
                    Andernacensis, both for a time professors at Paris; and, among the greatest,
                    Thomas Linacre (about 1460-1524; see <hi rend="smallcaps">Linacre).</hi> A
                    little later Janus Cornarius or Hagenbut (1500-58) and Leonard Fuchs (1501-66)
                    in Germany, and John Kaye or Caius (1510- 72) in England, carried on the work.

                    contemporary of Rabelais, and the patron of Servetus, wrote with fantastic
                    enthusiasm on the superiority of the Greek to the Arabian physicians, and
                    possibly did something to enlist in the same cause the two far greater men just
                    mentioned. Rabelais not only lectured on Galen and Hippocrates, but edited some
                    works of the latter; and Servetus, in a little tract <hi rend="italic"
                    >Syruporum</hi><hi rend="italic">universa</hi><hi rend="italic">ratio,</hi>
                    defended the practice of Galen as compared with that of the Arabians. The great
                    Aldine press made an important contribution to the work, by <hi rend="italic"
                    >editiones principes</hi> of Hippocrates and Galen in the original. Thus was the
                    campaign opened against the mediaeval and Arabian writers, till finally Greek
                    medicine assumed a predominant position, and Galen took the place of Avicenna.
                    The result was recorded in a formal manner by the Florentine Academy, sometime
                    shortly before 1535: “quae, excusso Arabicae et barbarae servitutis medicae
                    jugo, ex professo se Galenicam appellavit et profligato barbarorum exercitu unum
                    totum et solum Galenum, ut optimum artis medicae authorem, in omnibus se
                    sequuturam pollicita est.” Janus Cornarius, from whom this is quoted, laments,
                    however, that the Arabians still reigned in most of the schools of medicine, and
                    that the Italian and French authors of works called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Practica</hi> were still in high repute. The triumph of Galenism was therefore
                    not complete by the middle of the 16th century. It was probably most so, and
                    earliest, in the schools of Italy and in those of England, where the London
                    College of Physicians might be regarded as an offshoot of the Italian schools.
                    Paris was the stronghold of conservatism, and Germany was stirred by the
                    teachings of one who must be considered apart from all schools—Paracelsus. The
                    nature of the struggle between the rival systems may be -well illustrated by a
                    formidable controversy about the rules for bleeding in acute diseases. This
                    operation, according to the Arabian practice, was always performed on a vein at
                    a distance from the organ affected. The Hippocratic and also Galenic rule, to
                    let blood from, or near to, the diseased organ, was revived by Brissot (1470-
                    1522), a professor in the university of Paris. His attempt at reform, which was
                    taken to be, as in effect it was, a revolt against the authority of the Arabian
                    masters, led to his expulsion from Paris, and the formal prohibition by the
                    parliament of his method. Upon this apparently trifling question arose a
                    controversy which lasted many years, occupied several universities, and led to
                    the interposition of personages no less important than the pope and the emperor,
                    but which is thought to have largely contributed to the final downfall of the
                    Arabian medicine.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Paracelsus and Chemical Medicine.—</hi> Contemporary with the
                    school of medical humanists, but little influenced by them, lived in Germany a
                    man of strange genius, of whose character and importance the most opposite
                    opinions have been expressed. The first noticeable quality in Paracelsus (c.
                    1490-1541) is his revolutionary independence of thought, which was supported by
                    his immense personal arrogance. Himself well trained in the learning and medical
                    science of the day, he despised and trampled upon all traditional and
                    authoritative teachings. He began his lectures at Basel by burning the books of
                    Avicenna and others; he afterwards boasted of having read no books for ten
                    years; he protested that his shoe buckles were more learned than Galen and
                    Avicenna. On the other hand, he spoke with respect of Hippocrates, and wrote a
                    commentary on his <hi rend="italic">Aphorisms.</hi> In this we see a spirit very
                    different from the enthusiasm of the humanists for a purer and nobler philosophy
                    than the scholastic and Arabian versions of Greek thought. There is no record of
                    Paracelsus’s knowledge of Greek, and as, at least in his student days, the most
                    important works of Greek medicine were very imperfectly known, it is probable he
                    had little first-hand acquaintance with Galen or Hippocrates, while his breach
                    with the humanists is the more conspicuous from his lecturing and writing
                    chiefly in his native German.</p>
                <p>Having thus made a clean sweep of nearly the whole of the dogmatic medicine, what
                    did Paracelsus put in its place 1 Certainly not pure empiricism, or habits of
                    objective observation. He had a dogma of his own,—one founded, according to his
                    German expositors, on the views of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n840/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0840-0809"/> Neo-Blatonists, of which a few disjointed
                    specimens must here suffice. The human body was a “microcosm” which corresponded
                    to the “macrocosm,” and contained in itself all parts of visible nature,—sun,
                    moon, stars, and the poles of heaven. To know the nature of man and how to deal
                    with it, the physician should study, not anatomy, which Paracelsus utterly
                    rejected, but all parts of external nature. Life was a perpetual germinative
                    process controlled by the indwelling spirit or Archeus; and diseases, according
                    to the mystical conception of Paracelsus, were not natural, but spiritual.
                    Nature was sufficient for the cure of most diseases; art had only to interfere
                    when the internal physician, the man himself, was tired or incapable. Then some
                    remedy had to be introduced which should be antagonistic, not to the disease in
                    a physical sense, but to the spiritual seed of the disease. These remedies were
                    <hi rend="italic">arcana,</hi> —a word corresponding partly to what we now call
                    specific remedies, but implying a mysterious connexion between the remedy and
                    the “essence” of the disease. Arcana were often shown to be such by their
                    physical properties, not only by such as heat, cold, &lt;fcc., but by fortuitous
                    resemblances to certain parts of the body; thus arose the famous doctrine of
                    “signatures,” or signs indicating the virtues and uses of natural objects, which
                    was afterwards developed into great complexity. Great importance was also
                    attached to chemically prepared remedies as containing the essence or spiritual
                    quality of the material from which they were derived. The actual therapeutical
                    resources of Paracelsus included a large number of metallic preparations, in the
                    introduction of some of which he did good service, and, among vegetable
                    preparations, the tincture of opium, still known by the name he gave it,
                    laudanum. In this doubtless he derived much advantage from his knowledge of
                    chemistry, though the science was as yet not disentangled from the secret
                    traditions of alchemy, and was often mixed up with imposture.</p>
                <p>German historians of medicine attach great importance to the revolt of Paracelsus
                    against the prevailing systems, and trace in his writings anticipations of many
                    scientific truths of later times. That his personality was influential, and his
                    intrepid originality of great value as an example in his own country, is
                    undeniable. As a national reformer he has been not inaptly compared to Luther.
                    But his importance in the universal history of medicine we cannot estimate so
                    highly. The chief immediate result we can trace is the introduction of certain
                    mineral remedies, especially antimony, the use of which became a kind of badge
                    of the disciples of Paracelsus. The use of these remedies was not, however,
                    necessarily connected with a belief in his system, which seems to have spread
                    little beyond his own country. Of the followers of Paracelsus some became mere
                    mystical quacks and impostors. Others, of more learning and better repute, were
                    distinguished from the regular physicians chiefly by their use of chemical
                    remedies. In France the introduction of antimony gave rise to a bitter
                    controversy which lasted into the 17th century, and led to the expulsion of some
                    men of mark from the Paris faculty. In England “chemical medicine” is first
                    heard of in the reign of Elizabeth, and was in like manner contemned and
                    assailed by the College of Physicians and the Society of Apothecaries. But it
                    should be remembered that all the chemical physicians did not call Paracelsus
                    master. The most notorious of that school in England, a certain Anthony, never
                    quotes Paracelsus, but relies upon Arnold de Villanova and Raymund Lully. From
                    this time, however, it is always possible to trace a school of chemical
                    practitioners, who, though condemned by the orthodox Galenists, held their
                    ground, till in the 17th century a successor of Paracelsus arose in the
                    celebrated Van Helmont.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Consequences of ike Revival of Ancient Medicine.—</hi> Tho
                    revival of Galenic and Hippocratic medicine, though ultimately it conferred the
                    greatest benefits on medical science, did not immediately produce any important
                    or salutary reform in practical medicine. The standard of excellence in the
                    ancient writers was indeed far above the level of the 1G th century; but the
                    fatal habit of taking at second hand what should have been acquired by direct
                    observation retarded progress more than the possession of better models assisted
                    it, so that the fundamental faults of mediaeval science remained
                    uncorrected.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless some progress has to be recorded, even if not due directly to the
                    study of ancient medicine. In the first place the 15th and 16th centuries were
                    notable for the outbreak of certain epidemic diseases, which were unknown to the
                    old physicians. Of these the chief was the “sweating sickness” or “English
                    sweat,” especially prevalent in, though not confined to, the country whence it
                    is named. Among many descriptions of this disease, that by John Kaye or Caius,
                    already referred to, was one of the best, and of great importance as showing
                    that the works of Galen did not comprise all that could-be known in medicine.
                    The spread of syphilis, a disease equally unknown to the ancients, and the
                    failure of Galen’s remedies to cure it, had a similar effect.</p>
                <p>In another direction the foundations of modern medicine were being laid during
                    the 16th century, namely, by the introduction of clinical instruction in
                    hospitals. In this Italy, and especially the renowned school of Padua, took the
                    first step, where De Monte (Montanus), already mentioned as a humanist, gave
                    clinical lectures on tho patients in the hospital of St Francis, which may still
                    be read with interest. Pupils flocked to him from all European countries;
                    Germans are especially mentioned; a Polish student reported and published some
                    of his lectures; and the Englishman Kaye was a zealous disciple, who does not,
                    however, seem to have done anything towards transplanting this method of
                    instruction to his own country. Inspections of the dead, to ascertain the nature
                    of the disease, were made, though not without difficulty, and thus the modern
                    period of the science of morbid anatomy was ushered in.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Medicine in the</hi> 17 <hi rend="italic">th century.·</hi>
                    —The medicine of the early part of the 17th presents no features to distinguish
                    it from that of the preceding century. The practice and theory of medicine were
                    mainly founded upon Hippocrates and Galen, with ever-increasing additions from
                    the chemical school. But the development of mathematical and physical science
                    soon introduced a fundamental change in the habits of thought with respect to
                    medical doctrine.</p>
                <p>These discoveries not only weakened or destroyed the respect for authority in
                    matters of science, but brought about a marked tendency to mechanical
                    explanations of life and disease. When Harvey by his discovery of the
                    circulation furnished an explanation of many vital processes which was
                    reconcileable with the ordinary laws of mechanics, the efforts of medical
                    theorists were naturally directed to bringing all the departments of medicine
                    under similar laws. It is often assumed that the writings and influence of Bacon
                    did much towards introducing a more scientific method into medicine and
                    physiology. . But, without discussing the general philosophical position or
                    historical importance of Bacon, it may safely be said that his direct influence
                    can be little traced in medical writings of the first half of the 17th century.
                    Harvey, as is well known, spoke slightingly of the great chancellor, and it is
                    not till the rapid development of physical science in England and Holland in the
                    latter part of the century, that we find Baconian principles explicitly
                    recognized.</p>

                    (published in 1628), the mechanical philosophy of Descartes and the contemporary
                    progress of physics, the teaching of Van Helmont and the introduction of
                    chemical explanations of morbid processes, and finally, combined of all these,
                    and inspiring them, the rise of the spirit of inquiry and innovation, which may
                    be called the scientific movement. Before speaking in detail of these, we may
                    note that by other influences, quite independent of theories, important
                    additions were made to practical medicine. The method of clinical instruction in
                    hospitals, ' commenced by the Italians, was introduced into Holland, where it
                    was greatly developed, especially at Leyden, in the hands of the celebrated
                    Sylvius. It is noteworthy that concurrently with the rise of clinical study the
                    works of Hippocrates were more and more valued, while Galen began to sink into
                    the background.</p>
                <p>At the same time the discovery of new diseases, unknown to the ancients, and the
                    keener attention which the great epidemics of plague caused to be paid to those
                    already known, led to more minute study of the natural history of disease. The
                    most important disease hitherto undescribed was rickets, first made known by
                    Arnold de Boot, a Frisian who practised in Ireland, in 1649, and afterwards more
                    fully in the celebrated work of Glisson in 1651. The plague was carefully
                    studied by Diemerbroek <hi rend="italic">(De Peste,</hi> 1646) and others.
                    Hodges, of London, in 1665 seems to have been the first who had the courage to
                    make a post-mortem inspection of a plague patient. Bennet wrote an important
                    work on consumption in 1654. During the same period many new remedies were
                    introduced, the most important being cinchona bark, brought to Spain in the year
                    1640. The progress of pharmacy was shown by the publication of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dispensatories</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pharmacopoeiae,</hi> such as that of
                    the Royal College of Physicians of London in 1618. This, like the earlier German
                    works of the same kind (on which it was partly founded), contains both the
                    traditional (Galenical) and the modern or chemical remedies.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Van Helmont.—</hi> The medicine of the 17th century was
                    especially distinguished by the rise of systems; and we must first speak of an
                    eccentric genius who endeavoured to construct a system for himself, as original
                    and opposed to tradition as that of Paracelsus. Van Helmont (1578- 1644) was a
                    man of noble family in Brussels, who, after mastering all other branches of
                    learning as then understood, devoted himself with enthusiasm to medicine and
                    chemistry. By education and position a little out of the regular lines of the
                    profession, he took up in medicine an independent attitude. Well acquainted with
                    the doctrines of Galen, he rejected them as thoroughly as Paracelsus did, aud
                    borrowed from the latter some definite ideas as well as his revolutionary
                    spirit. The archeus of Paracelsus appears again, but with still further
                    complications,—the whole body being controlled by the <hi rend="italic">archeus
                    influus,</hi> and the organ of the soul and its various parts by the <hi
                    rend="italic">archei</hi><hi rend="italic">insiti,</hi> which are subject to the
                    central archeus. Many of the symptoms of diseases were caused by the passions
                    and perturbations of the archeus, and medicines acted by modifying the <hi
                    rend="italic">ideas</hi> of the same archeus. These and other notions cannot be.
                    here stated at sufficient length to be intelligible. It is enough to say that on
                    this fantastic basis Helmont constructed a medical system which had some
                    practical merits, that his therapeutical methods were mild and in many respects
                    happy, and that he did service by applying newer chemical methods to the
                    preparation of drugs. He thus had some share, though a share not generally
                    recognized, in the foundation of the iatro-chemical school, now to be spoken of.
                    But his avowed followers formed a small and discredited sect, which, in England
                    at least, can be clearly traced in the latter part of the century.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Discovery of the Circulation of the Blood.—</hi> The influence
                    of Harvey’s discovery began to be felt before the middle of the century. Its
                    merits were recognized by Descartes, among the first, nine years after its
                    publication. For the history of the discovery, and its consequences in anatomy
                    and physiology, we must refer to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Harvey.</hi>
                    In respect of practical medicine, much less effect was at first noticeable. But
                    this example, combined with the Cartesian principles, set many active and
                    ingenious spirits to work to reconstruct the whole of medicine on a
                    physiological or even a mechanical basis,—to endeavour to form what we should
                    now call physiological or scientific medicine. The result of this was not to
                    eliminate dogma from medicine, though it weakened the authority of the old
                    dogma. The movement led rather to the formation of schools or systems of
                    thought, which under various names lasted on into the 18th century, while the
                    belief in the utility or necessity of schools and systems lasted much longer.
                    The most important of these were the so-called iatro-ρhysical or mechanical and
                    the iatro-chemical schools.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Iatro-Physical School.—</hi> The iatro-physical school of
                    medicine grew out of physiological theories. Its founder is held to have been
                    Borelli of Naples (1608-79), whose treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">motu animalium,</hi> published in 1680, is regarded as marking an
                    epoch in physiology. The tendency of the school was to explain the actions and
                    functions of the body on physical and especially on mechanical principles. The
                    movements of bones and muscles were referred to the theory of levers; the
                    process of digestion was regarded as essentially a process of trituration;
                    nutrition and secretion were shown to be dependent upon the tension of the
                    vessels, and so forth. The developments of this school belong rather to the
                    history of physiology, where they appear, seen in the light of modern science,
                    as excellent though premature endeavours in a scientific direction. But the
                    influence of these theories on practical medicine was not great. The more
                    judicious of the mechanical or physical school refrained, as a judicious modern
                    physiologist does, from too immediate an application of their principles to
                    daily practice. Mechanical theories were introduced into pathology, in
                    explanation of the processes of fever and the like, but had little or no
                    influence on therapeutics. The most important men in this school after Borelli
                    were Steno (1638-86), Baglivi (1673-1707), and Bellini (1643-1704). An English
                    physician, Cole (1660-1700), is also usually ranked with them. One of the most
                    elaborate developments of the system was that of Pitcairn, a Scottish physician
                    who became professor at Leyden (1652-1713), to be spoken of hereafter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Iatro-Chemical School. —</hi> The so-called iatro-chemical
                    school stood in a much closer relation to practical medicine than the
                    iatro-physical. The principle which mainly distinguished it was not merely the
                    use of chemical medicines in addition to the traditional, or, as they were
                    called in distinction, “Galenical” remedies, but a theory of pathology or
                    causation of disease entirely different from the prevailing “humoral” pathology.
                    Its chief aim was to reconcile the new views in physiology and chemistry with
                    practical medicine. In some theoretical views, and in the use of certain
                    remedies, the school owed something to Van Helmont and Paracelsus, but took in
                    the main an independent position. The founder of the iatro-chemical school was
                    Francis de le Boë, called Sylvius (1614-72), belonging to a French family
                    settled in Holland. Sylvius was for fourteen years professor of medicine at
                    Leyden, where he attracted students from all quarters of Europe. He made a
                    resolute attempt to reconstruct medicine on the two bases of the doctrine of the
                    circulation of the blood and the new views of chemistry. Fermentation, which was
                    supposed to take place in the stomach, played an important <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0842-0811"/> part in the vital processes. Chemical
                    disturbances of these processes, called <hi rend="italic">acridities,</hi> Ac.,
                    were the cause of fevers and other diseases. Sometimes acid sometimes alkaline
                    properties predominated in the juices and secretions of the body, and produced
                    corresponding disturbances. In nervous diseases disturbances of the vital
                    “spirits” were most important. Still in some parts of his system Sylvius shows
                    au anxiety to base his pathology on anatomical changes. The remedies he employed
                    were partly Galenical, partly chemical. He was very moderate in the use of
                    bleeding.</p>
                <p>The doctrines of Sylvius became widely spread in Holland and Germany; less so in
                    France and Italy. In England they were not generally accepted, till adopted with
                    some modifications by Thomas Willis the great anatomist (1622-75), who is the
                    chief English representative of the chemical school. Willis was as
                    thorough-going a chemist as Sylvius. He regarded all bodies, organic and
                    inorganic, as composed of the three elements—spirit, sulphur, and salt, the
                    first being only found abundantly in animal bodies. The “intestine movement of
                    particles” in every body, or fermentation, was the explanation of many of the
                    processes of life and disease. The sensible properties and physical alterations
                    of animal fluids and solids depended upon different proportions, movements, and
                    combinations of these particles. The elaborate work <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pharmaceutice Rationalis,</hi> based on these materials, had much influence in
                    its time, though it was soon forgotten. But some parts of Willis’s works, such
                    as his descriptions of nervous diseases, and his account (the earliest) of
                    diabetes, are classical contributions to scientific medicine. In the application
                    of chemistry to the examination of secretions Willis made some important steps.
                    The chemical school met with violent opposition, partly from the adherents of
                    the ancient medicine, partly from the iatro-mechanical school. Towards the end
                    of the 17th century appeared an English medical reformer who sided with none of
                    these schools, but may be said in some respects to have surpassed and dispensed
                    with them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sydenham and Locke.—</hi> Thomas Sydenham (1G24-89) was
                    educated at Oxford and at Montpellier. He was well acquainted with the works of
                    the ancient physicians, and probably fairly so with chemistry. Of his knowledge
                    of anatomy nothing definite can be said, as he seldom refers to it. His main
                    avowed principle was to do without hypothesis, and study the actual diseases in
                    an unbiassed manner. As his model in medical methods, Sydenham repeatedly and
                    pointedly refers to Hippocrates, and he has not unfairly been called the English
                    Hippocrates. He resembled his Greek master in the high value he set on the study
                    of the “natural history of disease”; in the importance he attached to “epidemic
                    constitution,” that is, to the influence of weather and other natural causes in
                    modifying disease; and further in his conception of the healing power of nature
                    in disease, a doctrine which he even expanded beyond the teaching of
                    Hippocrates. According to Sydenham, a disease is nothing more than an effort of
                    nature to restore the health of the patient by the elimination of the morbific
                    matter. The extent to which his practice was influenced by this and other <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> conceptions prevents us from classing Sydenham as a
                    pure empiric, but he had the rare merit of never permitting himself to be
                    enslaved even by his own theories. Still less was his mind warped by either of
                    the two great systems, the classical and the chemical, which then divided the
                    medical world. Sydenham’s influence on European medicine was very great. His
                    principles were welcomed as a return to nature by those who were weary of
                    theoretical disputes. He introduced a milder and better way of treating fevers,
                    especially small-pox, and gave strong support to the use of specific medicines,
                    especially Peruvian bark. He was an advocate of bleeding, and often carried it
                    to excess. Another important point in Sydenham’s doctrine is his clear
                    recognition of many diseases as being what would be now called <hi rend="italic"
                    >specific,</hi> and not due merely to an alteration in the primary qualities or
                    humours of the older schools. From this springs his high appreciation of
                    specific medicines.</p>
                <p>One name should always be mentioned along with Sydenham—that of his friend John
                    Locke. The great sensational philosopher was a thoroughly trained physician, and
                    practised privately. He shared and defended many of Sydenham’s principles, and
                    in the few medical observations he has left shows himself to be even more
                    thorough-going than the “English Hippocrates.” It is deeply to be regretted in
                    the interests of medicine that he did not write more. It is, however, reasonable
                    to suppose that his commanding intellect often makes itself felt in the words of
                    Sydenham. One sentence of Locke’s in a letter to W. Molyneux sums up the
                    practical side of Sydenham’s teaching.</p>
                <p>“You cannot imagine how far a little observation carefully made by a man not tied
                    up to the four humours [Galen], or sal, sulphur, and mercury [Paracelsus], or to
                    acid and alcali [Sylvius and Willis] which has of late prevailed, will carry a
                    man in the curing of diseases though very stubborn and dangerous; and that with
                    very little and common things, and almost no medicine at all.”</p>
                <p>We thus see&gt;that, while the great anatomists, physicists, and chemists, men of
                    the type of Willis, Borelli, anti Boyle, were laying foundations which were
                    later on built up into the fabric of scientific medicine, little good was done
                    by the premature application of their half-understood principles to practice.
                    The reform of practical medicine was effected by men who aimed at, and partly
                    succeeded in, rejecting all hypothesis and returning to the unbiassed study of
                    natural processes, as shown in health and disease.</p>
                <p>Sydenham showed that these processes might be profitably studied and dealt with
                    without explaining them; and, by turning men’s minds away from explanations and
                    fixing them on facts, he enriched medicine with a <hi rend="italic">method</hi>
                    more fruitful than any discoveries in detail. From this time forth the reign of
                    canonical authority in medicine was at an end, though the dogmatic spirit long
                    survived.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The</hi> 18i7⅛ <hi rend="italic">century.—</hi> The medicine of
                    the 18th century is notable, like that of the latter part of the 17th, for the
                    striving after complete theoretical systems. The influence of the iatro-physical
                    school was by no means exhausted; and in England, especially through the
                    indirect influence of Newton’s great astronomical generalizations, it took on a
                    mathematical aspect, and is sometimes known as iatro-mathemacical. This phase is
                    most clearly developed in Pitcairn (1652-1713), who, though a determined
                    opponent of metaphysical explanations, and of the chemical doctrines, gave to
                    his own rude mechanical explanations of life and disease almost the dogmatic
                    completeness of a theological system. His countryman and pupil, George Cheyne,
                    who lived some years at Bath, published a new theory of fevers on the mechanical
                    system, which had a great reputation. Their English contemporaries and
                    successors, Freind, Cole, and Meacζ leaned also to mechanical explanations, but
                    with a distrust of systematic theoretical completeness, which was perhaps partly
                    a national characteristic, partly the result of the teaching of Sydenham and
                    Locke. Freind (1675- 1728) in his <hi rend="italic">Emmenologia</hi> gave a
                    mechanical explanation of the phenomena of menstruation. He is also one of the
                    most distinguished writers on the history of medicine. Cole (see above)
                    published mechanical hypotheses concerning the causation of fevers which closely
                    agree, with those of the Italian iatro-mechanical school. More distinguished in
                    his own day than any of these was Richard Mead (1673-1754), one of the most
                    accomplished and socially successful physicians of modern times. Mead was the
                    pupil of the equally popular and successful John Radcliffe <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n843/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0843-0812"/> (1650-1714), who had acquired from Sydenham a
                    contempt for book learning, and belonged to no school in medicine but the school
                    of common sense. Radcliffe left, however, no work requiring mention in a history
                    of medicine. Mead, a man of great learning and intellectual activity, was an
                    ardent advocate of the mathematical doctrines, “It is very evident,” he says,
                    “that all other means of improving medicine have been found ineffectual, by the
                    stand it was at for two thousand years, and that, since mathematicians have set
                    themselves to the study of it, men already begin to talk so intelligibly and
                    comprehensibly, even about abstruse matters, that it is to be hoped that
                    mathematical learning will be the distinguishing mark of a physician and a
                    quack.” His <hi rend="italic">Mechanical Account of Poisons,</hi> in the first
                    edition (1702), gave an explanation of the effects of poisons, as acting only on
                    the blood. Afterwards he modified his hypothesis, and referred the disturbances
                    produced to the “nervous liquor,” which he supposed to be a quantity of the
                    “universal elastic matter” diffused through the universe, by which Newton
                    explained the phenomena of light, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> what was
                    afterwards called the luminiferous ether. Mead’s treatise on <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Power of the Sun and Moon over Human Bodies</hi> (1704), equally inspired
                    by Newton’s discoveries, was a premature attempt to assign the influence of
                    atmospheric pressure and other cosmical causes in producing disease. His works
                    contain, however, many original experiments, and excellent practical
                    observations. James Keill (1673-1719) applied Newtonian and mechanical
                    principles to the explanation of bodily functions with still greater accuracy
                    and completeness; but his researches have more importance for physiology than
                    for practical medicine.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Boerhaave.—</hi> None of these men founded a school,—a result
                    due in part to their intellectual character, in part to the absence in England
                    of medical schools equivalent in position and importance to the universities of
                    the Continent. An important academical position was, on the other hand, one of
                    the reasons why a physician not very different in his way of thinking from the
                    English physicians of the age of Queen Anne was able to take a far more
                    predominant position in the medical world. Hermann Boerhaave (1668-1738) was
                    emphatically a great teacher. He was for many years professor of medicine at
                    Leyden, where he lectured five hours a day, and excelled in influence and
                    reputation, not only his greatest forerunners, Montanus of Padua and Sylvius cf
                    Leyden, but probably every subsequent teacher. The hospital of Leyden, though
                    with only twelve beds available for teaching, became the centre of medical
                    influence in Europe. Many of the leading English physicians of the 18th century
                    studied there; Van Swieten, a pupil of Boerhaave, transplanted the latter’s
                    method of teaching to Vienna, and founded the noted Vienna school of medicine.
                    As the organizer, and almost the constructor, of the modern method of clinical
                    instruction, the services of Boerhaave to the progress of medicine were immense,
                    and can hardly be overrated. In his teaching, as in his practice, he avowedly
                    followed the method of Hippocrates and Sydenham, both of whom he
                    enthusiastically admired. In his medical doctrines he must be pronounced an
                    eclectic, though taking his stand mainly on the iatro-mechanical school. The
                    best known parts of Boerhaave’s system are his doctrines of inflammation,
                    obstruction, and “plethora.” By the last-named especially he was long
                    remembered. His object was to make all the anatomical and physiological
                    acquisitions of his age, even microscopical anatomy, which he diligently
                    studied, available for use in the practice of medicine. He thus differed from
                    Sydenham, who took almost as little account of modern science as of ancient
                    dogma. Boerhaave may be in some respects compared to Galen, but again differed
                    from him in that he always abstained from attempting to reduce his knowledge to
                    a uniform and coherent system. Boerhaave attached great importance to the study
                    of the medical classics, but rather treated them historically than quoted them
                    as canonical authorities. It almost follows from the nature of the case that the
                    great task of Boerhaave’s life, a synthesis of ancient and modern medicine, and
                    the work in which this is chiefly contained, his celebrated <hi rend="italic"

                    thing is true even of the <hi rend="italic">Aphorisms,</hi> in which, following
                    the example of Hippocrates, he endeavoured to sum up the results of his long

                <p><hi rend="italic">Hoffmann and Stahl.—</hi> We have now to speak of two writers
                    in whom the systematic tendency of the 18th century showed itself most
                    completely.</p>
                <p>Friedrich Hoffmann (1660-1742), like Boerhaave, owed his influence, and perhaps
                    partly his intellectual characteristics, to his academical position. He was in
                    1693 appointed the first professor of medicine in the university of Halle, then
                    just founded by the elector Frederick III. Here he became, as did his
                    contemporary and rival Stahl, a popular and influential teacher, though their
                    university had not the European importance of Leyden. Hoffmann’s “system” was
                    apparently intended to reconcile the opposing “spiritual” and “materialistic”
                    views of nature, and is thought to have been much influenced by the philosophy
                    of Leibnitz. His medical theories rest upon a complete theory of the universe.
                    Life depended upon a universally diffused ether, which animals breathe in from
                    the atmosphere, and which is contained in all parts of the body. It accumulates
                    in the brain, and there generates the “nervous fluid” or <hi rend="italic"
                    >pneuma,—</hi> a theory closely resembling that of Mead on the “nervous liquor,”
                    unless indeed Mead borrowed it from Hoffmann. On this system are explained all
                    the phenomena of life and disease. Health depends on the maintenance of a proper
                    “tone” in the body,—some diseases being produced by excess of tone, or “spasm”;
                    others by “atony,” or want of tone. But it is impossible here to follow its
                    further developments. Independently of his system, which has long ceased to
                    exert any influence, Hoffmann made some contributions to practical medicine; and
                    his great knowledge of chemistry enabled him to investigate the subject of
                    mineral waters. He was equally skilful in pharmacy, but lowered his position by
                    the practice, which would be unpardonable in a modern physician, of trafficking
                    in secret remedies. Some of these are even to this day sold for the benefit of
                    the orphanage at Halle.</p>
                <p>George Ernest Stahl (1660-1734) was for more than twenty years professor of
                    medicine at Halle, and thus a colleague of Hoffmann, whom he resembled in
                    constructing a complete theoretical system, though their systems had l·.ttle or
                    nothing in common. Stahl’s chief aim was to oppose materialism. For mechanical
                    conceptions he substituted the theory of “animism,”—attributing to the soul the
                    functions of ordinary animal life in man, while the life of other creatures was
                    left to mechanical laws. The symptoms of disease were explained as efforts of
                    the soul to rid itself from morbid influences, the soul acting reasonably with
                    respect to the end of self-preservation. The anima thus corresponds partly to
                    the “nature” of Sydenham, while in other respects it resembles the archeus of
                    Van Helmont. Animism in its completeness met with little acceptance during the
                    lifetime of its author, but influenced some of the iatro-physical school. Stahl
                    was the author of the theory of “phlogiston” in chemistry, which in its day had
                    great importance.</p>

                    ultimately superseded. These are physiology in the modern sense, as dating from
                    Haller, and pathological anatomy, as dating from Morgagni.</p>
                <p>Albrecht von Haller (1708-77) was a man of even more encyclopaedic attainments
                    than Boerhaave. He advanced chemistry, botany, anatomy, as well as physiology,
                    and was incessantly occupied in endeavouring to apply his scientific studies to
                    practical medicine, thus continuing the work of his great teacher Bcerhaave.
                    Besides all this he was probably more profoundly acquainted with the literature
                    and bibliography of medicine than any one before or since. Haller occupied in
                    the new university of Göttingen (founded 1737) a position corresponding to that
                    of Boerhaave at Leyden, and in like manner influenced a very large circle of
                    pupils. The appreciation of his work in physiology belongs to the history of
                    that science; we are only concerned here with its influence on medicine.
                    Haller’s definition of irritability as a property of muscular tissue, and its
                    distinction from sensibility as a property of nerves, struck at the root of the
                    prevailing hypothesis respecting animal activity. It was no longer necessary to
                    suppose that a half conscious “anima” was directing every movement. Moreover,
                    Haller’s views did not rest on <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> speculation, but
                    on numerous experiments. He was among the first to investigate the action of
                    medicines on healthy persons. Unfortunately the lesson which his contemporaries
                    learnt was not the importance of experiment, but only the need of contriving
                    other “systems” less open to objection; and thus the influence of Haller led
                    directly to the theoretical subtleties of Cullen and John Brown, and only
                    indirectly and later on to the general anatomy of Bichat. The great name of
                    Haller does not therefore occupy a very prominent place in the history of
                    practical medicine.</p>
                <p>The work of Giovanni Battista Morgagni (1682-1771) had and still preserves a
                    permanent importance beyond that of all the contemporary theorists. In a series
                    of letters <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">sedibus et causis morborum
                    per anatomen indagatis,</hi> published when he was in his eightieth year, he
                    describes the appearances met with at the post-mortem examination as well as the
                    symptoms during life in a number of cases of various diseases. It was not the
                    first work of the kind. Bonet had published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sepulcretum</hi> in 1679; and observations of post-mortem appearances had been
                    made by Montanus, Tulp, Vieussens, Valsalva, Lancisi, Haller, and others. But
                    never before was so large a collection of cases brought together, described with
                    such accuracy, or illustrated with equal anatomical and medical knowledge.
                    Morgagni’s work at once made an epoch in the science. Morbid anatomy now became
                    a recognized branch of medical research, and the movement was started which has
                    lasted till our own day.</p>
                <p>The contribution of Morgagni to medical science must be regarded as in some
                    respects the counterpart of Sydenham’s. The latter had, in neglecting anatomy,
                    neglected the most solid basis for studying the natural history of disease;
                    though perhaps it was less from choice than because his practice, as he was not
                    attached to a hospital, gave him no opportunities. But it is on the combination
                    of the two methods, that of Sydenham and of Morgagni, that modern medicine
                    rests; and it is through these that it has been able to make steady progress in
                    its own field, independently of the advance of physiology or other sciences.</p>
                <p>The method of Morgagni found many imitators, both in his own country and in
                    others. In England the first important name in this field is at the same time
                    that of the first writer of a systematic work in any language on morbid anatomy,
                    Matthew Baillie (1761-1823), who published his treatise in 1793.</p>

                    from being passed over, though their real contribution to the progress of
                    medicine was not great—Cullen and Brown.</p>
                <p>William Cullen (1712-90) was a most eminent and popular professor of medicine at
                    Edinburgh. The same academical influences as surrounded the Dutch and German
                    founders of systems were doubtless partly concerned in leading him to form the
                    plan of a comprehensive system of medicine. Cullen’s system was largely based on
                    the new physiological doctrine of irritability, but is especially noticeable for
                    the importance attached to nervous action. Thus even gout was regarded as a
                    “neurosis.” These pathological principles of Cullen are contained in his <hi
                    rend="italic">First Lines of the Practice of Physic,</hi> an extremely popular
                    book, often reprinted and translated. More importance is to be attached to his
                    <hi rend="italic">Nosology or Classification of Diseases.</hi> The attempt to
                    classify diseases on a natural-history plan was not new, having been commenced
                    by Sauvages and others, and is perhaps not a task of the highest importance.
                    Cullen drew out a classification of great and needless complexity, the chief
                    part of which is now forgotten, but several of his main divisions are still
                    preserved.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to form a clear estimate of the importance of the last
                    syι⅜ematizer of medicine, John Brown (1735- 88), for, though in England he has
                    been but little regarded, the wide though short-lived popularity of his system
                    on the Continent shows that it must have contained some elements of brilliancy,
                    if not originality. His theory of medicine professed to explain the processes of
                    life and disease, and the methods of cure, upon one simple principle, — that of
                    the property of “excitability,” in virtue of which the “exciting powers,”
                    defined as being (1) external forces and (2) the functions of the system itself,
                    call forth the vital phenomena “sense, motion, mental function, and passion.”
                    All exciting powers are stimulant, the apparent debilitating or sedative effect
                    of some being due to a deficiency in the degree of stimulus; so that the final
                    conclusion is that “the whole phenomena of life, health as well as disease,
                    consist in stimulus and nothing else.” Brown recognized some diseases as <hi
                    rend="italic">sthenic,</hi> others as <hi rend="italic">asthenic,</hi> the
                    latter requiring stimulating treatment, the former the reverse; but his
                    practical conclusion was that 97 per cent, of all diseases required a
                    “stimulating” treatment. In this he claimed to have made the most salutary
                    reform because all physicians from Hippocrates had treated diseases by depletion
                    and debilitating measures with the object of curing by elimination. It would be
                    unprofitable to attempt a complete analysis of the Brunonian system; and it is
                    difficult now to understand why it attracted so much attention in its day. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> I o us at the present time it seems merely a
                    dialectical construction, having its beginning and end in definitions, the words
                    power, stimulus, &amp;c. <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi> being used in such a way
                    as not to correspond to any precise physical conceptions, still less to definite
                    material objects or forces. One recommendation of the system was that it
                    favoured a milder system of treatment than was at that time in vogue; Brown may
                    be said to have been the first advocate of the modern stimulant or feeding
                    treatment of fevers. He advocated the use of “animal soups” or beef tea. Further
                    he had the discernment to see that certain symptoms, such as convulsions, and
                    delirium, which were then commonly held always to indicate inflammation, were
                    often really signs of weakness.</p>
                <p>The fortunes of Brown’s system (called, from having been originally written in
                    Latin, the Brunonian) form one of t ιe strangest chapiters in the history of
                    medicine. In Scotlanc, Brown so far won the sympathy of the students that
                    riotous conflicts took place between his partisans and opponents. In England his
                    system took little root. In Italy, on the other hand, it received enthusiastic
                    supp&gt;ort, and, natural y, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n845/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0845-0814"/> a corresponding degree of opposition. The most
                    important adherent to Brown’s system was Rasori (1763-1837), who taught it as
                    professor at Pavia, but afterwards substituted his own system of
                    contra-stimulus. The theoretical differences between this and the “stimulus”
                    theory need not be expounded. The practical difference in the corresponding
                    treatment was very great, as Rasori advocated a copious use of bleeding and of
                    depressing remedies, such as antimony. Joseph Frank, a German, professor at
                    Pavia, afterwards of Vienna, the author of an oncyclopaedic work on medicine now
                    forgotten, embraced the Brunonian system, though he afterwards introduced some
                    modifications, and transplanted it to Vienna. Many names are quoted as partisans
                    or opponents of the Brunonian system in Italy, but scarcely one of them has any
                    other claim to be remembered. In Germany the new system called forth, a little
                    later, no less enthusiasm and controversial heat. Girtanner first began to
                    spread the new ideas (though giving them out as his own), but Weikard was the
                    first avowed advocate of the system. Röschlaub (1768-1835) modified Brown’s
                    system into the theory of excitement <hi rend="italic">(Erregungstheorie)</hi>,
                    which for a time was extremely popular in Germany. The enthusiasm of the younger
                    Brunonians in Germany was as great as in Edinburgh or in Italy, and led to
                    serious riots in the university of Göttingen. In America the system was
                    enthusiastically adopted by a noted physician, Benjamin Rush, of Philadelphia,
                    who was followed by a considerable school. France was not more influenced by the
                    new school than England. In both countries the tendency towards positive science
                    and progress by objective investigation was too marked for any theoretical
                    system to have more than a passing influence. In France, however, the influence
                    of Brown’s theories is very clearly seen in the writings of Broussais, who,
                    though not rightly classed with the system-makers, since his conclusions were
                    partly based upon anatomical investigation, resembled them in his attempt to
                    unite theory and practice in one comprehensive synthesis. The explanation of the
                    meteoric splendour of the Brunonian system in other countries seems to be as
                    follows. In Italy the period of intellectual decadence had set in, and no
                    serious scientific ardour remained to withstand the novelties of abstract
                    theory. In Germany the case was somewhat different. Intellectual activity was
                    not wanting, but the great achievements of the 18th century in philosophy and
                    the moral sciences had fostered a love of abstract speculation; and some sort of
                    cosmical or general system was thought indispensable in every department of
                    special science. Hence another generation had to pass away before Germany found
                    herself on the level, in scientific investigation, of France and England.</p>
                <p>Before the theoretic tendency of the 18th century was quite exhausted, it
                    displayed itself in a system which, though in some respects isolated in the
                    history of medicine, stands nearest to that of Brown,—that, namely, of Hahnemann
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Homoeopathy).</hi> Hahnemann (1753-1844) was in
                    conception as revolutionary a reformer of medicine as Paracelsus. He professed
                    to base medicine entirely on a knowledge of symptoms, regarding all
                    investigation of the causes of symptoms as useless. While thus rejecting all the
                    lessons of morbid anatomy and pathology, he put forward views respecting the
                    causes of disease which hardly bear to be seriously stated. All chronic maladies
                    result either from three diseases—psora (the itch), syphilis, or sycosis (a skin
                    disease), or else are maladies produced by medicines. Seven-eighths of ail
                    chronic diseases are produced by itch driven inwards.<note anchored="true"

                    one of his later works.) In treatment of disease Hahnemann rejected entirely the
                    notion of a <hi rend="italic">vis</hi><hi rend="italic">medicatrix</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">naturae,</hi> and was guided by his well-known principle “similia
                    similibus curantur,” which he explained as depending on the law that in order to
                    get rid of a disease some remedy must be given which should substitute for the
                    disease an action dynamically similar, but weaker. The original malady being
                    thus got rid of, the vital force would easily be able to cope with and
                    extinguish the slighter disturbance caused by the remedy. Something very similar
                    was held by Brown, who taught that “indirect debility” was to be cured by a
                    lesser degree of the same stimulus as had caused the original disturbance.
                    Generally, however, Hahnemann’s views contradict those of Brown, though moving
                    somewhat in the same plane. In order to select remedies which should fulfil the
                    indication of producing symptoms like those of the disease, Hahnemann made many
                    observations of the action of drugs on healthy persons. He did not originate
                    this line of research, for it had been pursued if not originated by Haller, and
                    cultivated systematically by Tommasini, an Italian “contra-stimulist;” but he
                    carried it out with much elaboration. His results, nevertheless, were vitiated
                    by being obtained in the interest of a theory, and by singular want of
                    discrimination. Hahnemann’s doctrines met with much opposition on the part of
                    the medical profession, and he was hence led to state his case to the “lay”
                    public as a sort of court of appeal; and thus matters of science were made the
                    theme of much popular controversy. This expedient, in which Hahnemann had been
                    in a small degree anticipated by Brown, contributed largely to the success of
                    his system. The appeal flattered a prevalent belief in the right of private
                    judgement, even in technical and learned subjects. Hahnemann was thus able to
                    take up the position (and not without justification) of a victim of professional
                    prejudice. The anomalous position into which professional scorn and
                    extra-professional popularity brought him produced a distinct deterioration in
                    the character of his work. In his second period he developed the extraordinary
                    theory of “potentiality” or dynamiza-tion,—namely, that medicines gained in
                    strength by being diluted, if the dilution was accompanied by shaking or
                    pounding, which was supposed to “potentialize” or increase the potency of the
                    medicine. On this extraordinary principle Hahnemann ordered his original
                    tinctures to be reduced in strength to one-fiftieth; these first dilutions again
                    to one-fiftieth; and so on, even till the thirtieth dilution, which he himself
                    used by preference, and to which he ascribed the highest “potentiality.” It is
                    hardly necessary to point out that even the lower dilutions involve quantities
                    which no analysis can weigh, measure, or even recognize. The still greater
                    eccentricities of Hahnemann’s later works need not be recounted. From a
                    theoretical point of view Hahnemann’s is one of the abstract systems, pretending
                    to universality, which modern medicine neither accepts nor finds it worth while
                    to controvert. In the treatment of disease his practical innovations came at a
                    fortunate time, when the excesses of the depletory system had only partially
                    been superseded by the equally injurious opposite extreme of Brown’s stimulant
                    treatment. Hahnemann’s use of mild and often quite inert remedies contrasted
                    favourably with both of these. Further he did good by insisting upon simplicity
                    in prescribing, when it was the custom to give a number of drugs, often
                    heterogeneous and inconsistent, in the same prescription. But these indirect
                    benefits were quite independent of the truth or falsity of his theoretical
                    system.</p>

                    acquirements which they involved. It was fortunate, however, that the
                    accumulation of positive knowledge in medicine did not cease. While Germany and
                    Scotland, as the chief homes of abstract speculation, gave birth to most of the
                    theories, progress in objective science was most marked in other countries,—in
                    Italy first, and afterwards in England and France. We must retrace our steps a
                    little to enumerate several distinguished names which, from the nature of the
                    case, hardly admit of classification.</p>
                <p>In Italy the tradition of the great anatomists and physiologists of the 17th
                    century produced a series of accurate observers and practitioners. Among the
                    first of these were Antonio Maria Valsalva (1666-1723), still better known as an
                    anatomist; Giovanni Maria Lancisi (1654-1720), also an anatomist, the author of
                    a classical work on the diseases of the heart and aneurisms; and Ippolito
                    Francisco Albertini (1662-1738), whose researches on the same class of diseases
                    were no less important.</p>
                <p>In France Jean Baptiste Sénac (1693-1770) wrote also an important work on the
                    affections of the heart. Sauvages, otherwise F. B. de Lacroix (1706-67), gave
                    under the title <hi rend="italic">Nosologie.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Methodica</hi> a natural-history classification of diseases; Jean Astruc
                    (1684-1766) contributed to the knowledge of general diseases. But the state of
                    medicine in that country till the end of the 18th century was unsatisfactory as
                    compared with some other parts of Europe.</p>
                <p>In England the brilliancy of the early part of the century in practical medicine
                    was hardly maintained to the end, and presented indeed a certain contrast with
                    the remarkable and unflagging progress of surgery in the same period. The roll
                    of the College of Physicians does not furnish many distinguished names. Among
                    these should be mentioned John Fothergill (1712-80), who investigated the
                    “putrid sore throat” now called diphtheria, and the form of neuralgia popularly
                    known as tic douloureux. A physician of Plymouth, John Huxham (1694-1768), made
                    researches on epidemic fevers, in the spirit of Sydenham and Hippocrates, which
                    are of the highest importance. William Heberden (1710-1801), a London physician,
                    called by Samuel Johnson <hi rend="italic">ultimτιs</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Romanorum,</hi> “the last of our learned physicians,” left a rich legacy of
                    practical observations in the <hi rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> published
                    after his death. More important in their results than any of these works were
                    the discoveries of <hi rend="smallcaps">Edward Jenner</hi> (7.v.), respecting
                    the prevention of small-pox by vaccination, in which he superseded the partially
                    useful but dangerous practice of inoculation, which had been introduced into
                    England in 1721. The history of this discovery need not be told here, but it may
                    be pointed out that, apart from its practical importance, it has had great
                    influence on the scientific study of infectious diseases. The name of. John
                    Pringle (1707-82) should also be mentioned as one of the first to study
                    epidemics of fevers occurring in prisons and camps. His work entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Observations on the Diseases of an Army</hi> was translated into
                    many European languages, and became the standard authority on the subject.</p>
                <p>In Germany the only important school of practical medicine was that of Vienna, as
                    revived by Van Swieteu (1700-72), a pupil of Boerhaave, under the patronage of
                    Maria Theresa. Van Swieten’s commentaries on the aphorisms of Boerhaave are
                    thought more valuable than thé original text. Other eminent names of the same
                    school are Anton de Haen (1704-76), Anton Störck (1731-1803), Maximilian Stoll
                    (1742-88), and John Peter Frank (1745-1821), father of Joseph Frank
                    beforementioned as an adherent of the Brownian system, and like his son carried
                    away for a time by the new doctrines.</p>
                <p>This, the old “Vienna School,” was not distinguished for any notable discoveries,
                    but for success in clinical teaching, and for its sound method of studying the
                    actual facts of disease during life and after death, which largely contributed
                    to the establishment of the “positive medicine” of the 19 th century <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>.</p>
                <p>One novelty, however, of the first importance is due to a Vienna physician of the
                    period, Leopold Λveubrugger (1722-1809), the inventor of the method of
                    recognizing diseases of the chest by percussion. Avenbrugger’s method was that
                    of <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> percussion with the tips of the fingers, not
                    that which is now used, of <hi rend="italic">mediate</hi> percussion with the
                    intervention of a finger or plessimeter; but the results of his method were the
                    same, and its value nearly as great. Avenbrugger’s great work, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Inventum</hi><hi rend="italic">Novum,</hi> was published in 1761.
                    The new practice was received at first with contempt and even ridicule, and
                    afterwards by St&lt;&gt;ll and Peter Frank with only grudging approval. It did
                    not receive due recognition till 1808, when Corvisart translated the <hi
                    rend="italic">Inventum</hi><hi rend="italic">Novum</hi> into French, and
                    Avenbrugger’s method rapidly attained a European reputation. Surpassed, but not
                    eclipsed, by the still more important art of auscultation introduced by Laennec,
                    it is hardly too much to say that this simple and purely mechanical invention
                    has had more influence on the development of modern medicine than all the
                    “systems” evolved by the most brilliant intellects of the 18th century.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">.Early Part of the</hi> ∖ <hi rend="italic">⅛tlι Century.—</hi>
                    It is not possible to carry the history of medicine, in a sketch such as this,
                    beyond the early years of the 19th century, both because the mass of details
                    becomes so large as to require more minute treatment, and because it is
                    difficult as we approach our own times to preserve the necessary historical
                    perspective. It was, however, in this period that what we regard as the modern
                    school of medicine was formed, and took the shape which it has preserved to our
                    own days. The characteristic of the modern school is the adoption in medicine of
                    the methods of research of physical science, and the gradually declining
                    importance attached to theory and abstract reasoning,—hypotheses, though not
                    neglected, being used as means of research rather than as ultimate conclusions.
                    Its method may therefore be called the positive method, or that of rational
                    empiricism. The growth of the new school was first seen in two European
                    countries, in France and England, and must be separately followed in the two.
                    Germany entered the field later.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rise of the Positive School in France.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> The reform of medicine in France must be dated from the great
                    intellectual awakening caused by the Revolution, but more definitely starts with
                    the researches in anatomy and physiology of Marie Francois Xavier Bichat
                    (1771-1802). The importance in science of Bichat’s classical works, especially
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Anatomie</hi><hi rend="italic">générale,</hi> cannot be
                    estimated here; we can only point out their value as supplying a new basis for
                    pathology or the science of disease. Among the most ardent of his followers was
                    François Joseph Victor Broussais (1772-1838), whose theoretical views, partly
                    founded on tlιose of Brown and partly on the so-called vitalist school of Bordeu
                    and Barthez, differed from these essentially in being avowedly based on
                    anatomical observations. Broussais’s chief aim was to find an anatomical basis
                    for all diseases, but he is especially known for his attempt to explain all
                    fevers as a consequence of irritation or inflammation of the intestinal canal
                    (gastro entérite). A number of other maladies, especially general diseases and
                    those commonly regarded as nervous, were attributed to the same cause. It would
                    be impossible now to trace the steps which led to this wild and long since
                    exploded theory. It led, among other consequences, to an enormous misuse of
                    bleeding. Leeches were his favourite <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n847/mode/1up"

                    have used 100,000 in his own hospital wards during one year. He was equalled if
                    not surpassed in this excess by his follower Bouillaud, known for his important
                    work on heart diseases. Broussais’s system, to which he gave the name of
                    “Médecine Physiologique” did much indirect good, in fixing attention upon morbid
                    changes in the organs, and thus led to the rise of the strongly opposed
                    anatomical and pathological school of Cυrvisart, Laennec, and Bayle.</p>
                <p>Jean Nicolas Corvisart (,1755-1821) has already been mentioned as the translator
                    and introducer into France of Avenbrugger’s work on percussion. He introduced
                    some improvements in the method, but the only real advance was the introduction
                    of mediate percussion by Piorry in 1828. The discovery had, however, yet to be
                    completed by that of auscultation, or listening to sounds produced in the chest
                    by breathing, the movements of the heart, &amp;c. The combination of these
                    methods constitutes what is now known as <hi rend="italic">physical
                    diagnosis.</hi> René Théophile Hyacinthe Laennec (1781-1826) was the inventor of
                    this most important perhaps of all methods of medical research. Except for some
                    trifling notices of sounds heard in certain diseases, this method was entirely
                    new. It was definitely expounded in an almost complete form in his work <hi
                    rend="italic">De Γauscultation</hi><hi rend="italic">médiate,</hi> published in
                    1819. Laennec attached undue importance to the use of the stethoscope, and laid
                    too much weight on specific signs of specific diseases; otherwise his method in
                    its main features has remained unchanged. The result of his discovery was an
                    entire revolution in the knowledge of diseases of the chest; but it would be a
                    mistake to forget that an essential factor in this revolution was the
                    simultaneous study of the condition of the diseased organs as seen after death.
                    Without the latter, it is difficult to see how the information conveyed by
                    sounds could ever have been verified. This increase of knowledge is therefore
                    due, not to auscultation alone, but to auscultation combined with morbid
                    anatomy. In the case of Laennec himself this qualification takes nothing from
                    his fame, for he studied so minutely the relations of post-mortem appearances to
                    symptoms during life that, had he not discovered auscultation, his researches in
                    morbid anatomy would have made him famous. The pathologico-anatomical method was
                    also followed with great zeal and success by Gaspard Laurent Bayle (1774— 1816),
                    whose researches on tubercle, and the changes of the lungs and other organs in
                    consumption, are the foundation of most that has been done since his time. It
                    was of course antecedent to the discovery of auscultation. Starting from these
                    men arose a school of physicians who endeavoured to give to the study of
                    symptoms the same precision as belonged to anatomical observations, and by the
                    combination of both methods made a new'era in clinical medicine. Among these
                    were Chomel (1788— 1858), Louis (1787-1872), Cruveilhier (1791-1874), and Andral
                    (1797-1876). Louis, by his researches on pulmonary consumption and typhoid
                    fever, had the chief merit of refuting the doctrines of Broussais. In another
                    respect also he aided in establishing an exact science of medicine by the
                    introduction of the numerical or statistical method. By this method only can the
                    fallacies which are attendant on drawing conclusions from isolated cases be
                    avoided; and thus the chief objection which has been made to regarding medicine
                    as an inductive science has been removed. Louis’s method was improved and
                    systematized by Gavarret; and its utility is now universally recognized. Space
                    does not permit us to trace further the history of this brilliant period of
                    French medicine, during which the superiority of the school of Paris could
                    hardly be contested. We can only mention the names of Bretonneau (1771- 1862),
                    Rostan (1790-1866), D’Alibert (1766-1837), Rayer (1793-1867), and Trousseau
                    (1801-1866), the eloquent and popular teacher.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">English Medicine from</hi> 1800 to 1840.—The progress of
                    medicine in England during this period displays the same characteristics as at
                    other times, viz., a gradual and uninterrupted development, without startling
                    changes such as are caused by the sudden rise or fall of a new school. Hardly
                    any theoretical system is of English birth; Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802), the
                    grandfather of the great Charles Darwin, alone makes an exception. In his <hi
                    rend="italic">Zoonomia</hi> (1794) he expounded a theory of life and disease
                    which had some resemblance to that of Brown, though arrived at (he says) by a
                    different chain of reasoning.</p>
                <p>Darwin’s work shows, however, the tendency to connect medicine with physical
                    science, which was an immediate consequence of the scientific discoveries of the
                    end of the 18th century, when Priestley and Cavendish in England exercised the
                    same influence as Lavoisier in France. The English school of medicine was also
                    profoundly stirred by the teachings of the two brothers William and John Hunter,
                    especially the latter,—who must therefore be briefly mentioned, though their own
                    researches were chiefly concerned with subjects lying a little outside the
                    limits of this sketch. William Hunter (1718-1783) was known in London as a
                    brilliant teacher of anatomy and successful obstetric physician; his younger
                    brother and pupil, John Hunter (1728-1793), was also a teacher of anatomy, and
                    practised as a surgeon. His immense contributions to anatomy and pathology
                    cannot be estimated here, but his services in stimulating research and training
                    investigators belong to the history of general medicine. They are sufficiently
                    evidenced by the fact that Jenner and Baillie were his pupils.</p>
                <p>The same scientific bent is seen in the greater attention paid to morbid anatomy
                    (which dates from Baillie), and the more scientific method of studying diseases.
                    An instance of the latter is the work of Robert Willan (1757-1812) on diseases
                    of the skin,—a department of medicine in which abstract and hypothetical views
                    had been especially injurious. Willan, by following the naturalhistory method of
                    Sydenham, at once put the study on a sound basis; and his work has been the
                    starting point of the most important modern researches. About the same time
                    William Charles Wells (1757-1817), a scientific investigator of remarkable
                    power, and the author of a celebrated essay on dew, published observations on
                    alterations in the urine, which, though little noticed at the time, were of
                    great value as assisting in the important discovery made some years afterwards
                    by Bright.</p>
                <p>These observers, and others who cannot be mentioned here, belong to the period
                    when English medicine was still little influenced by the French school. Shortly
                    after 1815, however, when the Continent was again open to English travellers,
                    many English doctors studied in Paris, and the discoveries of their great French
                    contemporaries began to be known. The method of auscultation was soon introduced
                    into this country by pupils of Laennec. John Forbes in 1824, and William Stokes
                    of Dublin in 1825, published treatises on the use of the stethoscope. Forbes
                    also translated the works of Laennec and Avenbrugger, and an entire revolution
                    was soon effected in the knowledge of diseases of the chest. James Hope and
                    Peter Mere Latham further developed this subject, and the former was also known
                    for his researches in morbid anatomy. The combination of clinical and anatomical
                    research led, as in·the hands of the great French physicians, to important
                    discoveries by English investigators. The discovery by Richard Bright
                    (1789-1858) of the disease of the kidneys known by his name, has proved to be
                    one of the most momentous of this century. It was published in <hi rend="italic"

                    Thomas Addison takes, somewhat later, a scarcely inferior place. The remarkable
                    physiological discoveries of Bell and Marshall Hall for the first time rendered
                    possible the discrimination of diseases of the spinal cord. Several of these
                    physicians were also eminent for their clinical teaching,—an art in which
                    Englishmen had up till then been greatly deficient.</p>
                <p>Although many names of scarcely less note might be mentioned among the London
                    physicians of the early part of the century, we must pass them over to consider
                    the progress of medicine in Scotland and Ireland. In Edinburgh the admirable
                    teaching of Cullen had raised the medical faculty to a height of prosperity of
                    which his successor, James Gregory (1758-1821), was notunworthy. His nephew,
                    William Pulteney Alison (1790-1859), was even more widely known. These great
                    teachers maintained in the northern university a continuous tradition of
                    successful teaching, which the difference in academical and other circumstances
                    rendered hardly possible in London. Nor was the northern school wanting in
                    special investigators, such as John Abercrombie, known for his work on diseases
                    of the brain and spinal cord published in 1828, and many others. Turning to
                    Ireland, it should be said that the Dublin school in this period produced two
                    physicians of the highest distinction. Robert James Graves (c. 18J0-1853) was a
                    most eminent clinical teacher and observer, whose lectures are regarded as the
                    model of clinical teaching, and indeed served as such to the most popular
                    teacher of the Paris school in the middle of this century, Trousseau. William
                    Stokes (1804-1878) was especially known for his works on diseases of the chest
                    and of the heart, and for his clinical teaching.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">German Medicine from</hi> 1800 <hi rend="italic">to</hi>
                    1840.—Of the other countries of Europe, it is now only necessary to mention
                    Germany. Here the chief home of positive medicine was still for a long time
                    Vienna, where the “new Vienna school” continued and surpassed the glory of the
                    old. Joseph Skoda (born 1805) extended, and in some respects corrected, the art
                    of auscultation as left by Laennec. Karl Rokitansky (1804-1878), by his colossal
                    labours, placed the science of morbid anatomy on a permanent basis, and enriched
                    it by numerous discoveries of detail. Most of the ardent cultivators of this
                    science in Germany in the next generation were his pupils. In the other German
                    schools, though some great names might be found, as Romberg (1795-1873), the
                    founder of the modern era in the study of nervous diseases, the general spirit
                    was scholastic and the result barren, till the teaching of one man, whom the
                    modern German physicians generally regard as the regenerator of scientific
                    medicine in their country, made itself felt. Johann Lucas Schönlein (1793-1864)
                    was first professor at Würzburg, afterwards at Zurich, and for twenty years at
                    Berlin (from 1839-1859). Schonlein⅛ positive contributions to medical science
                    were not large; but he made in 1839 one discovery, apparently small, but in
                    reality most suggestive, namely, that the contagious disease of the head called
                    favus is produced by the growth in the hair of a parasitic fungus. In this may
                    be found the germ of the startling modern discoveries in parasitic diseases. His
                    systematic doctrines founded the so-called “natural history school;” but his
                    real merit was that of the founder or introducer of a method. In the words of
                    Haeser, “Schönlein has the incontestable merit of having been the first to
                    establish in Germany the exact method of the French and the English, and to
                    impregnate this method with the vivifying spirit of German research.” The name
                    of Schönlein thus brings us to the threshold of the modern German school of
                    medicine,— the most scientific and exact in Europe, and in its spirit strikingly
                    in contrast with the theoretical subtlety of German systematists in the last
                    century.</p>
