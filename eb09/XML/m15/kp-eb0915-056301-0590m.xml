                    been Mares, Marais, or Marets, was a Norman of the neighbourhood of Caen. He was
                    himself a poet of considerable merit, and held the post of <hi rend="italic"
                    >escripυain</hi> (apparently uniting the duties of poet laureate and
                    historiographer) to Anne of Britanny. He had however, on what business or in
                    what capacity is not known, resided in Cahors for a considerable time, and was
                    twice married there, his second wife, whose name is not known, being the mother
                    of Clément. The boy was “brought into France ”—it is his own expression, and is
                    not unnoteworthy as showing the strict sense in which that term was still used
                    at the beginning of the 16th century—in 1506, and he appears to have been
                    educated at the university of Paris, and to have then begun the study of the
                    law. But, whereas most other poets have had to cultivate poetry against their
                    father’s will, Jean Marot took great pains to instruct his son in the
                    fashionable forms of versemaking, which indeed required not a little
                    instruction. It was the palmy time of the <hi rend="italic">rhetoriquβurs,</hi>
                    poets who combined stilted and pedantic language with an obstinate adherence to
                    the allegorical manner of the 15th century and to the most complicated and
                    artificial forms of the <hi rend="italic">Ballade</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rondeau.</hi> Clément himself practised with diligence this poetry (which he
                    was to do more than any other man to overthrow), and he has left panegyrics of
                    its coryphaeus Guillaume Crétin, the unfortunate suggester of the Ramina-grobis
                    of Rabelais. Nor did he long continue even a nominal devotion to law. He became
                    page to a certain Messire de Neuville, and this opened to him the road of court
                    life. Besides this, his father’s interest must have been not inconsiderable, and
                    the house of Valois, which was about to hold the throne of France for the
                    greater part of a century, was devoted to letters. As early as 1514, before the
                    accession of Francis I., Clément presented to him his <hi rend="italic">Judgment
                    of Minos,</hi> and shortly afterwards he was either styled or styled himself <hi
                    rend="italic">facteur</hi> (poet) <hi rend="italic">de la reine</hi> to Queen
                    Claude. In 1519 he was attached to the suite of Marguerite d’Angoulême, the
                    king’s sister, who was for many years to be the mainstay not only of him but of
                    almost all French men of letters. In 1524 he drew 95 livres annually from her as
                    a pension, and he had a post in the household of her husband the Duc d’Alençon.
                    It is certain that Marot, like most of Marguerite’s literary court, and perhaps
                    more than most of them, was greatly attracted by her gracious ways, her
                    unfailing kindness, and her admirable intellectual accomplishments, but there is
                    not the slightest ground for thinking that his attachment was other than
                    platonic. . Indeed the most famous passage of his poems which relates to the
                    future queen, in which he describes her “sweet refusal with a sweeter smile,” is
                    tolerably decisive on the point. It is, however, evident that at this time
                    either sentiment or matured critical judgment effected a great change in his
                    style, a change which was wholly for the better. At the same time he celebrates
                    a certain Diane, whom it has been sought to identify with Diane de Poitiers.
                    There is nothing to support this idea and much against it, for it was an almost
                    invariable habit of the poets of the 16th century, when the mistresses whom they
                    celebrated were flesh and blood at all (which was not always the case), to
                    celebrate them under pseudonyms. In the same year 1524, Marot accompanied
                    Francis on his disastrous Italian campaign. He was wounded and taken at Pavia,
                    but soon released, and he was back again at Paris by the beginning of 1525. His
                    luck had, however, turned. Marguerite for intellectual reasons, and her brother
                    for political, had hitherto favoured the double movementof <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aufklärung,</hi> partly humanist, partly Reforming, which distinguished the
                    beginning of the century. Formidable opposition to both forms of innovation,
                    however, now began to be manifested, and Marot, who was at no time particularly
                    prudent, was arrested on a charge of heresy and lodged in the Châtelet, February
                    1526. But this was only a foretaste of the coming trouble, and a friendly
                    prelate, acting for Marguerite, extricated him from his durance before Easter.
                    The imprisonment gave him occasion to write a vigorous poem on it entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Enfer,</hi> which was afterwards imitated by his luckless friend
                    Dolet. His father died about this time, and Marot seems to have been appointed
                    to the place which Jean had latterly-enjoyed, that of valet de chambre to the
                    king. He was certainly a member of the royal household in 1528, with a stipend
                    of 250 livres, besides which he had inherited property in Quercy. In 1530,
                    probably, he married. Next year he was again in trouble for heresy, and was
                    again rescued; this time the king and queen of Navarre seem to have bailed him
                    themselves. In 1532 he published, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Adolescence</hi><hi rend="italic">Clémentine,</hi> a title the characteristic
                    grace of which excuses its slight savour of affectation, the first printed
                    collection of his works, which was very popular, and was frequently reprinted
                    with additions. Dolet’s edition of 1538 is believed to be the most
                    authoritative. Unfortunately, however, the poet’s enemies were by no means
                    discouraged by their previous ill success, and the political situation was very
                    unfavourable to the Reforming party. In 1535 Marot was again summoned to appear
                    on the charge of heresy, and this time he was advised or thought it best to fly.
                    He passed through Béarn, and then made his way to Renée of Ferrara, a supporter
                    of the French Reformers as steadfast as her aunt Marguerite, and even more
                    efficacious, because her dominions were out of France. At Ferrara he wrote a
                    good deal, his work there including his celebrated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Blasons</hi> (adescriptive poem, improved upon mediaeval models), which set all
                    the verse writers of France imitating them. But the duchess Renée was not able
                    to persuade her husband, Ercole d’Este, to share her views, and Marot had to
                    quit the city. He then went to Venice, but before very long obtained permission
                    to return to France. Francis himself, though a fickle and unsafe patron, was
                    attached to him, and in 1539 gave him a house and grounds in the suburbs. It was
                    at this time that his famous translations of the Psalms appeared. The merit of
                    these has been sometimes denied, owing apparently to the absurd partiality which
                    seems in the case of some critics to make it impossible for the reader to
                    appreciate the manner of a work to the matter of which he is opposed on
                    political or religious grounds. It is, however, considerable, and the powerful
                    influence which the book exercised on contemporaries is not denied by any one.
                    The great persons of the court chose different pieces, each as his or her
                    favourite. They were sung in court and city, and they are said, with
                    exaggeration doubtless, but still with a basis of truth, to have done more than
                    anything else to advance the cause of the Reformation in France. Indeed the
                    vernacular prose translations of the Scriptures were in that country of little
                    merit or power, and the form of poetry was still preferred to prose, even for
                    the most incongruous subjects. At the same time Marot engaged in a curious
                    literary quarrel characteristic of the time, with a bad poet named Sagon. Half
                    the verse writers of France ranged themselves among the Mafotiques or the
                    Sagontiques, and a great deal of versified abuse was exchanged. The victory, as
                    far as wit was concerned, naturally rested with Marot, but his biographers are
                    probably not fanciful in supposing that a certain amount of odium was created
                    against him by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n591/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0591-0564"/> the squabble, and that, as in Dolet’s case, his
                    subsequent misfortunes were not altogether unconnected with a too little
                    governed tongue and pen. Although on his last return into France he had formally
                    abjured his errors, the publication of the Psalms gave the Sorbonne a handle,
                    and the book was condemned by that body. In 1543 it was evident that he could
                    not rely on the protection of Francis, who was probably too selfish in any case
                    to have given him inconvenient help, and who, like many of his family, was
                    disposed to compound with the church for a libertine life by ceremonial devotion
                    and by sacrificing heretics liberally. Marot accordingly fled to Geneva; but the
                    stars were now decidedly against him. He had, like most of his friends, been at
                    least as much of a freethinker as of a Protestant, and, notwithstanding the
                    immense service he had done to the cause by. the publication of his Psalms, this
                    was fatal to his reputation in the austere city of Calvin. He had again to fly,
                    and made his way into Piedmont, where he seems to have enjoyed a sort of
                    left-handed protection from Francis, who then held it. But the harassing effect
                    of these constant persecutions, assisted very likely by the careless living
                    which was but too common at the time, proved too much for him, and he died at
                    Turin in the autumn of 1544, aged barely forty-eight.</p>
                <p>In character Marot seems to have been a typical Frenchman of the old stamp,
                    cheerful, good humoured, and amiable enough, but probably not very much disposed
                    to elaborately moral life and conversation or to serious reflexion. He has
                    sometimes been charged, though on no very definite grounds, with a want of
                    independence of character, and his attitude towards his patrons was certainly
                    not that of almost haughty equality which Ronsard brought in; but it is fair to
                    remember that Marot belonged almost as much to the Middle Ages as to the
                    Renaissance, and that in the Middle Ages men of letters naturally attached
                    themselves as dependants to the great. Such scanty knowledge as we have of his
                    relations with his equals is favourable to him. He certainly at one time
                    quarrelled with Dolet, or at least wrote a violent epigram against him, for
                    which there is no known cause. But, as Dolet quarrelled with almost every friend
                    he ever had, and in two or three cases played them the shabbiest of tricks, the
                    presumption is not against Marot in this matter. Whatever may have been Marot’s
                    personal weaknesses, his importance in the history of French literature is very
                    great, and it is wont nowadays to be rather under-than over-valued. Coming
                    immediately before a great literary reform—that of the Pléiade—Marot suffered
                    the drawbacks of his position; he was both eclipsed and decried by the partakers
                    in that reform. In the reaction against the Pléiade he recovered honour; but its
                    restoration to virtual favour, a perfectly just restoration, has again unjustly
                    depressed him. Yet Marot is in no sense one of those writers of transition who
                    are rightly obscured by those who come after them. He himself was a reformer,
                    and a reformer on perfectly independent lines, besides which it may be said that
                    he carried his own reform as far as it would go. It has been said that his early
                    work was couched in the <hi rend="italic">rhétoriqueur</hi> style, the
                    distinguishing characteristics of which are elaborate metre and rhyme, allegoric
                    matter, and pedantic language. In his second stage he entirely emancipated
                    himself from this, and became one of the easiest, least affected, and most
                    vernacular poets of France. In these points indeed he has, with the exception of
                    La Fontaine, no rival, and the lighter verse writers ever since have taken one
                    or the other or both as model. In his third period he lost a little of this
                    flowing grace and ease, but acquired something in stateliness, while he
                    certainly lost nothing in wit. It is beyond question that Marot is the first
                    poet who strikes readers of French as being distinctively modern. He is not so
                    great a poet as Villon nor as some of his successors of the Pléiade, but he is
                    much less antiquated than the first (whose works, as well as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Roman de la Rose,</hi> it may be well to mention that he edited)
                    and not so elaborately artificial as the second. Indeed, if there be a fault to
                    find with Marot, it is undoubtedly that in his gallant and successful effort to
                    break up, supple, and liquefy the stiff forms and stiffer language of the 15th
                    century, he made his poetry almost too vernacular and pedestrian. In his hands,
                    and while the <hi rend="italic">style Marotique</hi> was supreme, French poetry
                    ran some risk of finding itself unequal to anything but graceful <hi
                    rend="italic">vers de société.</hi> But it is only fair to remember that for a
                    century and more its best achievements, with rare exceptions, had been <hi
                    rend="italic">vers de société</hi> which were not graceful.</p>
                <p>There is a very cheap, handsome, and useful edition of Marot by Jannet and
                    Héricault, 4 vols., Paris, 1873; but Μ. Georges Guiffrey is slowly producing a
                    costly and splendid work, containing a vast quantity of unpublished matter,
                    which will undoubtedly be the standard. This work contains much biographical
                    detail, which, however, as being still incomplete, is not available to modify
                    former accounts. (G. SA.)</p>
