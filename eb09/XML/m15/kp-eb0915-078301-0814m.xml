                <p><label type="entry">MEDICI</label>. This family is renowned in Italian history
                    for the extraordinary number of statesmen to whom it gave birth, and for its
                    magnificent patronage of letters and art. It emerged from private life and rose
                    to power by means of a very subtle policy that was persistently pursued from
                    generation to generation. The origin of the family is buried in obscurity. Some
                    court historians indeed declare it to have been founded by Perseus, and assert
                    that Benvenuto Cellini’s bronze Perseus holding on high the head of Medusa was
                    executed and placed in the Loggia dei Lanzi to symbolize the victory of the
                    Medici over the republic. But this only proves that the real origin of the
                    family is unknown, and equally unknown is the precise signification of the
                    Medicean arms—six red balls on a field of gold.</p>
                <p>The name appears in Florentine chronicles as early as the close of the 12th
                    century, although only casually mentioned in connexion with various offices of
                    the republic. The first of the family to be a distinct figure in history was
                    Salvestro dei Medici, who, in the year 1378, took an active part in the revolt
                    of the Ciompi—so-called because it was led by a wool-carder <hi rend="italic"
                    >{ci&lt;ym,po)</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> y</hi> one Michele di Lando, and
                    because the chief share in it was taken by the populace, who held the reins of
                    government for some time, and sought to obtain extended political rights. But,
                    although Michele di Lando was the nominal chief of the revolt, Salvestro dei
                    Medici was its real leader. The latter, although a member of the greater guilds,
                    had joined the lesser and sought to be at their head, in order to lay the
                    foundation of his own power and that of his kindred by attacking the Albizzi,
                    who were the leading men of the greater guilds. The victory of the Ciompi,
                    however, was brief, for the excesses of the lower classes brought about a
                    reaction, in which they were crushed, and Michele di Lando sent into banishment.
                    Nevertheless the lesser guilds had gained some ground by this riot, and
                    Salvestro dei Medici the great popularity at which he had aimed. His policy
                    during that period had traced the sole possible road to power in liberty-loving
                    Florence. And this was the road henceforth pursued by the Medici.</p>
                <p>On Salvestro’s death in 1388 the Albizzi repossessed themselves of the
                    government, and conducted the wars of the republic. Vieri dei Medici, who seems
                    to have been the next head of the family, understanding the temper of <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0815-0784"/> the times, abstained from becoming a popular
                    leader, and left it to his successors to prosecute the task under easier
                    conditions. Then, in the person of Giovanni, son of Bicci dei Medici
                    (1360—1429), another branch of the family arose, and became from that time
                    forward its representative branch. Indeed this Giovanni may be considered the
                    actual founder of Medicean greatness. He took little part in political affairs,
                    but realized an immense fortune by trade,—establishing banks in Italy and
                    abroad, which in his successors’ hands became the most efficient engines of
                    political power. The council of Constance (1414- 1418) enabled Giovanni dei
                    Medici to realize enormous profits. Besides, like his ancestor Salvestro, he was
                    a constant supporter of the lesser guilds in Florence. Historians record his
                    frequent resistance to the Albizzi when they sought to oppress the people with
                    heavier taxation, and his endeavours to cause the chief weight to fall upon the
                    richer classes. For this reason he was in favour of the so-called law of <hi
                    rend="italic">catasto,</hi> which, by assessing the property of every citizen,
                    prevented those in power from arbitrarily imposing taxes that unjustly burdened
                    the people. In this way, and by liberal loans of money to all who were in need
                    of it, he gained a reputation that was practically the foundation-stone of the
                    grand family edifice. Giovanni dei Medici died in 1429 leaving two sons, Cosimo
                    (1389— 1464) and Lorenzo (1395-1440). From the former proceeded the branch that
                    held absolute sway for many generations over the nominal republic of Florence,
                    and gave to Italy popes like Leo X. and Clement VII. On the extinction of this
                    elder line in the 16th century, the younger branch derived from Lorenzo,
                    Cosimo’s brother, seemed to acquire new life, and for two centuries supplied
                    grand-dukes to Tuscany. Cosimo, surnamed Cosimo the Elder, to distinguish him
                    from the many others bearing the same name, and honoured after his death by the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Pater</hi><hi rend="italic">patriae,</hi> first
                    succeeded in solving the strange problem of becoming absolute ruler of a
                    republic that was keenly jealous of its liberty, without holding any fixed
                    office, without suppressing any previous form of government, and always
                    preserving the appearance and demeanour of a private citizen. Born in 1389, he
                    had already reached the age of forty at the time of his father’s death. He had a
                    certain amount of literary culture, and throughout his life showed much taste
                    and an earnest love both for letters and art. But his father had mainly trained
                    him to commerce, for which he had a special liking and aptitude. In fact he was
                    devoted to business to the day of his death, and like his forefathers derived
                    pecuniary advantage from his friendly relations with the papal court. He
                    accompanied Pope John XXIII. to the council of Constance, transacted a vast
                    amount of business in that city, and made very large gains. Hethen travelled in
                    Germany, and after his return to Florence discharged several ambassadorial
                    missions. At the death of his father he was possessed of a vast fortune and an
                    extended experience, and inherited the leadership of the opposition to the then
                    dominant party of the greater guilds headed by Rinaldo degli Albizzi, Palla
                    Strozzi, and Niccolo da Hzzano. Of gentle and kindly manners, generous in
                    lending and even in giving money whenever he could gain popularity by that
                    means, at critical moments he frequently came to the succour of the Government
                    itself. He was very dexterous in turning his private liberalities to account for
                    the increase of his political prestige, and showed no less acumen and still
                    fewer scruples in making use of his political prestige for purposes of pecuniary
                    profit. Indeed, whenever his own interests were at stake, he showed himself
                    capable of positive villainy, although this was always tempered by calculation.
                    Cosimo proved his skill in these knavish arts during the war between Florence
                    and Lucca. He had joined the Albizzi in urging on this war, and many writers
                    assert that he turned it to much pecuniary advantage by means of loans to the
                    Government and other banking operations. When, however, military affairs went
                    badly, Cosimo joined the discontented populace in invectives against the war and
                    those who had conducted it. This won him an enormous increase of popularity, but
                    the hatred of the Albizzi and their friends augmented in equal degree, and a
                    conflict became inevitable. The Albizzi, who were far more impetuous and
                    impatient than Cosimo, were now bent upon revenge. In 1433 one of their own
                    friends, Bernardo Guadagni, was elected gonfalonier, and thereupon Cosimo dei
                    Medici was called to the palace and summarily imprisoned in the tower. A general
                    assembly of the people was convoked and a “balia” chosen, which changed the
                    Government and sent Cosimo into exile. Undoubtedly the Albizzi party would have
                    preferred a heavier sentence, but they did not dare to attempt their enemy’s
                    life, being well aware of the great number of his adherents. Cosimo had some
                    apprehension that he might be poisoned in prison, but Federigo dei Malavolti,
                    captain of the palace guard, showed him the utmost kindness, and, in order to
                    soothe his fears, voluntarily shared his meals. On the 3d October the prisoner
                    was sent to Padua, his allotted place of exile.</p>
                <p>The Albizzi speedily saw that they had done either too much or too little. While
                    seeking to keep the government entirely in their own hands, they beheld the
                    continual growth of the Medici party. When it was necessary to make a campaign
                    in Romagna against the mercenary captains commanding the forces of the duke of
                    Milan, it was plainly seen that in banishing Cosimo the republic had lost the
                    only citizen banker in a position to assist it with considerable loans. The
                    Florentines were defeated by Piccinino in 1434, and this event greatly increased
                    the public exasperation against the Albizzi. Meanwhile Cosimo, who had gone to
                    Padua as a private individual, was entertained there like a prince. Then, being
                    permitted to transfer his residence to Venice, he entered on a course of lavish
                    expenditure. He was overwhelmed with letters and appeals from Florence. Finally,
                    on the 1st of September 1434, a signory was elected composed of his friends, and
                    his recall was decreed. Rinaldo degli Albizzi determined to oppose it by force,
                    and rushed to the Piazza with a band of armed men; but his attempt failed, and
                    he left the country to return no more. The Medici were now reinstated in all
                    their former dignities and honours, and Cosimo, on the evening of September 6th,
                    rode past the deserted mansions of the Albizzi and re-entered his own dwelling
                    after an exile of a year. For three centuries, dating from that moment, the
                    whole history of Florence was connected witlι that of the house of Medici.</p>
                <p>Cosimo’s first thought was to secure himself against all future risk of removal
                    from Florence, and accordingly he drove the most powerful citizens into exile to
                    all parts of Italy. Nor did he spare even his former political adversary, Palla
                    Strozzi, although the latter had been favourable to him during the recent
                    changes. His rigour in this particular case was universally censured, but Cosimo
                    would tolerate no rivals in the city, and was resolved to abase the great
                    families and establish his power by the support of the lower classes. He was
                    accustomed to say that states could not be ruled by paternosters. Still, when
                    cruelty seemed requisite, be always contrived that the chief odium of it should
                    fall upon others. When Neri Capponi, the valiant soldier and able diplomatist,
                    gained great public favour by his military prowess, and his influence was
                    further increased by the friendship of Baldaccio d’Anghiari, captain of the
                    infantry, Cosimo resolved to weaken his position by indirect means. Accordingly,
                    when in 1441 a partisan of the Medici was elected gonfalonier, Baldaccio was
                    instantly summoned to the palace, imprisoned, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n816/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0816-0785"/> murdered, and his body hurled from the window. No
                    one could actually fix this crime upon Cosimo, but the majority believed that he
                    had thus contrived to rid himself of one enemy and cripple another without
                    showing his hand. It was impossible for Cosimo openly to assume the position of
                    tyrant of Florence, nor was it worth his while to become gonfalonier, since the
                    term of office only lasted two months. It was necessary to discover some other
                    way without resorting to violence; he accordingly employed what were then
                    designated “civil methods.” lie managed to attain his object by means of the
                    “balte.” These magistracies, which were generally renewed every five years,
                    placed in the ballot bags the names of the candidates from whom the signory and
                    other chief magistrates were to be chosen. As soon as a “balia” favourable to
                    Cosimo was formed, he was assured for five years of having the government in the
                    hands of men devoted to his interests. He had comprehended that the art of
                    politics depended rather upon individuals than institutions, and that he who
                    ruled men could also dictate laws. His foreign policy was no less astute. His
                    great wealth enabled him to supply money not only to private individuals, but
                    even to foreign potentates. Philippe de Comines tells us that Cosimo frequently
                    furnished Edward IV. of England with sums amounting to many hundred thousand
                    florins. When Tommaso Parentucelli was still a cardinal, and in needy
                    circumstances, Cosimo made him considerable loans without demanding guarantees
                    of payment. On the cardinal’s accession to the tiara as Nicholas V. he was
                    naturally very well disposed towards Cosimo, and employed the Medici bank in
                    Rome in all the affairs of the curia, which brought immense profits to the
                    house. At the time when Francesco Sforza was striving for the lordship of Milan,
                    Cosimo foresaw his approaching triumph, showed him great friendship, and aided
                    him with large sums of money. Accordingly, when Sforza became lord of Milan,
                    Cosimo’s power was doubled. Without the title of prince, this merchant showed
                    royal generosity in his expenditure for the promotion of letters and the fine
                    arts. Numerous edifices were raised and public works accomplished with his
                    purse. Besides his palace in the city, he constructed noble villas at Careggi,
                    Fiesole, and other places. He built the basilica of Fiesole, and that of St
                    Lorenzo in Florence, and enlarged the church and monastery of St Mark. Even in
                    distant Jerusalem he endowed a hospice for the use of pilgrims. The artists of
                    the day comprised men like Donatello, Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Luca della Robbia,
                    and many others, and Cosimo’s magnificent commissions not only developed their
                    powers but stimulated other men of wealth to the patronage of art. Without being
                    a scholar, Cosimo had a genuine taste for letters, and gave them much and
                    efficient patronage. He purchased many Greek and Latin manuscripts; he opened
                    the first public library at St Mark’s at his own expense, and founded another in
                    the abbey of Fiesole. The Greek refugees from Constantinople found a constant
                    welcome in his palace. During the council of Florence (1439-1442), Gemisthus
                    Pletho spoke to him with enthusiasm of the Platonic philosophy. Cosimo was so
                    deeply attracted by the theme that he decided to have the young Marsilio Ficino
                    trained in philosophy and Greek learning in order to make a Latin translation of
                    the complete works of Plato. And thus a version was produced that is still
                    considered one of the best extant, and that Platonic academy was founded which
                    led to such important results in the history of Italian philosophy and letters.
                    On the 1st of August 1464 Cosimo breathed his last, at the age of seventy-five,
                    while engaged in listening to one of Plato’s dialogues.</p>
                <p>The concluding years of his life had been years of little happiness for Florence.
                    Being old and infirm, he had left the government to the management of his
                    friends, among whom Luca Pitti was one of the more powerful, and they had ruled
                    with disorder, corruption, and cruelty. The lordship of Florence accordingly did
                    not pass without some difficulty and danger into the hands of Piero, surnamed
                    the Gouty, Cosimo’s only surviving legitimate son. Afflicted by gout, and so
                    terribly crippled that he was often only able to use his tongue, the new ruler
                    soon discovered that a plot was ou foot to overthrow his power. However, showing
                    far more courage than he was supposed to possess, he had himself borne on a
                    litter from his villa to Florence, defeated his enemies’ designs, and firmly
                    re-established his authority. But his success may be mainly attributed to the
                    enormous prestige bequeathed by Cosimo to his posterity. Piero died at the end
                    of five years’ reign, on the 3d December 1469, leaving two sons, Lorenzo
                    (1449-92) and Giuliano (1453-78). The younger, the gentler and less ambitious of
                    the pair, was, as we shall presently see, quickly removed from the world.
                    Lorenzo, on the contrary, at once seized the reins of state with a firm grasp,
                    and was, chronologically, the second of the great men bestowed upon Italy by the
                    house of Medici. In literary talent he was immensely superior to Cosimo, but
                    greatly his inferior in the copduct of the commercial affairs of the house, for
                    which he had neither aptitude nor inclination. Jn politics he had nobler
                    conceptions and higher ambitions, but he was more easily carried away by his
                    passions, less prudent in his revenge, and more disposed to tyranny. He had
                    studied letters from his earliest years under the guidance of Ficino and other
                    leading literati of the day, who were constant habitues of the Medici palace. At
                    the age of eighteen he visited the different courts of Italy in order to gain
                    experience of the world and mankind. At his father’s death he was only
                    twenty-one years old, but instantly showed his determination to govern Florence
                    with greater despotism than his father or grandfather. He speedily resorted to
                    the system of the “balie,” and was very dexterous in causing the first to be
                    chosen to suit his purpose. He then proceeded to humiliate the great families
                    and exalt those of little account, and this was the policy he constantly
                    pursued. His younger brother Giuliano, being of a mild and yielding disposition,
                    had only a nominal share in the government.</p>
                <p>Lorenzo’s policy was not exempt from danger, but, although prosecuted with less
                    caution, it was still the old astute and fortunate policy initiated by Cosimo.
                    But the grandson bestowed no care upon his commercial interests, although
                    squandering his fortune with far greater lavishness. Accordingly he was
                    sometimes driven to help himself from the public purse without ever being able
                    to assist it as Cosimo had done. All this excited blame and enmity against him,
                    while his greed in the matter of the alum mines of Volterra, and the subsequent
                    sack of that unhappy city, were crimes for which there was no excuse. Among his
                    worst enemies were the Pazzi, and, as they formed a very powerful clan, he
                    sought their ruin by competing with them even in business transactions. They
                    were just on the point of inheriting the large property of Giovanni Borromeo
                    when, in order to prevent this, Lorenzo hurriedly caused a law to be passed that
                    altered the right of succession. The hatred of the Pazzi was thereby exasperated
                    to fury. And in addition to these things there ensued a desperate quarrel with
                    Pope Sixtus IV., a man of very impetuous temper, who, on endeavouring to erect a
                    state on the frontiers of the Florentine republic for the benefit of his
                    nephews, found a determined and successful opponent in Lorenzo. Consequently the
                    Pazzi and Archbishop Salviati, another enemy of Lorenzo, aided by the nephews of
                    the pontiff, who was himself acquainted with the whole matter, determined to put
                    an end to the family.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0817-0786"/>
                <p>On the 26th April 1478, while Giuliano and Lorenzo were attending high mass in
                    the cathedral of Florence, the former was mortally stabbed by conspirators, but
                    the latter was able to beat back his assailants and escape into the sacristy.
                    His life saved; and, no longer having to share the government with a brother,
                    Lorenzo profited by the opportunity to wreak cruel vengeance upon his foes.
                    Several of the Pazzi and their followers were hanged from the palace windows;
                    others were hacked to pieces, dragged through the streets, and cast into the
                    Arno, while a great many more were condemned to death or sent into exile.
                    Lorenzo seemed willing and able to become a tyrant. But he stopped short of this
                    point. He knew the temper of the city, and had also to look to fresh dangers
                    threatening him from without. The pope had excommunicated him, put Florence
                    under an interdict, and, being seconded by the Neapolitan king, made furious war
                    against the republic. These hostilities speedily assumed alarming proportions,
                    and the Florentines began to tire of submitting to so many hardships in order to
                    support the yoke of a fellow-citizen. Lorenzo’s hold over Florence seemed
                    endangered. But he did not lose heart, and, on the contrary, rose superior to
                    the difficulties by which he was encompassed. He boldly journeyed to Naples, to
                    the court of King Ferdinand of Aragon, who was reputed to be as treacherous as
                    he was cruel, and succeeded in obtaining from him an honourable peace, that soon
                    led to a reconciliation with Sixtus. Thus at last Lorenzo found himself complete
                    master of Florence, and was in a position to turn his power to account. But, as
                    the “balte” changed every five years, it was always requisite, in order to
                    retain his supremacy, that he should be prepared to renew the usual manoeuvre at
                    the close of that term and have another elected equally favourable to his aims.
                    This was often a difficult achievement, and Lorenzo showed much dexterity in
                    overcoming all obstacles. In 1480 he compassed the institution of a new council
                    of seventy, which was practically a permanent <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi>
                    balia” with extended powers, inasmuch as it not only elected the chief
                    magistrates, but had also the administration of numerous state affairs. But,
                    this permanent council of his own devoted adherents once formed, his security
                    was firmly established. By this means, the chroniclers tell us, “liberty was
                    buried,” but the chief affairs of the state were always conducted by intelligent
                    and experienced men, who promoted the public prosperity. Florence was still
                    called a republic; the old institutions were still preserved, if only in name.
                    Lorenzo was absolute lord of all, and virtually a tyrant. His immorality was
                    scandalous; he kept an army of spies, and frequently meddled in the citizens’
                    most private affairs, and exalted men of the lowest condition to important
                    offices of the state. Yet, as Guicciardini remarks, “if Florence was to have a
                    tyrant, she could never have found a better or more pleasant one.” In fact all
                    industry, commerce, and public works made enormous progress. The civil equality
                    of modern states, which was quite unknown to the Middle Ages, was more developed
                    in Florence than in any other city of the world. Even the condition of the
                    peasantry was far more prosperous than elsewhere. And Lorenzo’s authority was
                    not confined to Tuscany, but was also very great throughout the whole of Italy.
                    He was on the friendliest terms with Pope Innocent VIII., from whom he obtained
                    the exaltation of his son Giovanni to the cardinalate at the age of fourteen.
                    This boy cardinal was afterwards Pope Leo X. From the moment of the decease of
                    Sixtus IV., the union of Florence and Rome became the basis of Lorenzo’s foreign
                    policy. By its means he was able to prevent the hatreds and jealousies of the
                    Sforzas of Milan and the Aragonese of Naples from bursting into the open
                    conflict that long threatened, and after his death actually caused, the
                    beginning of new and irreparable calamities. Hence Lorenzo was styled the needle
                    of the Italian compass.</p>
                <p>But the events we have narrated cannot suffice for the full comprehension of this
                    complex character, unless we add the record of his deeds as a patron of letters
                    and his achievements as a writer. His palace was the school and resort of
                    illustrious men. Within its walls were trained the two young Medici afterwards
                    known to the world as Leo X. and Clement VII. Ficino, Poliziano, Pico della
                    Mirandola, and all members of the Platonic academy were its constant habitués.
                    It was here that Pulci gave readings of his <hi rend="italic">Morgante,</hi> and
                    Michelangelo essayed the first strokes of his chisel. Lorenzo’s intellectual
                    powers were of exceptional strength and versatility. He could speak with equal
                    fluency on painting, sculpture, music, philosophy, and poetry. But his crowning
                    superiority over every other Maecenas known to history lay in his active
                    participation in the intellectual labours that he promoted. Indeed at certain
                    moments he was positively.the leading spirit among the literati of his time. He
                    was an elegant prose writer, and was likewise a poet of real originality. At
                    that period Italians were forsaking erudition in order to forward the revival of
                    the national literature by recurring to the primitive sources of the spoken
                    tongue and popular verse. It is Lorenzo’s lasting glory to have been the
                    initiator of this movement. Without being—as some have maintained—a poet of
                    genius, he was certainly a writer of much finish and eloquence, and one of the
                    first to raise popular poetry to the dignity of art. In his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ambra,</hi> his <hi rend="italic">Caccia del Falcone,</hi> and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Nencia da Barberino,</hi> he gives descriptions of nature and of
                    the rural life that he loved, with the graphic power of an acute and tasteful
                    observer, joined to an ease of style that occasionally sins by excess of
                    homeliness. Both in his art and in his politics he leant upon the people. The
                    more oppressive his government, the more did he seek in his verses to incite the
                    public to festivities and lull it to slumber by sensual enjoyments. In his <hi
                    rend="italic">Ballate,</hi> or songs for dancing, and more especially in his
                    carnival songs, a kind of verse invented by himself, Lorenzo displayed all the
                    best qualities and worst defects of his muse. Marvellously and spontaneously
                    elegant, very truthful and fresh in style, fertile in fancy and rich in colour,
                    they are often of a most revolting indecency. And these compositions of one
                    filling a princely station in the city were often sung by their author in the
                    public streets, in the midst of the populace.</p>
                <p>Lorenzo left three sons,—Pietro (1471-1503), Giovanni (1475-1521), and Giuliano
                    (1479-1516). He was succeeded by Pietro, whose rule lasted but for two years. 1
                    During this brief term he performed no good deeds, and only displayed inordinate
                    vanity and frivolity. His conduct greatly helped to foment the hatred between
                    Lodovico Sforza and Ferdinand of Naples, which hastened the coming of the French
                    under Charles VIII., and the renewal of foreign invasions. No sooner did the
                    French approach the frontiers of Tuscany than Pietro, crazed with fear, hastened
                    to meet them, and, basely yielding to every demand, accepted terms equally
                    humiliating to himself and the state. But, returning to Florence, he found that
                    the enraged citizens had already decreed his deposition, in order to
                    reconstitute the republic, and was therefore compelled to escape to Venice. His
                    various plots to reinstate himself in Florence were all unsuccessful. At last he
                    went to the south of Italy with the French, was drowned at the passage of the
                    Garigliano in 1503, and was buried in the cloister of Monte Cassino.</p>
                <p>The ensuing period was adverse to the Medici, for a republican government was
                    maintained in Florence from 1494 to 1512, and the city remained faithful to its
                    alliance with the French, who were all-powerful in Italy. Cardinal <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0818-0787"/> Giovanni, the head of the family, resided in
                    Rome, playing the patron to a circle of literati, artists, and friends, seeking
                    to increase his popularity, and'calmly waiting for better days. The battle of
                    Ravenna wrought the downfall of the fortunes of France in Italy, and led to the
                    rise of those of Spain, whose troops entered Florence to destroy the republic
                    and reinstate the Medici. Pietro had now been dead for some time, leaving a
                    young son, Lorenzo (1492- 1519), who was afterwards duke of Urbino. The
                    following year (1513) Cardinal Giovanni was elected pope, and assumed the name
                    of Leo X. He accordingly removed to Rome, leaving his brother Giuliano with his
                    nephew Lorenzo in Florence, and accompanied by his cousin Giulio, who was a
                    natural son of the Giuliano murdered in the conspiracy of the Pazzi, and was
                    soon destined to be a cardinal and ultimately a pope. Meanwhile his kinsmen in
                    Florence continued tp govern that city by means of a “balia,” although
                    preserving an empty show of republican institutions. And thus, being masters of
                    the whole of central Italy, the Medici enjoyed great authority throughout the
                    country, and their ambition plumed itself for still higher flights. This was the
                    moment when Niccolö Machiavelli, in his treatise <hi rend="italic">The
                    Prince,</hi> counselled them to accomplish the unity of Italy by arming the
                    whole country, and expelling its foregin invaders.</p>
                <p>Leo X., who is only indirectly connected with the history of Florence, gave his
                    name to the age in which he lived in consequence of his magnificent patronage of
                    art and letters in Rome. But he was merely a clever amateur, and had not the
                    literary gifts of his father Lorenzo. He surrounded himself with versifiers and
                    inferior writers, who enlivened his board and accompanied him wherever he went.
                    He liked to lead a gay and untroubled life, was fond of theatrical performances,
                    satires, and other intellectual diversions. His patronage of the fine arts, his
                    genuine affection for Raphael, and the numerous works he caused to be executed
                    by him and other artists, have served to· confer an exaggerated glory on his
                    name. He failed to comprehend the significance of the great religious movement
                    already stirring in Germany, and had not the remotest idea of the grave
                    importance of the Reformation, which indeed he unconsciously promoted by his
                    reckless and shameless sale of indulgences. The whole policy of Pope Leo X.
                    consisted in oscillating between France and Spain, in always playing fast and
                    loose, and deceiving both powers in turn. Yet the evil results of this
                    contemptible policy never seemed to disturb his mind. He finally joined th'e
                    side of the emperor Charles V., and in 1521, at the time of the defeat of the
                    French by the Spanish troops on the river Adda, he ceased to breathe at his
                    favourite villa of Magliana. Giuliano dei Medici had died during Leo’s reign, in
                    1516, without having ever done anything worthy of record. He was the husband of
                    Philiberta of Savoy, was duke of Nemours, and left a natural son, Ippolito dei
                    Medici (1511-1535), who afterwards became a cardinal. Lorenzo, being of more
                    ambitious temper, was by no means content to remain at the head of the Florence
                    Government hampered by many restrictions imposed by republican institutions, and
                    subject to the incessant control of the pope. In his eagerness to aggrandize his
                    kinsmen, the latter had further decided to give Lorenzo the duchy of Urbino, and
                    formally invested him in its rights, after expelling on false pretences its
                    legitimate lord, Francesco Maria della Rovere. This prince, however, soon
                    returned to Urbino, where he was joyously welcomed by his subjects, and Lorenzo
                    regained possession only by a war of several months, in which he was wounded. In
                    1519 he also died, worn out by disease and excess. By his marriage with
                    Madeleine de la Tour d’Auvergne, he had one daughter, Caterina dei Medici
                    (1519-89), married in 1533 to Henry, duke of Orleans, afterwards king of France.
                    She played a long and sinister part in the history of that country. Lorenzo also
                    left a natural son named Alessandro, inheriting the frizzled hair and projecting
                    lips of the negro or mulatto slave who had given him birth. His miserable death
                    will be presently related. Thus the only three surviving representatives of the
                    chief branch of the Medici, Cardinal Giulio, Ippolito, and Alessandro were all
                    of illegitimate birth, and left no legitimate heirs.</p>
                <p>Cardinal Giulio, who had laboured successfully for the reinstatement of his
                    family in Florence in 1512, had been long attached to the person of Leo X. as
                    his trusted factotum and companion. He had been generally regarded as the mentor
                    of the pope, who had no liking for hard work. But in fact, his frivolity
                    notwithstanding, Leo X. always followed his own inclinations. He had much
                    aptitude for command, and pursued his shuffling policy without any mental
                    anxiety. Giulio, on the contrary, shrank from all responsibility, muddled his
                    brains in weighing the reasons for and against every possible decision, and was
                    therefore a better tool of government in others’ hands than he was fit to govern
                    on his own account. When Giuliano and Lorenzo died, the pope appointed the
                    cardinal to the government of Florence. In that post, restricted within the
                    limits imposed by republican institutions, and acting under the continual
                    direction of Rome, he performed his duties fairly well. He caressed the citizens
                    with hopes of extended liberties, which, although never destined to be
                    fulfilled, long served to keep men’s minds in a pleasant flutter of expectation;
                    and when the more impatient spirits attempted to raise a rebellion he speedily
                    quenched it in blood. When, after the death of Leo X. and the very brief
                    pontificate of Adrian VI., he was elected pope (1523) under the name of Clement
                    VII., he entrusted the government of Florence to Cardinal Silvio Passerini
                    conjointly with Alessandro and Ippolito, who were still too young to do much on
                    their own account.</p>
                <p>The pontificate of Leo X. had been a time of felicity to himself if of disaster
                    to Italy and the church. The reign of Clement, on the contrary, was fatal to
                    himself as well, a result chiefly due to his hesitating temper and continual
                    uncertainty of mind. His policy, like that of Leo X., consisted in’ perpetual
                    oscillation between France and Spain. By his endeavours to trick all the world,
                    he frequently ended in being tricked himself. In 1525 he was the ally of the
                    French, who then suffered a terrible defeat at Pavia, where their king Francis
                    I. was taken prisoner. The armies of Charles V. triumphantly advanced, without
                    Clement being able to oppose any effectual resistance. Both Rome and Florence
                    were threatened with a fearful catastrophe.</p>
                <p>Thus far we have had no occasion to speak of the younger branch of the Medici,
                    descended from Lorenzo, brother to Cosimo the Elder. Always in obscurity, and
                    always held in check by the elder line, it now seemed to acquire new life, and
                    first entered the arena of history when the other was on the point of
                    extinction. In fact the most valiant captain of the papal forces was Giovanni
                    dei Medici, afterwards known by the name of Giovanni delle Bande Nere. His
                    father was Giovanni, son of Pier Francesco, who was the son of Lorenzo, the
                    brother of Cosimo dei Medici. History has little to tell of the elder Giovanni;
                    but his wife Caterina Sforza, of whom he was the third husband, was a woman of
                    more than masculine vigour. Giovanni dei Medici married her in 1497, but died in
                    1498, leaving her with one son who was christened Lodovico, but afterwards took
                    his father’s name of Giovanni (1498-1526). Trained to arms from his earliest
                    years, this youth inherited all the energy of his toother, whose Sforza blood
                    seemed to infuse new life into the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0819-0788"/> younger branch of the Medici. Notwithstanding his
                    extreme youth, he had already achieved the title of the best captain in Italy.
                    He always fought with immense dash and daring, and was devotedly loved and
                    obeyed by his soldiery. He was the only leader who opposed a determined
                    resistance to the imperial forces. He was seriously wounded at Pavia when
                    fighting on the French side. On his recovery he joined the army of the League,
                    and was much enraged by finding that the duke of Urbino, commander of the
                    Venetian and papal forces, would never decide on attacking. When the imperial
                    troops were struggling through the marshes of Mantua, surrounded on every side,
                    and without stores or ammunition, Giovanni could not resign himself to
                    inactivity like his colleagues in command. He was ignorant that the imperialists
                    had just received supplies and artillery from the duke of Ferrara, and therefore
                    daringly attacked them with a small body of men without taking any precautions
                    for defence. One of the first shots fired by the enemy injured him so fatally
                    that he died a few days after. He was married to Maria Salviati, by whom he had
                    one son, Cosimo (1519—1574), born, as we shall see, to lofty fortunes, for he
                    became the first grand-duke of Tuscany, and indeed the founder of the
                    grand-duchy and the new dynasty.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the imperial army pursued its march upon Rome, captured the Eternal
                    City after a few hours’ combat, and cruelly sacked it during many days (1527).
                    Thanks to his perpetual shuffling and excessive avarice, the pope found himself
                    utterly forsaken, and, being unable to defend the city, was obliged to seek
                    refuge in the castle of St Angelo, whence he only effected his escape after some
                    months. He thensigned atreatyof alliance with theemperor (1529), who sent an
                    army to besiege Florence and restore the Medici, whom the people had expelled in
                    1527 on the re-establishment of the republic. After an heroic defence, the city
                    was forced to surrender (1530); and, although it was expressly stipulated that
                    the ancient liberties of Florence should be respected, every one foresaw that
                    the conditions would be violated. In fact, pope and emperor immediately began to
                    dispute as to which should be the new lord of the city. Clement VII. had
                    inherited the traditional family dislike for the younger branch of his kin, and
                    so the choice lay between the two bastards Ippolito and Alessandro. The former
                    being a cardinal, the latter was chosen. Alessandro, who already bore the title
                    of duke of Città di Penna, came to Florence in 1531, and by imperial patent was
                    nominated head of the republic. According to the terms of this patent, the
                    former liberty enjoyed under the Medicean rule was to remain intact. But no
                    previous ruler of the city had enjoyed hereditary power confirmed by imperial
                    patent, and such power was inçom-patible with the existence of a republic.
                    Moreover, Clement VII. showed dissatisfaction with the uncertainty of the power
                    conferred upon his kinsman, and finally succeeded in obtaining additional
                    privileges. On the 4th of April 1532 a parliament was convoked for the last time
                    in Florence, and, as usual, approved every measure proposed for acceptance.
                    Accordingly a new council was formed of two hundred citizens elected for life,
                    forty-eight of which number were to constitute a senate. Alessandro, as duke of
                    the republic, filled the post of gonfalonier, and carried on the government with
                    the assistance of three senators, changed every three months, who took the place
                    of the suppressed signory.</p>
                <p>The duke’s chief advisers, and the contrivers of all these arrangements, were
                    Baccio Valori, Francesco Vettori, and above all Francesco Guicciardini,—men,
                    especially the two latter, of lofty political gifts and extensive influence. The
                    mind and character of Duke Alessandro were as yet comparatively unknown. At
                    first he seemed very anxious to win the favour of the people, and disposed to
                    rule with justice and prudence. But soon encountering difficulties that he was
                    unable to overcome, he began to neglect the business of the state, treated his
                    new office as affording the means for increased indulgence in pleasure and vice,
                    and acted as if the sole function of government consisted in lulling the people
                    by festivities and corrupting it by the dissolute life of which he set the
                    example. The question of the moment was the transformation of the old republican
                    régime into a princedom; as an unavoidable result of this change it followed
                    that Florence was no longer to be the ruling city to whose inhabitants alone
                    belonged the monopoly of political office. When the leading Florentine families
                    realized, not only that the republic was destroyed, but that they were reduced
                    to equality with those whom they had hitherto regarded as their inferiors and
                    subjects, their rage was indescribable, and hardly a day passed without the
                    departure of influential citizens who were resolved to achieve the overthrow of
                    their new ruler. They found a leader in Cardinal Ippolito dei Medici, who was
                    then in Rome, embittered by the preference given to Alessandro, and anxious to
                    become his successor with the least possible delay. Under the pressure of terror
                    the duke at once became a tyrant. He garrisoned the different cities, and began
                    the erection in Florence of the Fortezza da Basse, built chiefly at the expense
                    of Filippo Strozzi, who afterwards met his deaιl&gt; within its walls.</p>
                <p>In 1534 Clement VIΓ. died, and the election fell on Paul I II., from whom
                    Cardinal Ippolito hoped to obtain assistance for his designs. Accordingly the
                    principal Florentine exiles were despatched on a mission to the emperor Charles
                    V. with complaints of Alessandro’s tyranny and his shameless violation of the
                    terms upon which the city had surrendered. Cardinal Ippolito also represented
                    his owι&gt; willingness to carry on the government of Florence in a more
                    equitable manner, and promised the emperor a large sum of money. Reply being
                    delayed by the emperor’sabsence, he became so impatient that he set out,
                    accon&gt; panied by several exiles, to meet Charles in Tunis, but on the 10th of
                    August 1535 died suddenly by the way, at Itri, poisoned by order of Alessandro.
                    Such at least was the general belief, and it was confirmed by the same fate
                    befalling other enemies of the duke about the same time. On the emperor’s return
                    from Africa, the exiles presented themselves to him in Naples, and the venerable
                    patriot Jacopo Nardi pleaded their cause. Duke Alessandro, being cited to
                    appear, came to Naples accompanied by Francesco Guicciardini, who by speaking in
                    his defence rendered himself odious to all friends of liberty, and irretrievably
                    tarnished his illustrious name. The cardinal being dead, it was hard to find a
                    successor to Alessandro. On this account, and perhaps to some extent through the
                    emperor’s personal liking for the duke, the latter rose higher than before in
                    the imperial favour, married Margaret of Austria, the natural daughter of
                    Charles, and returned to Florence with increased power. And now Alessandro
                    indulged unchecked in the lowest excesses of tyranny, and although so recently a
                    bridegroom gave way to increased libertinism. His whole time was passed in
                    vicious haunts and in scandalous adventures. In order to conceal the obscurity
                    of his birth, he left his mother to starve, and it was even asserted that he
                    finally got rid of her by poison.</p>
                <p>His constant associate in this disgraceful routine was his distant kinsman
                    Lorenzo, generally known as Lorenzino dei Medici. Of the younger branch of the
                    Medici, the latter was second cousin of the Cosimo already mentioned as the son
                    of Giovanni delle Bande Nere. He had much culture and literary talent, but led
                    an irregular life, sometimes acting like a madman and sometimes like a <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n820/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0820-0789"/> villain. He was a writer of considerable
                    elegance, the author of several plays, one of which, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aridosio,</hi> was held <hi rend="italic">to</hi> be among the best of the age,
                    and he was a worshipper of antiquity. Notwithstanding these tastes, when in Rome
                    lie knocked off the heads of some of the finest statues of the age of Adrian, an
                    act by which Clement VII. was so incensed that he threatened to have him hanged.
                    Thereupon Lorenzino fled to Florence, where he became the friend of Duke
                    Alessandro and his partner in the most licentious excesses. They went together
                    to houses of ill-fame, and violated private dwellings and convents. They often
                    showed themselves in public mounted on the same horse. All Florence eyed them
                    with disgust, but no one foresaw the tragedy that was soon to take place.</p>
                <p>On the evening of January 5th, 1537, after a day passed in the usual excesses,
                    Lorenzino led the duke to his own lodging, and left him there, promising shortly
                    to return with the wife of Leonardo Ginori. Alessandro, worn out by the
                    exertions of the day, fell asleep on the couch while awaiting Lorenzino’s
                    return. Before long the latter came accompanied by a desperado known as the
                    Scoronconcolo, who aided him in falling on the sleeper. Roused by their first
                    thrusts, the duke fought for his life, and was only despatched after a violent
                    struggle. The murderers then lifted the body into bed, hid it beneath the
                    clothes, and, Lorenzino having attached a paper to it bearing the words, <hi
                    rend="italic">vincit</hi><hi rend="italic">amor</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >patriae,</hi><hi rend="italic">laudumque immensa cupido,</hi> they both fled to
                    Venice. In that city Lorenzino was assassinated some ten years later, in 1548,
                    at the age of thirty-two, by order of Alessandro’s successor. Thus he was only
                    about twenty-two at the time he committed the murder. He wrote an <hi
                    rend="italic">Apologia,</hi> in which he defended himself with great skill and
                    eloquence, saying that he had been urged to the deed solely by love of liberty.
                    For this reason alone he had followed the example of Brutus and played the part
                    of friend and courtier. The tone of this <hi rend="italic">Apologia</hi> is so
                    straightforward, sometimes even so eloquent and lofty, that we should be tempted
                    to give it credence were it possible to believe the assertions of one who not
                    only by his crime but by the infamy of his previous and subsequent career
                    completely gave the lie to his vaunted nobility of purpose. By Alessandro’s
                    death the elder branch of the Medici became extinct, and thus the appearance of
                    the younger line was heralded by a bloody crime.</p>
                <p>When the duke’s absence from his own palace was discovered on the morning of
                    January 6th, he was at first supposed to have spent the night with one of his
                    mistresses; but soon, some alarm being felt, search was made, and Cardinal Cybo
                    was the first to discover the murder. Enjoining the strictest secrecy, he kept
                    the corpse concealed for three days, and then had it interred in the sacristy of
                    San Lorenzo. Meanwhile he had hastily summoned Alessandro Vitelli and the other
                    captains, so that, by the time Alessandro’s death was made public, the city was
                    already filled with troops. The cardinal then convoked the council of
                    forty-eight to decide upon a successor. Alessandro’s only issue was a natural
                    son named Giulio, aged five. The cardinal favoured his election, in the hope of
                    keeping the real sovereignty in his own hands. But he speedily saw the
                    impossibility of carrying out a design that was ridiculed by all. On the other
                    hand, Guicciardini, Vettori, and others of the leading citizens favoured the
                    choice of Cosimo, the son of Giovanni delle Bande Nere. He was already in
                    Florence, was aged seventeen, was keen-witted and aspiring, strong and handsome
                    in person, heir to the enormous wealth of the Medici, and, by the terms of the
                    imperial patent, was Alessandro’s lawful successor. Charles V. approved the
                    nomination of Cosimo, who without delay seized the reins of government with a
                    firm grasp. Like Alessandro, he was named head of the republic; and Guicciardini
                    and others who had worked hardest in his cause hoped to direct him and keep him
                    under their control. But Cosimo soon undeceived them by proving that, his youth
                    notwithstanding, he had a will of bis own, and was resolved to rule unshackled
                    by republican forms and unhampered by advisers disposed to act as mentors. The
                    Florentines had now an absolute prince who was likewise a statesman of eminent
                    ability.</p>
                <p>On learning the death of Alessandro and the election of Cosimo, the exiles
                    appreciated the necessity for prompt action, as all delay would be fatal to the
                    overthrow of the Medicean rule. They had received money and promises from
                    France; they were strengthened by the adhesion of Filippo Strozzi and Baccio
                    Valori, who had both become hostile to the Medici through the infamous conduct
                    and mad tyranny of Alessandro; and Strozzi brought them the help of his enormous
                    fortune and the prowess of that very distinguished captain, bis son Piero. The
                    exiles accordingly met, and assembled their forces at Mirandola. They had about
                    four thousand infantry and three hundred horse.; among them were members of all
                    the principal Florentine families; and their leaders were Bernardo Salviati and
                    Piero Strozzi. They marched rapidly, and entered Tuscany towards the end of July
                    1537. Cosimo on this occasion displayed signal capacity and presence of mind.
                    Fully informed of the exiles’ movements by means of his spies, he no sooner
                    learned their approach than he ordered Alessandro Vitelli to collect the best
                    German, Spanish, and Italian infantry at his disposal, and advance against the
                    enemy without delay. On the evening of July 31 Vitelli marched towards Prato
                    with seven hundred picked infantry and a band of one hundred horse, and on the
                    way fell in with other Spanish foot soldiers who joined the expedition. At early
                    dawn the following morning he made a sudden attack on the exiles’ advanced guard
                    close to Montemurlo, an old fortress converted into a villa belonging to the
                    Nerli. Having utterly routed them, he proceeded to storm Montemurlo, w here
                    Filippo Strozzi and a few of his young comradeshad taken refuge and barricaded
                    the gates. Knowing that they must either conquer or die, they made a desperate
                    resistance for some hours, and then, overwhelmed by superior numbers, were
                    obliged to yield themselves prisoners. The main body of the army was still at
                    some distance, having been detained in the mountains by heavy rains and
                    difficult passes, and, on learning the defeat at Montemurlo, its leader refused
                    to advance, and turned back by the way he had come. Alessandro Vitelli then
                    reentered Florence with his victorious army and his fettered captives. Cosimo
                    had achieved his first triumph.</p>
                <p>All the prisoners, who were members of great families, were brought before
                    Cosimo, and were received by him with courteous coldness. Soon, however, a
                    scaffold was erected in the Piazza, and on four mornings in succession four of
                    the prisoners were beheaded. Then the duke saw fit to stay the executions.
                    Baccio Valori, however, and his son and nephew were beheaded on the 2Oth of
                    August in the courtyard of the Bargello. Filippo Strozzi still survived,
                    confined in the F∩rtezza da Basso, that had been built at his expense. His
                    family was illustrious, he had numerous adherents, and he enjoyed the protection
                    of the French king. Nevertheless Cosimo only awaited some plausible pretext to
                    rid himself of this dreaded enemy. He brought him to trial and had him put to
                    the question. But this cruelty led to nothing, for Strozzi denied every
                    accusation and bore the torture with much fortitude. On December 18th he was
                    found dead in his prison, with a blood-stained sword by his side, and a slip of
                    paper bearing these words: <hi rend="italic">exoriare</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >aliquis nostris</hi><hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">ossibus
                    ultor.</hi> It was believed that, having renounced all hope of his life being
                    spared, Strozzi had preferred suicide to death at the hands of the <pb

                    had caused him to be murdered, and adopted this mode of concealing the crime.
                    The young prince’s cold-blooded massacre of his captives cast an enduring shadow
                    upon his reign and dynasty. But it was henceforward plain to all that he was a
                    man of stern resolve, who went’ straight to his end without scruples or half
                    measures. Before long he was regarded by many as the incarnation of
                    Machiavelli’s <hi rend="italic">Prince,</hi> “inasmuch as he joined daring to
                    talent and prudence, was capable of great cruelty, and yet could practise mercy
                    in due season.” Guicciardini, who still pretended to act as mentor, and who on
                    account of his many services had a certain influence over him, was obliged to
                    withdraw from public life and busy himself with writing his <hi rend="italic"
                    >History</hi> at his villa of Arcetri. He died in this retreat in 1540, and it
                    was immediately rumoured that the duke had caused him to be poisoned. This shows
                    the estimation in which Cosimo was now held. It was true that he punished with
                    death all who dared to resist his will. By 1540 sentence of death had been
                    pronounced against four hundred and thirty contumacious fugitives, and during
                    his reign one hundred and forty men and six women actually ascended the
                    scaffold, without counting those who perished in foreign lands by the daggers of
                    his assassins. He reduced the old republican institutions to empty forms, by
                    making the magistrates mere creatures of his will. He issued the sternest edicts
                    against the rebels, particularly by the law known as the “Polverina,” from the
                    name of its proposer Jacopo Polverini. This law decreed not only the
                    confiscation of the property of exiles, but likewise that of their heirs, even
                    if personally acquired by the latter. Cosimo ruled like the independent
                    sovereign of a great state, and always showed the capacity, firmness, and
                    courage demanded by that station. Only, his state being small and weak, he was
                    forced to rely chiefly upon his personal talent and wealth. It was necessary for
                    him to make heavy loans to the different European sovereigns, especially to
                    Charles V., the most rapacious of them all, and to give enormous bribes to their
                    ambassadors. Besides, he had to carry on wars for the extension of his
                    dominions, and neither his inherited wealth nor the large sums gained by
                    confiscating the estates of rebellious subjects sufficed for all this outlay. He
                    was accordingly compelled to burden the people with taxes, and thus begin at
                    once to diminish its strength.</p>
                <p>Cosimo bore a special grudge against the neighbouring republics of Siena and
                    Lucca. Although the latter was small and weak, and the former garrisoned by
                    Spaniards, yet the spectacle of free institutions at the frontiers of his own
                    state Served as a continual incitement to subjects disaffected to the new
                    régime. In fact Francesco Burlanjacchi, a zealous Lucchese patriot, had
                    conceived the design of re-establishing republican government in all the cities
                    of Tuscany. Cosimo, with the emperor’s help, succeeded in having him put to
                    death. Lucca, however, was an insignificant state making no pretence of rivalry,
                    whereas Siena was an old and formidable foe to Florence, and had always given
                    protection to the Florentine exiles. It was now very reluctantly submitting to
                    the presence of a Spanish garrison, and, being stimulated by promises of prompt
                    and efficacious assistance from France, rose in rebellion and expelled the
                    Spaniards in 1552. Cosimo instantly seized the opportunity, wrote to the emperor
                    in terms that appealed to his pride, asked leave to attack Siena, and begged for
                    troops to ensure the success of his enterprise. As no immediate answer arrived,
                    he feigned to begin negotiations with Henry IT. of France, and, by thus arousing
                    the imperial jealousy, obtained a contingent of German and Spanish infantry.
                    Then came a long and bloody war. Siena was besieged for fifteen months, and its
                    inhabitants, aided by the valour of Piero Strozzi, who fought under the French
                    flag, made a most heroic resistance, even women and children helping on the
                    walls. But fortune was against them. Piero Strozzi sustained several defeats,
                    and finally the Sienese, having exhausted their ammunition and being decimated
                    by famine and the sword, were obliged to capitulate on honourable terms that
                    were shamelessly violated. By the varied disasters of the siege and the number
                    of fugitives the population was reduced from forty to eight thousand
                    inhabitants. The republicans, still eager to resist, withdrew to Montalcino.
                    Cosimo now ruled the city and territory of Siena in the name of Charles V., who
                    always refused him its absolute possession. After the emperor’s abdication, and
                    the succession of Philip II. to the Spanish throne, Cosimo at last obtained
                    Siena and Ponto-ferra by giving up his claim to a sum of 200,000 ducats that he
                    was to have received from Charles V. In 1559 he also captured Montalcino, and
                    thus formed the grandduchy of Tuscany, but he continued to govern the new state
                    <hi rend="italic">—i.e.,</hi> Siena and its territories—separately from the old.
                    His rule was intelligent, skilful, and despotic; but his enormous expenses drove
                    him to raise large sums of money by special contrivances unsuited to the Country
                    and the people. Hence, notwithstanding the genius of its founder, the
                    grand-duchy held from the first the elements of its future decay. Cosimo
                    preferred to confer office upon men of humble origin in order to have pliable
                    tools, but he also liked to be surrounded by a courtier aristocracy on the
                    Spanish and French pattern. As no Tuscan aristocracy any longer existed, he
                    created new nobles, and tempted foreign ones to come by the concession of
                    various feudal privileges; and, in order to turn this artificial aristocracy to
                    some account, he founded the knightly order of St Stephen, charged with the
                    defence of the coast against pirates, which in course of time won much honour by
                    its prowess. He also established a small standing army for the protection of his
                    frontiers; but, as we have seen, he generally employed German and Spanish troops
                    for his wars, and always had a foreign bodyguard. At the commencement of his
                    reign he opposed the popes in order to maintain the independence of his own
                    state; but later, to obtain help, he truckled to them in many ways, even to the
                    extent of giving up to the Inquisition his own confidant, Piero Carnesecchi,
                    who, being accused of heresy, was beheaded and burnt in 1567. In reward for
                    these acts of submission, the popes showed him friendship, and Pius V. granted
                    him the title of grandduke, conferring the patent and crown upon him in Rome,
                    although the emperor had always withheld his consent. Finally, however, the
                    latter confirmed the title to Cosimo’s successor. The measure most injurious to
                    Tuscany was the fiscal system of taxes, of which the sole aim was to extort the
                    greatest possible amount of money. The consequent damage to industry, commerce,
                    and agriculture was immense, and, added to the devastations caused by the
                    Sienese war, led to their utter ruin. Otherwise Cosimo did not neglect useful
                    measures for the interior prosperity of his state. He was no Maecenas, but
                    nevertheless restored the Pisan university, enlarged that of Siena, had the
                    public records classified, and also executed public works like the Santa Trinità
                    bridge. During the great inundations of 1557 he turned his whole energy to the
                    relief of the sufferers.</p>
                <p>In 1539 he had espoused Eleonora of Toledo, daughter of the viceroy of Naples, by
                    whom he had several children. Two died in 1562, and their mother soon followed
                    them to the grave. It was said that one of these boys, Don Garcia, had murdered
                    the other, and then been killed by the enraged father. Indeed Cosimo was further
                    accused of having put his own wife to death; but neither rumour had any
                    foundation. He now showed signs of illness and failure <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n822/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0822-0791"/> of strength. He was not old, but worn by the
                    cares of state and self-indulgence. Accordingly in 1561 he resigned the
                    government to his eldest son, who was to act as his lieutenant, since he wished
                    to remain the virtual head of the state and have power to resume the sceptre on
                    any emergency. In 1570, by the advice of Pius V., he married Camilla Martelli, a
                    young lady of whom he had been long enamoured. In 1574 he died, at the age of
                    fifty-four years and ten months, after a reign of thirty-seven years, leaving
                    three sons and one daughter besides natural children. These sons were Francesco,
                    his successor, who was already at the head of the government, Cardinal
                    Ferdinand, and Piero.</p>
                <p>Francesco I., born in 1541, began to govern as his father’s lieutenant in 1564,
                    and was married in 1565 to the archduchess Giovanna of Austria. On beginning to
                    reign on his own account in 1574, he speedily manifested his real character. His
                    training in the hands of a Spanish mother had made him suspicious, false, and
                    despotic. Holding everyone aloof, he carried on the government with the
                    assistance of a few devoted ministers. He compelled his stepmother to retire to
                    a convent, and kept his brothers at a distance from Florence. He loved the
                    privileges of power without its burdens. Cosimo had known how to maintain his
                    independence, but Francesco cast himself like a vassal at Austria’s feet. Ha
                    reaped his reward by obtaining from Maximilian II. the title of grand-duke, for
                    which Cosimo had never been able to win the imperial sanction, but he forfeited
                    all independence. Towards Philip II. he showed even greater submissiveness,
                    supplying him with large sums of money wrung from his over-taxed people. He held
                    entirely aloof from France, in order not to awake the suspicions of his
                    protectors. In short, under his rule the history of Tuscany was reduced to a
                    mere record of local and municipal events. To increase his funds, he traded on
                    his own account, thus creating a monopoly that was ruinous to the country at
                    large, and led to an enormous number of failures. He raised the tax upon corn to
                    so high a rate that few continued to find any profit in growing it, and thus the
                    Maremme, already partly devastated during the war with Siena, were converted
                    into a desert. Even industry declined under this system of government; and,
                    although Francesco founded porcelain manufactories and pietra dura works, they
                    did not rise to any prosperity until after his death. His love of science and
                    letters was the only Medicean virtue that he possessed. He had an absolute
                    passion for chemistry, and passed much of his time in his laboratory. Sometimes
                    indeed he gave audience to his secretaries of state standing before a furnace,
                    bellows in hand. He took some useful measures to promote the rise of a new city
                    at Leghorn, which at that time had only a natural and ill-sheltered harbour. The
                    improvement of Leghorn had been first projected by Cosimo I,, and was carried on
                    by all the succeeding Medici. Francesco was a slave to his passions, and was led
                    by them to scandalous excesses and deeds of bloodshed. His example and neglect
                    of the affairs of the state soon caused a vast increase of crime even among the
                    people, and, during the first eighteen months of his reign, there occurred no
                    less than one hundred and sixty-eight murders.</p>
                <p>In default of public events, the historians of this period enlarge upon private
                    incidents, generally of a scandalous or sanguinary kind. In 1575 Orazio Pucci,
                    wishing to avenge his father, whom Cosimo had hanged, determined to get up a
                    conspiracy, but, soon recognizing how firmly the Medicean rule had taken root in
                    the country, desisted from the attempt. But the grand-duke, on hearing of the
                    already abandoned plot, immediately caused Pucci to be hanged from the same
                    window of the Palazzo Vecchio, and even from the same iron stanchion, from which
                    his father before him had hung. His companions, who had fled to France and
                    England, were pursued and murdered by the ducal emissaries. Their possessions
                    were confiscated, and the “Polverina” law applied so that the conspirators’
                    heirs were reduced to penury, and the grand-duke gained more than 300,000
                    ducats.</p>
                <p>Next year Isabella dei Medici, Francesco’s sister, was strangled in her nuptial
                    bed by her husband, Paolo Giordano Orsini, whom she had betrayed. Piero dei
                    Medici, Francesco’s brother, murdered his wife Eleonora of Toledo from the same
                    motive. Still louder scandal was caused by the duke’s own conduct. He was
                    already a married man, when, passing one day through the Piazza of St Mark in
                    Florence, he saw an exceedingly beautiful woman at the window of a mean
                    dwelling, and at once conceived a passion for her. She was the famous Bianca
                    Cappello, a Venetian of noble birth, who had eloped with a young Florentine
                    named Pietro Buonaventuri, to whom she was married at the time that she
                    attracted the duke’s gaze. He made her acquaintance, and, in order to see her
                    frequently, nominated her husband to a post at court. Upon this, Buonaventuri
                    behaved with so much insolence, even to the nobility, that one evening he was
                    found murdered in the street. Thus the grand-duke, who was thought to have
                    sanctioned the crime, was able to indulge his passion unchecked. On the death of
                    the grand-duchess in 1578 he was privately united to Bianca, and afterwards
                    married her publicly. But she had no children, and this served to poison her
                    happiness, since the next in succession was her bitter enemy, the cardinal
                    Ferdinand. The latter came to Florence in 1587, and was ostentatiously welcomed
                    by Bianca, who was most anxious to conciliate him. On October 18th of the same
                    year, the grand-duke died at his villa of Poggio a Caiano, of a fever caught on
                    a shooting excursion in the Maremme, and the next day Bianca also expired,
                    having ruined her health by drugs taken to cure her sterility. But rumour
                    asserted that she had prepared a poisoned tart for the cardinal, and that, when
                    he suspiciously insisted on the grand-duke tasting it first, Bianca desperately
                    swallowed a slice and followed her husband to the tomb.</p>
                <p>Such was the life of Francesco dei Medici, and all that can be said in his praise
                    is that he gave liberal encouragement to a few artists, including Giovanni
                    Bologna, who executed for him the group of the Rape of the Sabines. He was the
                    founder of the Uffizi gallery, of the Medici theatre, and the villa of
                    Pratolino; and during his reign the Della Cruscan academy was instituted.</p>
                <p>Ferdinand I. was thirty-eight years of age when, in 1587, he succeeded his
                    brother on the throne. A cardinal from the age of fourteen, he had never taken
                    holy orders. He showed much tact and experience in the management of
                    ecclesiastical affairs. He was the founder of the Villa Medici at Rome, and the
                    purchaser of many priceless works of art, such as the Niobe group and many other
                    statues afterwards transported by him to Florence. After his accession he
                    retained the cardinal’s purple until the time of his marriage. He was in all
                    respects his brother’s opposite. Affable in his manners and generous with his
                    purse, he chose a crest typical of the proposed mildness of his rule,—a swarm of

                    pardoned all who had opposed him, and left his kinsmen at liberty to choose
                    their own place of residence. Occasionally, for political reasons, he committed
                    acts unworthy of his character; but he re-established the administration of
                    justice, and sedulously attended to the business of the state and the welfare of
                    his subjects. Accordingly Tuscany revived under his rule and regained the
                    independence and political dignity that his brother had sacrificed to love of
                    ease and personal indulgence. He favoured commerce, and effectually ensured the
                    prosperity of Leghorn, by an edict enjoining toleration towards Jews and <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0823-0792"/> heretics, which led to the settlement of many
                    foreigners in that city. He also improved the harbour and facilitated
                    communication with Pisa by means of the Naviglio, a canal into which a portion
                    of the water of the Arno was turned. Tie nevertheless retained the reprehensible
                    custom of trading on his own account, keeping banks in many cities of Europe. He
                    successfully accomplished the draining of the Val di Chiana, cultivated the
                    plains of Pisa, Fucecchio, and Vai di Nievole, and executed other works of
                    public utility at Siena and Pisa. But his best energies were devoted to the
                    foreign policy by which he sought to emancipate himself from subjection to
                    Spain. On the assassination (1589) of Henry III. of France, Ferdinand supported
                    the claims of the king of Navarre, undeterred by the opposition of Spain and the
                    Catholic League, who were dismayed by the prospect of a Huguenot succeeding to
                    the throne of France. He lent money to Henry IV., and strongly urged his
                    conversion to Catholicism; he helped to pgrsuade the pope to accept Henry’s
                    abjuration, and pursued this policy with marvellous persistence until his
                    efforts were crowned with success. Subsequently, however, Henry IV. showed faint
                    gratitude for the benefits conferred upon him, and paid no attention to the
                    expostulations of the grand duke, who then began to slacken his relations with
                    France, and showed that he could guard his independence by other alliances. He
                    gave liberal assistance to Philip III. for the campaign of the latter in
                    Algiers, and to the emperor for the war with the Turks. Hence he was compelled
                    to burden his subjects with enormous taxes, forgetting that while guaranteeing
                    the independence of Tuscany by his loans to foreign powers he was increasingly
                    sapping the strength of future generations. He at last succeeded in obtaining
                    the formal investiture of Siena, which Spain had always considered a fief of her
                    own.</p>
                <p>During this grand-duke’s reign the Tuscan navy was notably increased, and did
                    itself much honour on the Mediterranean. The war-galleys of the knights of St
                    Stephen were despatched to the coast of Barbary to attack Bona, the headquarters
                    of the corsairs, and they captured the town with much dash and bravery. And in
                    the following year (1608) the same galleys achieved their most brilliant victory
                    in the archipelago over the stronger fleet of the Turks, by taking nine of their
                    vessels, seven hundred prisoners, and a store of jewels of the value of
                    2,000,000 ducats.</p>
                <p>Ferdinand I. died in 1609, leaving four sons, of whom the eldest, Cosimo 11.,
                    succeeded to the throne at the age of nineteen. He was at first assisted in the
                    government by his mother and a council of regency. He had a good disposition,
                    and the fortune to reign during a period when Europe was at peace and Tuscany
                    blessed with abundant harvests. Of his rule there is little to rblate. His chief
                    care was given to the galleys of St Stephen, and he sent them to assist the
                    Druses against the Porte. On one occasion he was involved in a quarrel with
                    France. Concino Concini, the Marshal d’Ancre, being assassinated in 1617, Louis
                    XTII. claimed the right of transferring the property of the murdered man to De
                    Luynes. Cosimo opposed the decision, and, refusing to recognize the confiscation
                    decreed by the French tribunals, demanded that Concini’s son should be allowed
                    to inherit. Hence followed much ill-feeling and mutual reprisals between the two
                    countries, finally brought to an end by the intervention of the duke of
                    Lorraine.</p>
                <p>Like his predecessors, Cosimo II. studied to promote the prosperity of Leghorn,
                    and he deserves honour for abandoning all commerce on his own account. But it
                    was no praiseworthy act to pass a law depriving women of almost all rights of
                    inheritance. By this means many daughters of the nobility were driven into
                    convents against their will. He gave scanty attention to the general affairs of
                    the state. He was fond of luxury, spent freely on public festivities, and
                    detested trouble. Tuscany was apparently tranquil and prosperous; but the decay
                    of which the seeds were sown under Cosimo I. and Ferdinand I. was rapidly
                    spreading, and became before long patent to all and beyond all hope of remedy.
                    The best deed done by Cosimo II. was the protection accorded by him to Galileo
                    Galilei, who had removed to Padua, and there made some of his grandest
                    discoveries. The grand-duke recalled him to Florence in 1610, and nominated him
                    court mathematician and philosopher. Cosimo died in February 1621, after twelve
                    years of a quiet reign marked by no great event. Feeling his end draw near, when
                    he was only aged thirty and all his sons were still in their childhood, he
                    hastened to arrange his family affairs. His mother, Cristina of Lorraine, and
                    his wife, Maddalena of Austria, were nominated regents and guardians to his
                    eldest son Ferdinand 11., a boy of ten, and a council of four appointed, whose
                    functions were regulated by law. Accordingly, after Cosimo’s death, the young
                    Ferdinand was sent to Rome and Vienna to complete his education, and the
                    government of Tuscany remained in the hands of two jealous and quarrelsome
                    women. Thus the administration of justice and finance speedily went to ruin. Out
                    of submissiveness to the pope, the regents did not dare to maintain their
                    legitimate right to inherit the duchy of Urbino, and in 1623 sanctioned the
                    transfer of that right to the holy see. They conferred exaggerated privileges on
                    the new Tuscan nobility, which became increasingly insolent and worthless. They
                    resumed the practice of trading on their own account, and, without reaping much
                    benefit thereby, did the utmost damage to private enterprise.</p>
                <p>In 1627 Ferdinand II., then aged seventeen, returned to Italy and assumed the
                    reins of government; but, being of a very gentle disposition, he decided on
                    sharing his power with the regents and his brothers, and arranged matters in
                    such wise that each was almost independent of the other. He gained the love of
                    his subjects by his great goodness; and, when Florence and Tuscany were cruelly
                    ravaged by the plague in 1630, he showed admirable courage, and carried out many
                    useful measures. But he was totally incapable of energy as a statesman. When the
                    pope made bitter complaints because the board of health had dared to subject
                    certain monks and priests to the necessary quarantine, the grand-duke insisted
                    on his officers asking pardon on their knees for having done their duty. On the
                    death in 1631 of the last duke of Urbino, the pope was allowed to seize the
                    duchy without the slightest opposition on the part of Tuscany. As a natural
                    consequence the pretensions of the Roman curia became increasingly exorbitant;
                    ecclesiastics usurped the functions of the state; and the ancient laws of the
                    republic, together with the regulations decreed by Cosimo I. as a check upon
                    similar abuses, were allowed to become obsolete. On the extinction of the line
                    of the Gonzagas at Mantua in 1627, war broke out between France on the one side
                    and Spain, Germany, and Savoy on the other. The grandduke, uncertain of his
                    policy, trimmed his sails according to events. Fortunately peace was
                    re-established in 1631. Mantua and Monferrato fell to the duke of Nevers, as
                    France had always desired. But Europe was again in arms for the Thirty Years’
                    War, and Italy was not at peace. Urban VIII. wished to aggrandize his nephews,
                    the Barberini, by wresting Castro and Ronciglione from Odoardo Farnese, duke of
                    Parma and brother-in-law to Ferdinand. Farnese determined to maintain his
                    rights, and marched his army through Tuscany into the territories of the pope,
                    who was greatly alarmed by the attack. Naturally the grand-duke was dr⅛wn into
                    the war to defend his own state and his kinsman. His military operations,
                    however, were of the feeblest and often the most laughable character. At <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n824/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0824-0793"/> last, by means of the French intervention, peace
                    was made in 1644. But, although the pope was forced to yield, he resigned none
                    of his ecclesiastical pretensions in Tuscany. It was during Ferdinand’s reign
                    that the septuagenarian Galileo was obliged to appear before the Inquisition in
                    Rome, which treated him with infamous cruelty. On the death of this great and
                    unfortunate man, the grand-duke wished to erect a monument to him, but was
                    withheld by fear of the opposition of the clergy. The dynasty as well as the
                    country now seemed on the brink of decay. Two of the grand duke’s brothers had
                    already died childless, and Ippolito, the sole survivor, was a cardinal.
                    Accordingly the only remaining heir was Cosimo III., married to a wife who held
                    him in detestation, and did her best to have her marriage annulled or at least
                    obtain a separation.</p>
                <p>Like nearly all his predecessors, Ferdinand II. gave liberal patronage to science
                    and letters, greatly aided therein by his brother Leopold, who had been trained
                    by Galileo Galilei, and who joined with men of learning in founding the
                    celebrated academy <hi rend="italic">Del Cimento,</hi> of which he was named
                    president. This academy took for its motto the words <hi rend="italic">Provando
                    e riprovando,</hi> and followed the experimental method of Galileo. Formed in
                    1657, it was dissolved in 1667 in consequence of the jealousies and dissensions
                    of its members, but during its brief existence won renown by the number and
                    importance of its works.</p>
                <p>Cosimo III. succeeded his father in 1670. He was weak, vain, bigoted, and
                    hypocritical. In 1661 he had espoused Louise d’Orléans, niece of Louis XIV.,
                    who, being enamoured of Duke Charles of Lorraine, was very reluctant to come to
                    Italy, and speedily detested both her husband and his country, of which she
                    refused to learn the language. She had two sons and one daughter, but after the
                    birth of her third child, Giovan Gastone, her hatred for her husband increased
                    almost to madness. She first withdrew to Poggio a Caiano, and then, being unable
                    to get her marriage annulled, returned to France, where, although supposed to
                    live in conventu d seclusion, she passed the greater part of her time as a
                    welcome visitor at court. Even her testamentary dispositions attested the
                    violence of her dislike to her husband.</p>
                <p>Cosimo’s hypocritical zeal for religion compelled his subjects to multiply
                    services and processions, that greatly infringed upon their working hours. He
                    wasted enormous sums in pensioning converts—even those from other countries—and
                    in giving rich endowments to sanctuaries. Meanwhile funds often failed for the
                    payment of Government clerks and soldiers. His court was composed of bigots and
                    parasites; he ransacked the world for dainties for his table, adorned his palace
                    with costly foreign hangings, had foreign servants, and filled his gardens with
                    exotic plants. He purchased from the emperor the title of “Highness” in order to
                    be the equal of the duke of Savoy. He remained neutral during the Franco-Spanish
                    war, and submitted to every humiliation and requisition exacted by the emperor.
                    He had vague notions of promoting agriculture, but accomplished no results. At
                    one time he caused eight hundred families to be brought over from the Morea for
                    the cultivation of the Maremme, where all of them died of fever. But when, after
                    the revocation of the edict of Nantes, French Huguenots offered to apply their
                    labour and capital to the same purpose, the grand-duke’s religious scruples
                    refused them refuge. So ruin fell upon Tuscany. Crime and misery increased, and
                    the poor, who only asked for work, were given alms and sent oftener to church.
                    This period witnessed the rise of many charitable institutions of a religious
                    character under the patronage of the grand duke, as for instance the
                    congregation of San Giovanni Battista. But these could not remedy the general
                    decay.</p>
                <p>Cosimo’s dominant anxiety regarded the succession to the throne. His eldest son
                    Ferdinand died childless in 1713. The pleasure-loving Giovan Gastone was married
                    to' Anna Maria of Saxe-Lauenburg, widow of a German prince, a wealthy coarse
                    woman wholly immersed in domestic occupations, and who seemed little likely to
                    give birth to any children. After living with her for some time in a Bohemian
                    village, Giovan Gastone yielded to his dislike to his wife and her country,
                    withdrew to France, and ruined his health by his excesses. After a brief return
                    to Bohemia he finally separated from his wife, by whom he had no family. Thus
                    the dynasty was doomed to extinction. Cosimo had a passing idea of
                    reconstituting the Florentine republic, but, this design being discountenanced
                    by the European powers, he determined to transfer the succession, after the
                    death of Giovan Gastone, to his sister Anna Maria Louisa, who in fact survived
                    him. For this purpose he proposed to annul the patent of Charles V., but the
                    powers objected to this arrangement also, and by the treaty of 1718 the
                    quadruple alliance of Germany, France, England, and Holland decided that Parma
                    and Tuscany should descend to the Spanish Infante Don Carlos. The grand-duke
                    made energetic but fruitless protests.</p>
                <p>Cosimo III, had passed his eightieth year at the time of his decease in October
                    1723, and was succeeded by his son Giovan Gastone, then aged fifty-three. The
                    new sovereign was in bad health, worn out by dissipation, and had neither
                    ambition nor aptitude for rule. His throne was already at the disposal of
                    foreign powers, and his only thought on ascending it was to regain strength
                    enough to pass the remainder of his days in enjoyment. He dismissed the spies,
                    parasites, and bigots that had formed his father’s court, abolished the pensions
                    given to converts, suppressed several taxes, and prohibited the organized
                    espionage established in the family circle. He wished to live and let live, and
                    liked the people to be amused. Everything in fact bore a freer and gayer aspect
                    under his reign, and the Tuscans seemed to feel renewed attachment for the
                    dynasty as the moment of its extinction drew near. But the grandduke was too
                    feeble and incapable to accomplish any real improvement. Surrounded by gay and
                    dissipated young men, he entrusted all the cares of government to a certain
                    Giuliano Dami, who drove a profitable trade by the sale of offices and
                    privileges. In this way all things were in the hands of corrupt individuals;
                    while the grand-duke, compelled to pass the greater part of his time in bed,
                    vainly sought diversion in the company of buffoons, and was only tormented by
                    perceiving that all the world disposed of his throne without even asking his
                    advice. And when, after prolonged opposition, he had resigned himself to accept
                    Don Carlos as his successor, the latter led a Spanish army to the conquest of
                    Naples, an event afterwards leading to the peace of 1735, by which the Tuscan
                    succession was transferred to Francesco II., duke of Lorraine, and husband of
                    Maria Theresa. Giovan Gastone was finally obliged to submit even to this. Spain
                    withdrew her garrisons from Tuscany, and Austrian soldiers took their place and
                    swore fealty to the grand-duke on the 5th of February 1737. He expired on the
                    9th July of the same year. Such was the end of the younger branch of the Medici,
                    which had found Tuscany a prosperous country, where art, letters, commerce,
                    industry, and agriculture flourished, and left her poor and decayed in all ways,
                    drained by taxation, and oppressed by laws contrary to every principle of sound
                    economy, downtrodden by the clergy, and burdened by a weak and vicious
                    aristocracy.</p>
