                    (1840-47) and the university of Edinburgh (1847-50). Entering at Cambridge in

                    senior wrangler of his year in the higher ordeal of the Smith’s prize
                    examination. He held the chair of natural philosophy in Marischal College,
                    Aberdeen, from 1856 till the fusion of the two colleges there in 1860. For eight
                    years subsequently he held the chair of physics and astronomy in King’s College,
                    London, but resigned in 1868 and retired to his estate of Glenlair in
                    Kirkcudbrightshire. He was summoned from his seclusion in 1871 to become the
                    first holder of the newly-founded professorship of experimental physics in
                    Cambridge; and it was under his direction that the plans of the Cavendish
                    laboratory were prepared. He superintended every step of the progress of the
                    building and of the purchase of the very valuable collection of apparatus with
                    which it was equipped at the expense of its munificent founder the duke of
                    Devonshire (chancellor of the university, and one of its most distinguished
                    alumni). So far for the outline of Maxwell’s career, as regards dates, official
                    work, &amp;c. The rest belongs almost exclusively to mathematical and physical
                    science. For more than half of his brief life he held a prominent position in
                    the very foremost rank of natural philosophers. His contributions.to scientific
                    societies began in his fifteenth year, when Professor J. D. Forbes communicated
                    to the Royal Society of Edinburgh a short paper of his on a mechanical method of
                    tracing Cartesian ovals. In his eighteenth year, while still a student in
                    Edinburgh, he contributed two valuable papers to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions</hi> of the same society—one of which, “On the Equilibrium of
                    Elastic Solids,” is remarkable, not only on account of its intrinsic power and
                    the youth of its author, but also because in it he laid the foundation of one of
                    the most singular discoveries of his later life, the temporary double refraction
                    produced in viscous liquids by shearing stress. Immediately after taking his
                    degree, he read to the Cambridge Philosophical Society a very novel memoir <hi
                    rend="italic">On the Transformation of Surfaces by Bending.</hi> This is one of
                    the few purely mathematical papers he published, and it exhibited at once to
                    experts the full genius of its author. About the same time appeared his
                    elaborate memoir <hi rend="italic">On Faraday’s Lines of Force,</hi> in which he
                    gave the first indication of some of those extraordinary electrical
                    investigations which culminated in the greatest work of his life. He obtained in
                    1859 the Adams prize in Cambridge for a very original and powerful essay <hi
                    rend="italic">On the Stability of Saturn’s Bings.</hi> From 1855 to 1872 he
                    published at intervals a series of valuable investigations connected with the
                    <hi rend="italic">Perception of Colour</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Colour-Blindness.</hi> For the earlier of these he received the Rumford medal
                    in 1860. The instruments which he devised for these investigations were simple
                    and convenient, but could not have been thought of for the purpose except by a
                    man whose knowledge was co-extensive with his ingenuity. One of his greatest
                    investigations bore on the <hi rend="italic">Kinetic Theory of Gases.</hi>
                    Originating with D. Bernoulli, this theory’ was advanced by the successive
                    labours of Herapath, Joule, and particularly of Clausius, to such an extent as
                    to put its general accuracy beyond a doubt. But by far the greatest developments
                    it has received are due to Maxwell, part of whose mathematical work has recently
                    been still further extended in some directions by Bolzmann. In this field
                    Maxwell appears as an experimenter (on the laws of gaseous friction) as well as
                    a mathematician. His two latest papers deal <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0678-0647"/> with this branch of physics; one is an extension
                    and simplification of some of Bolzmann’s chief results, the other treats of the
                    kinetic theory as applied to the motion of the radiometer. He has written an
                    admirable text-book of the <hi rend="italic">Theory of Heat,</hi> which has
                    already (1882) gone through several editions, and a very excellent elementary
                    treatise on <hi rend="italic">Matter and Motion.</hi> Even this, like his other
                    and larger works, is full of valuable matter, worthy of the most attentive
                    perusal not of students alone but of the very foremost scientific men.</p>
                <p>But the great work of his life was devoted to electricity. He began by reading
                    with the most profound admiration and attention the whole of Faraday’s
                    extraordinary selfrevelations, and proceeded to translate the ideas of that
                    master into the succinct and expressive notation of the mathematicians. A
                    considerable part of this translation was accomplished during his career as an
                    undergraduate in Cambridge. The writer had the opportunity of perusing the MS.
                    on <hi rend="italic">Faraday's Lines of Force,</hi> in a form little different
                    from the final one, a year before Maxwell took his degree. His great object, as
                    it was also the great object of Faraday, was to overturn the idea of action at a
                    distance. The splendid researches of Poisson and Gauss had shown how to reduce
                    all the phenomena of statical electricity to mere attractions and repulsions
                    exerted at a distance by particles of an imponderable on one another. Sir W.
                    Thomson had, in 1846, shown that a totally different assumption, based upon
                    other analogies, led (by its own special mathematical methods) to precisely the
                    same results. He treated the resultant electric force at any point as analogous
                    to the <hi rend="italic">flux of heat</hi> from sources distributed in the same
                    manner as the supposed electric particles. This paper of Thomson’s, whose ideas
                    Maxwell afterwards developed in an extraordinary manner, seems to have given the
                    first hint that there are at least two perfectly distinct methods of arriving at
                    the known formulae of statical electricity. The step to magnetic phenomena was
                    comparatively simple; but it was otherwise as regards electromagnetic phenomena,
                    where current electricity is essentially involved. An exceedingly ingenious, but
                    highly artificial, theory had been devised by Weber, which was found capable of
                    explaining all the phenomena investigated by Ampère, as well as the induction
                    currents of Faraday. But this was based upon the assumption of a distance-action
                    between electric particles, whose intensity depended on their relative motion as
                    well as on their position. This was, of course, even more repugnant to Maxwell’s
                    mind than the statical distance-action developed by Poisson. The first paper of
                    Maxwell’s in which an attempt at an admissible physical theory of
                    electromagnetism was made was communicated to the Royal Society in 1867. But the
                    theory, in a fully developed form, first appeared in his great treatise on <hi
                    rend="italic">Electricity and Magnetism</hi> (1873). This work, already in a
                    second edition, is one of the most splendid monuments ever raised by the genius
                    of a single individual. Availing himself of the admirable generalized coordinate
                    system of Lagrange, Maxwell has shown how to reduce all electric and magnetic
                    phenomena to stresses and motions of a material medium, and, as one preliminary,
                    but excessively severe, test of the truth of his theory, has shown that (if the
                    electromagnetic medium be that which is required for the explanation of the
                    phenomena of light) the velocity of light in vacuo should be numerically the
                    same as the ratio of the electromagnetic and electrostatic units. We do not as
                    yet certainly know either of these quantities very exactly, but the means of the
                    best determinations of each separately agree with one another more closely than
                    do the various values of either. There seems to be no longer any possibility of
                    doubt that Maxwell has taken the first grand step towards the discovery of the
                    true nature of electrical phenomena. Had he done nothing but this, his fame
                    would have been secured for all time. But, striking as it is, this forms only
                    one small part of the contents of his truly marvellous work.</p>
                <p>One of his last great contributions to science was his editing (with copious
                    original notes) the <hi rend="italic">Electrical liesearches of the Hon. Henry
                    Cavendish,</hi> which had been altogether unappreciated by the witlings to whom
                    they had previously been confided. It now appears that Cavendish, already famous
                    by many other researches (such as the mean density of the earth, the composition
                    of water, &lt;fcc,), must be looked on as, in his day, a man of Maxwell’s own
                    stamp as a theorist, and an experimenter of the very first rank.</p>
                <p>This encyclopaedia has been, in its scientific aspects, greatly indebted to Clerk
                    Maxwell. The articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Atom, Attraction, Capillarity,
                    Diffusion, Ether,</hi> &amp;c., were intended as parts merely of one
                    comprehensive system, in which a general résumé of all that is known of the
                    properties of matter should be given in simple yet profound completeness. The
                    reader of these articles cannot but feel how much has been lost when this
                    splendid series cannot be completed by its initiator.</p>
                <p>In private life Clerk Maxwell was one of the most lovable of men, a sincere and
                    unostentatious Christian. Though perfectly free from any trace of envy or
                    ill-will, he yet showed on fit occasion his contempt for that pseudo-science
                    which seeks for the applause of the ignorant by professing to reduce the whole
                    system of the universe to a fortuitous sequence of uncaused events.</p>
                <p>His collected works will shortly be issued from the Pitt press; and an extended
                    biography, by his former schoolfellow and lifelong friend Professor Campbell,
                    has just been published (1882). (p. <hi rend="smallcaps">g. t.)</hi></p>
