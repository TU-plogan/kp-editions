                    N.W. by Ille-et-Vilaine. The extreme length from north-east to southwest is
                    about 7 8 miles; the breadth from north to south ranges from 25 to 50 miles, and

                    from Paris. The department is made up of two distinct regions, the line of
                    demarcation running from south-east to north-west, and passing through Angers;
                    that to the south consists of granites, felspars, and a continuation of the
                    geological formations of Brittany and Vendée; to the north, on the contrary,
                    schists, limestone, and chalk prevail. The general elevation of the latter
                    region is but small, and none of its eminences exceed 330 feet in height; the
                    former, on the contrary, has a surface richly varied with deep winding valleys
                    clothed with woods and thickets, though the highest points are under 700 feet.
                    The department belongs entirely to the basin of the Loire, which traverses it
                    from east to west by a valley varying in breadth from about 1 to 5 miles; the
                    bed is wide but shallow, and full of islands, the depth of the water in summer
                    being at some places little more than 2 feet. The floods which occur are sudden
                    and destructive.</p>

                <p>The chief affluent of the Loire within the department is the Maine, formed a
                    little above Angers by the junction of the Mayenne and the Sarthe (the latter in
                    turn having previously received the waters of the Loir). All three rivers are
                    navigable. Other tributaries of the Loire are the Thouet (with its tributary the
                    Dive), the Layon, the Èvre, the Divatte on the left, and the Authion on the
                    right. The latter, which has a course parallel to that of the Loire, has been
                    supposed, but erroneously, to occupy an ancient bed of that river. The Mayenne
                    is joined on the right by the Oudon, which can be navigated below Segré. The
                    Erdre, which joins the Loire at Nantes, and the Moine, a tributary of the
                    Sèvre-Nantaise, both take their rise within this department. The climate, which
                    is very mild, shares the characteristics both of the Sequanian and of the
                    Armorican districts. The mean annual temperature of Angers is 3° Fahr, above
                    that of Paris; the rainfall at the same place is only 18 ’ 64 inches, but rises
                    to 23 ’ 6 inches farther down the river, and 27‘75 as the sea is approached.
                    Notwithstanding this deficiency of rain, the frequent fogs, combined with the
                    peculiar nature of the soil in the southeast of the department, produce a degree
                    of moisture which is highly favourable to meadow growths. The winter colds are
                    never severe, and readily permit the cultivation of certain trees which cannot
                    be reared in the adjoining departments.</p>
                <p>Of the entire area more than one-half is arable; one-tenth is occupied by
                    meadows; and considerably smaller areas are occupied by woods, vineyards, and
                    heath respectively. Oxen number 225,000, pigs 100,000, and sheep 68,500; these
                    figures represent a considerable commercial activity, as most of the animals are
                    purchased out of neighbouring departments for the purpose of being fattened.
                    Cholet alone exports annually 100,000 cattle, 150,000 or 200,000 sheep, and
                    25,000 or 30,000 pigs. The number of horses in the department is 55,000, chiefly
                    of a race much used for light cavalry service. The cavalry school is at Saumur
                    within this department. The production of cereals is in excess of the
                    consumption; there are extensive areas in the valleys of the Loire and Sarthe
                    under hemp, and linseed and colza oil are produced in quantity. The legumes of
                    Saumur and Angers are specially prized. The wine of the department (14,000,000
                    gallons in 1880) is fairly good, and the white wine of Saumur is exported and
                    sold as sparkling champagne (about 6,000,000 bottles yearly). Cider is produced,
                    and large quantities of apples, pears, and plums are exported to the markets of
                    Paris, England, and Russia. Floriculture is an important industry, and the
                    forests of oak and beech abound in game (stag, roebuck, wildboar). Near Angers
                    are slate quarries in which 3250 workmen are employed; and the “Layon-et-Loire”
                    coal-bed produced in 1881 15,288 tons of coal and anthracite, which, however,
                    did not supply the demand of the department. There are sandstone quarries in the
                    arrondissements of Saumur and Baugé. Cholet, the chief manufacturing town, is
                    famous for its pocket-handkerchiefs; it has also manufactures of linen cloths,
                    flannels, and cotton stuffs, worsted and cotton thread factories, and bleaching
                    works. Similar manufactures are earned on at Angers; the speciality of Saumur is
                    the making of enamels and beads, in which it employs 600 workmen, producing
                    goods to the annual value of 1,500,000 francs. The population of the department
                    was 517,258 in 1876, being an increase of 141,714 since 1801. There are five
                    arrondissements,—Angers, Baugé, Cholet, Saumur, and Segré. The capital is
                    Angers.</p>
