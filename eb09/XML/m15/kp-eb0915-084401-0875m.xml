                    death as the Tyrtaeus of the hunting field, the laureate of fox-hunting; all his
                    most popular and distinctive heroes and heroines, Digby Grand, Tilbury Nogo, the
                    Honourable Crasher, Mr Sawyer, Kate Coventry, Mrs Lascelles, are or would be
                    mighty hunters. The eldest son of Major Whyte Melville, of Mount Melville,
                    Fifeshire, he received his school education, like so many of his heroes, at
                    Eton, entered the army in 1839, became captain in the Coldstream Guards in 1846,
                    and retired in 1849. His first appearance in literature was made soon after,
                    with a translation of Horace into fluent and graceful verse, published in 1850.
                    His first novel was <hi rend="italic">Digby Grand,</hi> published in 1853.
                    Although this first effort has a good deal more in it of Lytton’s early
                    high-flying style than Whyte Melville’s later works, the unflagging verve and
                    intimate knowledge with which he described sporting scenes and sporting
                    characters at once drew attention to him as a novelist with a new vein. His
                    power of sustaining interest in hunting and the things connected with hunting
                    appeared more markedly in his next novel, <hi rend="italic">Tilbury Nogo,</hi>
                    contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Sporting Magazine</hi> in 1853. He showed
                    in the adventures of Mr Nogo, what became more apparent in his later works, that
                    he had a surer hand in humorous narrative than in pathetic description; there
                    are many pathetic scenes in his novels, but the pathos is sometimes rather
                    forced, intended to point a moral—rather the pathos of the preacher than the
                    poet. The hero of <hi rend="italic">General Bounce,</hi> his next novel in order
                    of publication <hi rend="italic">{Fraser's Magazine,</hi> 1854), little as one
                    would expect it from the title, ends in a painful manner, somewhat out of
                    keeping with the lively middle and beginning. When the Crimean War broke out,
                    Whyte Melville took part in it as a volunteer iu the Turkish contingent; but
                    this was the only break in his literary career from the time that he began to
                    write novels till his death in 1878. By a strange accident, he lost his life in
                    the hunting-field, the hero of many a stiff ride meeting his fate in galloping
                    quietly over an ordinary ploughed field.</p>
                <p>Twenty-one novels appeared from his pen after his return from the Crimea:— <hi
                    rend="italic">Kate Coventry,</hi> 1856; <hi rend="italic">The Interpreter,</hi>
                    1858; <hi rend="italic">Holwiby House,</hi> 1860; <hi rend="italic">Good for
                    Nothing,</hi> 1861; <hi rend="italic">Market Harborough,</hi> 1861; <hi
                    rend="italic">The Gladiators,</hi> 1863; <hi rend="italic">Brookes of

                    rend="italic">Cerise,</hi> 1865; <hi rend="italic">Bones and I,</hi> 1868; <hi

                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>, 1869; <hi rend="italic">Contraband,</hi> 1870; <hi
                    rend="italic">Sarchedon,</hi> 1871; <hi rend="italic">Satanella,</hi> 1872; <hi
                    rend="italic">Ende</hi><hi rend="italic">John,</hi> 1874; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sister Louise,</hi> 1875; <hi rend="italic">Katerfelto,</hi> 1875; <hi
                    rend="italic">Rosine,</hi> 1876; <hi rend="italic">Roy's Wife,</hi> 1878; <hi
                    rend="italic">Black but Comely,</hi> 1878. Several of these novels are
                    historical, the <hi rend="italic">Gladiators</hi> being perhaps the most famous
                    of them. As an historical novelist Whyte Melville cannot be put on a level with
                    Harrison Ainsworth for painstaking accuracy and minuteness of detail; he makes
                    his characters live and move with great vividness, but he obviously did not know
                    at first hand the history of the periods chosen by him. It is on his portraiture
                    of contemporary sporting society that his reputation as a novelist must rest;
                    and, though now and then a character reappears, such as the supercilious
                    studgroom, the dark and wary steeple-chaser, or the fascinating sporting widow,
                    his variety in the invention of incidents is amazing. Whyte Melville was not
                    merely the annalist of sporting society for his generation, but may also be
                    fairly described as the principal moralist of that society; he exerted a
                    considerable and a wholesome influence on the manners and morals of the gilded
                    youth of his time. His <hi rend="italic">Songs and Verses</hi> and his metrical
                    <hi rend="italic">Legend of the True Cross,</hi> though respectable in point of
                    versification, are hardly worth mentioning on their own merits.</p>
