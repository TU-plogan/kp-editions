                <p><label type="entry">MACHIAVELLI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Niccolô</hi></label>
                    (1469-1527), was born at Florence on the 3d of May 1469. His ancestry claimed
                    blood relationship with the lords of Montespertoli, a fief situated between Val
                    di Pesa and Vai d’Elsa, at no great distance from the city. In 1393 the castle
                    of Montespertoli became the property of Niccolô’s great-grandfather. At this
                    date the Machiavelli, like other nobles of the Florentine <hi rend="italic"
                    >contado,</hi> had been absorbed into the body of the burghers, and had begun to
                    seek distinction as officers of the republic. They counted numerous priors and
                    gonfaloniers of justice in the generations which preceded the illustrious
                    secretary. Niccolô’s father, Bernardo, who was born in 1428, followed the
                    profession of a jurist. He held landed property, chiefly near the village of San
                    Casciano, which was worth, according to a recent calculation, something like
                    £250 a year of our money. His son, though not wealthy, was never wholly
                    dependent upon official income.</p>
                <p>Of Niccolô’s early years and education little is known. He is said to have
                    studied under the grammarian Marcello Virgilio Adriani; and his works show wide
                    reading in the Latin and Italian classics. But it is almost certain that he had
                    not mastered the Greek language. In that age of humanistic erudition, it is
                    noticeable that the three most eminent writers of the Renaissance—Machiavelli,
                    Ariosto, and Guicciardini—owed their training to the literature of their own
                    nation. To the defects of Machiavelli’s education, as it appeared to men of
                    Giovio’s stamp, we may, in part at least, ascribe the peculiar vigour of his
                    style and his speculative originality. He is free from the scholastic trifling
                    and learned frivolity which tainted the rhetorical culture of his century. He
                    made the world of men and things his study, learned to write his mothertongue
                    with idiomatic conciseness, and nourished his imagination on the masterpieces of
                    the Romans. Machiavelli shared the enthusiasm of his race and period for
                    antiquity; but the antiquity he worshipped was confined to the commonwealth of
                    Rome. Not the arts, the letters, and the philosophy of the Greeks, but the Latin
                    histories in which the statecraft and organization of the Romans are described,
                    arrested his attention. His habit of thought is marked throughout by a strong
                    Latin bias.</p>
                <p>The year 1494, the year of Charles VIII.’s invasion and of the Medici’s expulsion
                    from Florence, saw Machiavelli’s first entrance into public life. He was
                    appointed clerk in the second chancery of the commune under his old master
                    Marcello Virgilio Adriani. Early in 1498 Adriani became chancellor of the
                    republic, and Machiavelli received his vacated office with the rank of second
                    chancellor and secretary. This post he retained till the year 1512. The masters
                    he had to serve were the Dieci di Libertà e Pace, who, though subordinate to the
                    signoria, exercised a separate control over the departments of war and the
                    interior. They sent their own ambassadors to foreign powers, transacted business
                    with the cities of the Florentine domain, and controlled the military
                    establishment of the commonwealth. The next fourteen years of Machiavelli’s life
                    were fully occupied in the voluminous correspondence of his bureau, in
                    diplomatic missions of varying importance, and in the organization of a
                    Florentine militia. It would be tedious and uninstructive to follow him through
                    all his embassies to petty courts of Italy, the first of which took place in
                    1499, when he was sent to negotiate the continuance of a loan to Catherine
                    Sforza, countess of Forli and Imola. A more important mission followed in 1500,
                    when Machiavelli travelled into France, to deal with Louis XII. about the
                    affairs of Pisa. It is enough to say in general that these embassies were the
                    school in which Machiavelli formed his political opinions, and gathered views
                    regarding the state of Europe and the relative strength of nations. They not
                    only introduced him to the subtleties of Italian diplomacy, but also extended
                    his observation over races very different from the Italians in their social and
                    constitutional development. He thus, in the course of his official business,
                    gradually acquired principles and settled ways of thinking which he afterwards
                    expressed in writing. He was at no time a philosopher or man of letters by
                    profession, and when he came to write he gave to the world the condensed result
                    of practical experience, combined with meditations on the Latin historians,
                    rather than a methodical system.</p>
                <p>His office obliged him from time to time to draw up proposals and memorials on
                    questions of the day, which he presented to the Dieci. One of these, on the
                    affairs of Pisa, belongs to 1499; a second, on the condition of Pistoia, to
                    1501; a third, of more general importance, on the right way of dealing with the
                    rebels of Valdichiana, to 1502. In this last-named document some of the points
                    of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n164/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0164-0147"/> view which stamp his later works with a
                    distinctive character emerge into prominence. We find him seeking parallels and
                    precepts in Roman history, laying down the axiom that human nature is identical
                    throughout the ages, exposing the futility of half measures, and finally
                    appealing to Cesare Borgia as a model of political sagacity. It is clear from
                    this brief and early composition that Machiavelli had already formed the habits
                    of thought which distinguish him. He has begun to idealize Borgia’s policy. He
                    interweaves historical reflexions with contemporary analysis, using the past to
                    illustrate the present, and expounding practical doctrine from texts derived
                    from Livy. There is also noticeable the uncompromising spirit of the man, who
                    was destined afterwards in the <hi rend="italic">Principe</hi> to subordinate
                    all minor considerations of morality and conduct to the one object of political
                    attainment.</p>
                <p>In the year 1502 Machiavelli married Marietta Corsini, the wife who bore him
                    several children, with whom, in spite of his own infidelities, he lived on good
                    terms, and who survived him twenty-six years. In the same year Piero Soderini
                    was chosen gonfalonier for life, in accordance with certain changes in the
                    constitution of the state, which were intended to bring Florence closer to the
                    Venetian type of government. This was an important event in Machiavelli’s
                    career, for he now became intimately connected with Soderini, assisted him in
                    carrying out his policy, suggested important measures of military reform which
                    Soderini adopted, and finally was involved in ruin by his fall. Machiavelli, it
                    may be said in passing, had the qualities of a good servant and a practical
                    official. He remained faithful to Soderini through the difficulties of his later
                    years of power, and spoke well of him subsequently. Yet he was a severe critic,
                    blaming the gonfalonier for weakness of administration and half measures; and,
                    when he died, he indulged in a sarcastic epigram on his old master which does
                    less honour to his loyalty than to his wit.</p>
                <p>The year 1502 was marked by yet another decisive incident in Machiavelli’s life.
                    In October he was sent, much against his will, as envoy to the camp of Cesare
                    Borgia, or duke of Valentino, as he was now called. The duke was then in
                    Romagna, and it was Machiavelli’s duty to wait upon and watch him. He was able
                    now to observe those intricate intrigues which culminated in Cesare’s seizure of
                    Sinigaglia and the treacherous murder of his disaffected captains. From what
                    remains of Machiavelli’s letters to the Dieci during this period, and from his
                    tract upon the <hi rend="italic">Modo</hi><hi rend="italic">tenuto dal Duca
                    Valentino ηelV ammazzare Vitellozzo Vitelli,</hi> we are able to appreciate the
                    actual relations which existed between the two men, and the growth in
                    Machiavelli’s mind of a political ideal based upon his study of the duke’s
                    character. Machiavelli was a mere spectator and critic, by no means an adviser
                    of the duke. He seems to have been even weary and uneasy in the network of
                    hypocrisy and crime in which he found himself,—refreshing his spirits with
                    jocular letters to his private friends, and with the study of a Plutarch which
                    they sent him. He was also able to stigmatize the Borgia’s conduct from a
                    conventional point of view, as is proved by his calling him a “basilisk” and
                    “hydra” in his <hi rend="italic">DecennaU.</hi> Yet he conceived the strongest
                    admiration for his combination of audacity with diplomatic prudence, for his
                    adroit use of cruelty and fraud, for his self-reliance, avoidance of half
                    measures, employment of native troops, and firm administration in conquered
                    provinces. More than once, in letters to his friend Vettori, no less than in the
                    pages of the <hi rend="italic">Principe,</hi> he afterwards expressed his belief
                    that Cesare Borgia’s behaviour in the conquest of provinces, the cementing of a
                    new state out of scattered elements, and the dealing with false friends or
                    doubtful allies, was worthy of all commendation and of scrupulous imitation.
                    Hydra and basilisk were terms, not of reproach, but of panegyric, on the lips of
                    the writer who warned his prince to acquire the nature of the fox and of the
                    lion, who spoke familiarly of <hi rend="italic">frodi onorevoli,
                    scelleratezze</hi><hi rend="italic">gloriose,</hi> and whose conception of <hi
                    rend="italic">Virtu</hi> was self-reliant ability. As he watched Cesare Borgia
                    at this, the most brilliant period of his adventurous career, the man became
                    idealized in his reflective but imaginative mind. Round him, as a hero, he
                    allowed his own conceptions of the perfect prince to cluster. There was so much
                    in the conduct of the duke which exactly fitted with those conceptions, so much
                    of that ideal had conversely been derived at first hand from the duke himself,
                    that the hero and the adventurer were, as it were, confounded. That Machiavelli
                    separated the actual Cesare Borgia, whom he afterwards saw, ruined and
                    contemptible, at Rome, from this radiant creature of his political fancy, is
                    probable. That the Cesare of history does not exactly match the Duca Valentino
                    of Machiavelli’s writings is certain. Still the fact remains that henceforth
                    Machiavelli cherished the ideal image of the statesman which he had modelled
                    upon Cesare, and called this by the name of Valentino.</p>
                <p>On his return to Florence early in January 1503, Machiavelli began to occupy
                    himself with a project he had long since formed, and which his recent attendance
                    upon Cesare Borgia had strengthened in his mind. The duties of his office
                    obliged him to study the conditions of military service as they then existed in
                    Italy. He was familiar with the disadvantages under which republics laboured
                    when they engaged professional captains of adventure and levied mercenary
                    troops. The bad faith of the condottiere Paolo Vitelli (beheaded at Florence in
                    1499) had deeply impressed him. In the war with Pisa he had observed the
                    insubordination and untrustworthiness of soldiers gathered from the dregs of
                    different districts, serving under egotistical and irresponsible commanders. His
                    reading in Livy taught him to admire the Roman system of employing armies raised
                    from the body of the citizens; and Cesare Borgia’s method of gradually
                    substituting the troops of his own duchy for aliens and mercenaries showed him
                    that this plan might be adopted with success by the Italians. He was now
                    determined, if possible, to furnish Florence with a national militia. The
                    gonfalonier Soderini entered into his views. But obstacles of no small magnitude
                    arose. First came the financial difficulties in which the Government was then
                    involved. The suspicion and jealousy of the Florentines had also to be
                    encountered. Some of them feared lest Soderini, if he armed the commonwealth,
                    would aspire to tyranny. All alike were adverse to arming the population of
                    subject cities like Arezzo and Cortona; for it must be remembered that an
                    Italian republic ruled its province with the despotism of an autocrat, and the
                    towns beneath its sway were always panting for independence. The question of
                    money was immediately pressing. Early in 1503 Machiavelli drew up for Soderini a
                    speech, <hi rend="italic">Discorso sulla</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >provisione</hi><hi rend="italic">del Danaro,</hi> in which the duty and
                    necessity of liberal expenditure for the protection of the state were expounded
                    upon principles of sound political philosophy. Between this date and the last
                    month of 1506 Machiavelli laboured at his favourite scheme, working out
                    memorials on the subject for his office, and suggesting the outlines of a new
                    military organization. On the 6th of December 1506 his plan was approved by the
                    signory, and a special ministry, called the <hi rend="italic">Nove di Ordinaηza
                    e Milizia,</hi> was appointed. Machiavelli immediately became their secretary.
                    The country districts of the Florentine dominion were now divided into
                    departments, and levies of foot soldiers were made in order to secure a standing
                    militia. A commanderin-chief had to be chosen for the new troops. Italian <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n165/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0165-0148"/> jealousy shrank from conferring this important
                    office on a Florentine, lest one member of the state should acquire a power
                    dangerous to the whole. The choice of Soderini and Machiavelli fell, at this
                    juncture, upon an extremely ineligible person, none other than Don Micheletto,
                    Cesare Borgia’s cut-throat and assassin. It is necessary to insist upon this
                    point, since it serves to illustrate a radical infirmity in Machiavelli’s
                    genius. While forming and promoting his scheme, he was actuated by principles of
                    political wisdom and by the purest patriotism. But he failed to perceive that
                    such a ruffian as Micheletto could not inspire the troops of Florence with that
                    devotion to their country and that healthy moral tone which should distinguish a
                    patriot army. Here, as elsewhere, he revealed his insensibility to the ethical
                    element in human nature. Knowing that Don Micheletto had worked well for Cesare
                    Borgia, accustomed to disregard private morality as insignificant in public
                    conduct, he was satisfied to entrust the discipline and education of his raw
                    militia to a notorious villain. His indifference to personal ethics led him now
                    into a practical blunder, as it afterwards vitiated his political writings with
                    a philosophical error.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Italy had been the scene of memorable events, in most of which
                    Machiavelli took some part. Alexander VI. had died suddenly of fever. Julius II.
                    had ascended the papal chair. The duke Valentino had been checked in mid-career
                    of conquest. Machiavelli was sent to Rome during the conclave, when he renewed
                    his intercourse with Cesare Borgia. On this occasion he seems to have felt
                    nothing but contempt for the hero of his dreams, who had sunk into
                    insignificance and almost abject submission. The collapse of the Borgias threw
                    Central Italy into confusion; and Machiavelli had, in 1505, to visit the
                    Baglioni at Perugia and the Petrucci at Siena. In the following year he
                    accompanied Julius upon his march through Perugia into the province of Emilia,
                    where the fiery pope subdued in person the rebellious cities of the church. U
                    pon these embassies Machiavelli represented the Florentine Dieci in quality of
                    envoy. It was his duty to keep the ministry informed by means of frequent
                    despatches and reports. All this while the war for the recovery of Pisa was
                    slowly dragging on, with no success or honour to the Florentines. Machiavelli
                    had to attend the camp and provide for levies amid his many other occupations.
                    And yet he found time for private literary work. In the autumn of 1504 he began
                    his <hi rend="italic">Decennali,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Annals of Italy,</hi>
                    a poem composed in rough terza rima, and now remembered only for one line
                    describing the courage of Piero Capponi, when he defied Charles VIII. to his
                    face in 1495 :—</p>
                <p>“Lo strepito dell’ armi e de’ cavalli, Non potè far ch» non fosse sentita La voce
                    d’un Cappon fra cento Galli.”</p>
                <p>About the same time he composed a comedy on the model of Aristophanes, which is
                    unfortunately lost. It seems to have been called <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Haschere.</hi> Giuliano de’ Ricci tells us it was marked by
                    stringent satire upon great ecclesiastics and statesmen, no less than by a
                    tendency to “ascribe all human things to natural causes or to fortune.” That
                    phrase accurately describes the prevalent bias of its author’s mind.</p>
                <p>The greater part of 1506 and 1507 was spent in organizing the new militia,
                    corresponding on the subject, and scouring the country on enlistment service.
                    But at the end of the latter year European affairs of no small moment diverted
                    Machiavelli from these humbler duties. Maximilian was planning a journey into
                    Italy in order to be crowned emperor at Rome, and was levying subsidies from the
                    imperial burghs for his expenses. The Florentines thought his demands excessive.
                    Though they already Ind Francesco Vettori at his court, Soderini judged it
                    advisable to send Machiavelli thither in December. He travelled by Geneva, all
                    through Switzerland, to Botzen, where he found the emperor.</p>
                <p>This journey was an important moment in his life. It enabled, him to study the
                    Swiss and the Germans in their homes; and the report which he wrote on his
                    retura, <hi rend="italic">Rαppοrtο di Cose della Magna,</hi> reckons among his
                    most effective political studies. Instead of confining his attention to the
                    analysis of parties or the portraits of eminent persons in the countries he had
                    traversed, Machiavelli strove to estimate the essential elements of national
                    success or failure. The antique sobriety of the Swiss, their absolute equality
                    and independence, their efficient national militia, inspired him with such
                    admiration that henceforth the Swiss appeared to him the model of modera nations
                    and the most formidable among the neighbours of the Italians. He pointed out
                    that the strength of Germany lay in the free cities, while the emperor was
                    weakened, not only by his own indecisive character and want of funds, but by the
                    jealousy of the feudal princes. The German princes, the burghs, and the empire
                    being ill-accorded, and the Swiss being hostile to all alike, this vast nation
                    lacked the force which its excellent morality, sober living, and vigorous
                    military organization ought to have secured it. What is most remarkable in
                    Machiavelli’s report is his concentrated effort to realize the exact political
                    weight of the German nation, and to penetrate the causes of its strength and
                    weakness. He attempts to grasp the national character as a whole, and thence to
                    deduce practical conclusions. Certain mistakes he undoubtedly made. He treated
                    the Swiss, for example, too much as though they were a part of Germany. He
                    exaggerated the simplicity and sobriety of the race at large, seemingly inspired
                    by Tacitus, and inflamed in his own imagination by sympathy with a people who
                    realized his cherished dreams of national health. His indifference to
                    ecclesiastical questions prevented him from discerning the crisis of the
                    Reformation, which was on the verge of precipitating Germany into the discord of
                    religious wars. Yet, allowing for these drawbacks, we are astonished by the
                    insight into details and the co-ordinating faculty which enabled this Italian to
                    draw so discriminating and animated a portrait of the Germans for the benefit of
                    his republic.</p>
                <p>The same great qualities are noticeable in his <hi rend="italic">Ritratti
                    delle</hi><hi rend="italic">Cose di</hi><hi rend="italic">Francia,</hi> which he
                    drew up after an embassy to Louis XII. at Blois in 1510. These notes upon the
                    French race are more scattered than the report on German affairs. But they
                    reveal no less acumen combined with imaginative penetration into the very
                    essence of national existence. He points out that the special strength of France
                    lies in her centralization. The monarch is surrounded by obedient feudal
                    vassals, the most powerful of whom are of the royal blood. They in their turn
                    draw their wealth from the people. Feudalism, an element of discord in Germany,
                    has been converted into monarchy, and become the cohesive bond of society in
                    France. On the other hand, this centralization contains a grave element of
                    danger for the future of France. The people are ground down and have no liberty.
                    Machiavelli points out how, in these circumstances, the pith of the French army
                    is its chivalry, and why the king is always obliged to hire German and Swiss
                    infantry for his wars. The <hi rend="italic">Ritratli</hi> abound in pointed
                    observations upon the French character which is well contrasted with that of the
                    Spaniards. But what constitutes the originality of this tract is Machiavelli’s
                    determination to realize to himself and to his readers the political value of
                    the French people as a whole, and thus to form a solid basis for judging of its
                    probable behaviour in the future. In this case, as in the case of Germany, he
                    attempts to estimate the physical, moral, and intellectual capacity of an
                    antagonist with whom his country has to grapple. It may be said that, with
                    France as with Germany, he wholly omits the possibilities of religious
                    perturbation.</p>
                <p>While engaged upon this topic, it may be well to mention that Machiavelli
                    displayed exactly the same force of analysis in. laying bare the central causes
                    of weakness in Italy itself. The disarmament of the population by selfish
                    despots and indolent republics; the consequent growth of a vicious mercenary
                    system; the dismemberment of the nation into petty, mutually jealous parcels,
                    due for the most part to the selfishness of Rome; the loss of antique sobriety
                    in manners, and the almost total corruption of the people, fostered and
                    encouraged by their debauched spiritual leaders,—these, he says, are the causes
                    which have made Italy “more enslaved than the Hebrews, more downtrodden than the
                    Persians, more disunited than the Athenians.” This is not the place to discuss
                    his policy for the Italians. Suffice it to say that the same method which he
                    applied to Germany and France supplied him with general conclusions about Italy,
                    and enabled him to view with a truly terrible clairvoyance that desperate
                    disease of his country for which he afterwards invented remedies as
                    desperate.</p>
                <p>Machiavelli returned from Germany in June 1508. The rest of that year and a large
                    part of 1509 were spent in the affairs of the militia and the war of Pisa.
                    Chiefly <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n166/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0166-0149"/> through his exertions the war was terminated by
                    the surrenderor Pisa in June 1509. Meanwhile the league of Cambray had disturbed
                    the peace of Italy, and Florence found herself in a perilous position between
                    Spain and France. Soderini’s Government grew weaker. The Medicean party lifted
                    up its head. To the league of Cambray succeeded the Lega Santa. The battle of
                    Ravenna was fought, and the French retired from Italy. The Florentines had been
                    spectators rather than actors in these great events. But they were now destined
                    to feel the full effects of them. The cardinal Giovanni de’ Medici, who was
                    present at the battle of Ravenna, brought a Spanish army into Tuscany. Prato was
                    sacked in the August of 1512. Florence, in extreme terror, deposed the
                    gonfalonier, and opened her gates to the princes of the house of Medici.</p>
                <p>The Government on which Machiavelli depended had fallen, never to rise again. The
                    national militia in which he placed unbounded confidence had proved inefficient
                    to protect Florence in the hour of need. He was surrounded by political and
                    personal enemies, who regarded him with jealousy as the ex-gonfalonier’s right
                    hand man. Yet at first it appears that he still hoped to retain his office. He
                    showed no repugnance to a change of masters, and began to make overtures to the
                    Medici. The Nove della Milizia were, however, dissolved; and on November 7,
                    1512, Machiavelli was deprived of his appointments. He was exiled from Florence
                    and confined to the dominion for one year, and on November 17 was further
                    prohibited from setting foot in the Palazzo Pubblico. Ruin stared him in the
                    face; and, to make matters worse, he was implicated in the conspiracy of Pier
                    Paolo Boscoli in February 1513. Machiavelli had taken no share in that feeble
                    attempt against the Medici, but his name was found upon a memorandum dropped by
                    Boscoli. This was enough to ensure his imprisonment. He was racked, and only
                    released upon Giovanni de’ Medici’s election to the papacy in March 1513. When
                    he left his dungeon, he retired to a farm near San Casciano, and faced the fact
                    that his political career was at an end.</p>
                <p>Machiavelli now entered upon a period of life to which we owe the great works
                    that have rendered his name immortal. But it was one of prolonged disappointment
                    and annoyance. He had not accustomed himself to economical living; and, when the
                    emoluments of his office were withdrawn, he had but barely enough to support his
                    family. The previous years of his manhood had been spent in continual activity.
                    Muchas he enjoyed the study of the Latin and Italian classics, literature was
                    not his business; nor had he looked on writing as more than an occasional
                    amusement. He was now driven in upon his books for the employment of a restless
                    temperament; and to this irksomeness of enforced leisure may be ascribed the
                    production of the <hi rend="italic">Principe,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Discorsi,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Arte della Guerra,</hi> the comedies, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Storia</hi><hi rend="italic">Fiorentina,</hi> The
                    uneasiness of Machiavelli’s mind in the first years of this retirement is
                    brought before us by his private correspondence. The letters with Vettori paint
                    a man of vigorous intellect and feverish activity, dividing his time between
                    studies and vulgar dissipations, seeking at one time distraction in low
                    intrigues and wanton company, at another turning to the great minds of antiquity
                    for solace. It is not easy for a modern gentleman to understand the spirit in
                    which the author of the <hi rend="italic">Principe</hi> sat down to exchange
                    obscenities with the author of the <hi rend="italic">Sommamo della</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Storia</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Italia.</hi> Nor can it be urged that Machiavelli
                    plunged into dissipation at this crisis to escape from care, or that he penned
                    filth because he had no other occupation for his thoughts. From the camp of
                    Borgia in 1502, when his mind was on the stretch, and he was watching history in
                    the making, he had written similar trash to his acquaintances at home. At the
                    same time this coarseness of taste did not blunt his intellectual sagacity. His
                    letters on public affairs in Italy and Europe, especially those which he meant
                    Vettori to communicate to the Medici at Rome, are marked by extraordinary
                    fineness of perception, combined, as usual in his case, with philosophical
                    breadth. In retirement at his villa near Percussina, a hamlet of San Casciano,
                    Machiavelli completed the <hi rend="italic">Principe</hi> before the end of
                    1513. This famous book is an analysis of the methods whereby an ambitious man
                    may rise to sovereign power. It appears to have grown out of another scarcely
                    less celebrated work, upon which Machiavelli had been engaged before he took the
                    <hi rend="italic">Principe</hi> in hand, and which he did not finish until some
                    time afterwards. This second treatise is the <hi rend="italic">Discorsi
                    sul</hi><hi rend="italic">primo libro</hi><hi rend="italic">delle</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Deche di Tito Livio,</hi> which will henceforth be mentioned in
                    this article as the <hi rend="italic">Discorsi.</hi></p>
                <p>Cast in the form of comments on the history of Livy, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Discorsi</hi> are really an inquiry into the genesis and maintenance of
                    states,— how states come into being, prosper, and decline—in what forms they can
                    be modelled and maintained. The <hi rend="italic">Principe</hi> is an offshoot
                    from the main theme of the <hi rend="italic">Discorsi,</hi> setting forth
                    Machiavelli’s views at large and in detail upon the nature of principalities,
                    the method of cementing them, and the qualities of a successfμl autocrat. Being
                    more limited in subject and more independent as a work of literary art, this
                    essay detaches itself from the main body of'the <hi rend="italic">Discorsi,</hi>
                    and has attracted far more attention. We feel that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principe</hi> is inspired wit⅛ greater fervency, as though its author had more
                    than a speculative aim in view, and brought it forth to serve a special crisis.
                    The moment of its composition was indeed decisive. Machiavelli judged the case
                    of Italy so desperate that salvation could only be expected from the
                    intervention of a powerful despot. The unification of Italy in a state protected
                    by a national army was the cherished dream of his life; and the peroration of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Principe</hi> shows that he meant this treatise to have a
                    direct bearing on the problem. We must be careful, however, not to fall into the
                    error of supposing that he wrote it with the sole object of meeting an
                    occasional emergency. Together with the <hi rend="italic">Discorsi,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Principe</hi> contains the speculative fruits of his experience
                    and observation combined with his deductions from Roman history. The two works
                    form one coherent body of opinion, not systematically expressed, it is true, but
                    based on the same principles, involving the same conclusions, and directed to
                    the same philosophical end. That end is the analysis of the conception of the
                    state, studied under two main types, republican and monarchical. Up to the date
                    of Machiavelli, modern political philosophy had always presupposed an ideal.
                    Mediaeval speculation took the church and the empire for granted, as divinely
                    appointed institutions, under which the nations of the earth must flourish for
                    the space of man’s probation on this planet. Thinkers differed only as Guelfs
                    and Ghibellines, as leaning on the one side to papal on the other to imperial
                    supremacy. In the revival of learning, scholarship supplanted scholasticism, and
                    the old ways of mediaeval thinking were forgotten. But no substantial philosophy
                    of any kind emerged from humanism; the political lucubrations of the scholars
                    were, like their ethical treatises, for the most part rhetorical. Still the
                    humanists effected a delivery of the intellect from what had become the bondage
                    of obsolete ideas, and created a new medium for the speculative faculty. Society
                    in Europe had outgrown the conditions of the Middle Ages, and this new
                    humanistic atmosphere corresponded to the new phase upon which the modern
                    nations were entering. Simultaneously with the revival, Italy had passed into
                    that stage of her existence which has been called the age of despots. The yoke
                    of the empire had been shaken off. The church had taken rank among Italian
                    tyrannies. The peninsula was, roughly speaking, divided into principalities and
                    sovereign cities, each of which claimed autocratic jurisdiction. These separate
                    despotisms owned no common social tie, were founded on no common <hi
                    rend="italic">jus</hi> or right, but were connected in a network of conflicting
                    interests and changeful diplomatic combinations. A keen and positive political
                    intelligence emerged in the Italian race. The reports of Venetian and Florentine
                    ambassadors at this epoch contain the first germs of an attempt to study
                    politics from the point of view of science. At this moment Machiavelli
                    intervenes. He was conscious of the change which had come over Italy and Europe.
                    He was aware that the old strongholds of mediaeval thought must be abandoned,
                    and that the decaying rains of mediaeval institutions furnished no basis for the
                    erection of solid political edifices. He felt the corruption of his country, and
                    sought to bring the world back to a lively sense of the necessity for
                    reformation. His originality consists in having extended the positive
                    intelligence of his century from the sphere of contemporary politics and special
                    interests to <pb break="no"

                    founded the science of politics for the modern world, by concentrating thought
                    upon its fundamental principles. Much that is unnatural in the forced severance
                    of politics from ethics, much that we know now to be untrue in the conception of
                    national development, much that offends our moral sense in the justification of
                    iniquity for public ends, much that the experience of the last three centuries
                    has shown to be mistaken in the theory of the state considered as a work of
                    plastic art, much that belongs to the Renaissance, and has perished with that
                    period of transition, much that is wrongly applied from the experience of
                    Italian diplomacy to politics in general, can be noted by the students of
                    Machiavelli. We feel the want in him of a thorough philosophical education, the
                    continual oscillation between speculative and practical points of view, the lack
                    of system and the negligence of stringent definition. We surmise that, had he
                    studied Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Republic</hi> or the first chapters of
                    Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic">Politics</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ethics,</hi>
                    he might perhaps have avoided what has been the stumbling-block to generous
                    readers—his indifference to moral righteousness as indispensable to states no
                    less than individuals. We regret his unqualified inculcation of the doctrine
                    that means are justified by ends,—a doctrine rendered odious by Jesuitry to the
                    modern mind, and incompatible λvith any sound science of humanity. We knoλv that
                    ethics cannot be severed, as he severed them, from politics; that, though
                    national differs from private duty, both are based upon the same immutable
                    principles; that the former tends, with the growth of the race, to approach ever
                    more nearly to the former; and that it is the function of the political
                    philosopher to keep this steadily in view. We have learned to regard nations,
                    not merely as materials to be moulded by a lawgiver, but as total organisms,
                    which, however modified by men of genius, obey their own laws of evolution. We
                    have outgrown his admiration of antiquity, and do not believe that modern states
                    should seek to model themselves upon the type of Rome. We perceive that his
                    ideal of a prince, working by force, fraud, cruelty, dissimulation to a certain
                    end, was the creature of circumstances, which caused him to advocate the
                    opposition of violence to anarchy as the only possible resort. These are
                    deductions to be made from Machiavelli’s teaching, regarded as final, or as
                    instructive for the times in which we live. But, when we have made these
                    deductions, there remains the fact of his achievement. He began to study men,
                    not according to some preconception, but as he found them,— men, not in the
                    isolation of one century, but as a whole in history. He drew his conclusions
                    from the nature of mankind itself, “ascribing all things to natural causes or to
                    fortune.” In this way he restored the right method of study, a method which had
                    been neglected since the days of Aristotle. He formed a conception of the modern
                    state, which marked the close of the Middle Ages, and anticipated the next phase
                    of European development. His prince, abating those points which are purely
                    Italian or strongly tinctured with the author’s personal peculiarities,
                    prefigured the monarchs of the 16th and 17th centuries, the monarchs whose motto
                    was <hi rend="italic">I.'état c’est moi</hi><hi rend="italic">!</hi> His
                    doctrine of a national militia foreshadowed the system which has given strength
                    in arms to France and Germany. His insight into the causes of Italian decadence
                    was complete; and the remedies which he suggested, in the perorations of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Principe</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Arte della Guerra,</hi>
                    have since been applied in the unification of Italy. Lastly, when we once have
                    freed ourselves from the antipathy engendered by his severance of ethics from
                    the field of politics, when we have once made proper allowance for his peculiar
                    use of phrases like “frodi onorevoli” or “scelleratezze gloriose,” nothing is
                    left but admiration for his mental attitude. That is the attitude of a patriot,
                    who saw with open eyes the ruin of his country, who burned above all things to
                    save Italy and set her in her place among the powerful nations, who held the
                    duty of self-sacrifice in the most absolute sense, whose very limitations and
                    mistakes were due to an absorbing passion for the state he dreamed might be
                    reconstituted. It was Machiavelli’s intense preoccupation with this problem—what
                    a state is and how to found one in existing circumstances—which caused the many
                    riddles of his speculative writings. Dazzled, as it were, with the brilliancy of
                    his own discovery, concentrated in attention on the one necessity for organizing
                    a powerful coherent nation, he forgot that men are more than political beings.
                    He neglected religion, or regarded it as part of the state machinery. He was by
                    no means indifferent to private virtue, which indeed he judged the basis of all
                    healthy national existence; but in the realm of politics he postponed morals to
                    political expediency. He held that the people, as distinguished from the nobles
                    and the clergy, were the pith and fibre of nations; yet this same people had to
                    become wax in the hands of the politician,—their commerce and their comforts,
                    the arts which give a dignity to life and the pleasures which make life
                    liveable, neglected,—their very liberty subordinated to the one tyrannical
                    conception. To this point the segregation of politics from every other factor
                    which goes to constitute humanity had brought him; and this it is which makes us
                    feel his world a wilderness, devoid of atmosphere and vegetation. Yet some such
                    isolation of the subject-matter of this science was demanded at the moment of
                    its birth, just as political economy, when first started, had to make a rigid
                    severance of wealth from other units. It is only by a gradual process that
                    social science in its whole complexity can be evolved. We have hardly yet
                    discovered that political economy has unavoidable points of contact with
                    ethics.</p>
                <p>From the foregoing criticism it will be perceived that all the questions whether
                    Machiavelli meant to corrupt or to instruct the world, to fortify the hands of
                    tyrants or to lead them to their ruin, are now obsolete. He was a man of
                    science—one who by the vigorous study of his subject-matter sought from that
                    subjectmatter itself to deduce laws. The difficulty which remains in judging him
                    is a difficulty of statement, valuation, allowance. How much shall we allow for
                    his position in Renaissance Italy, for the corruption in the midst of which he
                    lived, for his own personal temperament? How shall we state his point of
                    departure from the Middle Ages, his sympathy with prevalent classical
                    enthusiasms, his divination of a new period? How shall we estimate the permanent
                    worth of his method, the residuum of value in his maxims?</p>
                <p>After finishing the <hi rend="italic">Principe,</hi> Machiavelli thought of
                    dedicating it to one of the Medicean princes, with the avowed hope that he might
                    thereby regain their favour and find public employment. He wrote to Vettori on
                    the subject, and Giuliano de’ Medici, duke of Nemours, seemed to him the proper
                    person. The choice was reasonable. No sooner had Leo been made pope than he
                    formed schemes for the aggrandizement of his family. Giuliano was offered and
                    refused the duchy of Urbino. Later on, Leo designed for him a duchy in Emilia,
                    to be cemented out of Parma, Piacenza, Reggio, and Modena. Supported by the
                    power of the papacy, with the goodwill of Florence to back him, Giuliano would
                    have found himself in a position somewhat better than that of Cesare Borgia; and
                    the Borgia’s creation of the duchy of Romagna might have served as his model.
                    Machiavelli therefore was justified in feeling that here was an opportunity for
                    putting his cherished schemes in practice, and that a prince with such alliances
                    might even advance to the grand end of the unification of Italy. Giuliano,
                    however, died in 1506. Then Machiavelli turned his thoughts towards Lorenzo,
                    duke of Urbino. The choice of this man as a possible Italian liberator reminds
                    us of the choice of Don Micheletto, as general of the Florentine militia. To
                    Lorenzo the <hi rend="italic">Principe</hi> was dedicated, but without result.
                    The Medici, as yet at all events, could not employ Machiavelli, and had not in
                    themselves the stuff to found Italian kingdoms.</p>
                <p>Machiavelli, meanwhile, was reading his <hi rend="italic">Discorsi</hi> to a
                    select audience in the Rucellai gardens, fanning that republican enthusiasm
                    which never lay long dormant among the Florentines. Towards the year 1519 both
                    Leo X. and his cousin the cardinal Giulio de’ Medici were much perplexed about
                    the management of the republic. It seemed necessary, if possible, in the gradual
                    extinction of their family, to give the city at least a semblance of
                    self-government. They applied to several celebrated politicians, among others to
                    Machiavelli, for advice in the emergency. The result was his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Discorso</hi><hi rend="italic">sopra</hi><hi rend="italic">il</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Piformar lo</hi><hi rend="italic">Stato</hi><hi rend="italic">di
                    Firenze,</hi> a treatise in which he deduces practical conclusions from the past
                    history and present temper of the city, blending these with his favourite
                    principles of government in general. He earnestly admonishes Leo, for his own
                    sake and for Florence, to found a permanent and free state system for the
                    republic, reminding him in terms of noble eloquence how splendid is the glory of
                    the man who shall confer such benefits upon a people. The year 1520 saw the
                    composition of <hi rend="italic">I sette</hi><hi rend="italic">Libri</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">delV Arte di Guerra,</hi> and of the <hi rend="italic">Vita di
                    Castruccio.</hi></p>
                <p>The first of these is a methodical treatise, setting forth Machiavelli’s views on
                    military matters, digesting his theories respecting the superiority of national
                    troops, the inefficiency of fortresses, the necessity of relying upon infantry
                    in war, and the comparative insignificance of artillery. It is strongly coloured
                    with his enthusiasm for ancient Rome; and specially upon the topic of artillery
                    it displays a want of insight into the actualities of modern warfare. We may
                    regard it as a supplement or appendix to the- <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n168/mode/1up"

                    rend="italic">Discorsi,</hi> since Machiavelli held it for a fundamental axiom
                    that states are powerless unless completely armed in permanence. The peroration
                    contains a noble appeal to the Italian liberator of his dreams, and a parallel
                    from Macedonian history, which, read by the light of this century, sounds like a
                    prophecy of Piedmont.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Vita di Castruccio</hi> was composed at Lucca, whither
                    Machiavelli had been sent on a mission. This so-called biography of the
                    mediaeval adventurer who raised himself by personal ability and military skill
                    to the tyranny of several Tuscan cities must be regarded in the light of an
                    historical romance. Dealing freely with the outline of Castniccio’s career, as
                    he had previously dealt with Cesare Borgia, he sketched his own ideal of the
                    successful prince. Cesare Borgia had entered into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principe</hi> as a representative figure rather than an actual personage; so
                    now conversely the theories of the <hi rend="italic">principe</hi> assumed the
                    outward form and semblance of Castruccio. In each case history is blent with
                    speculation in nearly the same proportions. But Castruccio, being farther from
                    the writer’s own experience, bears weaker traits of personality.</p>
                <p>In the same year, 1520, Machiavelli, at the instance of the cardinal Giulio de ’
                    Medici, received commission from the officers of the Studio Pubblico to write a
                    history of Florence. They agreed to pay him an annual allowance of 100 florins
                    while engaged upon the work. The next six years were partly employed in its
                    composition, and he left a portion of it finished, with a dedication to Clement
                    VII., when he died in 1527. In the <hi rend="italic">Istorie Florentine</hi>
                    Machiavelli quitted the field of political speculation for that of history. But,
                    having already written the <hi rend="italic">Discorsi</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Principe,</hi> he carried with him to this new task of
                    historiography the habit of mind proper to political philosophy. In his hands
                    the history of Florence became a text on which at fitting seasons to deliver
                    lessons in the science he initiated. This gives the work its special character.
                    It is not so much a chronicle of Florentine affairs, from the commencement of
                    modern history to the death of Lorenzo de’ Medici in 1492, as a critique of that
                    chronicle from the point of view adopted by Machiavelli in his former writings.
                    Having condensed his doctrines in the <hi rend="italic">Principe</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Discorsi,</hi> he applies their abstract principles to the
                    example of the Florentine republic. His favourite topics reappear—the
                    dismemberment of Italy by the papacy (bk i. 9, 23); the ruin of her national
                    militia (bk. i. 34, 38; bk. v. 1; bk. vi. 1); the enervation of her
                    commonwealths by commerce (bk. i. 39; bk. ii. 42); her corrupt morality (bk.
                    iii. 1); the reference of Italian circumstances to Boman precedents (bk. iii. 1
                    ); the theory of the intervenient “nomothetes” in states (bk. iv. 1); and the
                    theory of human vicissitudes (bk. v. 1). This gives to his history a deductive
                    and illustrative quality which men of less imaginative mind, like Guicciardini,
                    or the exact students of our own days may criticize. But the <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Florence</hi> is not a mere political pamphlet. It is the first
                    example in Italian literature of a national biography, the first attempt in any
                    literature to trace the vicissitudes of a people’s life in their logical
                    sequence, deducing each successive phase from passions or necessities inherent
                    in preceding circumstances, reasoning upon them from general principles, and
                    inferring corollaries for the conduct of the future. In his prooemium
                    Machiavelli taxes Poggio and Lionardo Bruni with having neglected civic affairs
                    for the record of wars and alliances. It is to the analysis of the republic’s
                    inner life that he directs attention, showing how her acts were the phenomena of
                    this organic force. At the same time he does not omit the narrative of external
                    events, but places the portrait of Florence in the centre of an animated group
                    of pictures drawn from Italian history. Approaching his own times, he enlarges
                    on the part played by the Medici; for it was one of the conditions of the task
                    imposed on him that he should celebrate the ancestors of Giulio. This portion of
                    the work is executed in no servile spirit, and the subsequent destiny of
                    Florence fully justified the prominence here given to the elder Cosimo and
                    Lorenzo. In point of form the <hi rend="italic">Florentine History</hi> is
                    modelled upon Livy. In contains speeches in the antique manner, which may be
                    taken as partly embodying the author’s commentary upon situations of importance,
                    partly as expressing what he thought dramatically appropriate to prominent
                    personages. The style of the whole book is nervous, vivid, free from artifice
                    and rhetoric, obeying the writer’s thought with absolute plasticity. Machiavelli
                    had formed for himself a prose style, equalled by no one but by Guicciardini in
                    his minor works, which was far removed from the emptiness of the Latinizing
                    humanists and the trivialities of the Italian purists. Words in his hands have
                    the substance, the selfevidence of things. It is an athlete’s style, all bone
                    and sinew, nude, without superfluous flesh or ornament.</p>
                <p>It would seem that from the date of Machiavelli’s discourse to Leo on the
                    government of Florence the Medici had taken him into consideration. Writing to
                    Vettori in 1513, he had expressed his eager wish to “roll stones” in their
                    service; and this desire was now gratified. In 1521 he was sent to Carpi to
                    transact a petty matter with the chapter of the Franciscans, the chief known
                    result of the embassy being a burlesque correspondence with Francesco
                    Guicciardini. Four years later, in 1525, he received a rather more important
                    mission to Venice. But Machiavelli’s public career was virtually closed; and the
                    interest of his biography still centres in his literary work. We have seen that
                    already, in 1504, he had been engaged upon a comedy in the manner of
                    Aristophanes, which is now unfortunately lost. A translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Andria,</hi> and three original comedies from his pen are extant,
                    the precise dates of which are uncertain, though the greatest of them was first
                    printed at Rome in 1524. This is the <hi rend="italic">Mandragola,</hi> which
                    may be justly called the ripest and most powerful single play in the Italian
                    language.</p>
                <p>The plot is both improbable and unpleasing. But, having granted this, literary
                    criticism is merged in admiration of the wit, the humour, the vivacity, the
                    satire of a piece which brings before us the old life of Florence in a
                    succession of brilliant scenes. If Machiavelli had any moral object when he
                    composed the <hi rend="italic">Mandragola,</hi> it was to paint in glaring
                    colours the corruption of Italian society. It shows how a bold and plausible
                    adventurer, aided by the profligacy of a parasite, the avarice and hypocrisy of
                    a confessor, and a mother’s complaisant familiarity with vice, achieves the
                    triumph of making a gulled husband bring his own unwilling but too yielding wife
                    to shame. The whole comedy-is a study of stupidity and baseness acted on by
                    roguery. About the power with which this picture of domestic immorality is
                    presented there can be no question. But the perusal of the piece obliges us to
                    ask ourselves whether the author’s radical conception of human nature was not
                    false. The same suspicion is forced upon us by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principe.</hi> Did not Machiavelli leave good habit, as an essential ingredient
                    of character, out of account? Men are not such absolute fools as Nicia, nor such
                    compliant catspaws as Ligurio and Timoteo; women are not such weak instruments
                    as Sostrata and Lucrezia. Somewhere, in actual life, the stress of craft and
                    courage acting on the springs of human vice and weakness fails, unless the hero
                    of the comedy or tragedy, Callimaco or Cesare, allows for the revolt of
                    healthier instincts. Machiavelli does not seem to have calculated the force of
                    this recoil. He speculates a world in which <hi rend="italic">Virtiι,</hi>
                    unscrupulous strength of character, shall deal successfully with frailty. This,
                    we submit, was a deep-seated error in his theory of life, an error to which may
                    be ascribed the numerous stumbling-blocks and rocks of offence in his more
                    serious writings.</p>
                <p>Some time after the <hi rend="italic">Mandragola,</hi> he composed a second
                    comedy, entitled <hi rend="italic">Clizia,</hi> a portion of the plot of which
                    is borrowed from the <hi rend="italic">Casina.</hi> Though modelled on the art
                    of Plautus, the <hi rend="italic">Clizia</hi> is even homelier and closer to the
                    life of Florence than its predecessor. It contains incomparable studies of the
                    Florentine housewife and her husband, a grave business-like citizen, who falls
                    into the senile folly of a base intrigue. The device by which Nicomaco is
                    brought back to a sense of duty is presented in scenes of solid humour which
                    recall the manner of Beu Jonson. On the whole, the <hi rend="italic">Clizia</hi>
                    is a pleasanter and wholesomer play than the <hi rend="italic">Mandragola.</hi>
                    It served as model to a school of later playwrights. There remains a short piece
                    without title, the <hi rend="italic">Commedia</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Prosa,</hi> which, if it be Machiavelli’s, as internal evidence of
                    style sufficiently argues, might be accepted as a study for both the <hi
                    rend="italic">Clizia</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Mandragola.</hi> It seems
                    written to expose the corruption of domestic life in Florence, and especially to
                    satirize the friars in their familiar part of go-betweens, tame cats,
                    confessors, and adulterers. The Fra Alberigo of this comedy is a vigorous piece
                    of realistic portraiture, anticipating, if not surpassing, the Fra Timoteo of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mandragola.</hi></p>
                <p>Of Machiavelli’s minor poems, sonnets, capitoli, and carnival songs, there is not
                    much to say. Powerful as a comic playwright, he was not a poet in the proper
                    sense of the term. The little novel of <hi rend="italic">Belfagor</hi> claims a
                    passing word, if only because of its celebrity. It is a good-humoured satire
                    upon marriage, the devil being forced to admit that hell itself is preferable to
                    his wife’s company. That Machiavelli invented it to express the irritation of
                    his own domestic life is a myth without foundation. The story has a mediaeval
                    origin, and it was almost simultaneously treated in Italian by Machiavelli,
                    Straparola, and Giovanni Brevio.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1526 Machiavelli was employed by Clement VII. to inspect the
                    fortifications of Florence. He presented a report upon the subject, and in the
                    summer of the same year received orders to attend Francesco Guicciardini, the
                    pope’s commissary of war in Lombardy. Guicciardini sent him in August to
                    Cremona, to transact business with the Venetian provveditori. Later on in the
                    autumn we find him once more with Guicciardini at Bologna. Thus the two great
                    Italian historians of th©</p>

                <p>16th century, who had been friends for several years, were brought into relations
                    of close intimacy. It would be interesting to know the topics of their
                    conversation, and to possess some fragments of the debates they undoubtedly held
                    upon the grave affairs of Italy at this decisive juncture. In the next year Rome
                    was destined to be sacked by an imperial army. Florence was to rise in rebellion
                    against the Medici. Four years later Charles V. was to lay the iron hand of
                    Spain upon the remnants of Italian liberty, But nothing survives of
                    Machiavelli’s and Guicciardini’s discourse. We can only form an opinion of what
                    it must have been from the commentaries written by the latter on the political
                    philosophy of Machiavelli—commentaries which sufficiently explain the different
                    methods of the two great thinkers. Guicciardini, more positive even than
                    Machiavelli in his criticism, averse to theory, satisfied with a policy of
                    public temporizing and expediency, accepting Italian decadence with the
                    tranquillity of egotism, looked on Machiavelli as a dreamer. “Nothing,” he says,
                    “can cure the diseases of our century but the knife of Lycurgus, and the knife
                    of Lycurgus may not be expected.” Machiavelli was always hoping against hope
                    that this knife in the hands of some superior Cesare might still be used.
                    Guicciardini, as events proved; had taken a sounder view of the situation; or
                    rather it was men like Guicciardini who made the situation. Machiavelli to the
                    last remained a patriot, with darkly bright impracticable visions in his
                    brain.</p>
                <p>After another visit to Guicciardini in the spring of 1527, Machiavelli was sent
                    by him to Civita Vecchia. It seemed that he was destined to be associated in the
                    papal service with Clement’s viceroy, and that a new period of diplomatic
                    employment was opening for him. But soon after his return to Florence he fell
                    ill. His son Piero said that he took medicine on the 20th of June which
                    disagreed with him; and on the 22d he died, having received the last offices of
                    the church. There is no foundation for the legend that he expired with profane
                    sarcasms upon his lips. Yet we need not run into the opposite extreme, and try
                    to fancy that Machiavelli, who had professed paganism in his life, proved
                    himself a believing Christian on his death-bed. That he left an unfavourable
                    opinion among his fellowcitizens is very decidedly recorded by the historian
                    Varchi. The <hi rend="italic">Principe,</hi> it seems, had already begun to
                    prejudice the world against him; and we can readily believe what Varchi
                    sententiously observes, that “it would have been better for him if nature had
                    given him either a less powerful intellect or a mind of a more genial temper.”
                    There is in truth a something crude, unsympathetic, cynical in his mental
                    attitude toward human nature, for which, even after the lapse of more than three
                    centuries, we find it difficult to make allowance. The force of his intellect
                    renders this want of geniality repulsive. We cannot help objecting that one who
                    was so powerful could have been kindlier and sounder if he willed. We therefore
                    do him the injustice of mistaking his infirmity for perversity. He was
                    colour-blind to commonplace morality; and we are angry with him because he
                    merged the hues of ethics in one grey monotone of politics. In person
                    Machiavelli was of middle height, black-haired, with rather a small head, very
                    bright eyes, and slightly aquiline nose. His thin close lips often broke into a
                    smile of sarcasm. His activity was almost feverish. When unemployed in work or
                    study, he was not averse to the society of boon companions, gave himself readily
                    to transient amours, and corresponded in a tone of cynical bad taste. At the
                    same time he lived on terms of intimacy with worthy men. Varchi says of him that
                    “in his conversation he was pleasant, obliging to his intimates, the friend of
                    virtuous persons.” Those who sare to understand the contradictions of which such
                    a character was capable should study his correspondence with Vettori. It would
                    be unfair to charge what is repulsive in their letters wholly on the habits of
                    the times; for wide familiarity with the published correspondence ot similar men
                    at the same epoch brings one acquainted with little that is so disagreeable.</p>
