                    professor of ecclesiastical history, and in the following year was appointed
                    dean of St Paul’s. He died July 31, 1871.</p>
                <p>The philosophy of Mansel, like that of his older contemporary Sir W. Hamilton of
                    Edinburgh, was mainly due to three sources,— the works of Aristotle, the
                    speculations of Kant, and the philosophy of Reid. Like Hamilton, Mansel
                    maintained the purely formal character of logical science, the duality of
                    consciousness as testifying to both self and the external world, and the
                    limitation of knowledge to the finite and “conditioned.” His logical doctrines
                    were developed in his edition of Aldrich’s <hi rend="italic">Artis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Logicae</hi><hi rend="italic">Rudimenta</hi> (1849)—his chief
                    contribution to the reviving study of Aristotle— and in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prolegomena</hi><hi rend="italic">Logica,</hi><hi rend="italic">—an Inquiry
                    into the Psychological Character of Logical Processes</hi> (1851), in which the
                    limits of logic as the “science of formal thinking” are rigorously determined.

                    Thought</hi> (1858) <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n521/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0521-0498"/> he applied to Christian theology the metaphysical
                    agnosticism which seemed to result from Kant’s criticism, and which had been
                    developed in Hamilton’s <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of the Unconditioned.</hi>
                    Showing the contradictions which arise when we attempt to conceive God under the
                    categories of substance or cause, Mansel contends that we can have no positive
                    conception either of the metaphysical or moral attributes of the Absolute and
                    Infinite Being, though we are compelled to believe in His existence, the
                    religious consciousness being built up by reflexion from the feeling of
                    dependence and the conviction of moral obligation. Hence he infers the
                    invalidity of all objections to revelation from its alleged inconsistency with
                    the Divine character, maintaining the dependence of its claim to acceptance upon
                    the evidences accompanying it. While denying all knowledge of the supersensuous,
                    Mansel deviated from Kant in contending that cognition of the ego as it really
                    is is itself a fact of experience. Consciousness, he held,—agreeing thus with
                    the doctrine of “natural realism” which Hamilton developed from Reid,—implies
                    knowledge both of self and of the external world. The latter ManseΓs psychology
                    reduces to consciousness of our organism as extended; with the former is given
                    consciousness of free-will and moral obligation. These views and a summary of
                    his whole philosophy are contained in his article “Metaphysics” contributed to
                    the 8th edition of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</hi>
                    (separately published, I860). Mansel was also the author of an essay on <hi
