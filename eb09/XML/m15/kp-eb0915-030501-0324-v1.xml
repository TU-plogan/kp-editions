                <p><label type="entry">MAINZ, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Mentz</hi></label> (in French,
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Mayence),</hi> the largest town in the grand duchy of
                    Hesse-Darmstadt, one of the strongest fortresses in Germany, and formerly the
                    seat of an archbishop and elector, is situated on a rising ground on the left
                    bank of the Rhine, nearly opposite the influx of the Main. The fortifications,
                    which consist of three <hi rend="italic">enceintes</hi> with a series of
                    outlying forts, embrace the small town of Castel on the opposite bank, and have
                    recently been widened so as to admit of a large extension of the town. Mainz is
                    connected with Castel by a bridge of boats, and the Rhine is also spanned there
                    by a railway bridge. The interior of the town consists chiefly of narrow and
                    irregular streets, but the oldest part of all, to the west, was almost entirely
                    destroyed by the explosion of a powder-magazine in 1857, and has been rebuilt in
                    a much improved style. There are also several handsome modern streets on the
                    side next the Rhine, which is bordered by a fine quay, upwards of 300 feet in
                    breadth. To the south lies the Neue Anlage, a park laid out on the site of the
                    chateau of Favorite, where the duke of Brunswick signed his famous manifesto to
                    the French people in 1792. The principal object of historical and architectural
                    interest in Mainz is the grand old cathedral, an imposing Romanesque edifice
                    with numerous Gothic additions and details. It was originally erected between
                    975 and 1009, but has since been repeatedly burned down and rebuilt, and in its
                    present form dates chiefly from the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries.. The largest
                    of its six towers is 300 feet in height. The whole building was restored by
                    order of Napoleon in 1814, and another thorough renovation has been recently in
                    progress. The interior contains the tombs of Boniface, the first archbishop of
                    Mainz, of Frauenlob the minnesinger, <pb break="no"

                    Mainz possesses other eight Roman Catholic churches, the most noteworthy of
                    which are those of St Ignatius, with a finely painted ceiling, and St Stephen,
                    built in 1318, and restored after the explosion of 1857. The old electoral
                    palace, erected in 1627-78, now contains valuable collections of Roman and
                    Germanic antiquities, a picture gallery, and a library of 130,000 volumes,
                    including several productions of Gutenberg, Fust, and Schöffen Among the other
                    principal buildings are the palace of the grand-duke, built in 1731-30 as a
                    lodge of the Teutonic Order, the theatre, the arsenal, the Government house, the
                    commandant’s residence, and several fine private houses. A handsome statue of
                    Gutenberg, by Thorwaldsen, was erected at Mainz in 1837, and the town is also
                    embellished with a statue of Schiller and two architectural fountains. Mainz
                    still retains many relics of the Roman period, the most important of which is
                    the Eigelstein, a monument believed to have been erected by the Roman legions in
                    honour of Drusus. It stands within the citadel, which occupies-the site of the
                    Roman castrum. A little to the south-west of the town are the remains of a large
                    Roman aqueduct, of which upwards of sixty pillars are still standing. The
                    educational and scientific institutions of Mainz include an episcopal seminary,
                    a gymnasium, a society for literature and art, a musical society, and an
                    antiquarian society, the fine collection of which has been mentioned above. The
                    university, founded in 1477, was suppressed in 1791.</p>
                <p>The site of Mainz would seem to mark it out naturally as a great centre of trade,
                    but the illiberal rule of the archbishops and its military importance seriously
                    hampered its commercial and industrial development, and prevented it from
                    rivalling its neighbour Frankfort. It is now, however, the chief emporium of the
                    Rhenish wine traffic, and also carries on an extensive transit trade in grain,
                    timber, flour, and oil. The natural facilities for carriage by water are
                    supplemented by seven railways. The principal manufactures of Mainz are leather
                    goods, furniture, carriages, chemicals, musical instruments, and carpets, for
                    the first two of which it has attained a wide reputation. Mainz is the seat of
                    the administrative and judicial authorities of the province of Rheinhessen, and
                    also of a Roman Catholic bishop. The population in 1880 amounted to 61,322,
                    including a garrison of about 8000 men. Fully two-thirds are Roman Catholics.
                    Castel has about 5000 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Mainz, one of the oldest cities in Germany, was originally a Celtic settlement.
                    Its strategic importance was early recognized by the Romans, and in 13 B.c.
                    Drusus, the son-in-law of Augustus, erected a fortified camp <hi rend="italic"
                        >(castrum)</hi> there, to which a smaller <hi rend="italic">castellum</hi>
                    (the modem Castel) on the opposite bank was afterwards added. The Celtic name
                    became Latinized as <hi rend="italic">Maguntiacum</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >Moguntiacum,</hi> and a town, <hi rend="italic">Maguntia,</hi> gradually
                    arose, which became the capital of Germania Superior. In the
                    “Völkerwanderungen," or migrations of peoples during the gradual dissolution of
                    the Roman empire, Mainz was destroyed on different occasions by the Alemanni,
                    the Vandals, and the Huns (451 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> Christianity
                    seems to have been introduced at an early period, and soon after its recovery
                    from the last of these calamities we find it the seat of a bishop. In the middle
                    of the 8th century, under Boniface, the see became an archbishopric, to which
                    the primacy of Germany was annexed. Charlemagne built a bridge here and granted
                    the town important privileges, and in the following centuries it was the seat of
                    several diets and ecclesiastical councils. In 1254 Mainz was the head and
                    mainspring of the league of Rhenish towns, and had attained to such a pitch of
                    commercial prosperity that it was known as the ’ ‘ Goldene Mainz.” Soon after
                    this time it is believed that the population was as numerous as at the present
                    day. In 1462, during the strife between the rival archbishops Diether von
                    Isenburg and Adolph von Nassau, Mainz espoused the cause of the former, but was
                    taken by the latter, who had the support of the emperor, lost its imperial
                    privileges, and was henceforth subject to the archbishops. Many of its citizens
                    were driven into exile, and carried into other lands a knowledge of the art of
                    printing, which had been invented at Mainz by Gutenberg in 1440. In the Thirty
                    Years’ War Mainz wasoccupied by the Swedes and the French. In 1792 it
                    enthusiastically welcomed the principles of the French Revolution, and opened
                    its gates to the Republican troops under General Custine. It was recaptured in
                    the following year, but was ceded to France by the peace of Campo Formio in
                    1797. In 1814 it was restored to Germany and handed over to the grand-duchy of
                    Hesse, remaining, however, a fortress of the German Confederation, garrisoned in
                    common by Prussian, Austrian, and Hessian troops. Since 1871 it has been a
                    fortress of the German empire.</p>
