                    anecdotical work of his in Latin, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Nugis Curialium.</hi> He was probably a native of Herefordshire or
                    Gloucestershire. He tells us that his parents rendered services to Henry If.
                    both before and after his accession. He was acquainted with the household of
                    Thomas Becket before this famous ecclesiastic became archbishop of Canterbury,
                    which wasin 1162. He studied in the university of Paris, attending the lectures
                    of Girard la Pucelie, who began lecturing in 1160. Map seems to have risen
                    rapidly in favour at the court of Henry If., combining ecclesiastical with civil
                    and political functions. In 1173 he was an itinerant justice at the assize of
                    Gloucester, and in the same year was with the court at Limoges, where the duty
                    fell to him of entertaining the archbishop of Tarentaise, about whom he tells
                    some marvellous stories. He was sent on a diplomatic mission to Louis le Jeune,
                    king of France, and sat as a delegate in a council called by Pope Alexander III.
                    (probably 1179), enjoying such repute that he was deputed to argue with the
                    Waldenses. He accompanied Henry IT. on all his progresses, and in return for his
                    services received several ecclesiastical preferments. Apparently he maintained
                    his position at court under Richard and John. In 1196 he was appointed
                    archdeacon of Oxford, and in 1207-8 the custodes of the abbey of Eynsham were
                    ordered to pay him his accustomed rent of five marks per annum. In the 12th
                    century the abuses of the church were assailed with great freedom and abundance
                    of humorous wit in rhymed Latin verse, and a century or two later rubrics appear
                    in the MSS. of these satirical poems ascribing them to Walter Map. “Golias
                    Episcopus” is the nominal author and hero of a great many of these effusions;
                    that is to say, they represent the sayings and doings of Golias, the revelation
                    made to him, the confession made by him, his creed, his reasons for not
                    marrying, and so forth. The fact that Map’s friend Giraldus Cambrensis denounces
                    Golias as a foul-mouthed scoffer is rather against Map’s alleged authorship, and
                    they have probably been attributed to him in consequence of his great reputation
                    as a wit, and a tradition that he had such a hatred of the White Monks that he
                    exempted them from his oath as king’s deputy to render even justice to all men.
                    If these coarse and witty poems were really Map’s, they are a proof of
                    astonishing versatility, for they offer as great a contrast as possible to the
                    high imaginative qualities, gracious tenderness, pure and lofty idealism, of his
                    contributions to the Round Table legends. This is not the place for an
                    exposition of the origin of these legends, but the <hi rend="italic">Quest du
                    Saint Graal</hi> was undoubtedly written by Map, being assigned to him in the
                    earliest MSS. Μ. Paulin Paris ascribes to him also, upon grounds which commend
                    themselves as being at least highly probable, the <hi rend="italic">Saint
                    Graal,</hi> and the noble prologue and the concluding parts of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lancelot du Lac.</hi> The effect of these contributions to the cycle was to
                    completely transform its character, making out of it a lofty spiritual allegory,
                    and forcing the paganism of the earlier legends into the service of the morality
                    of the church. With such consummate skill did Map insinuate his story of the
                    Graal into the cycle that the separate legends of Lancelot, Gawain, Percival,
                    and Tristan seem to grow out of it; the whole luxuriant and irregular growth
                    acquires a unity from its connexion with this root and stem. This reorganizing
                    achievement alone, apart from the high romantic value of Map’s independent
                    additions, entitles him to a high place in literature.</p>
