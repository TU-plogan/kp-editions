                    NorthWestern Provinces, India, lying between 28° 28' and 29° 18' N. lat., and
                    77° 10' and 78° 14' E. long, is bounded on the N. by Muzaffarnagar district, on
                    the E. by the Ganges, on the S. by Bulandshahr district, and on the W. by the
                    Jumna. The area in 1881 was given as 2361 square miles. Meerut forms a portion
                    of the long and narrow plain lying between the Ganges and the Jumna, with a very
                    gentle slope from north to south. Though well wooded in places and abundantly
                    supplied with mango groves, it has but few patches of jungle or waste land to
                    break the general expanse of cultivated soil. Sandy ridges run along the low
                    watersheds which separate the minor channels, but with this exception the whole
                    district is one continuous expanse of careful and prosperous tillage. Its
                    fertility is largely due to the system of irrigation canals, which intersect it
                    in every direction. The -eastern Jumna canal runs through the whole length of
                    the district, and supplies the rich tract between the Jumna and the Hindan with
                    a network of distributary streams. The main branch of the Ganges canal passes
                    across the centre Of the plateau in a sweeping curve, and waters the midland
                    tract. The Anùpshahr branch supplies irrigation to the Ganges slope. Besides
                    these natural and artificial channels, the country is everywhere cut up by small
                    water-courses. The Burh Gangâ, or ancient bed of the Ganges, lies at some
                    distance from the modern stream; and on its bank stood the abandoned city of
                    Hastinapur, the legendary capital of the Pandavas at the period of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mahabharata,</hi> said to have been deserted many centuries before
                    the Christian era, owing to the encroachments of the river.</p>
                <p>The census of 1872 returned the population of the district at 1,276,104, the
                    Hindus numbering 991,226. Among the higher castes Brahmans muster strong
                    (109,804). The Rajputs (both Hindus and Mohammedans) number 55,083, and enjoy
                    great social distinction as landholders; the Banias, or traders (66,942), also
                    now hold considerable landed property. The great cultivating castes are the
                    Chaînât» (197,273) and Jàts (145,514). The Gujars (60,350) are a pastoral tribe,
                    with an ancient character for plunder and cattle-lifting, which is now passing
                    away. The Mohammedans (281,857) are for the most part the descendants of
                    converted Hindus. The Christian population consists of 2149 Europeans, 142
                    Eurasians, and 730 natives. Fifteen towns in the district contain a population
                    exceeding 5000; namely, Meerut, 81,386; H⅛pur, 14,544; Sardhana, 12,466;
                    Garhmukhtesar, 7962; Bâgpat, 7367: Ghaziaba l, 7365; Shahdara, 7257; Baro, 7056;
                    Mawana, 6864; Pilkhua, 6239; Khekara, 6045; Tikri, 5698; Kirthal, 5651; Dasna,
                    5605; Chaprauli, 5594.</p>
                <p>Meerut is one of the most flourishing and best tilled districts of the Doâb. Out
                    of a total area of 1,505,824 acres, as many as 1,048,221 were under cultivation
                    in 1881, 281,095 acres being irrigated by Government works, and 303,526 by
                    private individuals. The grazing lands comprehended 242,091 acres, and the waste
                    185,400. The condition both of agricultural labourers and of artisans and
                    workmen in the towns has considerably improved of late years. About one-half the
                    soil is cultivated by the proprietors themselves, the remainder being about
                    equally divided between tenants with occupancy rights and tenants-at-will. Rents
                    are paid in money, and range from 18s. 10d. per acre for the best canal-watered
                    lands down to 2s. 5∣d. per acre for “dry” unirrigated soils. The chief exports
                    of the district are grain, cotton, and indigo; and the principal imports are
                    Manchester goods, English hardware, tobacco, drugs, and spices. The chief
                    commercial centres are Meerut, Ghaziabâd, and Bâgpat. Besides the great
                    waterways of the Jumna and Ganges, and the navigable canals, communication is
                    afforded by the East Indian and the Punjab and Delhi Railways; also by 1505
                    miles of made roads. In 1876 the district was in the administrative charge of
                    four covenanted civilians, and contained seventeen magisterial and fifteen civil
                    courts. The gross revenue in 1881 was £248,754, of which £203,977 was derived
                    from the land-tax; the cost of officials and police was £27,520. In 1881 there
                    were 214 schools, attended by 6677 pupils. The comparatively high latitude and
                    elevated position of Meerut make it one of the healthiest districts in the
                    plains of India. The average temperature varies from 57° Fahr, in January to 87°
                    in June. The rainfall is small, less than 30 inches annually. The only endemic
                    disease in the district is malarial fever; but small-pox and cholera
                    occasionally visit it as epidemics.</p>
                <p>The authentic history of the district commences with the</p>
                <p>Moslem invasions. Until the 11th century it is probable that Meerut was mainly in
                    the hands of predatory native tribes, such as the Jâts and Dors. The first
                    undoubted Mohammedan invasion was that of Kutab-ud-din in 1191, when Meerut town
                    was taken, and all the Hindu temples turned into mosques. In 1398 Timur swooped
                    down upon the district, captured the fort of Loni after a desperate resistance,
                    and put all his Hindu prisoners to death. He then proceeded to Delhi, and after
                    his memorable sack of that city, returned to Meerut, captured the town, razed
                    all the fortifications ami houses of the Hindus, and put the male inhabitants to
                    the sword. The firm establishment of the great Mughal dynasty in the 16th
                    century, under Babar and his successors, gave Meerut a period of internal
                    tranquillity and royal favour. After the death of Aurangzeb, however, it was
                    exposed to alternate Sikh and Mahratta invasions. From 1707 till 1775 the
                    country was the scene of one perpetual strife, and was only rescued from anarchy
                    by the exertions of the military adventurer Walter Reinhardt, afterwards the
                    husband of the celebrated Begâm Samru, who established himself at Sardhana in
                    the north, and ruled a large estate. The southern tract, however, remained in
                    its anarchic condition under Mahratta exactions until the fall of Delhi in 1803,
                    when the whole of the country between the Jumna and the Ganges was ceded by
                    Sindhia to the British. It was formed into a separate district in 1818. In the
                    British period it has become memorable as being the place where the first
                    outbreak of the great mutiny of 1857 took place. *</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Meerut,</hi> a city, and cantonment in the above district,
                    is situated about half way between the Ganges and the Jumna, in 29° 0' 41" N.
                    lat. and 77° 45' 3" E. long. The city proper lies south of the cantonments, and
                    although a very ancient town, dating as far back as the days of the Buddhist
                    emperor Asoka <hi rend="italic">(cire.</hi> 250 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>),
                    Meerut owes its modern importance to its selection by the British Government as
                    the site of a great military station. In 1805 it is mentioned as “a ruined
                    depopulated town.” The cantonment was established in 1806, and the population
                    rose rapidly to 29,014 in 1847, and 82,035 in 1853. In 1872 the census returned
                    the population (exclusive of the military) at 81,386, viz., Hindus, 47,606;
                    Mohammedans, 33,532; Christians, 248, The slight decline of population between
                    1853 and 1872 may probably be attributed to the mutiny of 1857. Most of the
                    streets have a poor appearance, owing to the hasty manner in which they were
                    erected. The cantonment, a little to the north of the city, forms the
                    headquarters of a military division. The principal building is the Meerut church
                    with its handsome tall spire. There are also a Boman Catholic church, mission
                    chapel, asylum for the relief of Europeans and Christians, and a club. Tlιe Mall
