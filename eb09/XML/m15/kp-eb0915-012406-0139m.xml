                    and rocky hills about 300 feet in height occupy both extremities of the
                    peninsula, the picturesque-looking city, with its flat-roofed houses painted
                    blue, green, and red, lying in the far from level stretch of ground between. The
                    forts are effective additions to the general view, but do not add much to the
                    real strength of the place. Along the east side of the peninsula runs the Praya
                    Grande, or Great Quay, the chief promenade in Macao, on which stand the
                    governor’s palace, the administrative offices, the consulates, and the leading
                    commercial establishments. The church of St Paul, erected between 1594 and 1602,
                    the seat of the Jesuit college in the 17th century, was destroyed by fire in
                    1835. The Hospital da Misericordia (1569) was rebuilt in 1640. The Camoens
                    grotto—where the exiled poet found leisure to celebrate the achievements of his
                    ungrateful country—lies in a secluded spot to the north of the town, which has
                    been partly left in its native wildness strewn with huge granite boulders and
                    partly transformed into a fine botanical garden. In 1871 there were in Macao
                    5375 persons of European birth or extraction, 53,761 Chinese living on land and
                    10,268 in boats. Half-castes are very numerous. Though most of the land is under
                    garden cultivation, the mass of the people is dependent more or less directly on
                    mercantile pursuits; for, while the exclusive policy both of Chinese and
                    Portuguese which prevented Macao becoming a free port till 1845-46 allowed what
                    was once the great emporium of European commerce in eastern Asia to be
                    outstripped by its younger and more liberal rivals, the trade of the place is
                    still of very considerable extent Since the middle of the century indeed much of
                    it has run in the most questionable channels: the nefarious coolie traffic
                    gradually increased in extent and in cruelty from about 1848 till it was
                    prohibited in 1874, and much of the actual trade is more or less of the nature
                    of smuggling. The total value of exports and imports was in 1876-77 upwards of
                    £1,536,000. Commercial intercourse is most intimate with Hong-Kong, Canton,
                    Batavia, and Goa. The preparation and packing of tea is the principal industry
                    in the town. The colonial revenue, which is largely recruited by a tax on the
                    notorious gambling tables, increased from 104,643 dollars in 1856-57 to 380,012
                    in 1872-73, while the expenditure rose from 69,757 to 266,344.</p>
                <p>In 1557 the Portuguese were permitted to erect factories on the peninsula, and in
                    1573 the Chinese built the wall across the isthmus which still cuts off the
                    barbarian from the rest of the island. Jesuit missionaries established
                    themselves on the spot, and in 1580 Gregory XIII. constituted a bishopric of
                    Macao. A senate was <pb break="no"

                    Silveira became first royal governor of Macao. Still the Portuguese remained
                    largely under the control of the Chinese, who had never surrendered their
                    territorial rights and maintained their authority by means of mandarins,—these
                    insisting that even European criminals should be placed in their hands. Ferreira
                    do Amaral, the Portuguese governor, put an end to this state of things in 1849,
                    and left the Chinese officials no more authority in the peninsula than the
                    representatives of other foreign nations; and, though his antagonists procured
                    his assassination (August 22d), his successors have succeeded in carrying out
                    his policy. The Chinese Government has hitherto refused (notably in 1862) to
                    recognize the territorial claims of the Portuguese; but the European powers
                    treat Macao as <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> a colonial possession, and not
                    only the governor, the president of the courts, and other Portuguese officials,
                    but even the Chinese magistrates, are directly appointed by the king of
                    Portugal. For a short time in 1802, and again in 1808, Macao was occupied by the
                    English as a precaution against seizure by the French.</p>
