                <p><label type="entry">MALTA</label> is the chief island of the Maltese group,
                    consisting of Malta, 35° 50' N. lat. and 14° 30' E. long., Gozo, 36° 5' N. lat.
                    and 14° 10' E. long., Comino, which lies between them, and the two islets
                    Cominotto and Filfla, a crown colony, and one of the Mediterranean possessions
                    of Great Britain. Malta is 17} miles long by 9} broad, containing an area of
                    about 95 square miles (about two-thirds the size of the Isle of Wight), and Gozo
                    is 9 miles long by 5 wide, with an area of 20 square miles. The islands lie
                    directly south of Sicily, distant from 55 to 60 miles, near the centre of tho
                    Mediterranean basin, where they appear as the remains of an ancient chain of
                    islands, much worn and still wearing away by the sea. Gozo, which has the same
                    general character as Malta, possesses more moisture and richer soil, and
                    therefore more verdure. A cluster of single hills, remarkable for their steeply
                    conical shape, on one of which stands Rabato, the principal village, is near the
                    middle of the island. Along the northern and eastern shores of Malta the
                    coast-line is frequently broken by deep indentations and bays (St Paul’s, St
                    George’s, and St Julian’s Bays); on the peninsulas in and round the most
                    remarkable of these Valetta and its fortifications are built. The geological
                    formation is late Eocene, the prevailing rocks being white, grey, reddish, or
                    yellow sandstone, with <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0361-0340"/> some beds of marl and coral limestone, in many
                    parts abounding in fossils. The surface of the country is diversified by valleys
                    and steep hills; there is little water, and no river, brook, or lake exists on
                    any of the islands. The highest point of Malta is near Casai Dingli, about 750
                    feet above the sea to the south; a little farther north lies the ancient
                    capital, Citta Vecchia, upon another steep height; west of these lies the range
                    of Bingemma Hills running north-east to south-west; from this higher ground the
                    island slopes somewhat towards the north-west. On the west and south the cliffs
                    rise sheer from the sea to a height of 300 or 400 feet; on the north the rock in
                    many places shelves to the water’s edge, though the harbours of Valetta and the
                    rocks where the apostle Paul was wrecked are an exception to this. At the east
                    end is the large harbour Marsa Scirocco, into which the south-east sirocco blows
                    with full force. The general appearance of the land is bare, owing to the want
                    of woodland, and also to the use of stone walls as enclosures for the fields,
                    which in the east of the island are smaller than in the west. The dark foliage
                    of the carob and the singular masses of the prickly pear are, however, very
                    marked in the landscape, which with its contrasts of blue sea running into the
                    brown and yellow land, heightened by whatever of green may be, is of fascinating
                    beauty under the effects of morning light and setting sun. The land is closely
                    cultivated; often the soil is terraced on the sides of the hills as a safeguard
                    against the winter rains. The soil is in many places extremely thin; it is,
                    however, so fertile that it produces two and sometimes three crops in a year.
                    Large quantities of early potatoes grown for the English market, corn sufficient
                    to supply the island for four months of the year, cotton, principally for home
                    use, and a fine red-flowering clover, called <hi rend="italic">sulla,</hi> are
                    the chief crops; excellent honey is obtained from Gozo; oranges and figs come to
                    great perfection. Goats abound, but few cows are kept; the mules and asses are
                    fine; •cattle and sheep for butcher meat are imported from Barbary. Fish is good
                    and abundant. The flowers of Malta are famous; Cicero mentions the cushions
                    stuffed with roses used by Verres, and many a lovely garden is hidden behind the
                    high stone walls. The interesting flora of the islands approaches that of Africa
                    (to which continent the old geographers considered them to belong, as the French
                    do still), including the palm, cactus, and other subtropical plants. The scanty
                    fauna is for the most part European; the Maltese dog is mentioned by Strabo and
                    other old writers; a few still remain, though not wild. Of birds there are about
                    ten or twelve indigenous species, but a large number of migratory birds pass or
                    rest here. The marine plants and animals also offer a rich fund of material to
                    the student.</p>
                <p>The winter climate is temperate and healthy, the thermometer ranging from 51° to
                    71° Fahr. between October and May. In the summer months the heat is almost
                    tropical; from July to the end of October it ranges between 80° and 90°. Snow is
                    unknown, but hail occurs in winter, and much rain usually falls between December
                    and February. The northerly winds are bracing, bub the southeast wind, called
                    the sirocco, which brings the warm air from the African deserts, and then takes
                    up the salt sea mists, is very deleterious; it occurs suddenly, chiefly in
                    August and September, occasionally in the spring, and fortunately lasts usually
                    but a few hours. The “gregale” (“eurokylon” of Acts xxvii. 14) is a strong
                    north-east wind which occasionally blows in the winter months with great fury
                    and force for two or three days together, especially in November and February,
                    rendering it dangerous to cross the harbour, sometimes tearing up stone walls
                    and landing-steps, and otherwise doing much damage.</p>
                <p>The Maltese are a strong well-formed race, the men dark, handsome, and lithe, the
                    women with black eyes and fine hair and an easy carriage; as in other Eastern
                    nations, the working classes grow old at a comparatively early age. They are a
                    cheerful, good-humoured, and industrious people, sober and abstemious, though
                    quick-tempered and addicted to the use of the knife. Bread or pasta, with a few
                    olives, a little oil, or milk cheese, forms the chief support of the poor, who
                    seldom or never eat meat, and drink but little of the light wine of the country.
                    The gentry have a large admixture of Spanish, Italian, and French, but among the
                    people in general the Arab race and character predominate, influenced by contact
                    with Sicily. Of the native language 70 per cent, consists of Arabic words, the
                    rest being chiefly a corrupt Italian; that spoken in Gozo is the purest Maltese.
                    The festivals and ceremonials of the Roman Church are kept up to an
                    extraordinary degree, together with a few that seem to be derived from the Greek
                    Church. The perpetual ringing of monotonous church bells, and the peculiar
                    method of striking time, are relics of South Italian customs.</p>
                <p>Malta is divided into twenty-six casais or village districts, Gozo into nine;
                    some of the villages are large and populous, each having its church, often large
                    and handsome. Near the middle of the island, on sharply rising ground, stands
                    the ancient capital, called Civitas Melita by the Romans and oldest writers,
                    Medina <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the city) by the Saracens, Notabile
                    (“jocale notabile, et insigne coronae regiae,” as it is called in a charter by
                    Alphonso, 1428) under the Sicilian rule, and Citta Vecchia (old city) by the
                    knights. The cathedral, overthrown by an earthquake in 1693, but rebuilt, stands
                    on the reputed site of the house of Publius, Paul’s friend; many Maltese gentry
                    live in this town, and the English utilize some of the buildings. The Roman
                    remains and catacombs of Citta Vecchia must not be forgotten. Since 1570 the
                    chief town has been Valetta, —a city built on a ridge of rock (Mount Sceberras)
                    which runs like a tongue into the middle of a bay, which it thus divides into
                    two great harbours, subdivided again by three other peninsulas into creeks. On
                    two of these peninsulas, and at their base, are built the aggregate of towns
                    called the Three Cities, part of which (grown up under the old Fort St Angelo)
                    is much older than the coming of the knights, and is called Vittoriosa in
                    commemoration of the siege of 1565. Valetta, including the suburb Florian, is
                    about 2 miles long and ∣ mile wide; Fort St Elmo, with a lighthouse, stands on
                    the point; the summer suburb Sliema lies on the point which encloses the west or
                    Marsamusceit harbour; Fort Ricasoli on the opposite point enclosing the east or
                    grand harbour. The streets of Valetta, paved with stone, run along and across
                    the ridge, and end on each side towards the water in steep flights of steps.
                    Many of the houses, which are of stone throughout, with flat roofs, are large
                    and luxuriously built; wooden covered balconies project from the windows and
                    give a peculiar aspect to the streets. There are several fine public buildings,
                    as the governor’s palace, the new opera-house, the public library, the <hi
                    rend="italic">auberges</hi> or lodges of the knights, especially the Auberge de
                    Castile, the English church built by Queen Adelaide and others. Roman Catholic
                    churches in Valetta are very numerous: the cathedral of St John is famous for
                    its rich inlaid marbles, its Brussels tapestries, its roof painted by Matteo
                    Preti (1661-99), and the picture by Caravaggio, the Decollation of John the
                    Baptist. The hospital of the knights contains one of the longest rooms in
                    Europe, 503 feet in length, without a central support. The extensive bagnios
                    under the rock, formerly occupied by the slaves of the knights, are now used for
                    naval stores. The knights strengthened Valetta and its harbours by bastions,
                    curtain-walls, lines, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n362/mode/1up"

                    on every available point, taking advantage in every particular of the natural
                    rock and of the marvellous advantages of situation, rendering it then almost
                    impregnable. The work of fortifying the place with modern armament is carried on
                    by the British Government, which possesses there the finest naval hospital in
                    Europe, a military prison, and other necessary institutions, including immense
                    subterranean stores of grain. New sanitary and water works and dwellings for the
                    over-crowded poor have lately been undertaken by the local authorities. The city
                    is clean and well-regulated, gay with the motley throng of all nations that
                    continually come and go, and presenting many features common to the East; the
                    influx of winter visitors attracted by the mild climate and social gaieties has
                    of late years proved a source of wealth to the inhabitants. A railroad from
                    Valetta to Citta Vecchia,the first in the island, is now nearly completed.</p>
                <p>The importance of Malta lies, as of old, in its harbours, which render it a
                    splendid port of call, repair, or refuge, as well as a fine naval station, in
                    its capabilities as a depot for coals and stores, in its hospitals, and in its
                    strength as a military station. Its position in the Mediterranean is of the
                    utmost value towards keeping a clear highway to the East and to India. During
                    the eighty-two years of British, occupation the population, trade, and produce
                    have largely increased. The government, created by royal letters patent of 11th
                    May 1849, consists of a council of eighteen members, eight elected by the
                    Maltese (about two thousand three hundred electors), nine chosen by the crown,
                    and the governor, with a salary of £5000, who is usually a military officer. To
                    these were added by letters patent of May 1881 an executive council of three
                    members to advise and assist the governor. The council have powers to make laws
                    and to vote money; this last was restricted by the British Government in 1875,
                    leading to a protest in the following year by the elected eight. The government
                    of the islands presents peculiarities owing to the combination of military and
                    civil duties. Several recent inquiries on taxation, education, &amp;c., have led
                    to important changes during the last two years. The consolidated revenue is at
                    the disposal of the crown through the governor and council; Malta is
                    self-supporting, costing the imperial exchequer little beyond the military and
                    naval establishments, and even contributing £5000 annually towards the former.
                    The revenue arises chiefly from import duties (of which a large proportion
                    accrues from a tax of 10s. a quarter upon grain) and tonnage dues.</p>

                <p>The tonnage of vessels entering and clearing equals that at Gibraltar; in 1878it
                    amounted to 6,503,859 (5,669,046 of which was for British vessels), and in 1880
                    it was 6,147,234. In 1879 the value of imports actually landed was £794,565, and
                    of exports £216,050,—a value of about £18,700,000 merely touching at the port.
                    The figures fluctuate; in the following year they fell considerably. In 1837 the
                    revenue was but £95,600, while but one steamship, of 137 tons, entered the
                    harbour; in 1879 2894 steamers, with a tonnage of 2,781,806 entered. In the
                    naval yard numerous vessels are repaired yearly; in 1876— 77 these amounted to
                    39 ironclad and other ships and 43 smaller vessels. One arm of the harbour is
                    devoted to a coaling station, where enormous quantities of coal are annually
                    imported and sold (384,272 tons in 1880). The British Mediterranean fleet is
                    stationed there for six months of the year, the strength of the naval forces
                    being usually about 5000 men. The strength of the military in the island is
                    usually about 6500, the largest garrison in any British colony.</p>
                <p>The population, which in 1837 was 115,570, was 154,892 in 1880, exclusive of
                    British troops and their families, about 24,000 being English and foreigners; it
                    is rapidly increasing, and is unequally distributed, the greater part being
                    settled in the large casais or villages on the eastern half of Malta, including
                    the densely populated Valetta; large tracts to the west are bare and but
                    sparsely inhabited; about one-third of the island is rocky and uncultivated.
                    Malta has now 1510 inhabitants to the square mile, Gozo 962. In 1879 there were
                    9868 children (about two-fifths of these at school age) attending elementary
                    schools, including 768 students at the university and two lyceums; in 1880 the
                    total was 9595. All the casais of Malta and Gozo (with but one or two
                    exceptions), besides Valetta and the Cities, have schools, which are now placed
                    on the same system as the board schools in England; great efforts are being made
                    to extend the acquisition of the English language, which till recently was
                    neglected in favour of Italian. The director of public education, besides the
                    elementary, has under his care several secondary schools, two lyceums in
                    Vittoriosa and in Valetta, and the university (founded by the knights in 1768),
                    with faculties of philosophy and arts, law, medicine,’ and theology. In Valetta
                    is a large public library founded by the knights in 1760, containing 48,000
                    volumes, open free daily; in Gozo is a smaller one.</p>

                    to whatever race wished to hold the highway of the Mediterranean, whether
                    Phoenician, Punic, Roman, or Arab. Thus even the stories of Homer have a
                    semblance of truth, for the Ogygian isle where Ulysses took refuge has been
                    supposed to be Malta or Gozo, in both of which tradition (born of the poem) yet
                    points out the grottoes of Calypso. The earliest inhabitants of whose presence
                    we have any actual trace are the Phoenicians, from whom we have several
                    important inscriptions which tell of them and their temples, several curious
                    images believed to belong to their worship, and many specimens of their pottery
                    and glass, chiefly found in tombs, some bearing Phoenician characters and
                    potters’ marks. Sepulchral caves and clusters of rock-hewn tombs, especially
                    those in the hills of Bingemma, in several of which terra cotta sarcophagi have
                    been found, are referred with reason to a Phoenician or a Puħic origin;
                    Caruana’s <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> gives a list of these in eight places,
                    distinguishing them from numerous Greek and Christian catacombs which also exist
                    in the islands. The most remarkable remains are three rough stone erections, one
                    in Gozo (Torre dei Giganti), and two in Malta, about a mile apart (Hagiar Kim
                    and Mnaidra), which mainly consist of several apsidal chambers side by side, the
                    walls ef which are built of enormous horizontal and upright stones. In Malta the
                    ruins show evidence of much skill in stone-cutting; the entrances to the
                    chambers consist of three large slabs of stone in place of doorpost, each
                    smaller than and at a little distance from the one outside it; several have
                    well-shaped holes for ropes ot other fastening; other slabs have sharply-squared
                    holes and shelves cut in the solid stone; others again are ornamented with
                    “pit-markings” or little depressions cut evenly all over the surface of the
                    stone. A table or altar is also found in some of the rooms, a massive slab of
                    stone supported on an upright formed like the trunk of a tree; in one case the
                    two ends of the slab are carefully mortised into the walls at each side, the
                    chamber being very small, and apparently intended specially for its reception.
                    Hagiar Kim was excavated by the Government in 1840, when considerable traces of
                    the action of fire were found on some of the walls, as well as buried ashes. In
                    other rooms were found quantities of bones, many fragments of pottery, lamps,
                    bowls, &amp;c., nine images, and a small ornamented altar <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Archseol.,</hi> vol. xxix. p. 227). The ruins in Gozo were excavated about
                    1827 <hi rend="italic">(Archaeol.,</hi> vol. xxii. p. 294). All these buildings
                    stand on commanding positions, high on the side or the shoulder of steep hills.
                    They have been usually considered Phoenician temples; and, on comparison of them
                    with what is known of the great temple of Melkart at the south-east corner of
                    Malta, the presumption is strong that these too were built by the same race, at
                    some very early period. The bilingual inscription found there belongs to a later
                    age, the Graeco-Punic time, to which Greek coins found in both islands and a few
                    other remains bear evidence. It is probable that the islands shared in some
                    degree the varying fortunes that followed on the wars in Sicily, which took
                    place as Greek drove cut Phoenician, as Carthaginian drove out Greek and tried
                    to regain the ancient possession of the mother-land, as finally Rome conquered
                    all. During the First Punic War (264-241 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) Malta
                    seems to have <pb break="no"

                    (Orosius, iv. c. 8). In the Second Punic War the Carthaginians, under Hamilcar,
                    son of Gisco, gave it up to Titus Sempronius, 218 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    (Livy, xxi. 51).</p>
                <p>In the pursuit of manufactures and commerce Malta had attained a high degree of
                    prosperity under the Phoenicians, which still existed under the Romans of the
                    Augustan age. It was especially famous for its textile fabrics (probably of
                    cotton, which is grown and spun there to this day); the Sicilian praetor Verres
                    sent there for women’s woven garments. The inhabitants were rich, and there were
                    many artificers of all kinds. Ovid speaks of it as a fertile island <hi
                    rend="italic">{Fast.,</hi> iii. 567). The” remains formerly existed
                    (unfortunately now for the most part dispersed or destroyed) of several fine
                    Graeco-Roman temples, such as the temple of Juno spoken of by Cicero and
                    Valerius Maximus, whose ornaments and fine ivories and carved figures of Victory
                    tempted more than one sacrilegious robber; the temple of Proserpine, which we
                    learn from an inscription was repaired by Chrestion, a freedman of Augustus,
                    procurator of Malta; and the temple of Apollo at the chief town Melita, which
                    with a theatre shared the munificence of a wealthy Maltese under the Antonine
                    rule; these and the ruins of a princely Roman dwelling with mosaics, system of
                    water supply, &amp;c., at the same place, are buta few signs of the luxury
                    enjoyed in the islands. Diodorus noticed the beauty and adornment of the houses
                    in Malta in his time, a few years after the shipwreck of St Paul. One of the
                    islanders was a friend of Cicero, who had thoughts of retiring there himself. A
                    mole and important harbour works, discovered a few years ago, show that the
                    Romans were not behind in strengthening the natural advantages of the islands
                    for shelter. Inscriptions recording municipal institutions there date from the
                    time of Hadrian; how much earlier they possessed them is unknown. Before then we
                    hear of Chrestion the procurator mentioned above, and a Roman governor under
                    Augustus, Lucius Castricius, styled <hi rend="italic">πpωτos</hi> Meλι- <hi
                    rend="italic">τalωv</hi>, “chief man of the Maltese” (Caruana, 1882, p. 134;
                    1881, pp. 20, 21), just as, half a century later, Publius was <hi rend="italic"

                    xxviii. 7); all these were probably concerned in the local government. The
                    Romans retained the Maltese group for many centuries. At the division of the
                    empire in 337 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> it passed with Italy, Illyria, and
                    Africa to Constans; after the reunion, and the final division after the death of
                    Theodosius in 395, Malta, as one of the isles of the Mediterranean, remained
                    with the empire of the East. History has but little to mention regarding it
                    during those early times, except that event of ever-living interest, the
                    shipwreck of St Paul, 58 <hi rend="smallcaps">a,d.,</hi> which it is now
                    well-ascertained took place in a bay on the north side of Malta. The alleged
                    conversion of the Maltese to Christianity following the three months’ stay of
                    the apostle and his companions may be a fact; Chrysostom refers to it <hi
                    rend="italic">{Hom.</hi> 54 on Acts). Many Christian monograms and inscriptions
                    have been found, ranging from the 2d to the 9th century; and the tombs and
                    subterranean cemeteries near Citta Vecchia are said to be arranged like the
                    Christian cemeteries of subterranean Rome (Caruana, 1881, p. 18). Tradition says
                    these were used as hiding-places in times of persecution; it is certain that
                    Ptolemy at the end of the 2d century notes the famous temples of Hercules and
                    Juno as still in existence; the old religion and the new must have gone on side
                    by side for a long time. After a time Malta was made a bishopric; according to
                    R. Pirrus <hi rend="italic">{Sicilia Sacra,</hi> Melitensis Eccl. Not. vii., <hi
                    rend="italic">s.v.</hi> ‘ ‘Lucilio ”) it was, though considered part of Africa,
                    subject to the bishop of Palermo (in 6th century primate of Africa); we find
                    Gregory the Great dealing with a contumacious bishop of Malta and directing the
                    bishop of Syracuse and others to depose him, and to aid the successor appointed
                    in his place (Greg., <hi rend="italic">Epist.,</hi> ii. 44; ix. 63; x. 1).</p>
                <p>The Saracens did not gain possession of-Malta without a struggle of many years;
                    they invaded it three times, in 828, 836 (when it appears to have been chiefly
                    Gozo that suffered), and finally in 870, when the inhabitants of Melita, having
                    massacred the Greek (Byzantine) garrison of 3000, opened their gates to the
                    invaders. The Arabs are said to have destroyed part of the city so as to bring
                    the fortifications within smaller compass, rendering it more easy to defend, and
                    to have changed its name to Medina (great or chief city). In a suburb just
                    outside the present walls there was discovered in 1881 a burial-place containing
                    numerous Arab coffins, overlying the remains of the Roman palace mentioned
                    above, which was thus finally ruined and concealed by the conquerors. It is
                    known that they built a fortress in 973, at the point of Mount Sceberras where
                    Fort St Elmo now stands. A few coins are preserved, but otherwise very little
                    record remains of the Arab dominion, which lasted about two hundred and twenty
                    years; no more Christian bishops are known until after that time, but tradition
                    asserts, not without probability, that some of the original natives remained in
                    certain villages and some Greeks in the capital, among whom were Christians.</p>
                <p>The Norman knights, who brought their conquering arms into Apulia, Calabria, and
                    Sicily, and even sent ships to Byzantium, were probably the first to bring a
                    Teutonic race and influence into λlalta. Through somewhat uncertain dates it
                    appears that Roger I. (youngest son of Tancred, and brother of Guiscard) about
                    1090 landed in the island and levied tribute, and that about 1127 Roger II.,
                    this not being paid, set sail with a fleet, took Medina, then governed by a <hi
                    rend="italic">gaito,</hi> Maimono, and after setting free all the Christians and
                    exacting a large sum in money, mules, and horses, completed the conquest of
                    Malta and Gozo. Walter, bishop of Malta, whose name is found as witness to a
                    document of 1090, is believed to have been now appointed by Roger I., and
                    consecrated by the pope. A succession of Christian bislιops, endowments and
                    buildings made, tithes granted, &amp;c., testify to the restoration of the
                    church in the islands, while they shared with Sicily the feudal laws and
                    administration newly established under the Norman rule. In 1193 Malta as a
                    county gave a title to Margarito Brundusio, grand-admiral of Sicily, and three
                    successive counts of Malta followed. After the Norman princes had possessed the
                    islands about a century, the kingdpm of the Two Sicilies, and the Maltese
                    islands with it, passed in 1194 to the emperor Henry Vl., in professed right of
                    his wife Constance, daughter and heiress of Roger II. In 1223 a Maltese named
                    Henry or Arrigo is stated to have been grand-admiral of Sicily (Pirrus, p. 906;
                    Miège, ii. 38). He is probably the same as the distinguished Henry, count of
                    Malta, who λvith three hundred Maltese youths in 1205 earned the favours of the
                    Genoese by brilliantly taking two forts in Tripoli (Caffarus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ann. Genuenses,</hi> in Muratori, t. vi.), and who took part also in the fourth
                    crusade. No traces of the crusades, however, have been found in these islands,
                    although it is probable that their leaders would not neglect the advantages of
                    Maltese ports and sailors.</p>
                <p>Henceforward Malta, as a fief of Sicily, followed the fortunes of that country.
                    The Maltese seem to have taken no part in the Sicilian Vespers (1282), but to
                    have held out for Charles of Anjou until Peter of Aragon, crowned king of
                    Sicily, August 1282, won a battle at sea against the French, attacked Notabile
                    and the forts, and thus obtained possession of the islands. For nearly two
                    hundred and fifty years the Spanish house, through fourteen kings of Aragon,
                    bore rule over Sicily and Malta. In 1391 the countship was erected into a
                    marquisate, which lasted two years only. In 1427 a swarm of Moors (18,000)
                    ravaged Malta and Gozo, but were not able to take the city Notabile; yet the
                    people, though afflicted by the plagne in 1431—as not unfrequently at other
                    times—were able to sally forth to conquer Gerbi on the coast of Africa in the
                    following year. The king at this time (1432) authorized the demolition of the
                    old castle at Notabile, built three hundred and fifty years before, and gave the
                    ground on which it stood to the town; but the fortifications of the island were
                    strengthened (1466), the chief stronghold in the 15th century being the fortress
                    of St Angelo. The inhabitants, addicted to fighting at sea, were forbidden from
                    1448 to 1494 to send out armed corsair ships, in order it is said to retain
                    those capable of defence in the islands, the population of which was at the
                    beginning of that period very scant. The Jews were expelled from Malta by the
                    same edict of Ferdinand, in 1492, which turned them out of Spain. By 1514 the
                    population of Malta had doubled; the two islands together contained 22,000
                    inhabitants (Miège, ii. 81). They frequently attacked the Moors on the mainland,
                    and suffered reprisals themselves as late as 1526. Their last king of the
                    Spanish house, the emperor Charles V., in 1530 granted Malta and Gozo (with the
                    city of Tripoli) as a noble and free fief to the knights of St John of
                    Jerusalem, still retaining, however, the suzerainty, by the homage of a falcon
                    annually to be given by the knights.</p>
                <p>Malta thus during many centuries occupied the position of a feudal fief of
                    Sicily; her laws and her church date from the times of the Normans, and both
                    developed as in other feudal governments. The progress of her political
                    independence in the 15th century, especially under Alphonso I. and John I., has
                    been shown by the historian Miège; the history of the relations between Malta
                    and the monarchs of Sicily affords an interesting example of feudal obligations
                    with their attendant difficulties. That these fostered a spirit of liberty and
                    independence in the people, and must have tended largely to the prosperity of
                    the islands, is shown by numerous diplomas of the Aragonese suzerains preserved
                    in the archives at Malta (Eton’s <hi rend="italic">Authentic Materials,</hi>
                    1803, p. 108 <hi rend="italic">sq.},</hi> where it is seen that the inhabitants
                    acquired many privileges and were also able to pay on emergency considerable
                    sums of money to increase and preserve their privileges. Thus in 1428, only a
                    century before the knights came, they paid 30,000 florins of gold to King
                    Alphonso in order to secure their tenure by the crown of Sicily without any
                    middle-lords, being the second time they thus bought back their island rights
                    (Eton, p. 84). These things are to be noticed, because, as has been complained,
                    the knights unjustly depreciated the value and advantages of the islands, in
                    order the more readily to obtain the grant from Charles V. Under the kings of

                    popular council and jurats, a captain-justiciar representing the rights of the
                    crown; in other words, Malta was a republic governed by its own laws; the
                    principal magistrate was named by the king out of three persons proposed by the
                    <hi rend="italic">consilio</hi><hi rend="italic">popolarc,</hi> and was liable
                    to dismissal on complaint by the people. The king protected the island, and in

                    the knights took possession the Maltese stipulated that each grand master on
                    enteriug office should take oath to maintain their ancient rights and liberties
                    (Eton, pp. 38, 85, 101). The knights began by deceiving the Maltese candidates
                    for admission into their ranks. Their rule, at first conciliatory, soon became
                    despotic; in time the overshadowing power of a rich military organization
                    encroached upon the constitutional government, corruption brought the officials
                    under the control of the knights, and the people lost their liberties, though
                    the material prosperity of the islands was in many ways heightened.</p>
                <p>For the history of the order of St John see <hi rend="smallcaps">St John (Knights
                    of).</hi> Twenty-eight successive grand masters, from Lisle d’Adam to Hompesch
                    (1530 to 1798), held the islands. Lisle d’Adam established his convent and
                    hospital in the Borgo, a city that had grown up on the coast near the castle St
                    Angelo, opposite the ancient fort St Elmo. In 1541 was made the first survey for
                    the fortification of Valetta. Ten years later the Turks, led by their famous
                    naval commander Dragut, ravaged Gozo, and made an attempt upon Malta which
                    failed. The knights, already famous for their power at sea, were soon engaged in
                    much skirmishing warfare against the pirates and Turks, winning success and
                    riches, and the gratitude of Christian nations. In 1565, after eight years of
                    threatening preparations, during which the knights had been strengthening and
                    fortifying their island, the Turks besieged them with an immense force; they
                    defended themselves with such valour that it took a month to reduce Fort St
                    Elmo, and in rather over two months more the Turks, whose further advance was
                    successfully resisted, were forced to retire, leaving the knights free to build
                    their new city Valetta and its fortifications. The admiration and gratitude of
                    Catholic countries for this service to Christendom showed itself in liberal
                    donations towards these works; large sums were also raised from the possessions
                    of the order; and Valetta, the first stone of which •was laid on 26th March
                    1566, in four years rose upon the ridge of rock, ‘ <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> a city built by gentlemen for gentlemen,” as it has been well
                    described,—the original design of which, the cutting down the rock to a level
                    platform, had only suffered from the continual fear of molestation by the Turks
                    while building.</p>
                <p>The order, now firmly established in their island, continued to carry out their
                    mission, that of keeping the Mediterranean clear from Turkish and Moorish
                    pirates, and of protecting Christendom against the infidels. Numerous sea-fights
                    took place during the 16th and 17th centuries, many of them undertaken more to
                    make up for the neglect of some of the grand masters to supply the islands with
                    corn, by seizing upon Turkish stores, than for any better reason. Valetta became
                    in consequence “a vast slave mart.” In 1614, under G. Μ. Vignacourt, an aqueduct
                    was constructed at a cost of £13,000 to bring water to Valetta from springs near
                    Citta Vecchia, a work of immense value, and still in use. But the work of
                    fortifying Malta occupied a large share of money an&lt;l attention, and was
                    carried on without relaxation by many of the grand masters, down as late as the
                    building of Fort Tigné in 1793. Besides the great lines and forts in and round
                    Valetta, the knights have left their mark all over the islands: they made good
                    roads, improved Citta Vecchia, built watch-towers round the coasts, and erected
                    towers, country palaces, and gardens. They also established and continually
                    carried on, at Notabile and Valetta, their hospitals for the sick and wounded.
                    In 1768 the Jesuits, having given much trouble, were expelled and their property
                    confiscated. Danger from rebellion twice threatened the knights—in 1722, when
                    the slaves were believed to be in communication with the Turks, and from 1773 to
                    1775, when both people and priests were wrought upon by oppression and
                    misgovernment, which, only mitigated for a time by the better measures of G. Μ.
                    Rohan, led to the weak and disorganized condition of the order that ended in its
                    overthrow. In June 1798, the possessions of the order in France having already
                    been seized by the republicans, Bonaparte on his way to Egypt landed with a
                    large force in a bay behind Valetta; no resistance was made, and in a few hours
                    the French were in possession of the whole of Gozo and Malta except the town of
                    Valetta and one little fort. In four days more, without bombardment, the order
                    had surrendered Valetta and practically ceased to exist. Bonaparte stayed six
                    days, laying down laws and regulations with a high hand, and collecting plunder
                    from churches, &amp;c. He left Vaubois in charge, but in less than three months
                    the Maltese had revolted from the tyranny of their new masters, and Vaubois
                    inside Valetta with 6000 men sustained a siege and blockade lasting two years,
                    during which time Portuguese, Neapolitans, and a small force of English assisted
                    the Maltese. Sir Alexander Ball commanded in the name of the Sicilian king, .and
                    was put at the head of their National Council by the Maltese. On 4th September
                    1800 Vaubois surrendered, and the Maltese (who lost 20,000 men) put themselves
                    and their islands under the protection of the English,—reunion to the crown of
                    Sicily, which they Iιad sought, being no longer thought of. The treaty of Amiens
                    (1802) provided that the islands should be restored to the order of St John,
                    obviously to the advantage of France, but repugnant to the Maltese. War breaking
                    out again, the islands remained in the hands of England till in 1814 they were
                    secured to her by the treaty of Paris (Art. 7), under which she still holds
                    them.</p>
