                    province of Orissa; then the wild highlands of the Central Provinces; next the
                    dominions of the nizâm of Hyderabad; and lastly, on the north-west, the Bombay
                    districts of Dhârwâr and North Kânara. The extreme length from north-east to
                    south-west is about 950 miles, and the breadth 450 miles; the area of the
                    British districts (1879) is 138,856 square miles, and the population in 1871 was
                    31,672,613. The five native states attached to Madras—Travancore, Cochin,
                    Puducottah, Banganapalli, and Sandfir—have an additional area of 9818 square
                    miles, and a population of 3,289,392, making a grand total area of 148,674
                    square miles, with a population of 34,962,005.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">General Aspect.—</hi> From a physical point of view, the Madras
                    presidency may be roughly divided into three tracts —(1) the long and broad east
                    coast, (2) the shorter and narrower west coast, and (3) the high interior
                    table-land. These divisions are determined by the great mountain ranges of the
                    Eastern and Western Ghfits. The Eastern Ghâts form a continuation of the
                    confused hill system of Chutifi Nfigpur. They run in a south-west direction
                    through almost the entire length of Madras until they lose themselves in the
                    Nilgiris, and there join the Western Ghâts. Their average height is only 1500
                    feet, and for the most part they leave a broad expanse of low land between their
                    base and the sea; their line is pierced by three great rivers—the Godâvari,
                    Kistna, and Kâveri (Cauvery). The Western Ghâts stretch continuously along the
                    shore of the Indian Ocean. Rising steeply at a distance of from 30 to 50 miles
                    from the coast, they catch almost the whole rainfall of the monsoon; and within
                    Madras territory not a single stream breaks through their barrier. Some of the
                    peaks attain an elevation of more than 5000 feet. Between these two ranges lies
                    the central table-land, with an elevation of from 1000 to 3000 feet, which
                    includes the whole of Mysore, and extends over about half a dozen districts of
                    Madras. The three principal rivers above-mentioned, each having a large
                    tributary system, all rise in the Western Ghâts, and run across the peninsula in
                    a south-east direction into the Bay of Bengal. In the upper parts of their
                    course they drain rather than water the country through which they flow, and are
                    comparatively valueless either for navigation or for irrigation; but before
                    reaching the sea they spread over alluvial deltas. Other but smaller rivers of
                    the same character are the North and South Pennâr or Ponniyâr, Palar, Vâigai,
                    Vellar, and Tambraparni. The two main hill systems have been already described
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Ghâts,</hi> vol. X. p. 559). The Nilgiris, which join
                    these, culminate in Dodabetta (8640 feet), the loftiest peak in southern India.
                    There are, besides, many outlying spurs and tangled masses of hills, of which
                    the Shevaroys, Anamalais, and the Palnis are the most important. The principal
                    lake in the presidency is that of Puli cat on the east coast, which is 33 miles
                    from north to south, and forms an important means of communication between
                    Madras city and the north districts. On the west coast are a remarkable series
                    of backwaters or lagoons, fringing the seaboard of Kânara, Malabar, and
                    Travancore. The largest is the backwater of Cochin, which extends for a distance
                    of 120 miles from north to south.</p>
                <p>The mineral wealth of the province is as yet undeveloped. Iron of excellent
                    quality has been smelted by native smiths in many localities from time
                    immemorial; but attempts to work the beds after European méthods have hitherto
                    proved unsuccessful. Carboniferous sandstone extends across the Godâvari valley
                    as far as Ellore, but the coal has been found to be of inferior quality.
                    Scientific researches have proved the existence of gold in the Nilgiris, in
                    sufficient quantity to render outlay on it profitable; and several companies,
                    representing a large amount of capital, have been formed for working the mines.
                    Among other minerals may be mentioned manganese in the Nilgiris and Bellary;
                    copper and lead ores in many parts of the Eastern Ghâts; antimony and silver;
                    and corundum in the valley of the Kâveri. Garnets are abundant in the sandstone
                    of the Northern Circars, and diamonds of moderate value are found in the same
                    region. Stone and gravel quarries are very numerous.</p>
                <p>The Forest Department of Madras was first organized in 1856, and it is estimated
                    that forests cover a total area of more than 5000 square miles, the whole of
                    which is under conservancy rules. For supplying fuel to the railways an area of
                    about 160,000 acres is strictly conserved. In the remaining forests, after
                    supplying local wants, timber is either sold direct by the department, or
                    licences are granted to wood-cutters. The more valuable timber-trees comprise
                    teak, ebony, rosewood, sandal-wood, and redwood. The Government plantations
                    cover an area of 9000 acres. The trees thus artificially reared are teak,
                    sandal-wood, <hi rend="italic">Casuarina,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eucalyptus.</hi> The finest teak plantation (over 3000 acres) is near Beypur in
                    Malabar. At Mudumalli there are plantations of both teak and sandalwood; and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Eucalyptus or</hi> Australian gum-tree now grows on the
                    Nilgiris in magnificent clumps. The total value of timber and wood exported was
                    £95,801 in 1875-76, and £122,413 in 1880-81.</p>
                <p>The wild animals are those for the most part common to the rest of India. Those
                    deserving mention are the elephant, bison, sambur, and ibex of the Western Ghâts
                    and the Nilgiris. Bison are also found in the hill tracts of the Northern
                    Circars. In Travancore state the black variety of leopard is not uncommon. In
                    1880-81 182 persons and 11,628 cattle were returned as killed by wild beasts.
                    The number of persons killed by snake-bites in 1880 was 928. The elephant is now
                    protected by law from indiscriminate destruction. The agricultural returns for
                    1880-81 report the number of buffaloes as <pb break="no"

                    goats 2,803,407, sheep 4,082,411, horses 8986, and elephants 532. The cattle are
                    small, but in Nellore and along the Mysore frontier a superior breed is
                    carefully kept up by the wealthier farmers. The best buffaloes are imported from
                    the Bombay district of Dhârwâr. Experiments in sheep breeding have been made at
                    the Saidâpet model farm, with fair success.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The first census, in 1822, returned the
                    population as 13,476,923, and an enumeration in 1866-67 gave 26,539,052. The
                    census of November 1871, however, was the first conducted in regular form. The
                    following table gives the results for the British districts of the presidency.
                    According to the preliminary return the total population at the census in 1871
                    was 30,839,181 (15,242,122 males and 15,597,059 females). This would seem to
                    show that the loss caused by the famine of 1876-78 has been nearly made up.</p>

                <p>Hindus numbered 28,863,978; Mohammedans, 1,857,857; Christians, 533,760; Jains,
                    21,254; and “others,” 4328. The Hindus (92 ∙3 per cent, of the whole) are
                    subdivided into 16,159,610 Sivaites, 11,657,311 Vishnuvites, 154,989 Lingâyats,
                    and 892,068 “others,” including hill tribes. The Sivaites are most numerous in
                    the extreme south and on the west coast, while the Vishnuvites are chiefly found
                    in the northern districts. The Lingâyats may be described as a sect of Sivaite
                    puritans, who derive their name from their practice of carrying about on their
                    persons the <hi rend="italic">lingà</hi> or emblem of Siva. Of Hindu castes,
                    Brahmans number 1,094,455. They follow various pursuits, and many of them are
                    said to be recent immigrants, who came south in the train of the Mahratta
                    armies. A peculiar caste of Brahmans, called Namburi, is found in Malabar, who
                    are said to be descended from fishermen. The Kshattriyas, or warrior caste of
                    the ancient Hindu organization, number only 190,415. The three trading castes of
                    Chettis, Beri Chettis, and Komatis number 714,712, and except in Kânara district
                    still retain in their hands nearly all the commerce of the country. Agricultural
                    castes number 7,826,127; the highest classes among them do not cultivate with
                    their own hands, and many of them formerly held their lands on a military
                    tenure. The pastoral castes number 1,730,681, buta large proportion of them have
                    now abandoned their hereditary occupation. Artisans number 785,085, of whom
                    nearly one-half are workers in metal. Weavers number 1,017,781, but their
                    industry is now decayed owing to Manchester competition. The labouring castes
                    are returned at 3,944,463. Fishing and hunting castes number 971,837, but many
                    have now betaken themselves to agriculture. The palm cultivators and toddy
                    makers amount to 1,664,862. Out-castes (Pariahs) number 4,761,503; in the
                    country round Madras they form about one-quarter of the total population. Up to
                    the close of the last century they lived in a state of slavery to the superior
                    castes; and they are still compelled by custom to live in separate hovels
                    outside the boundary of the village, and to perform all menial services. They
                    are described as a laborious, frugal, pleasure-loving people, omnivorous in
                    diet, and capable of performing much hard work. Unclassified Hindus (2,666,890)
                    consist of aboriginal hill races and wandering tribes. Numerically the most
                    important are the Kandhs and Sauras, two cognate races who inhabit the
                    mountainous tracts of the Eastern Ghats attached to several of the large <hi
                    rend="italic">zamindâris</hi> of Ganjâm and Vizagapatam. On the Nilgiris, the
                    aboriginal tribe best known to Europeans is the Todas, a stalwart, haughty race,
                    who domineer over the more timid jungle folk, and confine themselves to the
                    pastuπng of buffaloes. It is believed that the Todas are now dying out, for in
                    1871 they numbered only 693. The principal wandering tribes are the Brinjaris
                    and Lambadis, who are to be found in all parts of the country as carriers of
                    grain and salt.</p>
                <p>The Mohammedans are thus subdivided:—Sunnis, 1,654,529; Shias, 69,302; Wahhabis,
                    3954; unspecified, 130,072. A more familiar division is a race one :—Labbay,
                    Mopla, Arab, Shaikh, Sayyid, Pathân, and Mughal. The Labbays (312,088) are the
                    descendants of Hindu converts, and are traders by hereditary occupation,
                    although many now employ themselves as sailors and fishermen. The Moplas
                    (612,789) are the descendants of Malayalam converts to Islam,—the head of the
                    tribe, the raja of Kanamir, being descended from a fisher family in Malabar.
                    They are a hardworking, frugal people, but quite uneducated and very fanatical,
                    and under the influence of religious excitement have often disturbed the public
                    peace. The Shaikhs number 511,112, the Sayyids 89,219, the Pathâns 70,943, and
                    the Mughals 12,407.</p>
                <p>Christians are more numerous in Madras than in any other part of India. They
                    number in the British districts 533,760, of whom 40,879 are Europeans or
                    Eurasians, and the remainder native converts; Roman Catholics number 397,071,
                    and Protestants 93,228. In Travancore and Cochin states the native Christians
                    are still more numerous, constituting as much as one-fourth of the population.
                    The Roman Catholics, whose number throughout southern India is estimated at
                    upwards of 650,000, owe their origin to St Francis Xavier, and the famous Jesuit
                    mission of Madura; they are partly under the authority of the archbishop of Goa,
                    and parti; under twelve Jesuit vicariates. Protestant missions date from the
                    beginning of the last century. The Danes were the pioneers; .but their work was
                    taken up by the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, under whom laboured
                    the great Lutherans of the last century—Schultz, Sartorius, Fabricius, and
                    Schwartz. The Church Missionary Society entered the field in 1814; and
                    subsequently an American mission joined in the work. The total number of
                    Protestant native Christians in southern India (British and native) in 1878 was
                    296,408.</p>
                <p>Urban life may be said to be more highly developed in Madras than in Bengal or
                    Bombay. Populous cities, indeed, are not numerous, but there is an unusual
                    proportion of towns with from 2000 to 20,000 inhabitants. The six cities with a
                    population of more than 50,000 are—Madras city (1871), 397,552; Trichinopoli,
                    76,530; Tanjore, 52,175; Madura, 51,987; Bellary, 51,766; Salem, 50,012.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> Over the greater part of the area of Madras
                    artificial irrigation is impossible, and cultivation is dependent upon the local
                    rainfall, which rarely exceeds 40 inches a year, and is liable to fall
                    irregularly. The Malabar coast is the only part where the rainfall brought by
                    the south-west monsoon may be trusted both for its amount and regularity. Other
                    districts, such as Bellary, are also dependent upon this monsoon, but in their
                    case the rain clouds have spent themselves in passing over the Western Ghats,
                    and cultivation becomes a matter of hazard. Over the greater part of the
                    presidency the rainy season is caused by the south-east monsoon, which breaks
                    about the end of September. The deltas of the Godavari, Kistna, and Kaveri
                    rivers are the only spots on the east coast which artificial irrigation is able
                    to save from risk of occasional scarcity. Of the total cultivated area about 80
                    per cent, is returned as “dry” land, or that which is solely dependent upon
                    local rainfall; 15 per cent, as “wet” land, irrigated from river channels; 2 per
                    cent, as garden land irrigated from wells; and about 3 per cent, fallow and
                    pasture. The principal food staples are rice, <hi rend="italic">cholam, kambu,
                    ragi,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">varagu.</hi> The most common oilseed is
                    gingelly. Garden crops comprise tobacco, sugar-cane, chillies, betel-leaf, and
                    plantains. The fruit trees are cocoa-nut, areca-nut, date and palmyra palm,
                    jack, tamarind, and mango. Special crops include cotton, indigo, coffee, tea,
                    cinchona. The principal coffee tract stretches along the slopes of the Western
                    Ghats from the north of Mysore almost down to Cape Comorin. The larger portion
                    of this area lies within Mysore, Coorg, and Travancore states, but Wainâd and
                    the Nilgiri hills are within Madras. The first coffee plantation was opened in
                    the Wainâd in 1840. Many of the early clearings proved unprofitable, and the
                    enterprise made little progress till about 1855, in which year the total exports
                    were 32,000 cwts. Coffee, which is much cultivated on the Nilgiris, now covers
                    in the whole presidency 131,348 acres. The tea plant was also introduced into
                    the Nilgiri hills about 1840, but was not taken up as a commercial speculation
                    till 1865. The area under tea is over 4000 acres, and the exports in 1880-81
                    were 263,940 lb. The cinchona plant was successfully introduced into the Nilgiri
                    hills by Government in 1860. In 1880-81 847 acres were under cultivation;
                    1,087,637 plants were raised; and the receipts of sales were £39,618, the amount
                    in 1875-76 being only £4989. Tobacco is extensively grown in Godavari and Kistna
                    districts. The greater part of the soil in Madras is held by the cultivators
                    direct from Government under the tenure known as <hi rend="italic"

                    these lands in the hands of the Government, there are also proprietary or <hi
                    rend="italic">zamin∙ dAri</hi> estates in all parts of the country. These
                    estates are either the remains of ancient principalities, which the holder
                    cannot sell or encumber beyond his own life interest, or they are creations of
                    British rule and subject to the usual Hindu custom of partition. The total area
                    of the <hi rend="italic">zamindari</hi> estates is about 21 million acres, or
                    one-fourth of the whole presidency. The <hi rend="italic">pcshkash</hi> or
                    tribute payable to Government in perpetuity amounts to about £500,000 a year.
                    <hi rend="italic">InAms,</hi> revenue-free or quit-rent grants of lands made for
                    religious endowments or for services rendered to the state, occupy an aggregate
                    area of a little over 1,500,000 acres.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> Madras possesses few staple manufactures.
                    The preparation of the coffee berry for export constitutes the one great
                    business carried on by means of European capital and under European supervision.
                    Indigo is manufactured in considerable quantities, but of inferior quality. The
                    more important of the large manufactories are three cotton mills in Madras, a
                    weaving establishment maintained by the Basel mission in South Kanara, sugar
                    works in Ganjâm and South Arcot, and a jute factory at Vizagapatam. Up to the
                    close of the last century cotton goods constituted the main article of export.
                    Masulipatam, where the first English factory on the Coromandel coast was
                    established in 1620, enjoyed a special reputation for its chintzes, which were
                    valued for the freshness and permanency of their dyes. There is still a small
                    demand for these articles in Burmah, the Straits, and the Persian Gulf; but
                    Manchester goods have nearly beaten the Indian exporter out of the field. Native
                    looms, however, still hold their own in the local market, in face of strenuous
                    opposition. After weaving, working in metals appears to be the most widespread
                    native industry. Among local specialities which have attracted European
                    curiosity may be mentioned the jewellery of Trichinopoli, ornaments of ivory and
                    horn worked at Vizagapatam, and sandal-wood carving at Kanara. The manufacture
                    and sale of salt is a Government monopoly, carried on under close supervision.
                    The process employed is solar evaporation, and the entire eastern coast-line
                    from Orissa to Cape Comorin affords natural facilities for the industry. The
                    preparation of arrack and toddy spirit is also a Government monopoly. On the
                    Nilgiri hills and at Bellary country beer is manufactured by European firms
                    subject to an excise duty of 6d. per gallon.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways.—</hi> Two guaranteed railway companies, the Madras
                    and the South Indian, have their lines almost entirely within the presidency.
                    The Madras Railway, which connects at Râichur with the Great Indian Peninsular
                    system, runs south-east to Madras, and then west across the peninsula to Beypur,
                    with branches to Bellary and Bangalore. The total length open in 1881 was 858
                    miles; the capital expended, £10,441,699; the net profits £177,433, giving a
                    dividend of 1 ’ 7 per cent, on the capital expended. The South Indian Railway
                    (narrow guage) runs north from Tuticorin to Madras. In 1881 the total length was
                    658 miles; the capital expended, £4,291,311; and the net profits yielded a
                    dividend of 2‘9 per cent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce and Trade.—</hi> The continuous seaboard of the Madras
                    presidency, without any natural harbours of the first rank, has tended to create
                    a widely diffused trade. Madras city conducts nearly one-half of the total
                    sea-borne commerce; next comes Malabar, containing the western railway terminus
                    near Calicut; then Godavari, with its cluster of ports along the fringe of the
                    delta; Tinnevelli, with the new harbour at Tuticorin, which has opened large
                    dealings with Ceylon; Tanjore, South Kànara, Ganjam, and Vizagapatam in the
                    order given. The total foreign trade in 1880-81 was as follows. The imports
                    amounted to £6,518,783, of which cotton piece goods and twist made up
                    £2,908,379, grain £158,144, and apparel £147,691. The exports amounted to
                    £9,271,345, the chief items being—coffee, £1,393,000; raw cotton, £939,127;
                    hides and skins, £1,261,182; rice, £996,314; seeds, £708,390; indigo, £693,103;
                    spices, £379,282; oils, £372,119; sugar, £301,670. The total number of vessels
                    engaged in foreign trade that cleared and entered Madras ports in 1880-81 was
                    6247, with a tonnage of 1,177,337; the coasting trade was conducted by 11,316
                    vessels, with 3,748,474 tons, for ports outside Madras presidency, and 24,057
                    vessels, with 3,092,286 tons, for ports within the presidency. The importance of
                    this active coasting trade may be gathered from the fact that in 1876-77 (the
                    first year of the late famine) the imports of grain suddenly rose to 652,850
                    tons, by far the greater part consisting of rice from Bengal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The supreme executive authority is vested
                    in the governor, with a council of three members, of whom one is the
                    commander-in-chief; the others belong to the covenanted civil service. For
                    legislative purposes this council is increased by the presence of the
                    advocate-general and from four to eight other members nominated by the governor,
                    of whom not less than one-half must be non-officials. The local administration
                    is organized with the district or <hi rend="italic">zilA</hi> as its unit. Of
                    these districts there are twenty-one in all, including the Nilgiris and Madras
                    city, both of which occupy an exceptional position. Each of the remaining
                    districts is under the jurisdiction of a collector-magistrate and a sessions
                    judge. Beneath the collector-magistrate come deputy collectors, sub-collectors,
                    and assistants. Each district is subdivided into <hi rend="italic">Muks,</hi>
                    numbering one hundred and fifty-six in all, under the charge of a <hi
                    rend="italic">tahsildAr.</hi> Each <hi rend="italic">taluk</hi> comprises from
                    fifty to one hundred villages,, which constitute the ultimate units for fiscal
                    and administrative purposes. The hereditary village officials, to be found in
                    almost every Hindu village, are employed to perform minor public offices,
                    revenue and judicial, and are inadequately remunerated either by fees in grain
                    and other cesses levied from the villagers, or by a reduction in their land
                    assessment. The heads of villages and village accountants <hi rend="italic"
                    >(karnam)</hi> collect and account for all revenue, rates, and taxes within
                    their respective villages or townships.</p>
                <p>Local and municipal administration, including roads and communications, schools
                    and primary education, public health and local endowments, together with special
                    taxation levied for any of these purposes, is provided for by special
                    legislation passed in 1871. Entire districts or, where these are of unmanageable
                    size, parts of districts have been constituted local fund circles, each under
                    the management of a board of commissioners, of which the collector is <hi
                    rend="italic">ex officio</hi> president, and the district engineer, medical
                    officer, and one or more civil officers are official members. With them are
                    associated at least an equal number of native non-official gentlemen, appointed
                    by Government. To these boards is entrusted the entire management of the local
                    interests above named, subject to the submission of an annual budget for the
                    sanction of Government, and of a report of the board’s transactions at the close
                    of each year. The twenty-one districts of the presidency comprise thirty-five
                    such local fund circles. The sources of income at the disposal of these boards
                    are a grant from provincial funds, a special land rate not exceeding one <hi
                    rend="italic">anna</hi> in the rupee of the Government assessment, tolls, school
                    fees, local endowments, and other minor special funds. Municipal administration
                    of the larger towns is provided for by boards of town commissioners, constituted
                    similarly to the local boards as regards official and non-official members,
                    except that, with the consent of Government, the latter may be elected by the
                    ratepayers. Besides the above-named local interests, the commissioners manage
                    the local sanitation and hospitals of the towns, registration of births and
                    deaths, lighting, and police. About fifty towns, including Madras city, with an
                    aggregate population of 1,500,000, are provided with municipal administration,
                    and the number is steadily increasing. Tire funds at the disposal of the
                    commissioners consist of rates on houses and lands, a tax on professions and
                    trades, a wheel and animal tax, tolls and ferries, school and markest fees,
                    &amp;c. Under the administration of these local and municipal boards great
                    impulse has been given to the development of roads, education, and hospitals and
                    dispensaries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Revenue and Expenditure.—</hi> Down to 1871 every branch of
                    revenue and expenditure throughout India was managed in all details by the
                    Government of India. Under the decentralization scheme of that year the
                    financial administration of the jail, police, and educational services, together
                    with certain branches of the medical, sanitary, and other minor services, were
                    transferred to the Government of Madras, and a grant of a single fixed sum from
                    the imperial funds was assigned for their maintenance. The local fund boards,
                    described above, were constituted in the same year, and the municipal
                    administration improved. The provincial expenditure is almost entirely met by a
                    grant from imperial funds; and the local receipts benefit in a similar way by a
                    subsidy from the imperial budget. The following figures show the revenue and
                    expenditure under each head of finance for the year 1880-81, exclusive of the
                    charges under the heads of army, interest, and imperial public works. (1)
                    Imperial: total revenue, £8,526,451, of which about one-half, £4,284,335, is
                    derived from the land revenue, and £1,433,974 from salt; expenditure,
                    £3,478,655. (2) Provincial: total revenue, £955,162, of which £781,990 forms the
                    allotment from the imperial funds; expenditure, £971,011,—the main items being
                    police, £376,356; law and justice, £105,962; public works, £142,187; education,
                    £90,875. (3) Unfettered local funds: receipts, £24,768; charges, £19,628. (4)
                    Fettered local funds: income, £748,315; expenditure, £729,746. (5) Municipal:
                    total revenue, £137,364; expenditure, £129,525. The gross revenue of the
                    presidency was £9,030,152, and the expenditure £6,893,960.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Army.—</hi> The Madras army garrisons, besides the whole of
                    Madras proper, the adjoining state of Mysore, the Nizam’s Dominions, the Central
                    Provinces, and British Burmah; a regiment is also usually stationed at Dorunda
                    in the Chutia Nagpur division of Bengal, and another at Cuttack in Orissa. The
                    entire force consists of 1 regiment of European cavalry, 19 batteries of
                    European artillery, and 8 regiments of European infantry, with 1 company of
                    native sappers and miners, 4 regiments of native cavalry, and 40 regiments of
                    native infantry. In 1880-81 the European force numbered 10,229, and the native
                    army 30,958 of all ranks. The military expenditure charged against Madras in
                    1880-81 was £2,722,105. The principal cantonments are Kâmpti, Secunderabad,
                    Bangalore, Bellary, and Rangoon. St Thomas’s Mount near Madras city is an
                    important station for artillery. The two military sanatariums <pb break="no"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Administrative Statistics.—</hi> An early task of the English
                    administration was the repression of the system of black mail levied by bands of
                    Kavilgârs, which was not fully extinguished for many γears. By a Government
                    regulation in 1866 the village police was placed under the head of the village,
                    and became practically the most useful (although a somewhat dishonest) agency of
                    the magistrate in the police administration. The Madras police force was
                    organized in its present form in 1860. In March 1881 it consisted of a total
                    strength of 26,415 officers and men, maintained at a cost of £364,233. In 1880
                    the total number of prisoners passing through the jails in the presidency was
                    27,708,—considerably less than during and after the famine; the daily average
                    number of prisoners was 12,202. Education was afforded in 1880-81 by 12,878
                    schools, attended by 327,808 pupils; the expenditure was £284,873, of which
                    £86,641 was contributed by the state. The chief educational institutions are the
                    Madras university, the provincial college of Combaconum, the Madras Christian
                    college, the Doveton Protestant college, S. P. G. high' school at Tanjore,
                    medical college, civil engineering college, Lawrence asylum, school of
                    agriculture, school of ordnance artificers and school of arts, and the military
                    orphanage at Utakamand in memory of the late Sir Henry Lawrence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Health.—</hi> The climate varies in different parts
                    of the presidency, being determined by the very diverse geographical conditions.
                    The Nilgiri hills enjoy the climate of the temperate zone, with a moderate
                    rainfall, and a thermometer rarely exceeding 80° F., and sometimes falling to
                    the freezing-point. On the Malabar coast the south-west monsoon brings an
                    excessive rainfall, reaching 150 inches in the year at certain spots. The rain
                    clouds hanging on the slope of the Western Ghats sometimes obscure the sun for
                    month after month. Along the eastern coast and on the central table-lands the
                    rainfall is comparatively low, but the heat of the summer months is excessive.
                    At Masulipatam the thermometer frequently rises to above 110° F. in the shade.
                    The whole coast of the Bay of Bengal is liable to disastrous cyclones, which not
                    only wreck the shipping in the roads, but have repeatedly overwhelmed the
                    low-lying ports. The most prevalent diseases are fevers, diarrhoea, dysentery,
                    and other bowel complaints, cholera, and small-pox.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Until the English conquest the whole of southern
                    India had never acknowledged a single ruler. The difficult nature of the hill
                    passes and the warlike character of the highland tribes forbade the growth of
                    great empires, such as succeeded one another on the plains of Hindustan. The
                    Tamil country in the extreme south is traditionally divided between the three
                    kingdoms of Pandya, Chola, and Chera. The west coast supplied the nucleus of a
                    monarchy which afterwards extended over the highlands of Mysore, and took its
                    name from the Carnatic. On the north-east the kings of Kalinga at one time ruled
                    over the entire line of seaboard from the Krishna to the Ganges. Hindu legend
                    has preserved marvellous stories of these early dynasties, but our only
                    authentic evidence consists in their inscriptions on stone and brass, and their
                    noble architecture. The Mohammedan invader first established himself in the
                    south in the beginning of the 14th century. Ala∙uddin, the second monarch of the
                    Khilji dynasty at Delhi, and his general Malik Kafur conquered the Deccan, and
                    overthrew the kingdoms of Karnataka and Telingana, which were then the most
                    powerful in southern India. But after the withdrawal of the Musalmân armies the
                    native monarchy of Vijayanagar arose out of the ruins. This dynasty gradually
                    extended its dominions from sea to sea, and reached a pitch of prosperity before
                    unknown. At last, in 1565, it was overwhelmed by a combination of the four
                    Mohammedan principalities of the Deccan. At the close of the reign of Aurangzeb,
                    although that emperor nominally extended his sovereignty as far as Cape Comorin,
                    in reality South India had again fallen under a number of rulers who owned no
                    regular allegiance. The nizam of the Deccan, himself an independent sovereign,
                    represented the distant court of Delhi. The most powerful of his feudatories was
                    the nawab of the Carnatic, with his capital at Arcot. In Tanjore, a descendant
                    of Si'vaji ruled; and on the central table-land a Hindu chieftain was gradually
                    establishing his authority and founding the state of Mysore, destined soon to
                    pass to a Mohammedan usurper.</p>
                <p>Vasco da Gama cast anchor off Calicut on the 20th May 1498, and for a century the
                    Portuguese retained in their control the commerce of India. The Dutch began to
                    establish themselves on the ruin of the Portuguese at the beginning of the 17th
                    century, and were quickly followed by the English, who established themselves at
                    Calicut and Cranganore in 1616. Tellicherri became the principal British
                    emporium on the west coast of Madras. The Portuguese eventually retired to Goa,
                    and the Dutch to the Spice Islands. The first English settlement on the east
                    coast was in 1620, at Masulipatam, eventhen celebrated for its fabrics. Farther
                    south a factory, the nucleus of Madras city, was erected in 1639. Pondicherri
                    was purchased by the French in 1762. For many years the English and French
                    traders lived peacefully side by side, and with no ambition for territorial
                    aggrandisement. The war of the Austrian succession in Europe lit the first flame
                    of hostility on the Coromandel coast. In 1746 Madras was forced to surrender to
                    Labotιrdonnais, and Fort St David remained the only British possession in
                    southern India. By the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle Madras was restored to the
                    English; but from this time the rivalry of the two nations was keen, and found
                    its opportunities in the disputed successions which always fill a large place in
                    Oriental politics. English influence was generally able to secure the favour of
                    the rulers of the Carnatic and Tanjore, while the French succeeded in placing
                    their own nominee on the throne at Hyderabad. At last Dupleix rose to be the
                    temporary arbiter of the fate of southern India, but he was overthrown by Clive,
                    whose defence of Arcot in 1751 forms the turning point in Indian history. In
                    1760 the crowning victory of Wandewash was won by Colonel (afterwards Sir Eyre)
                    Coote, over Lally, and in the following year, despite help from Mysore,
                    Pondicherri was captured.</p>
                <p>Though the English had no longer any European rival, they had yet to deal with
                    Mohammedan fanaticism and the warlike population of the highlands of Mysore. The
                    dynasty founded by Hyder Ali, and terminating in his son Tipιi Sultan, proved
                    itself in four several wars, which terminated only in 1799, the most formidable
                    antagonist which the English had ever encountered (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hyder Ali</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">India).</hi> Since the beginning of the
                    present century Madras has known no regular war, but occasional disturbances
                    have called for measures of repression. The <hi rend="italic">pâlegârs</hi> or
                    local chieftains long clung to their independence after their country was ceded
                    to the British. On the west coast, the feudal aristocracy of the N airS, and the
                    religious fanaticism of the Moplas, have more than once led to rebellion and
                    bloodshed. In the extreme north, the wild tribes occupying the hills of Ganjam
                    and Vizagapatam have only lately learned the habit of subordination. In 1836 the
                    <hi rend="italic">zaminddri</hi> of Gumsur in this remote tract was attached by
                    Government for the rebellious conduct of its chief. An inquiry then instituted
                    revealed the wide prevalence among the tribe of Kandhs of human sacrifice, under
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">meriah.</hi> The practice has since been
                    suppressed by a special agency.</p>
                <p>The different territories comprising the Madras presidency have been acquired by
                    the British at various dates. In 1763 the tract encircling Madras city, now
                    Chengalpat district, was ceded by the nawâb of Arcot. In 1765 the Northern
                    Circars, out of which the French had recently been driven, were granted to the
                    Company by the Mughal emperor, bût at the price of an annual tribute of £90,000.
                    Full rights of dominion were not acquired till 1823, when the tribute was
                    commuted for a lump payment. In 1792 Tipu was compelled to cede the Baramahal
                    (now part of Salem district), Malabar, and Dindigal subdivision of Madura. In
                    1799, on the reconstruction of Mysore state after Tipιi ’ s death, Coimbatore
                    and Kanara were appropriated as the British share; and in the same year the
                    Mahratta raja of Tanjore resigned the administration of his territory, though
                    his descendant retained titular rank till 1855. In 1800 Bellary and Cuddapah
                    were made over by the nizam of Hyderabad to defray the expense of an increased
                    subsidiary force. In the following year the dominions of the nawab of the
                    Carnatic, extending along the east coast almost continuously from Nellore to
                    Tinnevelli, were resigned into the hands of the British by a puppet who had been
                    put upon the throne for the purpose. The last titular nawab of the Carnatic died
                    in 1855; but his representative still bears the title of prince of Arcot, and is
                    recognized as the first native nobleman in Madras. In 1838 the nawab of Karnιil
                    was deposed for misgovernment and suspicion of treason, and his territories
                    annexed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Madras,</hi> capital of Madras presidency, is situated on
                    the sea-coast in 13° 4' 8" N. 1at., 80° 14' 5Γ'E. long. Although at first sight
                    the city presents a disappointing appearance, and possesses not a single
                    handsome street, it has several edifices of high architectural pretensions, and
                    many spots of historical interest. Seen from the roadstead, the fort, a row of
                    merchants’ offices, a few spires and public buildings, are all that strike the
                    eye. Roughly speaking, it consists of the following divisions. (1) Black Town,
                    an ill-built, densely populated block, about a mile square, is the business part
                    of the town, and contains the banks, custom house, high court, and all the
                    mercantile offices. The last, for the most part handsome structures, lie along
                    the beach. On the sea-face of Black Town are the pier and the new harbour.
                    Immediately south of Black Town there is (2) an open space which contains the
                    fort, esplanade, brigade parade ground, Government house, and several handsome
                    public buildings on the sea-face. (3) West and south of this lung of the city
                    come a series of crowded quarters known by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n205/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0205-0188"/> various native names—Chintadrapet,
                    Tiruvaleswarampet, Pudupák, Royapet. Kistnampet, and Mylapur, which bend to the
                    sea again at the old town of Saint Thomé. (4) To the west of Black Town are the
                    quarters of Veperi and Pudupet, chiefly inhabited by Eurasians, and the suburbs
                    of Egmore, Nangambákam, and Perambúr, adorned with <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n206/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0206-0189"/> handsome European mansions and their spacious
                    “compounds” or parks. (5) South-west and south lie the European quarters of
                    Tanampet and aristocratic Adyar. Amongst the buildings most deserving of notice
                    for their architectural features are the cathedral, Scotch church, Government
                    house, Patcheappah’s hall, senate house, Chepauk palace (now the Revenue Board),
                    and the Central Railway station.</p>
                <p>Nearly all the most important offices of the presidency, and the headquarters of
                    every department, are located in Madras. Apart from the headquarters staff of
                    the Madras army, that of the central division is also stationed here, with a
                    garrison of 1 European and 3 native infantry regiments, 1 battery of artillery,
                    and the bodyguard of the governor (100 sabres). At St Thomas’s Mount are 3
                    batteries of artillery and a detachment of native infantry. Including these, the
                    garrison of Madras is about 3500 strong, of whom 1200 are Europeans.</p>
                <p>The population of Madras city, as ascertained by the census of 1871, was 397,552,
                    including 330,062 Hindus, 50,964 Mohammedans, 12,013 Eurasians, and 3613
                    Europeans. The annual municipal income is about X5 3,000. Madras,
                    notwithstanding its exposed situation, ranks third among the ports of India in
                    respect of the number and tonnage of vessels calling and the value of its
                    imports and exports. The port trades with every part of the world, exporting
                    coffee, cotton, grain, hides, indigo, oilseeds, dyes, sugar, and horns, and
                    importing piece goods, iron and other metals, and all kinds of European
                    manufactures. The lighthouse, 125 feet high, is visible from a ship’s deck 15
                    miles at sea. The Madras roadstead, like the whole line of the western coast of
                    India, is liable to be swept by hurricanes of irresistible fury, which occur at
                    irregular intervals of years, generally at the beginning of the monsoons in May
                    and October. The first recorded cyclone was in October 1746, a few weeks after
                    the fort had surrendered to Labourdonnais. A French fleet then lay at anchor in
                    the roads. Five large ships foundered, with 1200 men on board; and scarcely a
                    single vessel escaped with its masts standing. Perhaps the most destructive of
                    these storms occurred in May 1872. On this occasion the registered wind pressure
                    reached a maximum of 53 0&gt; to the square foot. In the space of a few hours
                    nine English vessels and twenty native craft were driven ashore. In May 1874
                    another cyclone broke on the Madras coast, but the ships were warned in time to
                    put to sea and gain an offing. The most recent of these periodical hurricanes
                    occurred in November 1881, when the new harbour works sustained serious
                    damage.</p>
                <p>The trade of the town does not depend on any special local manufactures or
                    produce. Such industries as once flourished—weaving, for instance—have decayed,
                    and no others have grown up to replace them. As elsewhere in India, spinning
                    companies have recently been formed, but what effect they are likely to exercise
                    on local trade remains to be seen. With the exception of banks, and enterprises
                    connected with the preparation of produce for export, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> y</hi> cotton-pressing and
                    coffee-cleaning, joint-stock undertakings have not prospered. As the capital of
                    southern India, Madras is the centre on which all the great military roads
                    converge. It is also the terminal station of two lines of railway, the Madras
                    line and the Madras and Tanjore section of the South Indian Railway.</p>
                <p>The Buckingham Canal, which passes through an outlying part of the city, connects
                    South Arcot district with Nellore and the Krishna and Godâvari system of canal
                    navigation. This long delayed project was undertaken as a famine work.</p>
                <p>The town of Madras dates from 1639, when Francis Day, chief of the East India
                    Company’s settlement at Armagon, obtained a grant of the present site of the
                    city from the raja of Chandragiri. A factory, with some slight fortifications,
                    was at once constructed, and a gradually increasing population settled around
                    its walls. In 1653 Madras, which had previously been subordinate to the
                    settlement of Bantam in Java, was raised to the rank of an independent
                    presidency. In 1702 Dâùd Khan, Aurangzeb’s general, blockaded the town for a few
                    weeks, and in 1741 the Mahrattas unsuccessfully attacked the place. In 1746
                    Labourdonnais bombarded and captured the fort. The settlement was restored to
                    the English two years later by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, but the government
                    of the presidency did not return to Madras till 1762. In 1758 the French under
                    Lally occupied the Black Town, and invested the fort The siege was conducted on
                    both sides with great skill and vigour. After two months, the arrival of a
                    British fleet relieved the garrison, and the besiegers retired with some
                    precipitancy. With the exception of the threatening approach of Hyder Ali’s
                    horsemen in 1769, and again in 1780, Madras has since the French siege been free
                    from external attack. The town of Saint Thome, now part of Madras city, was
                    founded and fortified by the Portuguese in 1504, and was held by the French from
                    1672 to 1674.</p>
