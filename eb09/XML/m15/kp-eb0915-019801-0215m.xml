                    surface of 82 square miles, 65 belong to Italy, and the remaining* 17 to the
                    Swiss canton of Tessin or Ticino. The length from north to south, between 45’
                    43' and 46° 10' N. lat., is 38 miles; the breadth, generally between 2 and 4
                    miles, is increased to 6 or 7 at the junction of the Toce valley on the west.
                    The Ticino, the leading tributary of the Po, enters at the one end of the lake
                    and escapes at the other. The very interesting geological problems which Lago
                    Maggiore suggests are not yet fully cleared up. (See Taramelli, <hi

                    the geological map of Switzerland.) The whole of the west side and the east side
                    as far south as Vai Travaglia are shut in by a region of gneiss and schists,
                    while the remaining portion presents dolomites, calcareous rocks, and
                    conglomerates, mingled with strongly developed moraines. On Dufour’s great map
                    of Switzerland the greatest depth is given as 2801 feet, opposite Pino; but this
                    is probably much in excess, as in G. B. Maggi’s topographical map of the lake
                    (Turin, 1857) the highest figure registered along the medial line ‘is only 1233
                    feet between Barbe and Lavello, and at the laying of a telegraph line in 1860
                    Salis found no more than 337 between Vira and Locarno. The ordinary height of
                    the surface above the sea is about 640 feet. Between the lowest and highest
                    water-mark, however, there is a difference in ordinary years of nearly 12 feet,
                    and in very exceptional cases of twice as much. For not only is the Ticino
                    subject to floods, but the lake receives a number of considerable streams (the
                    Toce, the Maggia, the Verzasca, the Tresa, &amp;c.), and some of these bring
                    down the surplus waters of other lakes— Lugano, Varese, and Orta. The flood of
                    1868, which exceeded by about 6 feet the greatest that had been known for
                    centuries, so deepened and enlarged the outlet of the river that the level of
                    the lake was permanently reduced by about a foot and a half, and alterations had
                    to be made at the various ports to suit the new condition of things. (See Paolo
                    Gallizia in <hi rend="italic">Atti del Coll, degli Ingegn. ed Archit. in
                    Milano,</hi> 1879.) At least twenty-three species of fish are caught in Lago
                    Maggiore; and the fisheries are of value enough to be closely preserved by the
                    proprietors.</p>
                <p>The principal towns and villages round the lake are the following,—the first
                    being in Switzerland, and the others in Italy:—Locarno (population in 1880,
                    2645), at the mouth of the Maggia, one of the alternate capitals of the canton
                    of Ticino; Cannobio (2000), famous from the 15th century for its tanneries, and
                    with paper-mills and silkworks; Luino (2000), the original home of the Luini
                    family, and the scene of one of Garibaldi’s exploits in 1867, commemorated on
                    the spot by a statue of the victor; Laveno (1500), formerly an Austrian naval
                    harbour; Intra (4500), a busy manufacturing town—cotton, glass, silk, &amp;c.;
                    and Pallanza (4200), a flourishing little city with a large cathedral, a
                    penitentiary, &amp;c., and altogether· the most important place on the lake. The
                    celebrated <hi rend="smallcaps">Bor-komean Islands,</hi> lying off Pallanza,
                    have been already described, vol. iv. p. 64; compare Medone, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le isole</hi><hi rend="italic">Borro-mee,</hi> with views by Falkenstein
                    (Novara, 1840). As the St Gotthard and St Bernardino routes meet at Bellinzona,
                    much of the trade between Italy and the north used to pass by way of the lake
                    and the high roads that skirt its banks; and the opening of the St Gotthard
                    railway, which joins the Italian system at Pino on the east side, and goes as
                    far as Locarno on the west side, will bring back some of the traffic which the
                    earlier railways diverted into other channels. The first steamboat was launched
                    on the lake in 1826.</p>
