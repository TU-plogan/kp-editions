                    the other, inclining however on the whole decidedly in favour of Rome, so much
                    so indeed as to be spoken of by Roman orators and historians as “a most faithful
                    ally of the Roman people.” He was the son of a Numidian king or chief, Gala,
                    whose dominions coincided with the eastern portions of Numidia, and thus
                    bordered on Carthaginian territory, or what is now Tunis. He was educated, like
                    many of the Numidian chiefs, at Carthage, learnt Latin and Greek, it is said,
                    and was in short an accomplished as well as a naturally clever man. Although his
                    kingdom was nominally independent of Carthage, it really stood to it in a
                    relation of vassalage; it was directly under Carthaginian influences, and was
                    imbued to a very considerable extent with Carthaginian civilization. It was to
                    this that Masinissa owed his fame and success; he was a barbarian at heart, but
                    he had a varnish of culture, and to this he added the craft and cunning in which
                    Carthaginian statesmen were supposed to excel. While yet a young man, he drove
                    his neighbour Syphax, prince of western Numidia, out of the country now known as
                    Algiers, and forced him to fly to the Moors in the extreme west of Africa. Soon
                    afterwards he appears in Spain, fighting for Carthage with a large force of
                    Numidian cavalry against the Romans under the two Scipios. The defeat of the
                    Carthaginian army in 206 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.,</hi> which for a time at
                    least gave the Romans complete mastery of the south of Spain, led him to desert
                    his old allies and to cast in his lot with the fortunes of Rome. The famous
                    Scipio Africanus is said to have cultivated his friendship <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n638/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0638-0609"/> and done all he could to secure his services for
                    his country. Masinissa now quitted Spain for a while for Africa, and was again
                    engaged in a war with Syphax, in which he was so decidedly worsted that he found
                    himself at last merely the head of a small band of marauders, and was obliged to
                    confine his movements to the coast. Scipio’s arrival in Africa in 204 gave him
                    another chance, and no sooner had he joined the Roman general than he quite
                    crushed his old enemy, Syphax, and captured Cirta (Constantineh), the capital of
                    Syphax. Here occurs the romantic story of Sophonisba, daughter of the
                    Carthaginian Hasdrubal, who had been promised in marriage to Masinissa, but who
                    had subsequently become the wife of Syphax. Masinissa, it is said, wedded her
                    immediately after his victory, but was required by Scipio to dismiss her as a
                    Carthaginian, and consequently an enemy to Rome. To save her from such
                    humiliation he sent her poison, with which she destroyed herself. Masinissa was
                    now accepted as a thoroughly loyal ally of Rome, and was confirmed by Scipio in
                    the possession of his hereditary kingdom. In the decisive battle of Zama, 202
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> which witnessed Hannibal’s downfall, he
                    commanded the cavalry on Scipio’s right wing, and materially assisted the Roman
                    victory. For his services on that great day he had given him, under a treaty
                    with Rome, the kingdom of Syphax with its capital Cirta, and thus under Roman
                    protection he became master of the whole of Numidia, and his dominions
                    completely enclosed the Carthaginian territories, now straitened and reduced at
                    the close of the Second Punic War.</p>
                <p>Masinissa was still far from satisfied, and it would seem that he almost had
                    thoughts of annexing Carthage itself with the connivance of Rome. He spared no
                    opportunity to harass and annoy the city by pressing unfair claims to some of
                    its best and oldest possessions, and threatening perpetual encroachments. In a
                    war which soon followed he was successful; the remonstrances of Carthage with
                    Rome on the behaviour of their ally were answered by deputing Scipio to
                    arbitrate in the quarrel, but, as though intentionally on the part of Rome, no
                    definite settlement was arrived at, and thus the relations between Masinissa and
                    the Carthaginians were still unfriendly. Rome, it is certain, deliberately
                    favoured her ally’s unjust claims with the view of keeping Carthage weak.
                    Masinissa too was cunning enough to retain the friendship and good opinion of
                    the Roman people by helping them with liberal supplies in their wars in the
                    East, with Perseus of Macedon and with Antiochus. As soon as Carthage seemed to
                    be recovering herself, and some of Masinissa’s partisans were driven from the
                    city into exile, his policy was to alarm the fears of Rome, till at last, in
                    149, war was declared, the Third Punic War, w*hich ended in the final and utter
                    overthrow of Carthage. The king bore some part in the negotiations which
                    preceded the war, and died soon after its commencement in 148 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> after a life of ninety and a reign of sixty
                    years.</p>
                <p>Masinissa was an able ruler and a decided benefactor to Numidia, the resources of
                    which he developed, while he converted a people which had been little better
                    than a plundering tribe into a settled and civilized population, and out of
                    robbers and marauder’s made efficient and disciplined soldiers. To his sons he
                    bequeathed a well-stored treasury, a formidable army, and even a fleet. Cirta,
                    his capital, became a famous centre of Phoenician civilization. In fact
                    Masinissa changed for the better the whole aspect of a great part of northern
                    Africa. He had much of the Arab nature, was singularly temperate, and equal to
                    any amount of fatigue. His fidelity to Rome was not the fidelity of principle,
                    but merely that of temporary expediency; it is in the really good work he did
                    for his country that the noblest side of his character comes into display.</p>

                    scholars. English readers may be referred to a very full article in Smith’s
