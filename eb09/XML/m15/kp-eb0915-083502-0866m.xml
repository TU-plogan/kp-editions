                    53" S. lat. and 144° 58' 42'' E. long. Along the shores of the bay the suburbs
                    extend for a distance of over 10 miles, but the part distinctively known as the
                    “city” occupies a site about 3 miles inland on the north bank of the ∖ arra
                    river.</p>
                <p>The appearance of Melbourne from the βea is by no means picturesque. The shipping

                    flat, and covered with factories, the prospect is not <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi> nviting. But the city itself has a very different aspect: its situation
                    is relieved by numerous gentle hills, which show off to great advantage its fine
                    public buildings; its streets are wide and well kept; and the universal
                    appearance of prosperity, activity, and comfort under its usually clear blue sky
                    impresses the visitor favourably.</p>
                <p>That part specially known as the <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> city” had a
                    population in 1881 of 65,800. It occupies the two hills of East Melbourne and
                    West Melbourne; the valley that separates them, once occupied by a densely
                    wooded little stream, is now partly filled in, and forms the busy thoroughfare
                    of Elizabeth Street: parallel to this runs Swanston Street, and at right angles
                    to these, and parallel to the river, are Bourke Street, Collins Street, and
                    Flinders Street,—the first being the busiest in Melbourne, the second containing
                    the most fashionable shops, and the third, which faces the river, being given
                    over to maritime pursuits. These streets are the eighth of a mile apart; between
                    them are narrower streets occupied by warehouses and business premises.</p>
                <p>Round the “city” lies a circle of populous suburbs. North-east is Fitzroy with
                    23,000 inhabitants; farther east, Collingwood, 24,000; east of Melbourne,
                    Richmond, 23,400; south-east, Prahran, 21,000; south, Emerald Hill, 25,300;
                    south-west, Sandridge, 8700; north-west, Hotham, 17,800. These all lie within
                    three miles of the general post-office in Elizabeth Street; but outside of them,
                    and within a radius of 5 miles, there is a circle of less populous suburbs: to
                    the north, Brunswick, 6200; east, Kew, 4200, and Hawthorn, 6000; south-east, St
                    Kilda, 11,600, and Brighton, 4700; south-west, Williamstown, 9000, and
                    Footscray, 6000; north-west, Essenden and Flemington, 5000. Numerous smaller
                    suburbs fill up the spaces between these,—the principal being Northcote,
                    Preston, Camberwell, Toorak, Caulfield, Elsternwick, and Coburg, with a united
                    population of 19,000.</p>
                <p>Fifteen of these suburbs rank as independent municipalities, and many of them
                    have streets which for importance rival the main streets of the city.</p>

                <p>The land on which the city now stands was sold in allotments of half an acre, the
                    prices realized being in June 1837 about £34 each, in November 1837 about £42,
                    and in September 1838 about £120 each. These allotments are now (1882) sold at
                    prices ranging from £20,000 to £40,000. But, though land has thus increased in
                    value, Melbourne is by no means a crowded city; the streets are all 99 feet
                    wide, and the parks, squares, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n868/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0868-0837"/> and gardens are so numerous that with only
                    one-thirteenth of the population of London it occupies very nearly half as great
                    an area.</p>
                <p>The public buildings are generally situated on positions from which they are seen
                    to advantage. The Parliament Houses form a great pile of brickwork with four
                    fronts in freestone, of which the main front is not yet completed; the interior
                    decorations are highly elaborate. The Treasury is a well-proportioned building
                    in freestone; behind it stands a vast building known as the Government offices.
                    On the hill of West Melbourne there is a large structure, newly erected, for the
                    law courts; it has four very handsome fronts, each about 300 feet in length, and
                    the whole is surmounted by a lofty cupola, in the manner of the Capitol at
                    Washington. The public library in Swanston Street forms one of four fronts of a
                    building which was projected on a grand scale, but has never been completed.
                    Much of the interior has been erected, but of the fronts only the main one is
                    yet in existence, its cost having been £111,000. The lower story is devoted to
                    sculpture; on one side there are casts of all the most famous statues; on the
                    other there is a small collection of original works by modern sculptors,
                    together with a gallery containing 8000 engravings and photographs; to the rear
                    is the picture gallery, a very handsome hall, with oil paintings, chosen from
                    the works of living artists. Another of the interior portions of the building is
                    occupied by the technological museum, in which are arranged about 30,000
                    specimens illustrative of the industrial arts. The upper story of the front is
                    devoted to the library, which occupies a chamber 240 feet long; 22 recesses
                    contain each its own special branch of literature, the total number of volumes
                    being 112,000. The book shelves rise to a height of 20 feet, but they are
                    divided by a narrow gallery which runs all round the room, and gives access to
                    the upper tiers. The library is open to the public; and every visitor ranges at
                    will, being bound by the two conditions only that he is to replace each book
                    where he found it, and that he is to preserve strict silence. During 1881 there
                    were 261,886 visits made to the room.</p>
                <p>The Melbourne University is a picturesque, but by no means imposing mass of
                    buildings, buried among the trees of extensive and well-kept grounds about a
                    mile from the heart of the city. In front of it stands the “Wilson Hall,”
                    erected at a cost of £40,000. Behind is the National Museum, containing
                    collections of specimens of natural history. The museum, like all public places
                    in Melbourne, is freely open to the people. About 98,000 visitors entered it in
                    1881. The university has a staff of 10 professors and 12 lecturers, with about
                    400 students. There are four courses open to students: arts, law, medicine, and
                    civil engineering. Affiliated to the Melbourne University are the two
                    denominational colleges, Trinity and Ormond, in which about 80 students reside,
                    and where provision is made for instruction in theology.</p>
                <p>The Exhibition building consists of a nave 500 feet long and 160 feet broad,
                    surmounted by a dome, with two annexes each 460 feet long. These are built in
                    brick with cement facings. The mint is a very handsome quadrangle, erected in
                    1872. In the year 1881 there were three millions of sovereigns coined in it,
                    making a total of sixteen millions since its'erection. The governor’s residence
                    is a large building on a hill overlooking the Yarra. The general post-office
                    forms only half of a magnificent pile of buildings which will, when completed,
                    include the central telegraph office.</p>
                <p>The town-hall, at the corner of Swanston Street and Collins Street, contains,
                    besides the usual apartments for municipal offices, a hall seated for nearly
                    3000 persons, and fitted with a colossal organ, on which the city organist
                    performs two afternoons a week, the public being admitted at a nominal charge.
                    Hotham, Richmond, Emerald Hill, Prahran, and Fitzroy have their own town halls,
                    all costly and somewhat pretentious buildings.</p>
                <p>The markets, erected at a cost of £80,000, stand in Bourke Street. They are
                    handsome in external appearance, and ingeniously contrived for convenience
                    within. The observatory is a humble-looking building on the St Kilda Road; it
                    contains an equatorial telescope, which had for some years the distinction of
                    being the largest in the world.</p>
                <p>There are two railway stations, one being the terminus of all the country lines,
                    and the other devoted to suburban traffic. The suburbs of Williamstown,
                    Sandridge, Footscray, St Kilda, Emerald Hill, Brighton, Elsternwick, Hawthorn,
                    Richmond, and Essendon are connected by rail with the city.</p>
                <p>The Melbourne Hospital is in the form of an extensive series of brick buildings,
                    situated close to the public library. There are beds for about 300 patients. The
                    Alfred Hospital, on the St Kilda Road, was built in commemoration of the visit
                    of Prince Alfred; it has beds for nearly 100 patients. The lying-in hospital can
                    accommodate 62 pêrsons. The blind asylum has over 100 inmates; and there are a
                    deaf and dumb asylum, an immigrants’ home, and other charitable
                    institutions.</p>
                <p>Melbourne contains many churches, but few of them will compare with the public
                    buildings in appearance. The Roman Catholic cathedral of St Patrick, when
                    completed, will, however, be a conspicuous ornament to the city. The Anglican
                    cathedral, now (1882) in the course of erection, is to .costabout £100,000. The
                    most striking ecclesiastical building is the Scotch church in Collins Street,
                    which divides with Ormond College and the Wilson Hall the honour of being the
                    finest specimen of architecture in the city.</p>
                <p>There are in Melbourne, among its numerous state schools, about thirty whose size
                    and proportions entitle them to rank with the architectural ornaments of the
                    city. They have each accommodation for from 600 to 2000 scholars. Abundant
                    provision has been made for secondary instruction by the denominations and by
                    private enterprise. The Scotch College and the Presbyterian Ladies’ College, the
                    Wesley College and the Wesleyan Ladies’ College, the Church of England Grammar
                    School, St Patrick’s College and St Francis Xavier’s College, are all connected
                    with the churches; and there are besides between twenty and thirty good private
                    grammar schools.</p>
                <p>Melbourne contains the offices of numerous banks, savings banks, and building
                    societies.</p>
                <p>The parks and public gardens of Melbourne are extensive and handsome. Within the
                    city proper there are four gardens, which have been decorated with a lavish
                    expenditure. The Fitzroy Gardens are one dense network of avenues of oak, elm,
                    and plane, with a “fern-tree gully” in the middle. Casts of famous statues
                    abound; and ponds, fountains, rustic houses, and small buildings after the
                    design of Greek temples give a variety to the scene. The Treasury, Flagstaff,
                    and Carlton Gardens are of the same class, but less costly in their decorations.
                    Around the central city there lie five great parks. The Royal Park, of about 600
                    acres, is lightly timbered with the original gum trees; some portions of open
                    land are used for°recreation. About 30 acres in the centre are beautifully laid
                    out to accommodate a very superior zoological collection. The Yarra Park, of
                    about 300 acres, contains the leading cricket grounds; of these the “Melbourne”
                    is the chief, distinguished by its very large stand and the excellence of its
                    pitch. The Botanic Gardens occupy <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n869/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0869-0838"/> about 200 acres of land, sloping down to the
                    banks of the river, and laid out with great taste and skill. Albert Park, about
                    500 acres in extent, is not so elaborately laid out, but contains a small lake,
                    which is much used for boating purposes, as the bay is stormy and exposed.
                    Studley Park, a favourite place for picnics, is a romantic corner on a bend of
                    the upper Yarra, of about 200 acres extent, left entirely in a state of
                    nature.</p>
                <p>Besides these parks each suburb has its own “gardens” of moderate extent. At
                    Flemington a large reserve is devoted to racing purposes, where in November the
                    race for the Melbourne Cup is held, the great racing carnival of Australia,
                    attended by about 100,000 persons.</p>
                <p>The shipping of Melbourne is very considerable. In 1880 about 1500 vessels
                    entered and cleared again, their tonnage being 960,000. Nearly all the
                    intercolonial and a small proportion of the foreign vessels ascend the Yarra and
                    unload in the heart of the city. The river was originally navigable for vessels
                    of only 9 feet draught; but of late years the channel has been deepened so much
                    that vessels drawing 16 feet can ascend with safety. Great works are now in
                    operation by which the course is to be straightened and further deepened; and
                    the quays which line the river banks will be made accessible to the large
                    vessels which now have to lie in the bay off the Sandridge and Williamstown
                    piers.</p>
                <p>Shipbuilding is a comparatively unimportant industry, but a great deal of
                    repairing is done; the graving dock at Williamstown is able to hold the largest
                    vessels which enter the port.</p>
                <p>The total values of the imports of Melbourne for 1879 and 1880 were respectively
                    £15,035,000 and £14,557,000, and of the exports £12,454,000 and £15,954,000.</p>
                <p>In 1881 Melbourne contained 2469 factories, employing 38,141 hands, and
                    converting £8,012,745 worth of raw material into £13,384,836 worth of finished
                    articles. The leading products are leather, flour, clothing, furniture, boots,
                    carriages, preserved meats, ales, soap, candles, cigars, ironwork, jewellery,
                    jams, confectionery, biscuits, and woollens.</p>
                <p>The city is abundantly supplied with newspapers, including three morning and
                    three evening dailies. Two reviews are published.</p>
                <p>The climate of Melbourne is exceptionally fine, the only drawback being the
                    occasional hot winds which blow from the north for two or three days at a time,
                    and raise the temperature to an uncomfortable extent. But the proportion of days
                    when the sky is clear and the air dry and mild is large. The mean annual
                    temperature is 57°, which would make the climate of Melbourne analogous to that
                    of Madrid, Marseilles, or Verona, but without the extremes experienced in those
                    places. Snow falls every year in Italy, while it is unknown in Melbourne; and
                    the highest temperature reached there in summer is below that of the cities
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>As a field for emigration from European countries, Melbourne offers many
                    advantages to the industrious mechanic or labourer.</p>
                <p>The cost of living is about the same as in London. Rents are higher, and
                    furniture and utensils dearer; but butcher meat, bread, and clothes are
                    cheaper.</p>
                <p>There is no city where more has been done for the working-classes or where they
                    have made so good a use of their advantages. Many of their efforts at government
                    (for they have all the power in their hands) have been ill-advised, but
                    individually they have exhibited a prudence of which the community reaps the
                    fruits. It is one of the peculiar features of Melbourne that about three out of
                    every four mechanics who have reached middle life own the neat cottages they
                    occupy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The city of Melbourne is without exception the
                    most striking instance of the aptitude of the Anglo-Saxon race for colonization.
                    It was not till the opening years of the present century that the first European
                    sailed through the narrow entrance to Port Phillip, and it was only in 1835 that
                    the white man made his habitation there. In that year John Fawkner sailed up the
                    Yarra in his little vessel the “Enterprise,” laden with materials for a
                    settlement; he was stopped by a slight waterfall in a valley where dense groves
                    of wattle trees all in bloom loaded the air with perfume, and where flocks of
                    white cockatoos whirled aloft when the first stroke of the axe resounded in the
                    forest. This spot is now the centre of a great city 10 miles in length, 6 in
                    breadth, covering an area of 45,000 acres, and peopled by 283,000 persons. So
                    rapid and solid a growth, at a distance from the mother country of the whole
                    extent of the earth, is an example of colonizing enterprise altogether without
                    parallel.</p>
                <p>The settlement was at first called by the native name “Dootigala,” but a desire
                    for distinguished patronage caused the portion on the sea-shore, which was then
                    esteemed the more important, to be called “Williamstown,” after King William
                    IV., while the little collection of huts some 3 or 4 miles inland was named
                    “Melbourne,” in honour of the prime minister Lord Melbourne.</p>
                <p>For two years a constant stream of squatters with their sheep flowed in from
                    Tasmania; then numerous “overlanders” drove their flocks from the Sydney side
                    across the Murray and settled near Port Phillip. Captain Lonsdale was sent by
                    the Sydney Government to act as police magistrate, but in 1838 Mr Latrobe was
                    placed in charge with the title of superintendent. As the squatters prospered
                    Melbourne increased in size, so that in 1841 it contained 11,000 inhabitants. A
                    period of depression occurred in 1843, followed by several years of the greatest
                    prosperity, till, in 1851, gold was discovered in New South Wales. The district
                    of Port Phillip became infected by the excitement; many parties scoured that
                    part of the country in search of the precious metal, and six weeks after the
                    first discovery of it there the great riches of Ballarat were made known. Within
                    a year from that time a hundred thousand men had landed in the colony in order
                    to proceed to the diggings; for several years after the same number landed every
                    twelve months; and Melbourne increased in population from 30,C00 to 100,000 in
                    the course of two or three years.</p>
                <p>During the year of the gold discoveries, the Port Phillip district was separated
                    from New South Wales, and formed into a separate colony with the name Victoria.
                    In 1855 the British Government granted to it a complete autonomy; Melbourne
                    became the capital of the new colony. (A. SU.)</p>
