                    however,"we must of course still depend chiefly upon the sacred books already
                    mentioned, consisting of fragments of very various antiquity derived from an
                    older literature.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    >Ginzâ</hi> (treasure), consisting of two unequal parts, of which the larger is
                    called “yaminâ” (to the right hand) and the smaller “s’mâlâ” (to the left hand),
                    because of the manner in which they are bound together. In Petermanu’s edition
                    the former occupies three hundred and ninety-five large quarto pages and the
                    other only one hundred and thirty-eight. The former is intended for the living;
                    the latter consists chiefly of prayers to be read at the burial of priests. As
                    regards doctrine, the work is exhaustive; but it is characterized throughout by
                    diffuseness, and often by extreme obscurity, •besides being occasionally
                    self-contradictory, as might be expected in a work which consists of a number of
                    unconnected paragraphs of various authorship and date. The last section of the
                    “right-hand” part (the “Book of Kings ”) is one of the older portions, and from
                    its allusion to “the Persian and Arabian kings” may be concluded to date from
                    somewhere between 700 and 900 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Many of the
                    doctrinal portions may in substance well be still older, and date from the time
                    of the Sassanids. None of the MSS., however, are older than the 16th
                    century.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The first

                <p>The following sketch represents, as far as can be gathered from these
                    heterogeneous sources, the principal features of the Mandaean system. The ground
                    and origin of all things is Pirâ, or more correctly Pérâ rabbâ, “the great
                    abyss” (either Persian Pir, “old,” or from ∙tys, “to split,” comp, the Gnostic
                    <hi rend="italic">βυθός),</hi> associated with whom, and forming a triad with
                    him, are the primal aeons Ayar zivâ rabbâ, “the great shining aether,” and Mânâ
                    rabbâ d’ékârâ, “the great spirit of glory,” usually called simply Mânâ rabbâ.
                    The last-named, the most prominent of the three, is the king of light properly
                    so called, from whom the development of all things begins. From him emanates
                    Yardënâ rabbâ, “the great Jordan,” which, as the higher world soul, permeates
                    the whole aether, the domain of Ayar. Alongside of Mânâ rabbâ frequent mention
                    is made of D’miithâ, his “image,” as a female power; the name “image of the
                    father” arises out of the same conception as that which gives rise to the names
                    of <hi rend="italic">σιγη</hi> and <hi rend="italic">l·vvoia</hi> among the
                    Greek Gnostics. Mânâ rabbâ called into being the highest of the aeons properly
                    so-called, Hayyé Kadmâyé, “Primal Life,” and then withdrew into deepest secrecy,
                    visible indeed to the highest but not to the lowest aeons (comp. 5oφια and
                    ∏poτrατωp), yet manifesting himself also to the souls of the more pious of the
                    Mandaeans after their separation from the body. Primal Life, who is properly
                    speaking the Mandaean god, has the same predicates as the primal spirit, and
                    every prayer, as well as every section of the sacred books, begins by invoking
                    him.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The use of the word
                    “life” in a personal sense is usual in Gnosticism; compare the Zωη of Valentin,
                    and el-hayat el-muallama, “the dark life,” of Mani in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fihrist.</hi></p></note> The extremely fantastic delineation of the world of
                    light by which Hayyé Kadmâyé is surrounded (see for example the beginning of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sidrâ rabbâ)</hi> corresponds very closely with the Manichaean
                    description of the abode of the “king of the paradise of light.” The king of
                    light “sits in the far north in might and glory.” The Primal Light unfolds
                    himself by five great branches, viz., “the highest purest light, the gentle
                    wind, the harmony of sounds, the voice of all the aeons, and the beauty of their
                    forms,” all these being treated as abstractions and personified. Out of the
                    further development and combination of these primary manifestations arise
                    numerous aeons ('Uthré, “splendours,” from i∏y, “is rich”), of which, the number
                    is often stated to be three hundred and sixty. They are divided into a number of
                    classes (kings, hypostases, forms, &amp;c.); the proper names by which they are
                    invoked are many, and for the most part obscure, borrowed doubtless, to some
                    extent, from the Parsee angelology. From the First Life proceeds as a principal
                    emanation the “Second Life,” Hayyé Tinyâné, generally called Yùshamin. This last
                    name is evidently meant to be Hebrew, “Jehovah of the heavens,” the God of the
                    Jews being of a secondary rank in the usual Gnostic style. The next emanation
                    after Yιishamin is “the messenger of life” (Mandâ d’hayyé, literally <hi
                    rend="italic">γvωσις</hi><hi rend="italic">της ζωής),</hi> the most important
                    figure in the entire system, the mediator and redeemer, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >λόγος</hi> and the Christ of the Mandaeans, from whom, as already stated, they
                    take their name. He is occasionally also called the primal man, Gabrâ Kadmâyâ,
                    as in the Kabbala and by Mani. Yùshamin desired to raise himself above the
                    Primal Light, but failed in the attempt, and was punished by removal out of the
                    pure aetherial world into that of inferior light. The one world is separated
                    from the other by water channels (H’fiké Mayyé). Mandâ on the other hand
                    continues with the First Life and Mânâ rabbâ, and is called his “beloved son,”
                    the “first born, “high priest,” and “word of life.” Mandâ makes his appearance
                    in the visible world in a series of incarnations beginning with the three
                    brothers Hibil, Shithil, and Amish (late Judaeo-Babylonian transformations of
                    the well-known names of the book of Genesis), and ending with John the Baptist.
                    Of the first three the most highly honoured is Hibil, almost invariably referred
                    to as “the brilliant Hibil”; he is the alter ego of Mandâ, his image in this
                    present world, having the same predicates and the same activities, and is the
                    Jesus Christ of the Mandaeans. The Second Life, Yüshamïn, has as the last of
                    three sons Hayyé t’iitâyé, the “Third Life,” the most distinguished of <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n492/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0492-0469"/> the 'Uthré, hence usually called their father
                    (Abâ d’ 'Uthré, Abâthûr). His usual epithet is “the Ancient” ('Atikâ); and he is
                    also called “the deeply hidden and guarded.” He stands on the borderland between
                    the here and the hereafter, like the mysterious <hi rend="italic">πρεσβύτης
                    τρίτος</hi> or <hi rend="italic">senex tertius</hi> of Mani, whose becoming
                    visible will betoken the end of the world. Abâthûr sits on the furthest verge of
                    the world of light that lies towards the lower regions, and weighs in his
                    balance the deeds of the departed spirits who ascend to him. Beneath him was
                    originally nothing but a huge void with muddy black water at the bottom, in
                    which his image was reflected, becoming ultimately solidified into P’tâhil, his
                    son, who now partakes of the nature of matter. The demiurge of the Mandaeans,
                    and corresponding to the Ialdabaoth of the Ophites, he at the instance of his
                    father frames the earth and men,—according to some passages in conjunction with
                    the seven bad planetary spirits. He created Adam and Eve, but was unable to make
                    them stand upright, whereupon Hibil, Shithil, and Amish were sent by the First
                    Life to infuse into their forms spirit from Mânâ rabbâ himself. Hibil, at the
                    instance of the supreme God, also taught men about the world of light and the
                    aeons, and especially gave them to know that not P’tahilbut another was their
                    creator and supreme God, who as “the great king of light, without number,
                    without limit,” stands far above him. At the same time he enjoined the
                    protoplasts to marry and people the world. P’tahil had now lost his power over
                    men, and was driven by his father out of the world of light into a place beneath
                    it, whence he shall at the day of judgment be raised, and after receiving
                    baptism be made king of the'Uthré with divine honours.</p>
                <p>The underworld is made up of four vestibules and three hells properly so-called.
                    The vestibules have each two rulers, Zartay and Zartanay, Hag and Mag, Gaf and
                    Gafan, Anatan and Kin. In the highest hell rules alone the grisly king Sh’dûm,
                    “the warrior”; in the story immediately beneath is Giv, “the great”; and in the
                    lowest is Kιτin or Karkιim, the oldest and most powerful of all, commonly called
                    “the great mountain of flesh” (Tûrâ rabbâ d’besrâ), but also “the first-born of
                    darkness.” In the vestibules dirty water is still to be met with, but the hells
                    are full of scorching consuming fire, except Kriin’s domain, where is nought but
                    dust, ashes, and vacancy. Into these regions descended Hibil the brilliant, in
                    the power of Mânâ rabbâ, just as in the Manichaean mythology the “primal man,”
                    armed with the elements of the king of light, descends to a contest with the
                    primal devil. Hibil lingers, gradually unfolding his power, in each of the
                    vestibules, and finally passing from hell to hell reaches Karkùm. Hibil allows
                    himself to be half swallowed by the monster, but is unhurt, and compels his
                    antagonist to recognize the superiority of Mânâ rabbâ, the God of light, and to
                    divulge his ρrofoundest secret, the hidden name of darkness. Armed with this he
                    returns through the successive hells, compelling the disclosure of every secret,
                    depriving the rulers of their power, and barring the doors of the several
                    regions. From the fourth vestibule he brought the female devil Rûhâ, daughter of
                    Kin, and set her over the whole four. This Rûhâ, the mother of falsehood and
                    lies, of poisoning and fornication, is an antiChristian parody of the Rûhâ
                    d’Kudshâ (Holy Spirit) of the Syriac Church. She is the mother of Ur, the
                    personified fire of hell, who in anger and pride made a violent onset on the
                    world of light (compare the similar occurrence in the Manichaean mythology), but
                    was mastered by Hibil and thrown in chains down to the “black water,” and
                    imprisoned within seven iron and seven golden walls. By Ur, Rûhâ, while P’tâhil
                    was engaged in his work of creation, became mother of three sets of seven,
                    twelve, and five sons respectively; all were translated by P’tâhil to the
                    heavenly firmament (like the Archons of Mani), the first group forming the
                    planets and the next the signs of the zodiac, while the third is as yet
                    undetermined. Of the names of the planets Estera (Istar, Venus, also called Rûhâ
                    d’Kudshâ, “holy spirit”), Enba (Nebo, Mercury), Sin (moon), Kéwân (Saturn), Bil
                    (Jupiter), and Nirig (Nirgal, Mars) reveal their Babylonian origin; Il or II II,
                    the sun, is also known as Kâdûsh and Adûnay (the Adonai of the Old Testament);
                    as lord of the planetary spirits his place is in the midst of them; they are the
                    source of all temptation and evil amongst men. The houses of the planets, as
                    well as the earth and a second world immediately to the north of it, rest upon
                    anvils laid by Hibil on the belly of Ur.</p>
                <p>In the Mandaean representation the sky is an ocean of water, pure and clear, but
                    of more than adamantine solidity, upon which the stars and planets sail. Its
                    transparency allows us to see even to the pole star, who is the central sun
                    around whom all the heavenly bodies move. Wearing a jewelled crown, he stands
                    before Abâthûr’s door at the gate of the world of light; the Mandaeans
                    accordingly invariably pray with their faces turned northward. The earth is
                    conceived of as a round disk, slightly sloping towards the south, surrounded on
                    three sides by the sea but on the north by a fiigh mountain of turquoises;
                    behind this is the abode of the blest, a sort of inferior paradise, inhabited by
                    the Egyptians drowned along with Pharaoh in the Red Sea, whom the Mandaeans look
                    upon as their ancestors, Pharaoh himself having been their first high priest and
                    king. The total duration of the earth they fix at four hundred and eighty
                    thousand years, divided into seven epochs, in each of which one of the planets
                    rules. The <hi rend="italic">Sidra Rabid</hi> knows of three total destructions
                    of the human race by fire and water, pestilence and sword, a single pair alone
                    surviving in eaclι case. In the Mandaean view the Old Testament saints are false
                    prophets; such are Abraham, who arose six thousand years after Νύ (Noah) during
                    the reign of the Sun, Mishâ (Moses), in whose time the true religion was
                    professed by the Egyptians, and Shlimûn (Solomon) bar Davith, the lord of the
                    demons. Another false prophet and magician was Yishu M’shihâ, who was in fact a
                    manifestation of the planet Mercury. Forty-two years before his day, under King
                    Pontius Pilate, there had appeared the true prophet Yahyâ or John son of
                    Zechariah, an incarnation of Hibil, of whose birth and childhood fantastic
                    stories are told. Yahyâ by a mistake gave baptism to the false Messiah, who had
                    feigned humility; on the completion of his mission, after undergoing a seeming
                    execution, he returned clothed with light into the kingdom of light. As a
                    contemporary of Yahyâ and the false Messiah HibiΓs younger brother Anûsh 'Uthrâ
                    came down from heaven, caused himself to be baptized by Yahyâ, wrought miracles
                    of healing and of raising the dead, and brought about the crucifixion of the
                    false Messiah. He preached the true religion, destroyed Jerusalem (“Urashlam,”
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> “the devil finished it”), which had been built by
                    Adûnay, dispersed over the world the Jews who had put Yahyâ to death, and
                    previous to his return into the worlds of light sent forth three hundred and
                    sixty prophets for the diffusion of the true religion. All this speaks of
                    intense hatred alike of Jews and Christians; the fasts, celibacy, and monastic
                    and anchoret life of the latter are peculiarly objectionable to the Mandaeans.
                    Two hundred and forty years after the appearing of the false Messiah there came
                    to the world sixty thousand saints out of Pharaoh’s world to take the place of
                    the Mandaeans, who had been completely extirpated; their high priest had his
                    residence in Damascus. The last false prophet was M’hammad or Ahmat bar Bisbat
                    (Mohammed), but Anûsh, who remained close beside him and his immediate
                    successors, prevented hostilities against <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n493/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0493-0470"/> the true believers, who claim to have had in
                    Babylonia, under the Abbasides, four hundred places of worship. Subsequent
                    persecutions compelled their withdrawal to 'Ammârah in the neighbourhood of
                    Wâsit, and ultimately to Khüzistân. At the end of the world the devil Ur will
                    swallow up the earth and the other intermediate higher worlds, and thereupon
                    will burst and fall into the abyss of darkness, where, along with all the worlds
                    and powers of darkness, he will ultimately cease to be, so that thenceforward
                    the universe will consist of but one everlasting world of light.</p>
                <p>The chief depositaries of these Mandaean mysteries are the priests, who enjoy a
                    high degree of power and social regard. The priesthood has three grades. (1) the
                    Sh’kanda or deacon is generally chosen from episcopal or priestly families, and
                    must be without bodily blemish. The candidate for orders must be at least
                    nineteen years old and have undergone twelve years’ preparation; he is then
                    qualified to assist the priesthood in the ceremonies of religion. (2) The
                    Tarmida (t.e., “Talmidâ,” initiated’’) or priest is ordained by a bishop and two
                    priests or by four priests after a long and extremely painful period of
                    preparation. (3) The Ganzivra (“treasurer'’) or bishop, the highest dignitary,
                    is chosen from the whole body of the Tarmidâs after a variety of tests, and
                    possesses unlimited authority over the clergy. A supreme priestly rank, that of
                    Rish ’ amma, or “head of the people,” is recognized, but only in theory; since
                    the time of Pharaoh this sovereign pontificate has only once been filled. The
                    priestly dress, which is all white, consists of drawers, an upper garment, and a
                    girdle with the so-called taga or “crown”; in all ceremonies the celebrants must
                    be barefoot. By far the most frequent and important of the religious ceremonies
                    is that of baptism (masbûthâ), which is called for in a great variety of cases,
                    not only for children but for adults, where consecration or purification is
                    required, as for example on all Sundays and feast days, after contact with a
                    dead body, after return from abroad, after neglect of any formality on the part
                    of a priest in the discharge of his functions. In all these cases baptism is
                    performed by total immersion in running water, but during the five days’
                    baptismal festival the rite is observed wholesale by mere sprinkling of large
                    masses of the faithful at once. The Mandaeans observe also with the elements of
                    bread (pehta) and wine (mambιiga, lit. “fountain”) a sort of eucharist, which
                    has a special sanctifying efficacy, and is usually dispensed at festivals, but
                    only to baptized persons of good repute who have never willingly denied the
                    Mandaean faith. In receiving it the communicant must not touch the host with his
                    finger; otherwise it loses its virtue. The hosts are made by the priests from
                    unleavened fine flour. A peculiar act of piety is for a layman under the
                    guidance of the bishop to receive the massektha (“elevation”), and thereby
                    become a sort of ascetic, a shalmâna taba, (“really perfect”). The Mandaean
                    places of worship, being designed only for the priests and their assistants, are
                    excessively small, and very simply furnished; two windows, a door that opens
                    towards the south so that those who enter have their faces turned towards the
                    pole star, a few boards in the corner, and a gabled roof complete the whole
                    structure; there is neither altar nor decoration of any kind. The neighbourhood
                    of running water (for baptisms) is essential. At the consecration of a church
                    the sacrifice of a dove (the bird of Venus) has place among the ceremonies.
                    Besides Sundays there are six great feasts: (1) that of the New Year (Nauniz
                    rabba), on the first day of the first month of winter; (2) Dehwa h’nina, the
                    anniversary of the happy return of Hibil Ziva from the kingdom of darkness into
                    that of light, lasting five days, beginning with the 18th of the first month Of
                    spring; (3) the Marwana, in commemoration of the drowned Egyptians, on the first
                    day of the second month of spring; (4) the great five days’ baptismal festival
                    (pantsha), the chief feast, kept on the five intercalary days at the end of the
                    second month of summer,—during its continuance every Mandaean, male and female,
                    must dress in white and bathe thrice daily; (5) Dehwâ d’daimânâ, in honour of
                    one of the three hundred and sixty 'Uthras, on the first day of the second month
                    of autumn; (6) Kanshe Zahlâ, the preparation feast, held on the last day of the
                    year. There are also fast days called m’battal (Arab.), on which it is forbidden
                    to kill any living thing or eat flesh. The year is solar, and has twelve months
                    of thirty days each, with five intercalary days between the eighth and the ninth
                    month. Of the seven days of the week, next to Sunday (habshabâ) Thursday has a
                    special sacredness as the day of Hibil <hi rend="italic">Ziva.</hi> As regards
                    secular occupation, the present Mandaeans are goldsmiths, ironworkers, and house
                    and ship carpenters. They practise polygamy, the <hi rend="italic">Sidrd
                    Rαbbd</hi> laying great stress upon the duty of procreation, but few of them are
                    rich enough to maintain more than two wives. In the 17th century, according to
                    the old travellers, they numbered about 20,000 families, but at the present day
                    they hardly number more than 1200 souls. In external appearance the Mandaean is
                    distinguished from the Moslem only by a brown coat and a parti-coloured
                    headcloth with a cord twisted round it. They have some peculiar death-bed rites:
                    a deacon with some attendants waits upon the dying, and as death approaches
                    administers a bath first of warm and afterwards of cold water; a holy dress,
                    consisting of seven pieces (rastâ), ∙is then put on; the feet are directed
                    towards the north and the head turned to the south, so that the body faces the
                    pole star. After the burial a funeral feast is held in the house of
                    mourning.</p>
                <p>The Mandaeans are strictly reticent about their theological dogmas in the
                    presence of strangers; and the knowledge they actually possess of these is
                    extremely small. The foundation of the system is obviously to be sought in
                    Gnosticism, and more particularly in the older type of that doctrine (known from
                    the serpent symbol as Ophite or Naassene) which obtained in Mesopotamia and
                    Further Asia generally. But it is equally plain that the Ophite nucleus has from
                    time to time received very numerous and often curiously perverted accretions
                    from Babylonian Judaism, Oriental Christianity, and Parsism, exhibiting a
                    striking example of religious syncretism. In the Gnostic basis itself it is not
                    difficult to recognize the general features of the religion of ancient
                    Babylonia, and thus we are brought nearer a solution of the problem as to the
                    origin of Gnosticism in general. It is certain that Babylonia, the seat of the
                    present Mandaeans, must be regarded also as the cradle in which their system was
                    reared; it is impossible to think of them as coming from Palestine, or to
                    attribute to their doctrines a Jewish or Christian origin. They do not spring
                    historically from the disciples of John the Baptist (Acts xviii. 25; xix. 3 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.; Recog. Clem.,</hi> i. 54); the tradition in which he and the
                    Jordan figure so largely is not original, and is therefore worthless; at the
                    ‘same time it is true that their baptismal praxis and its interpretation place
                    them in the same religious group with the Hemerobaptists of Eusebius <hi
                    rend="italic">(H. E.,</hi> iv. 22) and Epiphanius <hi rend="italic">(Haer.</hi>,
                    xvii. ), or with the sect of disciples of John who remained apart from
                    Christianity. Their reverence for John is of a piece with their whole
                    syncretizing attitude towards the New Testament. Indeed, as has been seen, they
                    appropriate the entire personale of the Bible from Adam, Seth, Abel, Enos, and
                    Pharaoh to Jesus and John, a phenomenon which bears witness to the close
                    relations of the Mandaean doctrine, at the time of its formation, both with
                    Judaism and Christianity,—not the less close because they were relations of
                    hostility. The history of religion presents other examples of the degradation of
                    holy to demonic figures on occasion of religious schism. The use of the word
                    “Jordan,” even in. the plural, for “sacred water,” is precisely similar to that
                    by the Naassenes described in the <hi rend="italic">Philosoj)humena</hi> (v. 7);
                    there ό <hi rend="italic">μeyas</hi><hi rend="italic">’Ιορδάνης</hi> denotes the
                    spiritualizing, sanctifying fluid which pervades the world of light. The notions
                    of the Egyptians and the Red Sea, according to the same work (v. 16), are used
                    by the Peratae much as by the Mandaeans. And the position assigned by the
                    Sethians <hi rend="italic">(2ηθιavoi)</hi> to Seth is precisely similar to that
                    given by the Mandaeans to Abel. Both alike are merely old Babylonian divinities
                    in a new Biblical garb. The genesis of Mandaeism and the older gnosis from the
                    old and elaborate Babylonio-Chaldaean religion is clearly seen also in the fact
                    that the names of the old pantheon (as for example those of the planetary
                    divinities) are retained, but their holders degraded to the position of
                    demons,—a conclusion confirmed by the fact that the Mandaeans, like the allied
                    Ophites, Peratae, and Manichaeans, certainly have their original seat in
                    Mesopotamia and Babylonia. Great caution is necessary, in the present state of
                    our knowledge, in the use made of the results of cuneiform decipherment in
                    relation to Babylonian mythology; but so much seems clear, that the trinity of
                    Anu, Bil, and Ea in the old Babylonian religion has its counterpart in the
                    Mandaean Pira, Ayar, and Mana rabba. The D’mûthâ of Mana is the Damkina, the
                    wife of Ea, mentioned by Damascius as <hi rend="italic">∆aυκη,</hi> wife of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> A&lt;is. Manda d’hayyé and his image Hibil Ziva with
                    his incarnations clearly correspond with the old Babylonian Marduk, Merodach,
                    the “first-born” son of Ea, with his incarnations, the chief divinity' of the
                    city of Babylon, the mediator and redeemer in the old religion. Hibil’s contest
                    with darkness has its prototype in Marduk’s battle with chaos, the dragon
                    Tiamat, which (another striking parallel) partially swallows Marduk, just as is
                    related of Hibil and the Manichaean primal man. Other features are borrowed by
                    the Mandaean mythology under this head from the well-known epos of Istar’s <hi
                    rend="italic">descensus ad inferos.</hi> The sanctity with which water is
                    invested by the Mandaeans is to be explained by this fact that Ea has his seat
                    “in the depths of the world sea.”</p>
