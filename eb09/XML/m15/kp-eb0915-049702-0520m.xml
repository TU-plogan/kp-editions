                    formerly capital of Maine and now of the department of Sarthe, lies 118 miles
                    (131 by rail) W.S.W. from Paris, near the confluence of the Sarthe and the
                    Huisne, on an elevation rising from the left bank of the former river. Three
                    bridges besides that of the railway connect the town with the quarter on the
                    right bank. Of the wide and commodious thoroughfares which are gradually
                    superseding the old winding and narrow streets, the most worthy of notice is the
                    tunnel by which the Place des Jacobins is connected with the river side. The
                    principal building is the cathedral, originally founded by St Julian, to whom it
                    is dedicated. Rebuilt in the 6th century by St Innocent, in the 9th by St
                    Aldric, and a third or fourth time in the 11th by Vulgrin, who was at once
                    architect and bishop, it was completed by the addition of two towers in the
                    12th. Destroyed by two fires, the roof was reconstructed in the Gothic style,
                    and the transept and south portal were added. In the 13th century the choir was
                    enlarged in the grandest and boldest style of that magnificent period. Finally a
                    new transept and a bell tower were added in the 15th century. In the large
                    window of the west front the ten divisions which have for their subject the
                    legend of St Julian are the oldest extant specimens of stained glass in France
                    (end of 11th century). The side portal (12th century) is richly decorated, and
                    its statuettes exhibit many interesting costumes of the period. The aisles have
                    ten bays, but the nave only five; the transept is much higher; from it rises the
                    only tower of the building. The austere simplicity of the nave is in striking
                    contrast with the lavish richness of the ornamentation in the choir and apse.
                    The former is 115 feet in height, and has twelve chapels besides the sacristy;
                    its windows almost entirely date from the middle of the 13th century. The glass
                    of the north transept is of the 15th century, and represents the Last Judgment;
                    it contains many historical figures. The cathedral has also curious tapestries
                    and some remarkable tombs, including that of Berengaria, queen of Richard Coeur
                    de Lion. The entire length of the building is 427 feet. Close to the western
                    wall is a megalithic monument nearly 15 feet in height. The church of La
                    Couture, which belonged to an old abbey founded in the 7th century by St
                    Bertrand or Bertram, has a remarkable porch of the 13th century; the rest of the
                    building is older. Of the other churches of Le Mans, none require special
                    mention except that of Notre Dame du Pré, on the right bank of the Sarthe. Of
                    the secular buildings may be mentioned the hôtel de ville, built about a century
                    ago on the site of the former castle of the counts of Maine, and the prefecture,
                    occupying the site of the monastery of La Couture (1760). The latter contains
                    the library (50,000 volumes, 700 MSS.), the communal archives, and the museum of
                    paintings, archaeology, and natural history. Other prominent buildings are the
                    general hospital, the lyceum, the seminary, the palais de justice, and the
                    cavalry barracks; the house occupied by Scarron is still pointed out, and there
                    are considerable remains of the old Gallo-Roman enceinte. The principal
                    promenades are those of the Jacobins, of the horticultural garden, Du Greffier
                    (on the right bank of the river), and Des Sapins (on the road to Tours). The
                    industries of Le Mans, which are carried on chiefly in the faubourg of
                    Pontlieue, include metal-working, the manufacture of agricultural implements,
                    and weaving. For some years there has been a Government tobacco factory. A local
                    specialty is the fattening of poultry. The population in 1876 was 50,175
                    (including 5282 representing the garrison, &amp;c.). Le Mans is an important
                    railway junction.</p>
                <p>As the capital of the Aulerci Cenomani, Le Mans was called Suindinum or Vindinum.
                    The Romans surrounded it with walls in the 3d century; it was evangelized by St
                    Julian in the 4th. The countship of Maine was made hereditary by Hugh Capet in
                    the 10th century. Le Mans was seized by William the Conqueror, but his son
                    Robert was unable to retain it. Having chosen the side of Richard Coeur-de-Lion,
                    it was taken by Philip Augustus, recaptured by John, subsequently confiscated,
                    and afterwards ceded to the widow of Richard. Maine was next held by Margaret,
                    the wife of St Louis, who gave it to his brother’ Charles of Anjou. Le Mans was
                    five times besieged during the Hundred Years’ War, and was subsequently
                    devastated by the Huguenots in 1562. In 1793 it was seized by the Vendeans, who
                    were expelled by Marceau after a sanguinary battle in the streets of the town.
                    In 1799 it was again occupied by the Chouans; and in January 1871 the second
                    army of the Loire sustained in the neighbourhood of Le Mans a defeat which made
                    the relief of Paris impossible. The town is the birthplace of Henry II. of
                    England, of John the Good, king of France, and of Chappe, the inventor of the
                    aerial telegraph.</p>
