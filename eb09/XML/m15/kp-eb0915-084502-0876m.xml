                <p><label type="entry">MEMLING, <hi rend="smallcaps">Hans</hi></label>, a painter of
                    the 15th century, whose art gave a passing lustre to Bruges in the period of its
                    political and commercial decline. Though much has been written respecting the
                    rise and fall of the school which made this city famous, it still remains a moot
                    question whether that school ever truly existed. . Like Rome or Naples, Bruges
                    absorbed the talents which were formed and developed in humbler centres. John
                    Van Eyck first gained repute at Ghent and the Hague before he acquired a
                    domicile elsewhere, and Mending, we have reason to think, was a skilled artist
                    before he settled at Bruges. Yet if the question should be asked where the
                    manner of Memling was shaped, and where he acquired the skill which he displayed
                    at Bruges, we shall be greatly at a loss to reply. The annals of the city are
                    silent as to the birth and education of a painter whose name was inaccurately
                    spelt by different authors, and whose identity was lost under the various
                    appellations of Hans and Hausse, or Hemling and Memling. But no other city of
                    the Netherlands has vindicated the right which Bruges had no means of proving.
                    Travellers who came to Bruges were only told that Mending's masterpieces were
                    preserved in the hospital of St John. In one of these pictures it was said a
                    portrait of the artist might be discovered; on the sculptured ornaments of a
                    porch enframing one of its subjects an incident of the master’s life might be
                    traced,—his danger as he lay senseless in the street, his rescue as charitable
                    people carried his body to thé hospital. The legend grew too. It came to be told
                    how the great artist began life as a soldier who went to the wars under Charles
                    the Bold, and came back riddled with wounds from the field of Nancy. Wandering
                    homeward in a disabled state in 1477, he fainted in the streets of Bruges, and
                    was cured by the Hospitallers. Unknown to them, and a stranger to Bruges, he
                    gave tangible proofs of his skill to the brethren of St John, and showed his.
                    gratitude by refusing payment for a picture he had painted. Unhappily the legend
                    refutes itself. The portrait of Memling is a myth; the carvings of the capitals
                    of the porch represent the ordinary incidents attending the reception of
                    patients at an hospital. Memling did indeed paint for the Hospitallers, but he
                    painted not one but many pictures, and he did so in 1479 and 1480, being
                    probably known to his patrons of St John by many masterpieces even before the
                    battle of Nancy.</p>
                <p>Memling is only connected with military operations in a mediate and distant
                    sense. His name appears on a list of subscribers to the loan which was raised by
                    Maximilian of Austria to push hostilities against France in the year 1480. When
                    he signed this list his position was that of a resident at Bruges who had
                    probably lived there long enough to acquire a large practice and its advantages
                    in the form of lands and tenements. In 1477, when he is said to have fallen, and
                    when Charles the Bold was killed, he was under contract to furnish an altarpiece
                    for the guild chapel of the booksellers of Bruges; and this altarpiece, now
                    preserved, under the name of the Seven Griefs of Mary, in the gallery of Turin,
                    is one of the fine creations of his riper age, and not inferior in any way to
                    those of 1479 in the hospital of St John, which for their part are hardly less
                    interesting as illustrative of the master’s power than the Last Judgment in the
                    cathedral of Dantzic. Critical opinion has been unanimous in assigning the
                    altarpiece of Dantzic to Memling, and by this it affirms that Memling was a
                    resident and a skilled artist at Bruges in 1473; for there is no doubt that the
                    Last Judgment was painted and sold to a merchant at Bruges, who shipped it there
                    on board of a vessel bound to the Mediterranean, which was captured by a Dantzic
                    privateer in that very year. But, in order that Memling’s repute should be so
                    fair as to make his pictures purchasable, as this had been, by an agent of the
                    Medici at Bruges, it is incumbent on us to acknowledge that he had furnished
                    sufficient proofs before that time of the skill which excited the wonder of such
                    highly cultivated <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0877-0846"/> patrons; and thus we come to admit without much
                    difficulty the possible truth of a report made by a chronicler of the 16th
                    century that Memling had sittings from Isabella, consort of Philip the Good of
                    Burgundy, in the year 1450.</p>
                <p>It is characteristic that the very oldest allusions to pictures connected with
                    Memling’s name are those which point to relations with the Burgundian court. The
                    inventories of Margaret of Austria, drawn up in 1524, allude to a triptych of
                    the God of Pity by Roger van der Weyden, of which the wings containing angels
                    were by “Master Hans.” But this entry is less important as affording testimony
                    in favour of the preservation of Memling’s work than as showing his connexion
                    with an older Flemish craftsman. For ages Roger van der Weyden was acknowledged
                    as an artist of the school of Bruges, until records of undisputed authenticity
                    demonstrated that he was bred at Tournai and settled at Brussels. Nothing seems
                    more natural than the conjunction of his name with that of Memling as the author
                    of an altarpiece, since, though Memling’s youth remains obscure, it is clear
                    from the style of his manhood that he was taught in the painting-room of Van der
                    Weyden. Nor is it beyond the limits of probability that it was Van der Weyden
                    who received commissions at a distance from Brussels, and first took his pupil
                    to Bruges, where he afterwards dwelt. The clearest evidence of the connexion of
                    the two masters is that afforded by pictures, and particularly an altarpiece,
                    which has alternately been assigned to each of them, and which may possibly be
                    due to the joint labours of both. In this altarpiece, which is a triptych
                    ordered for a patron of the house of Sforza, we find the style of Van der Weyden
                    in the central panel of the Crucifixion, and that of Memling in the episodes on
                    the wings. Yet the whole piece was assigned to the former in the Zambeccari
                    collection at Bologna, whilst it was attributed to the latter at the Middleton
                    sale in London in 1872. At first, we may think, a closer resemblance might be
                    traced between the two artists than that disclosed in later works of Memling,
                    but the delicate organization of the younger painter, perhaps also a milder
                    appreciation of the duties of a Christian artist, may have led Memling to
                    realize a sweet and perfect ideal, without losing, on that account, the feeling
                    of his master. He certainly exchanged the asceticism of Van der Weyden for a
                    sentiment of less energetic concentration. He softened his teacher’s asperities
                    and bitter hardness of expression.</p>
                <p>In the very oldest form in which Memling’s style is displayed, or rather in that
                    example which represents the Baptist in the gallery of Munich, we are supposed
                    to contemplate an effort of the year 1470. The finish of this piece is scarcely
                    surpassed, though the subject is more important, by that of the Last Judgment of
                    Dantzic. But the latter is more interesting than the former because it tells how
                    Memling, long after Roger’s death and his own settlement at Bruges, preserved
                    the traditions of sacred art which had been applied in the first part of the
                    century by Roger van der Weyden to the Last Judgment of Beaune. All that Memling
                    did was to purge his master’s manner of excessive stringency, and add to his
                    other qualities a velvet softness of pigment, a delicate transparence of colours
                    and yielding grace of slender forms. That such a beautiful work as the Last
                    Judgment of Dantzic should have been bought for the Italian market is not
                    surprising when we recollect that picture-fanciers in that country were familiar
                    with the beauties of Memling’s compositions as shown in the preference given to
                    them by such purchasers as Cardinal Grimari and Cardinal Beιnbo at Venice, and
                    the heads of the house of Medici at Florence. But Memling’s reputation was not
                    confined to Italy or Flanders. The Madonna and Saints which so lately passed out
                    of the Duchatel collection into the gallery of the Louvre, the Virgin and Child
                    of Sir John Donne at Chiswick, and other noble specimens in English and
                    Continental private houses show that his work was as widely known and
                    appreciated as it could be in the state of civilization of the 16th century. It
                    was perhaps not their sole attraction that they gave the most tender and
                    delicate possible impersonations of the “Mother of Christ” that could suit the
                    taste of that age in any European country. But the portraits of the donors with
                    which they were mostly combined were more characteristic, and probably more
                    remarkable as likenesses than any that Memling’s contemporaries could produce.
                    Nor is it unreasonable to think that his success as a portrait painter, which is
                    manifested in isolated busts as well as in altarpieces, was of a kind to react
                    with effect on the Venetian school, which undoubtedly was affected by the
                    partiality of Antonello da Messina for transAlpine types studied in Flanders in
                    Memling’s time. The portraits of Sir John Donne and his wife and children in the
                    Chiswick altarpiece are not less remarkable as models of drawing and finish than
                    as refined presentations of persons of distinction; nor is any difference in
                    this respect to be found in the splendid groups of father, mother, and children
                    which fill the noble altarpiece of the Louvre’ As single portraits, the busts of
                    Burgomaster Moreel and his wife in the museum of Brussels, and their daughter
                    the Sibyl Zam-betha in the hospital of Bruges, are the finest and most
                    interesting of specimens. The Seven Griefs of Mary in the gallery of Turin, to
                    which we may add the Seven Joys of Mary in the Pinakothek of Munich, are
                    illustrations of the habit which clung to the art of Flanders, of representing a
                    cycle of subjects on the different planes of a single picture, where a wide
                    expanse of ground is covered with incidents from the Passion in the form common
                    to the action of sacred plays. The time came, no doubt, when the players took
                    their cue from the painters, as in the Ghent procession, which was formed on the
                    model of Van Eyck’s Adoration of the Lamb. But in Memling’s days there were
                    still some original “players,” and the public was not averse to seeing
                    illustrations of their work. In the first period of the development of Belgian
                    art too, when the Flemings assigned more importance to carved work than to
                    painting, and yet refused to accept sculpture without colour, it was natural
                    that the sculptor should multiply incidents on bas-reliefs which were coated
                    with tinting in the semblance of nature. Memling’s pictures imitate reliefs so
                    far as they abound in variety of episodes, and are marked by absence of contrast
                    in light and shade or want of toning by gradations of atmosphere. Yet with all
                    these peculiarities his works are very pleasant to the eye, because they are
                    always graceful and quiet.</p>
                <p>The masterpiece of Memling’s later years, a shrine containing relics of St Ursula
                    in the hospital of Bruges, is fairly supposed to have been ordered and finished
                    in 1480 after the painter had become acquainted with the scenery of the Rhine.
                    This shrine is one of the most interesting monuments of mediaeval art in
                    Flanders, not only because it is beautifully executed, but because it reveals
                    some part of the life of the painter who produced it, and illustrates the
                    picturesque legend of Ursula and her comrades. The delicacy of finish in its
                    miniature figures, the variety of its landscapes and costume, the marvellous
                    patience with which its details are given, are all matters of enjoyment to the
                    spectator. There is later work of the master in the St Christopher and Saints of
                    1484 in the academy, or the Newenhoven Madonna in the hospital of Bruges, or a
                    large Crucifixion with scenes from the Passion, of 1491, in the cathedral of
                    Liibeck. But as we near the close of Memling’s career we observe that his
                    practice has become larger than he can compass alone; and, as usual in such
                    cases, the labour of disciples is substituted for his own. The registers of the
                    painters’ corporation at Bruges give the names of two apprentices who served
                    their time with Memling and paid dues on admission to the guild in 1480 and
                    1486. These subordinates remained obscure.</p>
                <p>It would be easy to form a long list of pictures by Memling in the galleries of
                    Berlin, Florence, Ix&gt;ndon, Madrid, Paris, Rome, and Vienna, and pieces
                    equally remarkable in many private collections of England and the Continent.
                    These have all been described, and are widely known. The present notice must be
                    closed with the admission that pictures tell more of Memling’s life than
                    records. The date of the master’s death is not better certified than that of his
                    birth. This much, however, is certain. The trustees of Memling’s will appeared
                    before the court of wards at Bruges on the 10th of December 1495, and we gather
                    from records of that date and place that Memling died a short time before,
                    leaving behind several children and a considerable property. (J. A. C. )</p>
