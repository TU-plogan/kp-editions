                    age to college at Aberdeen, and afterwards at St Andrews, graduating at sixteen.
                    He then engaged for three years in the study of the civil law at Bourges; on his
                    return to Scotland he was called to the bar in 1656, and before the Restoration
                    had risen into considerable practice. Immediately after the Restoration he was
                    appointed a “justice-depute,” and it is recorded that he and his colleagues in
                    that office were ordained by the parliament in 1661 “to repair, once in the week
                    at least, to Musselburgh and Dalkeith, and to try and judge such persons as are
                    there or thereabouts delate of witchcraft.” In the same year he acted as counsel
                    for the marquis of Argyll; soon afterwards he was knighted, and he represented
                    the county of Ross during the four sessions of the parliament which was called
                    in 1669. He succeeded Sir John Nisbet as king’s advocate in August 1677, and in
                    the discharge of this office became implicated in all the worst acts of the
                    Scottish administration of Charles II., earning for himself an unenviable
                    distinction as “the bloody Mackenzie.” His refusal to concur in the measures for
                    dispensing with the penal laws against Catholics led to his removal from office
                    in 1686, but he was reinstated in February 1688. At the Revolution, being a
                    member of convention, he was one of the minority of five in the division on the
                    forfeiture of the crown. King William was urged to declare him incapacitated for
                    holding any public office, but refused to accede to the proposal. When the death
                    of Dundee (September 1689) had finally destroyed the hopes of his party in
                    Scotland, Mackenzie betook himself to Oxford, where, admitted a student by a
                    grace passed on June 2, 1690, he was allowed to spend the rest of his days in
                    the enjoyment of the ample fortune he had acquired, and in the prosecution of
                    his literary labours. One of his last acts before leaving Edinburgh had been to
                    pronounce (March 15, 1689), as dean of the faculty of advocates, the inaugural
                    oration at the foundation of the Advocates’ Library. He died at Westminster on
                    May 8, 1691, and was buried in Greyfriars churchyard, Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>While still a young man Sir George Mackenzie appears to have aspired to eminence
                    in the domain of pure literature, his earliest publication having been <hi
                    rend="italic">Aretina, or a Serious Romance</hi> (anon., 1660); it was followed,
                    also anonymously, by <hi rend="italic">Religio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Stoici,</hi><hi rend="italic">a Short Discourse upon several Divine and Moral
                    Subjects</hi> (1663), <hi rend="italic">A Moral Essay, preferring Solitude to
                    Public Employment</hi> (1665), and one or two other disquisitions of a similar
                    nature. None of these earlier efforts are now read, if they ever were; and
                    perhaps Mackenzie’s strongest claim to be remembered at all in connexion with
                    belles lettres is that which rests upon Dryden’s grateful reminiscence of some
                    stimulating conversation held with “that noble wit of Scotland, Sir George
                    Mackenzie,” aboutl673. (See Dryden’s “Discourse on the Origin and Progress of
                    Satire,” prefixed to his <hi rend="italic">Juvenal</hi> in 1693.) His most
                    important legal works are entitled <hi rend="italic">A Discourse upon the
                    Lawsand Customs of Scotland in Matters Criminal</hi> (1678), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observations upon the Laws and Customs of Nations as to Precedency, with the
                    Science of Heraldry</hi> (1680), <hi rend="italic">Institutions of the Law of
                    Scotland</hi> (1684), and <hi rend="italic">Observations upon the Acts of
                    Parliament</hi> (1686); of these the last-named is the most important, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Institutions</hi> being completely overshadowed by the similar
                    work of his great contemporary Stair. In his <hi rend="italic">Jus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Regium</hi><hi rend="italic">; or the Just and Solid Foundations
                    of Monarchy in general, and more especially of the Monarchy of Scotland,
                    maintained</hi> (1684), Mackenzie appears as an uncompromising advocate of the
                    highest doctrines of prerogative. His <hi rend="italic">Vindication of the
                    Government of Scotland during the reign of</hi><hi rend="italic">Charles</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">II.</hi> is valuable as a piece of contemporary history. The
                    collected <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> were published at Edinburgh (2 vols,
                    f&gt;&gt;l.) in 1716-22; and <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Affairs of
                    Scotland from the Restoration of King Charles 11.,</hi> from previously
                    unpublished MSS., in 1821. It may be well to add that the subject of this notice
                    must not be confounded with Dr George Mackenzie, the author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lives and Characters of the Most Eminent Writers of the Scots Nation</hi>
                    (1708-22).</p>
