                    district in the lieutenant-governorship of Bengal, India, lying between 23° 56'
                    and 25° 25' N. lat., and 89° 43' and 91° 18' E. long., with an area of 6287
                    square miles, is bounded on the N. by the Gâro Hills, on the E. by Sylhet, on
                    the S.E. by Tipperah, on the S. by Dacca, and on the W. by the river Jamunâ,
                    which separates it from Pabna, Bogra, and Rangpur districts. It is, for the most
                    part, level and open, covered with well-cultivated fields, and intersected by
                    numerous rivers. The Madhupur jungle is a slightly elevated tract, extending
                    from the north of Dacca district into the heart of Maimansinh, almost as far as
                    the Brahmaputra; its average height is about 60 feet above the level of the
                    surrounding country, and it nowhere exceeds 100 feet. The jungle contains
                    abundance of <hi rend="italic">sdl,</hi> valuable both as timber and for
                    charcoal. During the cold season the open parts of the jungle afford grazing
                    grounds for cattle. The only other elevated tract in the district is on the
                    southern border, where the Susang hills rise. They are for the most part covered
                    with thick thorny jungle, but in parts are barren and rocky. The Jamunà forms
                    the western boundary of Maimansinh for a course of 94 miles. It is <pb

                    year; and during the rainy season it expands in many places to 5 or 6 miles in
                    breadth, overflowing a considerable portion of low-lying land. The Brahmaputra
                    enters Maimansinh at its north-western corner near Karâibari, and flows
                    south-east and south till it joins the Meghnâ a little below Bhairab Bâzâr. The
                    gradual formation of <hi rend="italic">chars</hi> and bars of sand in the upper
                    part of its course has diverted the main volume of water into the present
                    channel of the Jamunâ, which has in consequence become of much more importance
                    than the Brahmaputra proper. The Meghnà only flows through the south-east
                    portion of the district for a short distance. The eastern and south-eastern
                    parts of the district abound in marshes. The wild animals include tigers,
                    leopards, deer, bears, elephants, and an occasional rhinoceros. Small game is
                    abundant.</p>
                <p>The census of 1872 returned the population of Maimansinh at 2,349,917 (males,
                    1,187,962; and females, 1,161,955),—Mohammedans numbering 1,519,635; Hindus,
                    817,963; Christians, 124. Of aboriginal tribes the most numerous are the Hajongs
                    (24,936) and Gâros (10,997). The semi-Hinduized aborigines number in all
                    205,592, of whom more than one-half are Chandäls (123,262), the most numerous
                    caste in the district, employed as cultivators, fishermen, labourers, and menial
                    servants. Among high-caste Hindus, Brahmans number 33,414. Five towns contain
                    upwards of 5000 inhabitants:—Maimansinh or Nasirabâd, 10,068; Jamalpur, 14,302;
                    Kisoriganj, 13,637; Sherpùr, 8015; and Dhanikhola, 6730. Ulakandi or Bhairab
                    Bazar, although with only a population of 1500, is the most important commercial
                    mart, with a large trade in jute and a well-supplied cattle-market. Rice, of
                    which three crops are raised annually, forms the staple food crop of the
                    district. Other agricultural products are wheat, oats, maize, pulses, linseed,
                    mustard, <hi rend="italic">til,</hi> indigo, tobacco, sugarcane, <hi
                        rend="italic">pdn,</hi> and jute. The last constitutes the chief commercial
                    staple. Maimansinh suffers occasionally from blights and floods, but never to
                    any serious extent. The chief imports are piece goods, raw cotton, wheat, betel
                    nuts, chillies, sugar, and cattle; the exports consist of rice, jute, indigo,
                    reed-mats, hides, brass and copper utensils, cheese, <hi rend="italic">ghi,</hi>
                    &amp;c. Tobacco and muslins are also exported to a small extent. Besides a
                    little muslin, the only manufactures are coarse silk cloth, <hi rend="italic"
                        >sitalpati</hi> mats, cheese, and <hi rend="italic">ghi.</hi> Apart from the
                    rivers, means of communication are afforded by about 146 miles of good and 124
                    miles of inferior roads. Although the general revenue (£166,938 in 1880-81) has
                    more than doubled in seventy-five years, the land revenue has remained almost
                    stationary; in 1880-81 it was only £75,226, excise amounting to £23,652, and
                    stamps to £48,680. Education in 1872-73 was afforded by 173 state-supported
                    schools attended by 6372 pupils, besides 71 unaided schools, with 2425 pupils.
                    Except towards the close of the rainy season, the climate is fairly healthy. The
                    average annual rainfall is 105 inches.</p>
