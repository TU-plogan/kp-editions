                    name was Carlet, but who after the loose fashion of the period assumed the
                    surname of Chamblain, and then, finding that others of his class had chosen the
                    same, superadded that of Marivaux. Μ. Carlet de Marivaux, however, was a man of
                    good reputation, and he received the appointment of director of the mint at Riom
                    in Auvergne, where and at Limoges the young Pierre was brought up. It is said
                    that he developed literary tastes early, and wrote his first play, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Père</hi><hi rend="italic">Prudent</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">Equitable,</hi> when he was only eighteen; it was not,
                    however, published till 1712, when he was twenty-four. His chief attention in
                    those early days was paid to novel writing, not the drama. In the three years
                    from 1713 to 1715 he produced three novels— <hi rend="italic">Les Effets
                    Surprenantes de la Sympathie, La Voiture Embourbée,</hi> and a book which had
                    three titles <hi rend="italic">Pharsamon,</hi><hi rend="italic">Les
                    Folies</hi><hi rend="italic">Romanesques,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Don</hi><hi rend="italic">Quichotte Moderne.</hi> All these books
                    were in a curious strain, not in the least resembling the pieces which long
                    afterwards were to make his reputation, but following partly the Spanish
                    romances and partly the heroic novels of the preceding century, with a certain
                    intermixture of the marvellous. Then Marivaux’s literary ardour took a new
                    phase. He fell under the influence of La Motte, and thought to serve the cause
                    of that ingenious paradoxer by travestying Homer, an ignoble task, which he
                    followed up by performing the same office in regard to Fénelon. His friendship
                    for La Motte, however, introduced him to the <hi rend="italic">Mercure,</hi> the
                    chief newspaper of France, where in 1717 he produced various articles of the
                    “Spectator” kind, which were distinguished by much keenness of observation and
                    not a little literary skill. It was at this time that the peculiar style called
                    Marivaudage first made its appearance in him. The year 1720 and those
                    immediately following were very important ones for Marivaux; not only did he
                    produce a comedy, now lost except in small part, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >I.</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Amour</hi><hi rend="italic">et la Vérité,</hi> and
                    another and far better one entitled <hi rend="italic">Arlequin</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Polipar l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Amour</hi>, but he wrote a
                    tragedy, <hi rend="italic">Annibal,</hi> which was and deserved to be
                    unsuccessful. Meanwhile his worldly affairs underwent a sudden revolution. His
                    father had left him a comfortable subsistence, but he was persuaded by friends
                    to risk it in the Mississippi scheme, and after vastly increasing it for a time
                    lost all that he had. His prosperity had enabled him to marry a certain
                    Mademoiselle Martin, of whom much good is said, and to whom he was deeply
                    attached, but who died very shortly. His pen now became almost his sole
                    resource. He had a connexion with both the fashionable theatres, for his <hi
                    rend="italic">Annibal</hi> had been played at the Comédie Française and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Arlequin</hi><hi rend="italic">Poli</hi> at the Comédie Italienne,
                    where at the time a company who were extremely popular, despite their imperfect
                    command of French, were established. He endeavoured too to turn his newspaper
                    practice in the <hi rend="italic">Mercure</hi> to more account by starting a
                    weekly <hi rend="italic">Spectateur Français,</hi> to which he was the sole
                    contributor. But his habits were the reverse of methodical; the paper appeared
                    at the most irregular intervals; and, though it contained some excellent work,
                    its irregularity killed it. For nearly twenty years the theatre, and especially
                    the Italian theatre, was Marivaux’s chief support, for his pieces, though they
                    were not ill received by the actors at the Français, were rarely successful
                    there. The best of a very large number of plays (Marivaux’s theatre numbers
                    between thirty and forty items) were the <hi rend="italic">Surprise de Γ
                    Amour</hi> (1722), the <hi rend="italic">Triomphe</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">Plutus</hi> (1728), the <hi rend="italic">Jeu de
                    ΓAmour</hi><hi rend="italic">et du Hasard</hi> (1730), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Les</hi><hi rend="italic">Fausses</hi><hi rend="italic">Confidences</hi>
                    (1737), all produced at the Italian theatre, and <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Legs,</hi> produced at the French. Meanwhile <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n578/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0578-0551"/> he had at intervals returned to both his other
                    lines of composition. A periodical publication called <hi rend="italic">I.</hi>
                    ’ <hi rend="italic">Indigent</hi><hi rend="italic">Philosophe</hi> appeared in
                    1727, and another called <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cabinet</hi><hi rend="italic">du Philosophe</hi> in 1734, but the same causes
                    which had proved fatal to the <hi rend="italic">Spectateur</hi> prevented these
                    later efforts from succeeding. In 1731 Marivaux published the first two parts of
                    his best and greatest work, <hi rend="italic">Marianne,</hi> a novel of a new
                    and remarkable kind. As was usual, however, with him when he ventured on any
                    considerable task, he was very slow with it. The eleven parts appeared in
                    batches at intervals during a period of exactly the same number of years, and
                    after all it was left unfinished. In 1735 another novel, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paysan</hi><hi rend="italic">Parvenu,</hi> was begun, but this also was left
                    unfinished. The year afterwards Marivaux, who was then nearly fifty years of
                    age, was elected of the Academy. He survived for more than twenty years, and was
                    not idle, again contributing occasionally to the <hi rend="italic">Mercure,</hi>
                    writing plays, “reflexions” (which were seldom of much worth), and so forth. He
                    died on the 12th February 1763, aged seventy-five years.</p>
                <p>The personal character of Marivaux was curious and somewhat contradictory, though
                    not without analogies, one of the closest of which is to be found in Goldsmith.
                    He was, however, unlike Goldsmith, at least as brilliant in conversation as with
                    the pen. He was extremely good-natured, but fond of saying very severe things,
                    unhesitating in his acceptance of favours (he drew a regular annuity from
                    Helvetius), but exceedingly touchy if he thought himself in any way slighted. He
                    was, though a great cultivator of <hi rend="italic">sensibilité,</hi> on the
                    whole decent and moral in his writings, and was unsparing in his criticism of
                    the rising <hi rend="italic">Philosophes.</hi> This last circumstance, and
                    perhaps jealousy as well, made him a dangerous enemy in Voltaire, who lost but
                    few opportunities of speaking disparagingly of him. Not very much is known of
                    his life, though anecdotes of his sayings are not uncommon. He had good friends,
                    not merely, as has been said, in the rich, generous, and amiable Helvetius, but
                    in Madame de Tencin, in Fontenelle, and even in Madame de Pompadour, who gave
                    him, it is said, a considerable pension, of the source of which he was ignorant.
                    11 is even asserted that annoyance at the discovery of the origin of a benefit
                    which he thought came directly from the king hastened his death; and, though
                    this is scarcely likely, his extreme sensitiveness is shown by many stories, one
                    of which carries out in real life and almost to the letter Farquhar’s famous <hi
                    rend="italic">mot</hi> as to “laughing consumedly.” He had one daughter, who
                    took the veil, the duke of Orleans, the regent’s successor, furnishing her with
                    her dowry.</p>
                <p>We have no space here for a detailed criticism of Marivaux’s extensive work. The
                    so-called Marivaudage is the main point of importance about it, though the best
                    of the comedies have great merits, and <hi rend="italic">Marianne</hi> is an
                    extremely important step in the legitimate development of the French
                    novel,—-legitimate, that is, in opposition to the brilliant but episodic
                    productions of Le Sage. The subject-matter of Marivaux’s peculiar style has been
                    generally and with tolerable exactness described as the metaphysic of
                    love-making. His characters, in a happy phrase of Crebillon’s, not only tell
                    each other and the reader everything they have thought, but everything that they
                    would like to persuade themselves that they have thought. The style chosen for
                    this is justly regarded as derived mainly from Fontenelle, and through him from
                    the Précieuses, though there are traces of it even in La Bruyère. It abuses
                    metaphor somewhat, and delights to turn off a metaphor itself in some unexpected
                    and bizarre fashion. Now it is a familiar phrase which is used where dignified
                    language would be expected; now the reverse. In the same criticism of
                    Crebillon’s which has been already quoted occurs another happy description of
                    Marivaux’s style as being “an introduction to each other of words which have
                    never made acquaintance, and which think that they will not get on together,” a
                    phrase as happy in its imitation as in its satire of the style itself. Yet this
                    fantastic embroidery of language has a certain charm, and suits perhaps better
                    than any other style the somewhat unreal gallantry and <hi rend="italic"
                    >sensibilité</hi> which it describes and exhibits. The author possessed,
                    moreover, both thought and observation, besides considerable command of pathos.
                    He is not, and is never any more likely to be, generally popular, but he is one
                    of the authors in whom those who do like them are sure to take particular
                    delight.</p>
                <p>The best and most complete edition of Marivaux is that of 1781, 12 vols. 8vo.
                    There is a good modem edition of the plays by E. Fonmier, and another of
                    Marianne and the Paysan Parvenu in two volumes. J. Fleury’s Marivaux et le
                    Marivaudage (Paris, 1881) is worth consulting by those who are interested in the
                    subject. . (G. SA.)</p>
