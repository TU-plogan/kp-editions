                    Fleming, the word is written “Martin,” but this form <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    spelling is now generally reserved by way of distinction for the bird (see <hi

                    described, occurs in most Germanic and Romanic languages:—German, <hi

                    known use is in the form <hi rend="italic">martes</hi> (Martial, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ep.</hi> x. 37), but it can scarcely be an old Latin word, as it
                    is not found in Pliny or other classical writers, <pb
                    corresp="kp-eb0915-0603-0576" xml:id="pbn9576"/> and Martial often introduced
                    foreign words into his Latin. Its etymology has been connected with the German
                    “martern,” to torment. A second Romanic name for the same animal is <hi
                    rend="italic">fuina,</hi> in French <hi rend="italic">fouine</hi> (see E. Von

                    is a misnomer, for though somewhat Cat-like in size, general appearance, and
                    habits, its true affinities are not with the <hi rend="italic">Felidae,</hi>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0603-0576"/> a small but well-defined section of the family
                    <hi rend="italic">Mustelidae,</hi> belonging to the Arctoid or Bear-like
                    division of the order <hi rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia,</hi> pp. 439, 440 of the present volume).</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Mustela,</hi> as restricted by Cuvier <hi
                    rend="italic">{Règne</hi><hi rend="italic">Animal,</hi> 1817), contains a very
                    natural assemblage of animals commonly called Martens, Sables, Polecats, Stoats,
                    Ermines, and Weasels, all closely allied in structure and habits. A structural
                    division, however, occurs between the two first-named and all the others,
                    especially shown in the presence of an additional small premolar tooth on each
                    side of each jaw; and, availing himself of this and some other minor characters,
                    Cuvier divided the genus into two subgenera, for the first of which he retained
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Mustela,</hi> and to the second assigned that of
                    <hi rend="italic">Putorvus.</hi> Three years later Nilsson <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Skand. Fauna,</hi> 1820) definitely constituted the two groups into genera,
                    applying to the first the name of <hi rend="italic">Martes,</hi> by which the
                    animals composing it had been generally designated by the Latin-writing
                    zoologists of the preceding century, and keeping <hi rend="italic">Mustela</hi>
                    for the' more typical Weasels and their immediate allies. Later zoologists have
                    been divided between the nomenclature of Cuvier, which has the priority, and
                    that of Nilsson, which on other grounds is preferable. Those who adopt the
                    latter affirm that Cuvier’s names, being only used by him in a subgeneric sense,
                    and not binomially, need not be applied generically; but this is contrary to the
                    practice usually followed in such cases. Others avoid the difficulty by not
                    breaking up the genus at all, and so apply the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mustela</hi> to all the species. The result is that the generic name of the
                    Martens in modern zoological works oscillates between <hi rend="italic"
                    >Martes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mustela,</hi> according to the views of the
                    writer.</p>
                <p>The following characters apply to the restricted group of Martens proper, by
                    whatever name they are called. Body long, slender, and very flexible, though
                    less so than in the true Weasels. Head somewhat triangular; muzzle pointed, the
                    nose extending a little beyond the lips; eyes large and prominent; ears
                    conspicuous, broad, somewhat triangular, rounded at the ends, furred outside and
                    in; limbs short; feet rounded; toes short, five on each foot, all with short,
                    compressed, curved, sharp-pointed claws. Soles densely furred between the naked
                    pads. Tail moderately long, more or less bushy. Outer fur long, strong, and
                    glossy; a very abundant soft under fur.</p>
                <p>Vertebrae: C 7, D 14, I. 6, S 3, C 18-23. Skull elongated and depressed. Facial
                    portion moderate and rather compressed. Zygomata arched and wide but slender.
                    Postorbital processes small. Auditory bullae large, but not very globose.
                    Mandible with a strong triangular vertical coronoid process and a well-developed
                    angular process.</p>

                    >∣</hi><hi rend="italic">, m</hi> ∣; total 38. Upper incisors in a straight
                    transverse line, rather long and compressed; first and second subequal, third
                    considerably larger. Lower incisors very small, especially the first, and
                    crowded together, the second placed rather behind the others. Canines long and
                    sharp-pointed. Upper premolars: first very small, with simple crown and one
                    root; second and third nearly equal in size and two-rooted, with simple
                    compressed sharp-pointed crowns, with very slightly developed accessory cusps;
                    fourth (the sectorial) with blade consisting chiefly of the central and
                    posterior cusps, the anterior being rudimentary, inner tubercle small and
                    confined to the anterior part of the tooth. True molar tubercular, about twice
                    as wide transversely as in the antero-posterior direction, having an outer, more
                    elevated, but smaller portion, bearing three blunt tubercles; to the inner side
                    of this the crown is contracted, and its surface deeply hollowed; it then
                    expands again into a broad low lobe, with the central part elevated, and a
                    raised, even, semicircular, .slightly crenated internal border. Lower premolars:
                    first very small, simple, and one-rooted; second, third, and fourth increasing
                    slightly in size, with high compressed pointed crowns and posterior accessory
                    cusps, best marked in the'third. First molar (sectorial) with well-marked
                    bilobed blade,—heel scarcely more than one-third of the length of the tooth, and
                    a very small inner tubercle. Second molar small, single-rooted, with a low,
                    flattened, subcircular or oval tubercular crown.</p>
                <p>In geographical distribution the Martens are limited to the northern hemisphere,
                    ranging throughout the greater part of the northern temperate regions of both
                    Old and New Worlds, as far north as conditions of existence suited to their
                    habits are met with, and southwards in America to 35° N. lat., while in Asia one
                    species is met with as far as the island of Java.</p>
                <p>The various species appear to be very similar in their habits. They live in woods
                    and rocky places, and are thoroughly arboreal, spending most of their time in
                    trees, although descending to the ground in quest of prey. They climb with great
                    facility, and are agile and graceful in their movements. Some species are said
                    occasionally to resort to berries and other fruit for food, but as a rule they
                    are strictly carnivorous, feeding chiefly on birds and their eggs, small
                    mammals, as squirrels, hares, rabbits, and moles, but chiefly mice of various
                    kinds, of which they destroy great numbers, and occasionally snakes, lizards,
                    and frogs. In proportion to their size they are among the most bloodthirsty of
                    animals, though less so than the true Weasels. The female usually makes her nest
                    of moss, dried leaves, and grass in the hollow of a tree, but sometimes in a
                    hole among rocks or ruined buildings, and produces several young at a birth,
                    usually from four to six. Though wild and untameable to a great degree if
                    captured when fully grown, when taken young they are very docile, and have
                    frequently been made pets of, not having the strong unpleasant odour of the
                    smaller <hi rend="italic">Mustelidae.</hi> The common European Marten appears to
                    have been partially domesticated by the Greeks and Romans, and to have been used
                    to keep houses clear from rats and mice before cats were introduced.<note

                    1868.</p></note> In the same way, according to Hodgson, an allied species, the
                    Yellow-bellied Weasel <hi rend="italic">(Mustela</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >kathialι),</hi> “is exceedingly prized by the Nepalese for its service in
                    ridding houses of rats. It is easily tamed; and such is the dread of it common
                    to all murine animals that not one will approach a house where it is domiciled.”
                    It is, however, to the great value attached to the pelts of these animals that
                    their importance to man is chiefly due. Though all yield fur of serviceable
                    quality, the commercial value varies immensely, not only according to the
                    particular species from which it is obtained, but according to individual
                    variation, depending upon age, sex, season, and other trifling circumstances.
                    The skins from northern regions are more full and of a finer colour and gloss
                    than those from more temperate climates, as are those of animals killed in
                    winter compared to the same individuals in the summer season. The caprices of
                    fashion have, moreover, set wholly factitious values upon slight shades of
                    colour, recognized and named by experienced furriers, but not indicating any
                    specific or other distinctions <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n604/mode/1up"

                    numbers of animals are annually caught, chiefly in traps, to supply the demand
                    of the fur trade, Siberia and North America being the principal localities from
                    which they are obtained.</p>
                <p>With the exception of the Pekan (J∕. <hi rend="italic">penn</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >anti)</hi> all the Martens are so much alike in size, general colouring, and
                    cranial and dental characters that the discrimination of the species, and
                    assignment of the proper geographical distribution to each, has been a subject
                    which has sorely perplexed the ingenuity and patience of zoologists. The
                    following description by Dr Elliott Coues of the external characters of the
                    American Pine Marten (JZ. <hi rend="italic">americana)</hi> will apply almost
                    equally well to most of the others. “It is almost impossible to describe the
                    colour of the Pine Marten, except in general terms, without going into the
                    details of the endless diversities occasioned by age, sex, season, or other
                    incidents. The animal is ‘brown,’ of a shade from orange or tawny to quite
                    blackish; the tail and feet are ordinarily the darkest, the head lightest, often
                    quite whitish; the ears are usually rimmed with whitish; on the throat there is
                    usually a large tawny-yellowish or orange-brown patch, from the chin to the fore
                    legs, sometimes entire, sometimes broken into a number of smaller, irregular
                    blotches, sometimes wanting, sometimes prolonged on the whole under surface,
                    when the animal is bicolor like a Stoat in summer. The general ‘ brown ’ has a
                    greyish cast, as far as the under fur is concerned, and is overlaid with rich
                    lustrous blackish-brown in places where the long bristly hairs prevail. The
                    claws are whitish; the naked nose pad and whiskers are black. The tail
                    occasionally shows interspersed white hairs, or a white tip.”</p>
                <p>The species generally recognized as distinct are the following, the first five
                    belonging to the Old and the last two to the New World.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Mustela</hi><hi rend="italic">foina,</hi> Erxleben; the
                    Beech Marten, Stone Marten, or White-breasted Marten.—Distinguished from the
                    following by the greater breadth of the skull, and some minute but constant
                    dental characters, by the dull greyish-brown colour of the fur of the upper
                    parts, and the pure white of the throat and breast. It inhabits the greater part
                    of the Continent of Europe, but is more southern than the next in its
                    distribution, not being found in Sweden or Norway, nor, according to the recent
                    investigations of Mr Alston, in the British Isles, although included in their
                    fauna by all earlier writers.</p>

                    rend="italic">abietum,</hi> Fleming; the Pine Marten (see figure).—Outer fur
                    rich dark brown; under fur reddish-grey, with clear yellow tips; breast spot
                    usually yellow, varying from bright orange to pale cream-colour or
                    yellowish-white. Length of head and body 16 to 18 inches; of tail (including the
                    hair) 9 to 12 inches. This species is extensively distributed throughout
                    northern Europe and Asia, and was formerly common in most parts of Great Britain
                    and Ireland. Though commonly called “Pine Marten,” it does not appear to have
                    any special preference for coniferous trees, except that, inasmuch as they
                    constitute the greater proportion of the forests of the countries which it
                    inhabits, it is more often met with in them than in any other. With regard to
                    its recent occurrence in the British Isles, Mr Alston writes in <hi
                    rend="italic">Proc, of Zool. Society of London,</hi> 1879 :—</p>
                <p>“Athough greatly reduced in numbers by persecution, it still maintains its ground
                    in the wilder districts of Scotland, the north of England, Wales, and Ireland;
                    and occasionally specimens are killed in counties where the species was thought
                    to have been long extinct. In Scotland it is still found, though comparatively
                    rarely, in the Lews and in most of the Highland mainland counties, being perhaps
                    most abundant in Sutherland and Ross-shire, especially in the deer forests. In
                    the Lowlands a Marten is now a very great rarity; but a fine example was killed
                    in Ayrshire in the winter of 1875-76. In the north of England MrW. A. Durnford
                    says the species is ‘still plentiful’ in the wilder parts of Cumberland,
                    Westmoreland, and Lancashire, and in Lincolnshire several have been recorded,
                    the latest killed in 1865, by Mr Cordeaux.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    1804; but a specimen occurred in Hampshire about forty years ago, and another in
                    Surrey in 1847. In Ireland the following counties were enumerated by Thompson as
                    habitats of this species: Donegal, Londonderry, Antrim, Down, Armagh, Fermanagh,
                    Longford, Galway, Tipperary. Cork, and Kerry. The Cat-crann is probably now a
                    rarer animal in Ireland than it was when Thompson wrote; but it still exists in
                    various districts, especially in County Kerry, whence the society has received
                    several living examples; and Professor A. Leith Adams states that it has been
                    seen of lata years even in county Dublin."</p>

                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Μ. americana,</hi> Turton; the North-American Sable or
                    Marten.—A species so closely allied to the European Pine.Marten and Asiatic
                    Sable that it is very difficult to assign constant distinguishing characters
                    between them. The importance of the fur of this animal as an article of commerce
                    may be judged of from the fact that 15,000 skins were sold in one year by the
                    Hudson’s Bay Company as long ago as 1743, and the more recent annual imports
                    into Great Britain have exceeded 100,000. It is ordinarily caught in wooden
                    traps of very simple construction, being little enclosures of stakes or brush in
                    which the bait is placed upon a trigger, with a short upright stick supporting a
                    log of wood, which falls upon its victim on the slightest disturbance. A line of
                    such traps, several to a mile, often extends many miles. The bait is any kind of
                    meat, a mouse, squirrel, piece of fish, or bird’s head. It is principally
                    trapped during the colder months, from October to April, when the fur is in good
                    condition, as it is nearly valueless during the shedding in summer. Dr Coues
                    tells us that, notwithstanding the persistent and uninterrupted destruction to
                    which the American Sable is subjected, it does not appear to diminish materially
                    in numbers in unsettled parts of the country. It holds its own partly in
                    consequence of its shyness, which keeps it away from the abodes of men, and
                    partly because it is so prolific, bringing forth six to eight young at a litter.
                    Its home is sometimes a den under ground or beneath rocks, but offener the
                    hollow of a tree, and it is said frequently to take forcible possession of a
                    squirrel’s nest, driving off or devouring the rightful proprietor.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Μ. pennanti,</hi> Erxleben; the Pekan or Pennant’s Marten,
                    also called Fisher Marten, though there appears to be nothing in its habits to
                    justify the appellation. This is the largest species of the group, the head and
                    body measuring from 24 to 30 inches, and the tail 14 to 18 inches. It is also
                    more robust in form than the-others, its general aspect being more that of a Fox
                    than a Weasel; in fact its usual name among the American hunters is ‘ ‘ Black
                    Fox.’* Its general colour is blackish, lighter by mixture of brown or grey on
                    the head and upper fore part of the body, with no light patch on the throat, and
                    unlike the other Martens generally darker below than above. It was generally
                    distributed in wooded districts throughout the greater part of North America, as
                    far north as Great Slave Lake, lat. 63° N., and Alaska, and extending south to
                    the parallel of 35°; but at the present time it is almost exterminated in the
                    settled parts of the United States east of the Mississippi.</p>
