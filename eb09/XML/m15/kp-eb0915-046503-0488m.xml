                    tho Manchus, an epithet meaning “Pure,” chosen by the founder of the dynasty
                    which now rules over Manchuria and China as an appropriate designation for his
                    family. Manchuria as it has existed for upwards of two centuries, that is to say
                    since it has had an historical existence, is a tract of country lying in a
                    north-easterly and southwesterly direction between 38° 40' and 49° N. lat. and
                    120° and 133° E. long., and is wedged in between China and Mongolia on the west
                    and north-west, and Corea and the Russian territory on the Amur on the east and
                    north. Speaking more definitely, it is bounded on the N. by the Amur, on the E.
                    by the Usuri, on the S. by the Gulf of Leaou-tung, the Yellow Sea, and Corea,
                    and on the W. by the river Nonni and a line of palisades which stretch from
                    Kwan-chung-tsze to the Great Wall of China. The territory thus defined is about
                    800 miles in length and 500 miles in width, and contains about 390,000 square
                    miles. It is divided into three provinces, viz., Tsitsihar or Northern
                    Manchuria, Kirin or Central Manchuria, and Leaou-tung or Southern Manchuria.
                    Physically the country is divided into two regions, the one a series of mountain
                    ranges occupying the northern and eastern portions of the kingdom, and. the
                    other a plain which stretches southwards from Moukden, the capital, to the Gulf
                    of Leaou-tung. Speaking generally, the mountains run in a direction parallel
                    with the lie of the country, and are interspersed with numerous and fertile
                    valleys, more especially on the southern and eastern slopes, where the summer
                    sun brings to rich perfection the fruits of the soil fertilized by the showers
                    of the south monsoon.</p>
                <p>The principal range of mountains is the Shan-a lin, the Chinese <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chang pih Shan,</hi> “the long white mountains.” <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n489/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0489-0466"/> which runs in a north-easterly direction from the
                    shores of the Gulf of Leaou-tung to the mouth of the Amur river. In its course
                    through Northern Manchuria it forms the watershed of the Sungari, Hurka, and
                    Usuri rivers, and in the south that of the Ya-lu, Ta-yang, and many smaller
                    streams. It also forms the eastern boundary of the great plain of Leaou-tung.
                    The mountains of this range reach their greatest height on the south-east of
                    Kirin, where their snow-capped peaks rise to the elevation of from 10,000 to
                    12,000 feet. The scenery among them is justly celebrated for the grandeur of its
                    beauty, more especially in the neighbourhood of Hatching, Siu-yen, and the
                    Corean Gate. Another range forms a parallel line to the Shan-a-lin mountains on
                    their west, and runs from the neighbourhood of the junction of the Hurka and
                    Sungari rivers, passing Kirin, to the plain on the north side of Moukden.</p>
                <p>The three principal rivers of Manchuria are the Sungari, Hurka, and Usuri already
                    mentioned. Of these the Sungari, which is the largest, rises on the northern
                    slopes of the Shan-a-lin range, and runs in a north-westerly direction to its
                    junction with the Nonni, from which point it turns north-east until it empties
                    itself into the Amur. It is navigable by native junks above Kirin, to which city
                    also the Russians have succeeded in travelling on it by steamer. In its long
                    course it varies greatly both in depth and width, in some parts being only a few
                    feet deep and spreading out to a width of more than a mile, while in other and
                    mountainous portions of its course its channel is narrowed to 300 or 400 feet,
                    and its depth is increased in inverse ratio. The Usuri rises in about 44° N.
                    lat. and 13l <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> E. long., and, after running a
                    northeasterly course for nearly 500 miles, it also loses itself in the Amur. The
                    Hurka takes its rise, like the Sungari, on the northern slopes of the Shan-a-lin
                    range, and not far form the sources of that river. It takes a north-easterly
                    course as far as the city of Ninguta, at which point it turns northward, and so
                    continues until it joins the Sungari at San-sing. It is navigable by junks
                    between that city and Ninguta, though the torrents in its course make the voyage
                    backwards and forwards one of considerable difficulty. Next in importance to
                    these rivers are the Leaou and Ta-yang, the former of which rises in Mongolia,
                    and after running in an easterly direction for about 400 miles enters Manchuria
                    in about 43° N. lat., and turning southward empties itself into the Gulf of
                    Leaou-tung. In bygone days large junks were able to sail up it as far as
                    New-chwang, but owing to the silting up of the bed it is not now navigable for
                    any but small boats beyond Ying-tsze, where the foreign settlement is situated.
                    The Ta-yang rises on the southern slopes of the Shan-a-lin mountains, and flows
                    southward into the Yellow Sea.</p>
                <p>Moukden, or as it is called by the Chinese Shing-yang, the capital city of
                    Manchuria, is situated in the province of Leaou-tung, in 41° 40' N. lat. and
                    130° 30' E. long. It occupies a fine position on the river Shin, an affluent of
                    the Leaou, and is a city with considerable pretensions to grandeur. The city
                    wall presents a handsome appearance, and is pierced by eight gates. Like Peking,
                    the town possesses a drum tower and a huge bell. The streets are broad and well
                    laid out, and the shops are well supplied with both native and foreign goods.
                    The population is estimated at about 200,000, including that of the suburbs, the
                    richest and most extensive of which are on the western and southern faces of the
                    city. Leaou-yang, which was once the capital of the country, also stands in the
                    province of Leaou-tung, but it is not now a place of much importance. Such trade
                    as there is is carried on in the centre of the city, the remaining portions
                    being open, having been turned into vegetable gardens. The other cities in the
                    province are King-chow·foo on the west of the Gulf of Leaou-tung; Kin-chow, on
                    the western extremity of the Leaou-tung peninsula; Kai-chow, on the
                    north-western shore of the same peninsula; Hai-ching, on the road from Ying-tsze
                    to Moukden; Ki-yuen, a populous and prosperous city in the north of the
                    province; and Hing-king, on the northern slope of the Shan-a-lin mountains,
                    which is famous, rather from the fact that it was the original seat of the
                    founders of the present dynasty than for any pretensions to present importance.
                    The most important commercial place, however, is the treaty port of Ying-tsze,
                    which is situated at the head of the Gulf of Leaou-tung. The main street, which
                    is lined with shops and warehouses, is 2 miles in length, and the trade there
                    carried on is very considerable. According to the custom-house returns the value
                    of the foreign imports and exports in the year 1880 was £691,954 and £1,117,790
                    respectively, besides a large native trade carried on in junks. The population
                    of the whole province of Leaou-tung is estimated to be about 12,000,000.</p>
                <p>The province of Kirin, or Central Manchuria, is bounded on the N. and N.W. by the
                    Sungari, on the S. by Leaou-tung and Corea, on the W. by the line of palisades
                    already spoken of, and on the E. by the Usuri and the maritime Russian
                    provinces. It contains an area of about 135,000 square miles, and is entirely
                    mountainous with the exception of a stretch of plain country in its
                    north-western corner. This plain produces large quantities of indigo and opium,
                    and is physically remarkable for the number of isolated conical hills which dot
                    its surface. These sometimes occur in a direct line at intervals of 15 or 20
                    miles, and elsewhere are scattered about “like dish-covers on a table.” Kirin,
                    the capital of the province, is situated in about 43° 40' N. lat. and 126° 50'
                    E. long., and occupies a magnificent position, being surrounded on the north,
                    west, and south by a semicircular range of mountains with the broad stream of
                    the Sungari flowing across the front. The local trade is considerable, and is
                    benefited by the presence of large junk-building yards, which, owing to the
                    abundance and cheapness of wood, have been established there, and from which the
                    place has derived its Chinese name of Chuen-chang or “shipyard.” The town has a
                    well-to-do appearance, and in summer time the houses and shops are gaily
                    decorated with flowers brought from the sunny south. Ashehoh, on the Ashe, with
                    its population of 40,000·; Petuna, <hi rend="italic">Sinice</hi> Sing-chung, on
                    the Sungari, population 30,000; San-sing, near the junction of the Sungari and
                    Hurka; La-lin, 120 miles to the north of Kirin, population 20,000; and Ninguta,
                    are the other principal cities in the province.</p>
                <p>Tsi-tsi-har, or Northern Manchuria, which contains about 195,000 square miles, is
                    bounded on the N. and N.E. by the Amur, on the S. by the Sungari, and on the W.
                    by the Nonni and Mongolia. This province is thinly populated, and is cultivated
                    only along the lines of its rivers. The only towns of any importance are
                    Tsitsihar and Mergen, both situated on the Nonni.</p>
                <p>Four principal highways traverse Manchuria. The first runs from Peking to Kirin
                    <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Moukden, where it sends off a branch to Corea. At
                    Kirin it bifurcates, one branch going to San-sing, the extreme north-eastern
                    town of the province of Kirin, and the other to Poissiet on the coast <hi
                    rend="italic">via</hi> Ninguta. The second road runs from the treaty port of
                    Ying-tsze through Moukden to Petuna in the northwestern corner of the Kirin
                    province and thence to Tsitsihar, Mergen, and the Amur. The third also starts
                    from Ying-tsze, and strikes southward to Kin-chow at the extremity of the
                    Leaou-tung peninsula. And the fourth connects Ying-tsze with the Gate of
                    Corea.</p>
                <p>The great plain in Leaou-tung is in many parts swampy, and in the neighbourhood
                    of the sea, where the soil emits a saline exudation<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n490/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0490-0467"/> such as is also common in the north of China, it
                    is perfectly sterile. In other parts fine crops of millet and various kinds of
                    grain are grown, and on it trees flourish abundantly.</p>
                <p>The climate over the greater part of the country varies between the two extremes
                    of heat and cold, the thermometer ranging between 90° in the summer and 10“
                    below zero in the winter. As in the north of China, the rivers are frozen up
                    during the four winter months. After a short spring the heat of summer succeeds,
                    which in its turn is separated by an autumn of six weeks’ duration from snow and
                    ice. The trees and plants are much the same as those common in England, and
                    severe as the weather is in winter the less elevated mountains are covered to
                    their summits with trees. The wild animals also are those known in Europe, with
                    the addition of tigers and panthers. Bears, wild boars, hares, wolves, foxes,
                    and wild cats are very common, and, in the north, sables are found in great
                    numbers. One of the most noticeable of the birds is the Mongolian lark <hi
                    rend="italic">{Melanocoryphya mongolica</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    y</hi><hi rend="italic">),</hi> which is found in a wild state both in Manchuria
                    and in the desert of Mongolia. This bird is exported in large numbers to
                    northern China, where it is much prized on account of the extraordinary power it
                    possesses of imitating the songs of other birds, the different tones of the
                    barks of dogs, and the mews and hisses of cats, as well as all the noises
                    peculiar to the neighbourhood in which it lives. The Manchurian crane is common,
                    as also are eagles, cuckoos, laughing doves, &amp;c. Insects, of which there
                    are, according to the Russians, one thousand different species, abound, owing to
                    the swampy nature of much of the country. The rivers are well stocked with fish,
                    especially with salmon, which forms a common article of food among the people.
                    In such immense shoals do these fish appear in some of the smaller streams that
                    numbers are squeezed out on to the banks and there perish. This fact possibly
                    gave rise to the legend of a certain Prince whose royal mother became pregnant
                    by the influence of the rays of the sun, and who brought forth an egg from which
                    the prince was sprung. His supernatural origin excited the alarm of the king’s
                    ministers, who advised that he should be put to death, but his mother, having
                    warning of their intention, sent him away privately. This Manchurian Phaeton
                    thereupon wandered forth, and in his travels came to a river having neither
                    bridge nor ferry. In his difficulty he cried for help to his father the Sun, and
                    instantly fishes rose to the surface of the water and formed themselves into
                    such close array that the prince was able to walk to the opposite bank on their
                    backs.</p>
                <p>In minerals Manchuria is very rich: coal, gold, iron (as well as magnetic iron
                    ore), and precious stones are found in quantities which suggest that if better
                    appliances were employed than are now in use the returns might be very
                    large.</p>
                <p>Of the crops grown by the people indigo and opium are the most lucrative. The
                    indigo plant is grown in large quantities in the plain country to the north of
                    Moukden, and is transported thence to the coast in carts, each of which carries
                    rather more than a ton weight of the dye. The poppy is cultivated wherever it
                    will grow, the crop being far more profitable than that of any other product.
                    Cotton, tobacco, pulse, millet, wheat, and barley are other crops grown by the
                    Manchurian farmers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Manchow, or more correctly Manchu, is, as has
                    been said, not the name of the country but of the people who inhabit it. The
                    name is a modern one, having been adopted by a ruler who rose to power in the
                    beginning of the 13th century. Before that time the Manchus were more or less a
                    shifting population, with no fixed location, and, being broken uρ into a number
                    of tribes, they went mainly under the distinctive name of those clans which at
                    different periods exercised lordship over them. Thus under the Chow dynasty
                    (1122-225 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> we find them spoken of as Sewshin, and
                    at subsequent periods they were known as Yih-low, Wuh-keih, Moh-hoh, Pohai,
                    Niichin, and according to the Chinese historians also as K’etan. Throughout
                    their history they appear as a rude people, the tribute they brought to the
                    Chinese court consisting of stone arrow-heads, hawks, gold, and latterly
                    ginseng. Assuming that, as the Chinese say, the K’etans were Manchus, the first
                    appearance of the Manchus, as a people, in China dates from the beginning of the
                    10th century, when K’etans having first conquered the kingdom of Pohai crossed
                    the frontier into China and established the Leaou or Iron dynasty in the
                    northern portion of the empire. These invaders were in their turn overthrown two
                    centuries later by another invasion from Manchuria. These new conquerors were
                    Nüchins, and, therefore, direct ancestors of the Manchus. On assuming the
                    imperial yellow in China, their chief a Iopted the title of Kin or “Golden” for
                    his dynasty. ’ ‘ Iron” (Leaou), he said, “rusts, but gold always keeps its
                    purity and colour, therefore my dynasty shall be called Kin. Ina little more
                    than a century, however, the Kins were driven out of China by the Mongols under
                    Jenghiz Khan. But before the close Of their rule a miraculous event occurred on
                    the Shan-a-lin mountains which is popularly believed to have laid the seeds of
                    the greatness of the present rulers of the empire. Three heaven-born maidens, so
                    runs the legend, were bathing one day in a lake under the Shan-a-lin mountains
                    when a passing magpie dropped a ripe red fruit into the lap of one of them. The
                    maiden ate the fruit, and in due course a child was born to her, whom she named
                    Aisin Gioro, or the Golden. When quite a lad Aisin Gioro was elected chief over
                    three contending clans, and established his capital at Otole near the Shan-a-lin
                    mountains. His reign, however, was not of long duration, for his subjects rose
                    against him and murdered him, together with all his sons except the youngest,
                    Fancha, who, like the infant Haitu in Mongolian history, was miraculously saved
                    from his pursuers. Nothing is recorded of the facts of Aisin Gioro’s reign
                    except that he named the people over whom he reigned Mancl∣u, or “Pure.” His
                    descendants, through the rescued Fancha, fell into complete obscurity until
                    about the middle of the 16th century, when one of them, Norhachi by name, a
                    chieftain of a small tribe, rose to power. Taking advantage of the shifting
                    scenes of Manchurian politics, Norhachi played with skill and daring the rôle
                    which had been played by Jenghiz Khan more than three centuries before in
                    Mongolia. With even greater success than his Mongolian counterpart, Norhachi
                    drew tribe after tribe under his sway, and after numerous wars with Corea and
                    Mongolia, he established his rule over the whole of Manchuria. Being thus the
                    sovereign of an empire, he, again like Jenghiz Khan, adopted for himself the
                    title of Ying-ming, “Brave and Illustrious,” and took for his reign the title of
                    T’een-ming. Thirteeen years later, in 1617, after numerous border fights with
                    the Chinese, Norhachi drew up a list of “seven hates,” or indictments, against
                    his southern neighbours, and, not getting the satisfaction he demanded, declared
                    war against them. The progress of this war, the hastily patched up peace, the
                    equally hasty alliance and its consequences, being matters of Chinese history,
                    have been treated cf under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">China.</hi></p>
                <p>At the present day the Manchus are rapidly dying out before the quietly advancing
                    Chin⅜se settlers. By far the greater number of the present inhabitants of
                    Manchuria are Chinamen. The Chinese system of education is adopted everywhere
                    throughout the country; the Chinese language is taught in all the schools; and
                    Manchuria promises to become before long as much a Chinese province as Chih-le
                    or Shantung.</p>
