                    various appointments in the civil service of Savoy, finally becoming a member of
                    the senate. In 1786 he married Françoise de Morand. The invasion and annexation
                    of Savoy by the French Republicans made him an exile. He did not take refuge in
                    that part of the king of Sardinia’s domains which was for the time spared', but
                    betook himself to the as yet neutral territory of Lausanne. There, in 1796, he
                    published his first important work (he had previously ’ written certain
                    discourses, pamphlets, letters, &amp;c.), <hi rend="italic">Considérations sur
                    la</hi><hi rend="italic">France.</hi> In this he developed his views, which were
                    those of a Legitimist, but a Legitimist entirely from the religious and Roman
                    Catholic point of view. The philosophism of the 18th century, as shown in its
                    political views, or rather the second as a consequence of the first, was Joseph
                    de Maistre’s life-long object of assault.</p>
                <p>After the still further losses which, in the year of the publication of this
                    book, the French Revolution inflicted on Sardinia, Charles Emmanuel summoned
                    Joseph de Maistre to Turin, and he remained there for the brief space during
                    which the king retained a remnant of territory on the mainland. Then he went to
                    the island of Sardinia itself, <pb break="no"

                    appointed envoy extraordinary an! minister plenipotentiary at St Petersburg, and
                    journeyed thither the next year. Although his post was no sinecure, its duties
                    were naturally less engrossing than the official life, with intervals of uneasy
                    exile and travelling, which he had hitherto known, and his literary activity was
                    great. He only published a single treatise, on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principe</hi><hi rend="italic">générateur</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Constitutions;</hi> but he wrote his best and most famous works, <hi
                    rend="italic">Du Pape, De V</hi><hi rend="italic">Église Gallicane,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Soirées</hi><hi rend="italic">de St</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pétersbourg,</hi> the last of which was never finished. <hi rend="italic">Du
                    Pape,</hi> which the second-named book completes, is a treatise in regular form,
                    dealing with the relations of the sovereign pontiff to the church, to temporal
                    sovereigns, to civilization generally, and to schismatics, especially Anglicans
                    and the Greek Church. It is written from the highest possible standpoint of
                    papal absolutism. The <hi rend="italic">Soirées</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    St</hi><hi rend="italic">Pétersbourg,</hi> so far as it is anything (for the
                    arrangement is somewhat desultory), is a kind of <hi rend="italic"
                    >théodicée,</hi> dealing with the fortunes of virtue and vice in this world. It
                    contains two of De Maistre’s most famous pieces, his panegyric on the
                    executioner as the foundation of social order, and his acrimonious, and in part
                    unfair, but also in part very damaging, attack on Locke. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Du Pape</hi> is dated May 1817; on the <hi rend="italic">Soirées</hi> the
                    author was still engaged at his death. Besides these works he wrote an
                    examination of the philosophy of Bacon, some letters on the Inquisition (an
                    institution which, as maybe guessed from the remarks just noticed about the
                    executioner, was no stumbling-block to him), and, earlier than any of these, a
                    translation of Plutarch’s “Essay on the Delay of Divine Justice,” with somewhat
                    copious notes. After 1815 he returned to Savoy, and was appointed to high
                    office, while his <hi rend="italic">Du Pape</hi> made a great sensation. But the
                    world to which he had returned was not altogether in accordance with his
                    desires. He had domestic troubles; and chagrin of one sort and another is said
                    to have had not a little to do with his death by paralysis at no very advanced
                    age. Most of the works mentioned were not published till after his death, and it
                    was not till 1851 that a collection of <hi rend="italic">Lettres et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Opuscules</hi> appeared, while even since that time fresh matter
                    has been published.</p>
                <p>Joseph de Maistre was one of the fnost powerful, and by far the ablest, of the
                    leaders of the Neo-Catholic and anti-revolutionary movement The most remarkable
                    thing about his standpoint is that, layman as he was, it was entirely
                    ecclesiastical. Unlike his contemporary Bonald, Joseph de Maistre regarded the
                    temporal monarchy as an institution of altogether inferior importance to the
                    spiritual primacy of the pope. He was by no means a political absolutist, except
                    in so far as he regarded obedience as the first of political virtues, and be
                    seldom loses an opportunity of stipulating for a tempered monarchy. But the
                    pope’s power is not to be tempered at all, either by councils or by the temporal
                    power or by national churches, least of all by private judgment. The peculiarity
                    of Joseph de Maistre is that he supports his conclusions, or if it be preferred
                    his paradoxes, by the hardest and heaviest argument. Although a great master of
                    rhetoric, he never makes rhetoric do duty for logic. Every now and then it is
                    possible to detect fallacies in him, but for the most part he has succeeded in
                    carrying matters back to those fundamental differences of opinion which hardly
                    admit of argument, and on which men take sides in consequence chiefly of natural
                    bent, and of predilection for one state of things rather than for another. The
                    absolute necessity of order may be said to have been the first principle of this
                    thinker. He could not conceive such order without a single visible authority,
                    reference to which should settle all dispute. He saw that there could be no such
                    temporal head, and in the pope he thought that he saw a spiritual substitute.
                    The anarchic tendencies of the revolution in politics and religion were what
                    offended him. It ought to be added that he was profoundly and accurately learned
                    in history and philosophy, and that the superficial blunders of the 18th century
                    <hi rend="italic">philosophes</hi> irritated him as much as their doctrines. To
                    Voltaire in particular he shows no mercy.</p>
