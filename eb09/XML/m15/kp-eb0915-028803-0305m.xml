                    (1804-1866), “Father Prout,” Roman Catholic priest, scholar, journalist,
                    song-writer, and humorist, was born at Cork of a respectable middleclass family
                    in 1804. His classical education was chiefly obtained at a Jesuit college at
                    Amiens, and after studying theology at Paris he received clerical ordination,
                    and served in Switzerland and Ireland. He then came to London, and officiated
                    for some time in the chapel of the Bavarian Legation. While there he fell in
                    with the coterie of wits and men of letters who were then engaged on <hi
                    rend="italic">Fraser's Magazine,</hi> and, soon finding their society and
                    pursuits more congenial to him than those of the Romish priesthood, he, about
                    1834, began to contribute his celebrated Prout papers to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fraser.</hi> These consist principally of translations of well-known English
                    songs into Latin, Greek, French, and Italian verse, which he humorously
                    represents as being the true originals from which the English authors had merely
                    plagiarized them. The songs of France, and those of modern and ancient Italy
                    (including among the latter many most felicitous renderings of Horace’s odes),
                    were then given in English versions, accompanied by a running commentary full of
                    queer humour and often acute criticism. Prout’s translations have been
                    universally admired for the extraordinary command which they display of the
                    various languages into which his renderings are made, and for their spirit and
                    freedom both of thought and expression. Perhaps, however, the wonder at his
                    polyglott learning has led to less attention than is deserved being paid to the
                    remarkable excellence of many of his English versions of French and Latin odes.
                    In happy abandon they are often almost unequalled, and most of them have all the
                    unfettered character of original compositions. It might have been expected that
                    with his great gift of poetical expression he would have left behind him more of
                    what was exclusively his own. What he has given us in this line tends chiefly to
                    show that with all his sarcastic and cynical wit his genius had also its tender,
                    serious, and sentimental side. His “Bells of Shandon” have always been greatly
                    admired; and “The Mistletoe,” “The Redbreast of Aquitaine,” “The Lady of Lee,”
                    and the “Legend of Arethusa” are not without a certain sweetness and beauty. In
                    1846 Mahony became “own correspondent” at Rome to the <hi rend="italic">Daily
                    News,</hi> and his letters from that capital gave very vivid pictures, and
                    contain much valuable and interesting information, of the first years, so full
                    of liberal promise, of the reign of Pius IX. The last twelve or fifteen years of
                    his life were spent at Paris, from which he supplied the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Globe</hi> with a series of piquant letters on the incidents of the day. His
                    death took place in May 1866. Mahony was not less distinguished as a
                    conversationalist than as a writer. He had great stores of very various
                    knowledge, had seen much of the world, and had a quick power of repartee and no
                    end of sharp cynical wit. It is difficult to suppose that he could ever have
                    been in his true place as a priest of the Roman Catholic Church. Bohemian as he
                    was, however, he never separated himself from it, or seems to have lost his
                    attachment to it; and it is creditable to his character that, though living much
                    among scorners and indifferentists, he would never suffer injurious reflexions
                    either upon his church or upon Christianity to pass without sharp rebuke.</p>
