                <p><label type="entry">MANISTEE</label>, a city of the United States, the county
                    seat of Manistee county, Michigan, is situated 135 miles north-west of Lansing,
                    on the east side of Lake Michigan, at the mouth of the Manistee river, which is
                    navigable for vessels drawing 10 to 12 feet of water for the distance of 1⅜
                    miles to Manistee Lake. It is a great seat of the lumber trade, shipping
                    annually 200,000,∙000 feet of timber, and having a score of saw-mills and about
                    as many shingle mills, the latter of which produce in the year 400,000,000
                    shingles,—the largest quantity made at any one place in the world. Planing-mills
                    and foundries are also maintained; and, in consequence of the discovery in 1881
                    of a bed of solid salt 30 feet thick, extensive salt factories are being built.
                    The surrounding district is especially adapted for fruit-growing; and sportsmen
                    are attracted to the Manistee river and its tributaries by the abundance of the
                    rarely found grayling. The population, 3373 in 1870, was 7080 in 1880.</p>
                <p>, MANITOBA, one of the western provinces of the Dominion of Canada, is situated
                    midway between the Atlantic and the Pacific coasts of the Dominion, about 1090
                    miles due west of Quebec (see vol. iv. plate xxxv.). It is bounded on the S. by
                    the parallel 49° N. lat., which divides it from the United States; on the W. by
                    101° 20' W. long; on the N. by 52° 50' N. lat.; and on the E. by the western
                    boundary of Ontario. Manitoba formerly belonged to the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hudson’s Bay Company</hi> (γ.u), and was, after the transfer of their territory
                    to Canada, admitted in 1870 as the fifth province of the Dominion. At that time
                    the infant province had an area of 13,500 square miles, and some 12,000 people,
                    chiefly Indian half-breeds. In 1881 the limits were increased to the extent
                    indicated above, and now contain, taking the Lake of the Woods as the eastern
                    boundary, upwards of 80,000 square miles, an area only 8782 square miles less
                    than that of England and Scotland together, extending 264 miles from north to
                    south and upwards of 300 from east to west. The old district of Assiniboia, the
                    result of the efforts in colonization by the earl of Selkirk in 1811 and
                    succeeding years, was the nucleus of the province. Manitoba was so called by the
                    Dominion parliament after the lake of that name; the designation is usually
                    considered to be a compound of the Ojibway words, Manito, great spirit, and
                    Waba, straits between lakes, or a word meaning echo.</p>
                <p>The drainage of Manitoba is entirely north-eastward to Hudson’s Bay. The three
                    lakes—whose greatest lengths are 250, 150, and 130 miles respectively—are
                    Winnipeg, Winnipegoosis, and Manitoba. They are all of a very varying and
                    irregular shape, but average respectively 30, 18, and 10 miles in width. They
                    are fresh, shallow, and tideless. Winnipegoosis and Manitoba at high water, in
                    spring time, discharge their overflow through small streams into Winnipeg. The
                    chief rivers emptying into Lake Winnipeg are the Winnipeg, the Red, and the
                    Saskatchewan. The Assiniboine river, with its source in the province, and
                    navigable from 250 to 350 miles for steamers of light draught, enters the Red
                    river 45 miles from Lake Winnipeg, and at the confluence of the rivers (“The
                    Forks”) is situated the city of Winnipeg. The Winnipeg, which flows from the
                    territory lying southeast of Lake Winnipeg, is a noble river some 200 miles
                    long, that after leaving Lake of the Woods, dashes with its clear water over
                    many cascades, and traverses very beautiful scenery. At its falls from Lake of
                    the Woods is one of the greatest and most easily utilized water-powers in the
                    world. Like most rivers in the New World, the Red river is at intervals of years
                    subject to freshets. In the seventy years’ experience of the Selkirk colonists
                    there have been four “floods.” The highest level of the site of the city of
                    Winnipeg is said to have been under 5 feet of water for several weeks in May and
                    June in 1826, under 2⅜ feet in 1852, not covered in 1861, and only under water
                    on the lowest levels in 1882. The extent of overflow has thus on each occasion
                    been less. The loose soil on the banks of the river is every year carried away
                    in great masses, and the channel has so widened as to render the recurrence of
                    an overflow unlikely. The Saskatchewan, though not in the province, empties into
                    Lake Winnepeg less than half a degree from the northern boundary. It is a mighty
                    river, rising in the Rocky Mountains, and crossing eighteen degrees of
                    longitude. Near its mouth are the Grand Rapids. Above these, steamers ply to
                    Fort Edmonton, a point upwards of 800 miles north-west of the city of Winnipeg.
                    Steamers run from Grand Rapids, through Lake Winnipeg, up Red river to the city
                    of Winnipeg.</p>
                <p>Geologically Manitoba may be said to be the resumption of the Secondary rocks
                    left belιind in the fertile portions of Ontario. The whole north-east of North
                    America, running from Labrador, crossing the Ottawa, and skirting the Georgian
                    Bay and Lake Superior, is a region of Laurentian or Primary rocks—containing
                    copper, silver, and probably gold-bearing rocks. From Lake Superior
                    north-westward to within 40 miles of Red river and up to the eastern shore of
                    Lake Winnipeg the same region continues for about 500 miles, including near its
                    western limits the Lake of the Woods. This barren region left behind, the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n514/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0514-0491"/> fertile plains of Manitoba begin—a district
                    resting on Silurian limestones. For 100 or 150 miles these rocks continue. This
                    is the first prairie steppe. At very few points does an outcrop of limestone
                    occur. A range of hills running from south-east to north-west bounds this region
                    on the west. These are Pembina Mountains, Riding Mountains, and Duck Mountain,
                    varying from 200 to 700 feet in height. Before the Riding Mountains are reached,
                    on the shores and islands of Lakes Manitoba and Winnipegoosis are found a few
                    buff-coloured Devonian limestones. From this line of hills westward spreads out
                    the second prairie steppe, extending some 400 or 500 miles. Beyond this for an
                    equal distance, at a still higher elevation, is the third prairie steppe, till
                    the Rocky Mountains are reached. From the Pembina and Riding Mountains to the
                    Rocky Mountains, say 1000 miles, Cretaceous beds underlie the plains and crop
                    out at long intervals. The most striking feature of this formation, of which
                    only the eastern 100 or 150 miles are within Manitoba, is the presence of coal.
                    It is, like most of the Tertiary varieties, a lignite: a specimen analysed gives
                    water 7 ’ 82 per cent., volatile combustible matter 31 ’ 35 per cent., fixed
                    carbon 54 ’ 97 per cent., and ash 5 ’ 86 per cent. The supply of this coal is,
                    according to Professor Selwyn, practically inexhaustible. Mr G. Μ. Dawson,
                    Government explorer, has figured exposures of lignite 1 foot, 7 feet, and even
                    18 feet in thickness in the Souris valley, 250 miles south-west of Winnipeg. As
                    a fuel for domestic purposes, this coal in general answers very well. The drift
                    deposit on the first and second prairie levels varies from 20 to 100 feet, and
                    consists of clay and boulders. A clay lying near the surface is used for making
                    the white brick of which Winnipeg is built. The most recent geologic deposit is
                    a rich vegetable mould, sometimes 4 feet in thickness. It is this that gives the
                    reputation for fertility which the soil of the province enjoys.</p>
                <p>The surface of Manitoba is somewhat level and monotonous. It is chiefly a prairie
                    region* with treeless plains of from 5 to 40 miles extent, covered in summer
                    with an exuberant vegetable growth, which dies every year. The river banks are,
                    however, fringed with trees, and in the more undulating lands the timber belts
                    vary from a few hundreds of yards to 5 or 10 miles in width, forming at times
                    forests of no inconsiderable size. The chief trees of the country are the aspen
                    <hi rend="italic">(Populus</hi><hi rend="italic">tremuloides'),</hi> the
                    ash-leaved maple <hi rend="italic">(Negundo aceroides),</hi> oak <hi
                    rend="italic">(Quercus</hi><hi rend="italic">alba),</hi> elm <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ulmus</hi><hi rend="italic">americana</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi> and many
                    varieties of willow. The strawberry, raspberry, currant, plum, cherry, and grape
                    are indigenous.</p>
                <p>The climate of Manitoba, being that of a region of wide extent and of similar
                    conditions, is not subject to frequent variations. Winter, with cold but clear
                    and bracing weather, usually sets in about the middle of November, and ends with
                    March. In April and May the rivers have opened, the snow has disappeared, and
                    the opportunity has been afforded the farmer of sowing his grain. The month of
                    June is often wet, but most favourable for the springing crops; July and August
                    are warm, but, excepting two or three days at a time, not uncomfortably so;
                    while the autumn months of August and September are very pleasant. Harvest
                    generally extends from the middle of August to near the end of September. The
                    chief crops of the farmer are wheat (which from its flinty hardness and full
                    kernel is the specialty of the Canadian north-west), oats, barley, and pease.
                    Hay is made of the native prairie grasses, which grow luxuriantly. From the
                    richness and mellowness of the soil potatoes and all tap-roots reach a great
                    size. Heavy dews in summer give the needed moisture after the rains of June have
                    ceased. The traveller and farmer are at times annoyed by the mosquito. This
                    troublesome insect is chiefly found near swampy ground or on the uncultivated
                    prairie. It usually continues through June and July.</p>
                <p>The population of the province is very mixed. In 1870 there were 2000 whites and
                    10,000 Indian half-breeds. Of the latter, one half are of English-speaking
                    parentage, and chiefly of Orkney origin; the remainder are known as Metis or
                    Bois-brûlés, and are descended from French-Canadian voyageurs. In 1875 a number
                    of Russian Mennonites (descendants of the Anabaptists of the Reformation) came
                    to the country. Some fifty years ago they originally emigrated from Germany to
                    the plains of southern Russia, but came over to Manitoba to escape the
                    conscription. They number nearly 8000. About 4000 French Canadians, who had
                    emigrated from Quebec to the United States, have also made the province their
                    home, as well as a number of Icelanders. The remainder of the population is
                    chiefly made up of English-speaking people from the other provinces of the
                    Dominion, from the United States, from England and Scotland and the north of
                    Ireland. Though somewhat difficult to estimate, the population of Manitoba is
                    estimated by competent authorities at upwards of 120,000 in 1882.</p>
                <p>In 1881 the religious opinions of the people were as follows :— Episcopalians, 22
                    per cent; Presbyterians, 22; Roman Catholics, 19; Methodists, 14; Baptists, 2⅜;
                    Lutherans, 1⅜ per cent.</p>
                <p>There is a system of primary and secondary free school education for Protestants,
                    and another for Roman Catholics. For the higher education there are the three
                    colleges of St Boniface (Roman Catholic), St John’s (Episcopalian), and Manitoba
                    College (Presbyterian). These are affiliated to the university of Manitoba,
                    which is an examining and degree-conferring body.</p>
                <p>Like other provinces of the Dominion, Manitoba is under a lieutenant-governor,
                    with a council of five ministers responsible to the local legislature, which
                    again is composed of thirty-one members. The province is represented by three
                    senators in the Dominion senate, and by five members in the Dominion house of
                    commons. There are three judges of the superior court, and a number of county
                    court judges. The whole province is divided into municipalities, each of which
                    chooses a warden and six councillors annually.</p>
                <p>The city of Winnipeg, the provincial centre of government, law, education, and
                    religion, had in 1882 upwards of 20,000 inhabitants. The trade of the country
                    has chiefly grown up since Winnipeg was connected in 1878 with the United States
                    railroad system, and it has received a further impulse from the construction of
                    the Canadian Pacific Railway, which traverses the territory. (G. BR.)</p>
