                    (1732-1811), astronomer-royal at Greenwich for nearly half a century, was born
                    in London October 6, 1732. The great solar eclipse of 1748 seems to have made a
                    deep impression upon him; and after studying divinity at Trinity College,
                    Cambridge, of which he was elected a fellow in 1756, he determined to devote
                    himself wholly to astronomy. He early became intimate with Bradley, and in 1761
                    was deputed by the Royal Society to make observations of the transit of Venus at
                    St Helena. During the voyage he introduced into navigation the determination of
                    longitude by lunar distances, a method which Mayer’s recently published tables
                    had made practically possible. In 1763 he undertook a voyage to Barbados to test
                    Harrison’s watches, which, however, he reported to be inferior to the method of
                    lunars for determining longitude. In 1765 he succeeded Bliss as
                    astronomer-royal, and thereafter devoted himself with singular energy to the
                    duties of his office, which he held till his death, February 9, 1811.</p>
                <p>Maskelyne’s first contribution to astronomical literature was “A Proposal for
                    Discovering the Annual Parallax of Sirius,” published in 1760 in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> in which also most of his
                    later original memoirs appeared— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> his observations
                    of the transit of Venus (1761 and 1769), observations on the tides at St Helena
                    (1762), astronomical observations at St Helena (1764) and at Barbados (1764). In
                    1763 he published a small octavo, <hi rend="italic">The British Mariner’s
                        Guide,</hi> which contains the valuable suggestion that, in order to
                    facilitate the finding of longitude at sea, lunar distances should be calculated
                    beforehand for each year and published in a form accessible to navigators. This
                    suggestion, the germ of the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac,</hi> was
                    approved of by the Government, and under the care of Maskelyne the <hi
                        rend="italic">Nautical Almanac</hi> for 1767 was published in 1766. During
                    the remainder of his life Maskelyne continued to superintend the publication of
                    this invaluable annual, the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac</hi> for 1815
                    being the last which he prepared. Another valuable service which he rendered
                    astronomy was his inducing the Government to print his observations annually.
                    Flamsteed’s and Bradley’s observations had been private property, and were
                    published as such. The result of Maskelyne’s action was the accumulation and
                    rapid dissemination of a long series of observations which from their continuity
                    and accuracy have been of inestimable value to astronomers, and form along with
                    the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac</hi> his most lasting monument. The whole
                    work of the observatory was carried on by him and his one assistant in a most
                    methodical manner, Greenwich being in point of organization second to none
                    amongst the observatories of the day. He introduced several improvements in the
                    use of the instruments, being, for example, the first astronomer who measured to
                    tenths of a second; and he prevailed upon the Government to replace Bird’s mural
                    quadrant, which had become untrustworthy, by a repeating circle of 6 feet in
                    diameter. The new instrument was constructed by Troughton; but Maskelyne did not
                    live to see it completed. In 1772 he suggested to the Royal Society the famous
                    Schehallion experiment for the determination of the earth’s density. Forty years
                    previously Bouguer had demonstrated by experiment that Chimborazo in South
                    America affected the direction of the plumb-line quite appreciably; but his
                    observations were not made with sufficient care to deduce therefrom any
                    trustworthy result. Maskelyne’s experiments were made in 1774 (see <hi
                        rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1775), the apparent
                    difference of latitude between two stations on opposite sides of the mountain
                    being compared with the real difference of latitude obtained by triangulation.
                    From Maskelyne’s observations Hutton deduced by laborious calculations that tħe
                    density of the earth was 4’5 times that of pure water. Playfair subsequently
                    estimated with greater accuracy the mass of Schehallion, and obtained 4 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7 for the earth’s mean density. Maskelyne also
                    took a great interest in various geodesical operations, notably the measurement
                    of the length of a degree of latitude in Maryland and Pennsylvania <hi
                        rend="italic">(Philosophical Transactions,</hi> 1769), which was carried out
                    by Mason and Dixon in 1766-68, and later the determination of the relative
                    longitude of Greenwich and Paris <hi rend="italic">(Philosophical
                        Transactions,</hi> 1787). Cassini, Legendre, and Μéchain conducted the
                    triangulation on the French side; on the English side the work was carried on
                    under the superintendence of General Roy. This triangulation was the beginning
                    of the great trigonometrical survey which has since been extended all over the
                    country. A volume of <hi rend="italic">Selections</hi> (London, 1812) contains
                    several papers that were published, by Maskelyne as additions to the <hi
                        rend="italic">Nautical Almanac.</hi> His observations fill three large folio
                    volumes, and many of them were reprinted in Vince’s <hi rend="italic"
