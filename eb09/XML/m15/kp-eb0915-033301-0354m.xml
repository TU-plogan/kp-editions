                    afterwards counsel for the defence of Louis XVI., came of a famous legal family,
                    and was born at Paris on December 6, 1721. He too was destined for the legal
                    profession, much to the surprise of Marcel, the famous dancing master, who
                    declared that his pupil would never be able to dance well enough to be a soldier
                    or a lawyer, and must therefore be a priest. The young lawyer soon proved his
                    intellectual capacity, when he was appointed president of the <hi rend="italic"

                    the promotion of his father to be chancellor. One of the chancellor’s duties was
                    to control the press, and this duty was entrusted to Malesherbes by his father
                    during his eighteen years of office, and brought him into connexion with the
                    public far more than his judicial functions. To carry it out efficiently he kept
                    in communication with the literary leaders of Paris, and especially with
                    Diderot, and Grimm even goes so far as to say that “without the assistance of
                    Malesherbes the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie</hi> would probably never have
                    been published.” Though he met with abuse from all sides, there can be no doubt
                    that it was the eminently judicious manner in which he carried out his
                    objectionable duties which laid the foundation of his subsequent popularity. In
                    1771 he was called upon to mix in politics; the parlements of France had been
                    dissolved, and a new method of administering justice devised by Maupeou, which
                    was in itself commendable as tending to the better and quicker administration of
                    justice, but pernicious as exhibiting a tendency to overcentralization, and as
                    abolishing the hereditary “nobility of the robe,” which, with all its faults,
                    had from its nature preserved some independence, and been a check on the royal
                    power. Malesherbes presented a strong remonstrance against the new system, and
                    was at once banished to his country seat at St Lucie, to be recalled, however,
                    with the old parlement on the accession of Louis XVI., and to be made minister
                    of the <hi rend="italic">maison du roi</hi> in 1775. He only held office nine
                    months, during which, however, he directed his attention to the police of the
                    kingdom, which came under his department, and did much to check the odious
                    practice of issuing <hi rend="italic">lettres</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    cachet.</hi> On retiring from the ministry with Turgot in 1776, he betook
                    himself entirely to a happy country and domestic life. He had always been an
                    enthusiastic botanist; his avenue at St Lucie was world famous; he had written
                    against Buffon on behalf of the botanists whom Buffon had attacked, and had been
                    elected a member of the Académie des Sciences as far back as 1750. He was now
                    elected a member of the Académie Française, and everything seemed to promise a
                    quiet and peaceful old age spent in the bosom of his family and occupied with
                    scientific and literary pursuits, when the king in his difficulties wished for
                    the support of his name, and summoned him back to the ministry in 1787. Again he
                    held office but a short time, but returned to his country life this time with a
                    feeling of insecurity and disquiet, and, as the troubles increased, retired to
                    Switzerland. Nevertheless, in December 1792, in spite of the fair excuse his old
                    age and long retirement would have given him, he voluntarily left his asylum and
                    undertook with Tronchet and Desèze the defence of the king before the
                    convention, and it was his painful task to break the news of his condemnation to
                    the king. After this effort he returned once more to the country, but in
                    December 1793 he was arrested with his daughter, his son-in-law Μ. de Rosambô,
                    and his grandchildren, and on April 23, 1794, he was guillotined, after having
                    seen all whom he loved in the world executed before his eyes for their
                    relationship to him. Malesherbes is one of the sweetest characters of the 18th
                    century; though no man of action, hardly a man of the world, by his charity and
                    unfeigned goodness he became one of the most popular men in France, and it was
                    an act of truest self-devotion in him to sacrifice himself for a king who had
                    done little or nothing for him. With reason does his statue stand in the hall of
                    justice at Paris, for he is the greatest representative of that noble
                    independence which should prevent any thought of self when a counsel is pleading
                    his client’s cause, however perilous such advocacy might be.</p>
