                <p>Like many other great and conscientious rabbis of all times, who considered it a
                    sin to make of religious learning a means of gaining bread, Maimonides adopted
                    the medical profession. That he must have greatly excelled in it is not merely
                    known by the medical works he composed, but is best testified to by the fact
                    that, although a Jew (and the times and the country he lived in were certainly
                    not more tolerant than ours), he held the lucrative and important office of
                    court-physician to Saladin of Egypt.</p>

                    greatest theologian and philosopher the Jews ever produced, and one of the

                    The earliest edition, which has neither place nor date, appeared somewhere in
                    Italy, about 1480; the second at Soncino, 1490; the third at Constantinople,
                    1509; the fourth, fifth, sixth (with the <hi rend="italic">Sepher
                    Hammisvoth,</hi> &amp;c. ), and seventh editions at Venice, 1524, 1550, 1550-51,
                    and 1574-75 respectively; the eighth (with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antichristiana)</hi> at Amsterdam, 1702-3, all in folio; the most recent and
                    incomplete edition being that of Leipsic, 1862, 8vo. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mishneh Torah</hi> stands, and has stood for centuries, even among non-Jews, in
                    such respeet that ‘ ‘ parts of books” <hi rend="italic">(Halakhoth)</hi> have

                    have been translated into English by the late H. H. Bernard of Cambridge
                    (Cambridge, 1832, 8vo) and E. Soloweyczik of Poland (London, 1863, 8vo).</p>
                <p>2. Commentary on the treatise of <hi rend="italic">Rosh Hasshanah</hi> according
                    to the Babylonian Talmud. We know from Maimonides himself that he commented on
                    almost the whole of the second, third, and fourth <hi rend="italic">Sedarim</hi>
                    and on one treatise <hi rend="italic">(Hullin)</hi> of the fifth <hi
                    rend="italic">Seder</hi> of the Babylonian Talmud. But of all this none but his
                    <hi rend="italic">Rosh Hasshanah</hi> has been preserved. This commentary is
                    extant in four MSS., one of which, however, is a mere transcript, whilst two of
                    the others are imperfect. The only edition existing <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Hallebanon,</hi> ii. p. 61, &amp;c.) is from these imperfect MSS. The one
                    perfect MS. copy known to us is preserved in the University Library of Cambridge
                    (Add. 494).</p>
                <p>3. Some of the numerous letters ascribed to Maimonides. These are inextricably
                    mixed up both with letters written by him in Arabic and translated by others
                    into Hebrew, and with letters addressed to him by others.</p>
                <p>4. Religious poetry. There is a short liturgical piece (it is recited on the
                    first day of New Year by the Arabic-speaking Jews of Algiers, Tunis, &amp;c.)
                    which begins <hi rend="italic">Eth Sha'are Ratzon,</hi> and which bears the
                    acrostic <hi rend="italic">Ani Mosheh biribbi Maimon Hazak.</hi> It is an <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ii</hi><hi rend="italic">'AkedahB</hi> But because
                    there is a composition of the same nature and beginning, but of greater length
                    and by another author (‘Abbas Yehudah Shemuel), this is, in contradistinction,
                    called <hi rend="italic">'Akedah Hetannah.</hi> Since the name of Mosheh,
                    however, is common among all Jews and that of Maimon among those of the Maghrib
                    (see Schiller-Szinessy’s Cambridge <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Hebrew
                    Manuscripts,</hi> ii. p. 28, note 2), this little poem may, perhaps, belong to
                    another (and inferior) rabbi of this name. If it really does belong to our
                    Maimonides, we have a key to his contempt for the liturgical poets.<note

                <p>1. The commentary on the whole <hi rend="italic">Mishnah.</hi> The author began
                    this work whilst yet in Spain, continued it on his flight through Morocco, and
                    finished it at his ease at Fostat (Cairo). The merit of this work is that the
                    author explains therein the <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> in a very lucid and
                    brief way; and, having privately digested the Talmudical controversies regarding
                    each paragraph, he gives the result of it in the decision of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Halakhah.</hi> But this work has also its demerits. (1) It is
                    occasionally incorrect in itself. (2) Being to most Talmudists accessible only
                    in a translation, which they cannot gauge, the smallest clerical error produces
                    confusion. (3) Nor were all the translators equally qualified for their task.
                    Some were good Talmudists, but indifferent Arabic scholars; some were good
                    Talmudists and good Arabic scholars, but not fine Hebraists. (For the
                    translators see Schiller-Szinessy, <hi rend="italic">ut supra,</hi> ii. pp. 16,
                    17.)</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Sepher Hammisvoth</hi> is a preliminary to the author’s
                    masterpiece, the <hi rend="italic">Mishneh Torah.</hi> This small but important
                    work has been twice translated,—first by R. Mosheh b. Shemuel b. Yehudah Ibn
                    Tibbon (Tabbon ?), and secondly by R. Shelomoh b. Yoseph Ibn Aiyùb. The former
                    translation is known by printed editions<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The first edition appeared without place and date, but
                    Constantinople about 1516, 4to.</p></note> and the latter by MSS. Ibn Aiyùb’s,
                    though less known, is the more correct translation. There is a copy of it in the
                    University Library of Cambridge (Add. 676, 2).</p>
                <p>3. But the most important and most learned and to us the most interesting of
                    Maimonides’s Arabic works is the <hi rend="italic">Guide of the Perplexed</hi>
                    (Dalâlatu ’ 1-Hairin in Arabic, and <hi rend="italic">Morch Hannebokhim</hi> in
                    Hebrew). It is the result of deep research in Bible and Midrash on the one hand
                    and in Greek philosophy, as interpreted by Aristotle and his followers, together
                    with various religious systems, on the other. The purpose of its composition and
                    publication was to reconcile Jewish theology with refined heathen philosophy.
                    Maimonides deservedly held Aristotle in very high estimation; his traducers,
                    however, said that he placed him in the <hi rend="italic">Guide</hi> next to, if
                    not above, Moses. No wonder, then, that religious Jews of a certain type in the
                    author’s lifetime took offence both at the book and the author. But serious
                    warfare broke out only after Maimonides’s death, which raged for more than a
                    full century, and is not entirely extinguished even at this day. His followers,
                    chiefly in Provence at the end of the 13th and the beginning of the 14th
                    century, some of whom had only eyes for the master’s negations and none for his
                    affirmations, declared the whole history of the Bible to be mere symbolism.

                    These absurdities were considered by the religious as highly irreligious, and
                    provoked active opposition and even excommunication. These, in their turn,
                    provoked again the strong remonstrance of the moderate middle party and the
                    ultimate excommunication of the excommunicators by the excommunicated. But long
                    before that time the <hi rend="italic">Guide</hi> had been publicly burned,—an
                    act quite un-Jewish, but in unison with an age which had more faith than
                    knowledge, and which, dwelling in darkness, hated the light. People in our days
                    cannot understand this; they cannot understand the fierce opposition to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Guide,</hi> and much less the attachment to it. They ask, Is this
                    the great work of the great Maimonides? These explanations of the Scriptures we
                    have long ago outgrown, and the philosophy it contains is not worth mention by
                    the side of that of Schelling, Fichte, and Hegel! But the fact is that, if one
                    wishes to form a proper estimate of this work, he must not merely read it, but
                    earnestly study it. Then again, its contents must be viewed historically, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> both in connexion with the theological and
                    philosophical systems of past ages and with the influence it has exercised
                    uninterruptedly from the time of its appearance down to almost oπr own
                    days.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Moses Mendelssohn,

                    become antiquated. The symbolism of the Pentateuch and the meaning of the words
                    of the prophetic books and Hagiographa may be clearer to us than they were in
                    the author’s time, by reason of our discoveries in science, our progress in
                    philology, and our knowledge of history. Our knowledge of Greek philosophy may
                    be much greater than Maimonides’s was, owing partly to our acquaintance with the
                    original writings of Aristotle and others, accessible to Maimonides only through
                    a translation of a translation, and partly owing to our collation of numerous
                    MSS., by which the errors are rectified of the copies from which the first
                    translators made their version,—a rectification by which parts of the foundation
                    and of the superstructure of the <hi rend="italic">Moreh</hi> go down at one and
                    the same time. But, when all this is considered, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Guide</hi> still remains a great work,—a product, indeed, of the Middle Ages,

                    adduce for the translation by the author himself of this treatise are not so
                    telling, as those in the case just mentioned before, the moral certainty is not
                    less. The treatise details (1) how much a Jew may yield, and how much he must
                    resist, if forced to embrace another religion, and (2) that Mohammedanism is not
                    a heathenish religion. It is generally held, though not quite conclusively
                    proved, that Maimonides wrote this treatise <hi rend="italic">pro domo
                    sιca,</hi> he and his family having been themselves forced to embrace
                    Mohammedanism during the persecution by lbn Tamurt. It ought to be borne in mind
                    that the Jews generally look upon Christianity and Mohammedanism as having each
                    taken a large share in their mother’s (Judaism’s) inheritance, and that, whilst
                    the former looked more for her moral, the latter coveted her doctrinal
                    possessions. Since morality, however, consists more in negatives than positives,
                    and since doctrines are more openly challenged and openly avowed than morals,
                    the Jews have always manifested less repugnance to profess, under pressure,
                    Mohammedanism than Christianity.</p>
                <p>There are other works both in Hebrew and iu Arabic extant by our author. These
                    relate mostly either to ritual affairs, and consist of letters to various

                    in Yemen and elsewhere, or to medical matters, and consist of short treatises,
                    such as aphorisms, &amp;c., but do not come up in interest to the great works
