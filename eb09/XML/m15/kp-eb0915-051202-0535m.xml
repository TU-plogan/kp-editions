                    of a humanist, according to the custom of the century, he went in 1482 to reside
                    at Mirandola with his old friend and fellow-student, the illustrious Giovanni
                    Pico. There he stayed two years, prosecuting his studies in Greek literature.
                    Before Pico removed to Florence, he procured for Aldo the post of tutor to his
                    nephews Alberto and Lionello Pio, princes of Carpi. To Alberto Pio the world
                    owes a debt of gratitude, inasmuch as he supplied Aldo with funds for starting
                    his printing press, and gave him lands at Carpi. It was Aldo’s ambition to
                    secure the literature of Greece from further accident by committing its chief
                    masterpieces to type; and the history of his life is the record of the execution
                    of this gigantic task. Before his time four Italian towns had won the honours of
                    Greek publications:—Milan, with the grammar of Lascaris, Aesop, Theocritus, a
                    Greek Psalter, and Isocrates, between 1476 and 1493; Venice, with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Erotemata</hi> of Chrysoloras in 1484; Vicenza, with reprints of
                    Lascaris’s grammar and the <hi rend="italic">Erotemata,</hi> in 1488 and 1490;
                    Florence, with Alopa’s Homer, in 1488. Of these works, only three, the Milanese
                    Theocritus and Isocrates and the Florentine Homer, were classics. Aldo selected
                    Venice as the most appropriate station for his labours. He settled there in
                    1490, and soon afterwards gave to the world editions of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hero and Leander</hi> of Musaeus, the <hi rend="italic">Galeomyomachia,</hi>
                    and the Greek Psalter. These have no date; but they are the earliest <pb

                    him “Precursors of the Greek Library.’’</p>
                <p>At Venice Aldo gathered an army of Greek scholars and compositors around him. His
                    trade was carried on by Greeks, and Greek was the language of his household.
                    Instructions to type-setters and binders were given in Greek. The prefaces to
                    his editions were written in Greek. Greeks from Crete collated MSS., read
                    proofs, and gave models of calligraphy for casts of Greek type. Not counting the
                    craftsmen employed in merely manual labour, Aldo entertained as many as thirty
                    of these Greek assistants in his family. His own industry and energy were
                    unremitting. In 1495 he issued the first volume of his Aristotle. Four more
                    volumes completed the work in 1497-98. Nine comedies of Aristophanes appeared in
                    1498. Thucydides, Sophocles, and Herodotus followed in 1502; Xenophon’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Hellenics</hi> and Euripides in 1503; Demosthenes in 1504. The
                    troubles of Italy, which pressed heavily on Venice at this epoch, suspended
                    Aldo’s labours for a while. But in 1508 he resumed his series with an edition of
                    the minor Greek orators; and in 1509 appeared the lesser works of Plutarch. Then
                    came another stoppage. The league of Cambray had driven Venice back to her
                    lagoons, and all the forces of the republic were concentrated on a struggle to
                    the death with the allied powers of Europe. In 1513 Aldo reappeared with Plato,
                    which he dedicated to Leo X. in a preface eloquently and earnestly comparing the
                    miseries of warfare and the woes of Italy with the sublime and tranquil objects
                    of the student’s life. Pindar, Hesychius, and Athenaeus followed in 1514.</p>
                <p>These complete the list of Aldo’s prime services to Greek literature. · But it
                    may be well in this place to observe that his successors continued his work by
                    giving Pausanias, Strabo, Aeschylus, Galen, Hippocrates, and Longinus to the
                    world in first editions. Omission has been made of Aldo’s reprints, in order
                    that the attention of the reader might be concentrated on his labours in editing
                    Greek classics from MSS. Other presses were at work in Italy; and, as the
                    classics issued from Florence, Rome, or Milan, Aldo took them up, bestowing in
                    each case fresh industry upon the collation of codices and the correction of
                    texts. Nor was the Aldine press idle in regard to Latin and Italian classics.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Asolani</hi> of Bembo, the collected writings of
                    Poliziano, the <hi rend="italic">Hypnerotomaclιia Poliphili,</hi> Dante’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Divine Comedy,</hi> Petrarch’s poems, a collection of early Latin
                    poets of the Christian era, the letters of the younger Pliny, the poems of
                    Pontanus, Sannazzaro’s <hi rend="italic">Arcadia,</hi> Quintilian, Valerius
                    Maximus, and the <hi rend="italic">Adagia</hi> of Erasmus were printed, either
                    in first editions, or with a beauty of type and paper never reached before,
                    between the years 1495 and 1514. For these Italian and Latin editions Aldo had
                    the elegant type struck which bears his name. It is said to have been copied
                    from Petrarch’s handwriting, and was cast under the direction of Francesco da
                    Bologna, who has been identified by Panizzi with Francia the painter.</p>
                <p>Aldo’s enthusiasm for Greek literature was not confined to the printing-room. He
                    burned with a humanist’s enthusiasm for the books he printed; and we may well
                    pause astonished at his industry, when we remember what a task it was in that
                    age to prepare texts of authors so numerous and so voluminous from MSS. Whatever
                    the students of this century may think of Aldo’s scholarship, they must allow
                    that only vast erudition and thorough familiarity with the Greek language could
                    have enabled him to accomplish what he did. In his own days Aldo’s learning won
                    the hearty acknowledgment of ripe scholars. ’ Γo his fellow workers he was
                    uniformly generous, free from jealousy, and prodigal of praise. His stores of
                    MSS. were as open to the learned as his printed books were liberally given to
                    the public. While aiming at that excellence of typography which renders his
                    editions the treasures of the book-collector, he strove at the same time to make
                    them cheap. We may perhaps roughly estimate the current price of his pocket
                    series of Greek, Latin, and Italian classics, begun in 1501, at 2s. per volume
                    of our present money. The five volumes of the Aristotle cost about £8. His great
                    undertaking was carried on under continual difficulties, arising from strikes
                    among his workmen, the piracies of rivals, and the interruptions of war. When he
                    died, bequeathing Greek literature as an inalienable possession to the world, he
                    was a poor man. In order to promote Greek studies, Aldo founded an academy of
                    Hellenists in 1500 under the title of the New Academy. Its rules were written in
                    Greek. Its members were obliged to speak Greek. Their names were Hellenized, and
                    their official titles were Greek. The biographies of all the famous men who were
                    enrolled in this academy must be sought in the pages of Didot’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Aide Manuce.</hi> It is enough here to mention that they included
                    Erasmus and the English Linacre.</p>
                <p>In 1499 Aldo married Maria, daughter of Andrea Torresano of Asola. Andrea had
                    already bought the press established by Nicholas Jenson at Venice. Therefore
                    Aldo’s marriage combined two important publishing firms. Henceforth the names
                    Aldus and Asolanus were associated on the title pages of the Aldine
                    publications; and after Aldo’s death in 1515, Andrea and his two sons carried on
                    the business during the minority of Aldo’s children. The device of the dolphin
                    and the anchor, and the motto <hi rend="italic">festina</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lente,</hi> which indicated quickness combined with firmness in the execution
                    of a great scheme, were never wholly abandoned by the Aldines until the
                    expiration of their firm in the third generation.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Paulus Manutius</hi> (1512-1574). By his marriage with
                    Maria Torresano, Aldo had three sons, the youngest of whom, Paolo, was born in
                    1512. He had the misfortune to lose his father at the age of two. After this
                    event his grandfather and two uncles, the three Asolani, carried on the Aldine
                    press, while Paolo prosecuted his early studies with unremitting industry at
                    Venice. Excessive application hurt his health, which remained weak during the
                    rest of his life. At the age of twenty-one he had acquired a solid reputation
                    for scholarship and learning. In 1533 Paolo undertook the conduct of his
                    father’s business, which had latterly been much neglected by his uncles. In the
                    interregnum between Aldo’s death and Paolo’s succession (1514-33) the Asolani
                    continued to issue books, the best of which were Latin classics. But, though
                    their publications count a large number of first editions, and some are works of
                    considerable magnitude, they were not brought out with the scholarly perfection
                    at which Aldo aimed. The Asolani attempted to perform the whole duties of
                    editing, and to reserve all its honours for themselves, dispensing with the
                    service of competent collaborators. The result was that some of their editions,
                    especially their Aeschylus of 1518, are singularly bad. Paolo determined to
                    restore the glories of the house, and in 1540 he separated from his uncles. The
                    field of Greek literature having been well-nigh exhausted, he devoted himself
                    principally to the Latin classics. He was a passionate Ciceronian, and perhaps
                    his chief contributions to scholarship are the corrected editions of Cicero’s
                    letters and orations, his own epistles in a Ciceronian style, and his Latin
                    version of Demosthenes. Throughout his life he combined the occupations of a
                    student and a printer, winning an even higher celebrity in the former field than
                    his father had done. Four treatises from his pen on Roman antiquities deserve to
                    be commemorated for their erudition no less than for the elegance of their
                    Latinity. Several Italian cities contended for the possession of so <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n537/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0537-0514"/> rare a man; and he received tempting offers from
                    the Spanish court. Yet his life was a long struggle with pecuniary difficulties.
                    To prepare correct editions of the classics, and to print them in a splendid
                    style, has always been a costly undertaking. And, though Paolo’s publications
                    were highly esteemed, their sale was slow. In 1556 he received for a time
                    external support from the Venetian Academy, founded by Federigo Badoaro. But
                    Badoaro failed disgracefully in 1559, and the academy was extinct in 1562.
                    Meanwhile Paolo had established his brother, Antonio, a man of good parts but
                    indifferent conduct, in a printing office and book shop at Bologna. Antonio died
                    in 1559, having been a source of trouble and expense to Paolo during the last
                    four years of his life. Other pecuniary embarrassments arose from a contract for
                    supplying fish to Venice, into which Paolo had somewhat strangely entered with
                    the Government. In 1561 Pope Pius IV. invited him to Rome, offering him a yearly
                    stipend of 500 ducats, and undertaking to establish and maintain his press
                    there. The profits on publications were to be divided between Paolo Manuzio and
                    the apostolic camera. Paolo accepted the invitation, and spent the larger
                    portion of his life, under three papacies, with varying fortunes, in the city of
                    Rome. Ill health, the commercial interests he had left behind at Venice, and the
                    coldness shown him by Pope Pius V., induced him at various times and for several
                    reasons to leave Rome. But of these excursions it is not necessary to take
                    particular notice. As was natural, his editions after his removal to Rome were
                    mostly Latin works of theology and Biblical or patristic literature.</p>
                <p>Paolo married his wife, Caterina Odoni, in 1546. She brought him three sons and
                    one daughter. His eldest son, the younger Aldus, succeeded him in the management
                    of the Venetian printing house when his father settled at Rome in 1561. Γaolo
                    had never been a strong man, and his health was overtaxed with studies and
                    commercial worries. Yet he lived into his sixty-second year, and died at Rome in
                    1574.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Aldus Manutius, Junior</hi> (1547-1597). The younger
                    Aldo, born in the year after his father Paolo’s marriage, cradled in
                    scholarship, and suckled as it were with printer’s ink, proved what is called an
                    infant prodigy. When he was nine years old, his name was placed upon the title
                    page of the famous <hi rend="italic">Eleganze della lingua Toscana e
                    Latina.</hi> What his share was in that really excellent selection cannot be
                    ascertained; but it is hardly possible that a boy of nine could have compiled it
                    without assistance. The <hi rend="italic">Eleganze</hi> was probably a book made
                    for his instruction and in his company by his father. In 1561, at the age of
                    fourteen, he produced a work upon Latin spelling, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orthographies Ratio.</hi> During a visit to his father at Rome in the next
                    year, he was able to improve this treatise by the study of inscriptions, and in
                    1575 he completed his labours in the same field by the publication of an <hi
                    rend="italic">Epitome</hi><hi rend="italic">Orthographiae.</hi> Whether Aldo was
                    the sole composer of the work on spelling, in its first edition, may be doubted;
                    but he appropriated the subject and made it his own. Probably his greatest
                    service to scholarship is this analysis of the principles of orthography in
                    Latin.</p>
                <p>Aldo remained at Venice, prosecuting studies in literature and superintending the
                    Aldine press. But in these days of early manhood he was not satisfied with the
                    career of scholarship and business. At one time he hankered after the more
                    worldly honours of the law, at another he built a country house at Asola,
                    perplexing his father, who had given him too easy independence, with the humours
                    of his age. A marriage came to make these matters straight. The Giunta family
                    had been steadily rising in the world as printers, in proportion as the Aldi
                    declined through want of concentration upon commerce. In 1572 Aldo took for his
                    wife Francesca Lucrezia, daughter of Bartolommeo Giunta, and great-grandchild of
                    the first Giunta, who founded the famous printing house in Venice. This was an
                    alliance which augured well for the future of the Aldines, especially as the
                    young husband, in the midst of distractions, had recently found time to publish
                    a new revised edition of Velleius Paterculus. Two years later the death of his
                    father at Rome placed Aldo at the head of the firm. In concert with his new
                    relatives, the Giunta, he now edited an extensive collection of Italian letters,
                    and in 1576 he appeared again before the public as a critic with his commentary
                    upon the <hi rend="italic">Ars Poetica</hi> of Horace. Printing, in this case,
                    as in the case of his father, went hand in hand with original authorship. About
                    the same time, that is to say, about the year 1576, he was appointed professor
                    of literature to the Cancelleria at Venice. The Aldine press continued through
                    this period to issue books, but none of signal merit; and in 1585 Aldo
                    determined to quit his native city for Bologna, where he occupied the chair of
                    eloquence for a few months. In 1587 he left Bologna for Pisa, and there, in his
                    quality of professor, he made the curious mistake of printing Alberti’s comedy
                    <hi rend="italic">Philodoxl·us</hi> as a work of the classic Lepidus. Sixtus V.
                    drew him in 1588 from Tuscany to Rome; and at Rome he hoped to make a permanent
                    settlement as lecturer. But his public lessons were ill attended, and he soon
                    fell back upon his old vocation of publisher under the patronage of a new pope,
                    Clement VIII. In the tenth year of his residence at Rome, that is, in 1597, he
                    died, leaving children, but none who cared or had capacity to carry on the
                    Aldine press. Aldo himself, though a precocious student, a scholar of no mean
                    ability, and a publisher of some distinction, was the least remarkable of the
                    three men who gave books to the public under the old Aldine ensign. Times had
                    changed in Italy since Aldo the elder conceived the great idea of reaping for
                    the press the harvest of Greek literature. And his posterity had changed with
                    the times for the worse. This does not of necessity mean that we should adopt
                    Scaliger’s critique of the younger Aldo without reservation. Scaliger called him
                    “a poverty-stricken talent, slow in operation; his work is very commonplace; he
                    aped his father.” What is true in this remark lies partly in the fact that
                    scholarship in Aldo’s days had flown beyond , the Alps, where a new growth of
                    erudition, on a basis different from that of the Italian Renaissance, had
                    begun.</p>
