                    Judaism (a view supposed by some to be alluded to even in John viii. 41). We
                    learn from Origen that the story about the soldier Panthera (∏αy0ηpα) was
                    already upheld by Celsus. The Ebionites and other heretical sects, as is well
                    known, maintained the paternity of Joseph.</p></note>); that she afterwards had
                    other children is a natural inference from Matt. i. 25, which the evangelists,
                    who frequently allude to “the brethren of the Lord,” are at no pains to obviate.
                    The few incidents mentioned in Scripture regarding her show that she followed
                    our Lord to the very close of His earthly career with unfailing motherliness,
                    but the “Magnificat” assigned to her in Luke i. is the only passage which would
                    distinctly imply on her part a high prophetic appreciation of His divine
                    mission. She was present at the crucifixion, where she was commended by Jesus to
                    the care of the apostle John, (John xix. 26, 27), Joseph having apparently died
                    before this time. (It would be idle to inquire why “the brethren of the Lord,”
                    who, whatever their relationship to Mary, must at least have been nearer than
                    John, were ignored in this arrangement.) Mary is mentioned in Acts i. 14 as
                    having been among those who continued in prayer along with the apostles at
                    Jerusalem during the interval between the ascension and pentecost. There is no
                    allusion in the New Testament to the time or place of her death.</p>
                <p>The subsequent growth of ecclesiastical tradition and belief regarding Mary will
                    be traced most conveniently under the separate heads of (1) her perpetual
                    virginity, (2) her absolute sinlessness, (3) her peculiar relation to the
                    Godhead, which specially fits her for successful intercession on behalf of
                    mankind.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Iler Perpetual Virginity. —</hi> This doctrine, as has already
                    been pointed out, was, to say the least, of no importance in the eyes of the
                    evangelists, and so far as extant writings go there is no evidence of its having
                    been anywhere taught within the pale of the catholic church of the first three
                    centuries. On the contrary, to Tertullian the fact of Mary’s marriage after the
                    birth of Christ is a useful argument for the reality of the Incarnation against
                    Gnostic notions, and Origen relies upon the references to the Lord’s brethren as
                    disproving the Docetism with which he had to contend. The ct∈ιτrαp0mα, though
                    very ancient, is in reality a doctrine of non-catbolic origin, and first occurs
                    in a work proscribed by the earliest papal <hi rend="italic">Index</hi><hi

                    Jerusalem); he had long been married to Anna her mother, whose continued
                    childlessness had become a cause of much humiliation and sorrow to them both.
                    The birth of a daughter was at last angelically predicted to each parent
                    separately. From her third to her twelfth year “Mary was in the temple as if she
                    were a dove that dwelt there, and she received food from the hand of an angel.”
                    When she became of nubile age a guardian was sought for her by the priests among
                    the widowers of Israel “lest she should defile the sanctuary of the Lord”; and
                    Joseph, an elderly man with a family, was indicated for this charge by a
                    miraculous token. Some time afterwards the annunciation took place; when the</p>
                <p>Virgin’s pregnancy was discovered, Joseph and she were brought before the high
                    priest, and, though asserting their innocence in all sincerity, were acquitted
                    only after they had been tried with “the water of the ordeal of the Lord” (Numb.
                    v. 11). Numerous details regarding the birth at Bethlehem are then given. The
                    perpetual physical virginity of Mary, naively insisted upon in thia apocryphon,
                    is alluded to only with a half belief and a “some say” by Clement of Alexandria
                    <hi rend="italic">(Strom.,</hi> vii. 16), but became of much importance to the
                    leaders of the church in the 4th century, as for example to Ambrose, who sees in
                    Ezek. xliv. 1-3 a prophetic indication of so great a mystery.<note

                    miraculous birth of Jesus, had become the mother of other children by Joseph
                    came accordingly to be spoken of as her enemies,—Antidicoma-rianitae
                    (Epiphanius) or Antidicomaritae (Augustine),— and the first-mentioned author
                    devotes a whole chapter (chap. 78) of his great work upon heresies to their
                    confutation. For holding the same view Bonosus of Sardica was condemned by the
                    synod of Capua in 391. To Jerome the perpetual virginity not only of Mary but
                    even of Joseph appeared of so much consequence that while a young man he wrote
                    (387) the long and vehement tract <hi rend="italic">Against</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Helvidius,</hi> in which he was the first to broach the theory
                    (which has since gained wide currency) that the brethren of our Lord were
                    children neither of Mary by her husband, nor of Joseph by a former marriage, but
                    of another Mary, sister to the Virgin and wife of Cloρas or Alphaeus. At last
                    the epithet of det <hi rend="italic">παρθένος</hi> was authoritatively applied
                    to the Virgin by the council of Chalcedon in 451, and the doctrine implied has
                    ever since been an undisputed point of orthodoxy both in the Eastern and in the
                    Western church, some even seeking to hold the Anglican Church committed to it on
                    account of the general declaration (in the <hi rend="italic">Homilies)</hi> of
                    concurrence in the decisions of the first four general councils.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Her Absolute Sinlessness.·</hi> —While much of the apocryphal
                    literature of the early sects in which she is repeatedly spoken of as “undefiled

                    from the acknowledged fathers of the church could be cited to show that it was
                    originally quite unknown to Catholicism. Even Augustine repeatedly asserts that
                    she was born in original sin <hi rend="italic">(De Gen. ad lit.,</hi> x. 18);

                    guarded passage <hi rend="italic">(De Nat.</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Grat.,</hi> chap. 36) in which, while contradicting the assertion
                    of Pelagius that many had lived free from sin, he wishes exception to be made in
                    favour of “the holy Virgin Mary, of whom out of honour to the Lord I wish no
                    question to be made where sins are treated of,—for how do we know what mode of
                    grace wholly to conquer sin may have been bestowed upon her who was found meet
                    to conceive and bear Him of whom it is certain that He had no sin.” A writer so
                    late as Anselm <hi rend="italic">(Cur Deus Homo,</hi> ii. 16) declares that “the
                    Virgin herself whence He (Christ) was assumed was conceived in iniquity, and in
                    sin did her mother conceive her, and with original sin was she born, because she
                    too sinned in Adam in whom all sinned,” and the same view was expressed by
                    Damian. The growth of the modern Roman doctrine of the immaculate conception

                    festival in honour of her “holy conception,” and were remonstrated with by
                    Bernard, has been already sketched elsewhere (see <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    the epithet 0eoτ0κos (“Mother of God”) was first applied to Mary by theologians
                    of Alexandria towards the close of the 3d century; but it does not occur in any
                    genuine extant writing of that period, unless we are to assign an early date to

                    valued as directly honourable to Mary herself and as corresponding to the
                    greatly increased esteem in which she personally was held throughout the
                    catholic world, so that, when Nestorius and others began to dispute its
                    propriety in the following century, their temerity was resented, not as an
                    attack upon the established orthodox doctrine of the Nicene creed, but as
                    threatening a more vulnerable and more tender part of the popular faith. It is
                    sufficient in illustration of the drift of theological opinion to refer to the
                    first sermon of Proclus, preached on a certain festival of the Virgin <hi

                    the Virgin Mary at the opening of the council of Ephesus in 431. In the former
                    the orator speaks of “the holy Virgin and Mother of God” as “the spotless
                    treasure-house of virginity, the spiritual paradise of the second Adam; the
                    workshop in which the two natures were welded together . . . . the one bridge

                    characterizes much of it as a “wild labyrinth of untranslatable
                    metaphor.”</p></note> in the latter she is saluted as the “mother and virgin,”
                    “through whom (δι ’ <hi rend="italic">η&lt;s)</hi> the Trinity is glorified and
                    worshipped, the cross of the Saviour exalted and honoured, through whom heaven
                    triumphs, the angels are made glad, devils driven forth, the tempter overcome,
                    and the fallen creature raised up even to heaven.” The response which such
                    language found in the popular heart was sufficiently shown by the shouts of joy
                    with which the Ephesian mob heard of the deposition of Nestorius, escorting his
                    judges with torches and incense to their homes, and celebrating the occasion by
                    a general illumination. The causes which in the course of the preceding century
                    had led to this exaltation of the Mother of God in the esteem of the catholic
                    world are not far to seek. On the one hand the solution of the Arian
                    controversy, however correct it may have been theoretically, undoubtedly had the
                    practical effect of relegating the God-man redeemer for ordinary minds into a
                    far away region of “remote and awful Godhead,” so that the need for a mediator
                    to deal with the very Mediator could not fail to be felt. On the other hand, it
                    must be accepted as a fact abundantly proved by history that the religious
                    instincts of mankind are very ready to pay worship, in grosser or more refined
                    forms, to the idea of womanhood; at all events many of those who became
                    professing Christians at the political fall of paganism entered the church with
                    such instincts (derived from the nature-religions in which they had been brought
                    up) very fully developed. Probably it ought to be added that the comparative
                    colourlessness with which the character of Mary is presented not only in the
                    canonical gospels but even in the most copious of the apocrypha left greater
                    scope for the untrammelled exercise of devout imagination than was possible in
                    the case of Christ, in the circumstances of whose humiliation and in whose
                    recorded utterances there were many things which the religious consciousness
                    found difficulty in understanding or in adapting itself to. At all events, from
                    the time of the council of Ephesus, to exhibit figures of the Virgin and Child
                    became the approved expression of orthodoxy, and the relationship of motherhood

                    virgin,” takes occasion to speak of Mary as the “advocata” of Eve; but it seems
                    certain that this word is a translation of the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >συνήγορος,</hi> and implies hostility and rebuke rather than
                    advocacy.</p></note> There we read of Mary’s prayer to Christ: “Do Thou bestow
                    Thine aid upon every man calling upon, or praying to, or napιing the name of
                    Thine handmaid”; to which His answer is, “Every soul that calls upon thy name
                    shall not be ashamed, but shall find mercy and support and confidence both in
                    the world that now is and in that which is to come in the presence of My Father
                    in the heavens.” But Gregory of Nazianzus also, in his panegyric upon Justina,
                    mentions with incidental approval that in her hour of peril she “implored Mary
                    the Virgin .to come to the aid of a virgin in her danger.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is probable that the commemorations and
                    invocations of the Virgin which occur in the present texts of the ancient
                    liturgies of “St James” and “St Mark” are due to interpolation. In this
                    connexion ought also to be noted the chapter in Epiphanius <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Haer.,</hi> 79) against the “Collyridians,” certain women in Thrace, Scythia,
                    and Arabia, who were in the habit of worshipping the Virgin (α∈l <hi
                    rend="italic">παρθΙνο1)</hi> as a goddess, the offering of a cake (κoλλιφ(δα <hi
                    rend="italic">τιva)</hi> being one of the features of their worship. He rebukes
                    them for offering the worship which was due to the Trinity alone; “let Mary be
                    held in honour, but by no means worshipped.” The cultus was probably a relic of
                    heathenism; compare Jerem. xliv. 19.</p></note> Of the growth of the Marian
                    cultus, alike in the East and in the West, after the decision at Ephesus it
                    would be impossible to trace the history, however slightly, within the limits of
                    the present article. Justinian in one of his laws bespeaks her advocacy for the
                    empire, and he inscribes the high altar in the new church of St Sophia with her
                    name. Narses looks to her for directions on the field of battle. Heraclius bears
                    her image on his banner. John of Damascus speaks of her as the sovereign lady to
                    whom the whole creation has been made subject by her son. Peter Damian
                    recognizes her as the most exalted of all creatures, and apostrophizes her as
                    deified and endowed with all power in heaven and in earth, yet not forgetful of
                    our race.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Num quid quia

                    of doctrine and practice which Protestant controversialists are accustomed to
                    call by the name of Mariolatry. With reference to this much-disputed phrase it
                    is always to be kept in mind that the directly authoritative documents, <pb

                    distinguish formally between “latria” and “dulia,” and declare that the
                    “worship” to be paid to the mother of God must never exceed that superlative
                    degree of “dulia” which is vaguely described as “hyperdulia.” On the other hand,
                    it must be remembered that the comparative reserve shown by the council of Trent
                    in its decrees, and even in its catechism,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The points taught in the catechism are—that she is truly the
                    Mother of God, and the second Eve, by whose means we have received blessing and
                    life; that she is the Mother of Pity, and very specially our advocate; that her
                    merits are highly exalted, and that her dispositions towards us are extremely
                    gracious; that her images are of the utmost utility. In the <hi rend="italic"

                    are seldom directly appealed to except in the Litany and in some of the later
                    offices such as those for September 8, and for the Festival of the Seven Sorrows
                    (decreed by Benedict XIII. in 1727). Noteworthy are the versicles in the office
                    for December 8 (The Feast of the Immaculate Conception), “Tota pulchra es,
                    Maria, et macula originalis non est in te,” and ‘ ‘ Gloriosa dicta sunt de te,
                    Maria, quia fecit tibi magna qui potens est.”</p></note> on this subject has not
                    been observed by individual theologians, and in view of the fact of the
                    canonization of some of these (such as Liguori),—a fact guaranteeing the absence
                    of erroneous teaching from their writings,—it does not seem unfair to hold the
                    Roman Church responsible for the natural interpretations and just inferences
                    which may be drawn even from apparently exaggerated expressions in such works as
                    the well-known <hi rend="italic">Glories of Mary</hi> and others frequently
                    quoted in controversial literature. A good résumé of recent Catholic
                    developments of the cultus of Mary is to be found in Pusey’s <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The following are the principal feasts of the Virgin in the order in which they
                    occur in the ecclesiastical year. (1) That of the Presentation <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Praesentatio</hi><hi rend="italic">B.</hi><hi rend="italic">V. Μ.,</hi> τα
                    eι&lt;rJδtα ττ}s <hi rend="italic">Θεοτόκου),</hi><hi rend="italic">to</hi>
                    commemorate the beginning of her stay in the temple, as recorded in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Protevangelium Jacobi</hi> (see above). It is believed to have
                    originated in the East sometime in the 8th century, the earliest allusion to it
                    being made by George of Nicomedia (9th century); Manuel Comnenus made it
                    universal for the Eastern empire, and in the modern Greek Church it is one of
                    the five great festivals in honour of the Deipara. It was introduced into the
                    Western Church late in the 14th century, and, after having been withdrawn from
                    the calendar by Pius V., was restored by Sixtus V., the day observed both in
                    East and West being November 21. It is not mentioned in the English calendar.
                    (2) The Feast of the Conception <hi rend="italic">(Conceptio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">B.</hi><hi rend="italic">V. Μ.,</hi><hi rend="italic">Conceptio

                    the Homan Catholic Church on December 8, and by all the Eastern churches on
                    December 9, has already been explained (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Immaculate
                    Conception)</hi>; in the Greek Church it only ranks as one of the middle
                    festivals of Mary. (3) The Feast of the Purification <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Occursus, Obviat</hi><hi rend="italic">io,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Praesentatio,</hi><hi rend="italic">Festum</hi><hi rend="italic">88.

                    rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> (4) The Feast of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary
                    <hi rend="italic">(Annunciatio, ι.υayyελισμ6s)',</hi> see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Annunciation.</hi> It may be mentioned that at the Toledan council in 656 it
                    was decreed that this festival should be observed on December 18, in order to
                    keep clear of Lent. (5) The Feast of the Visitation (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Visitatio</hi><hi rend="italic">B.</hi><hi rend="italic">V. Μ.)</hi> was
                    instituted by Urban VI., promulgated in 1389 by Boniface IX., and reappointed by
                    the council of Basel in 1441 in commemoration of the visit paid by Mary to
                    Elizabeth. It is observed on July 2, and has been retained in the English
                    calendar. (6) The Feast of the Assumption <hi rend="italic">(Dormitio, Pausatio,
                    Transitus, Depositio, Migratio, Assumptio,</hi><hi rend="italic">κolμησιs,
                    μετaστaσιs,</hi><hi rend="italic">άνάληψα)</hi> has reference to the apocryphal
                    story related in several forms in various documents of the 4th century condemned
                    by Pope Gelasius. Their general purport is that as the time drew nigh for “the
                    most blessed Virgin” (who is also spoken of as “Holy Mary,” “the queen of all
                    the saints,” “the holy spotless Mother of God ”) to leave the world, the
                    apostles were miraculously assembled round her deathbed at Bethlehem on the
                    Lord’s day, whereupon Christ descended with a multitude of angels and received
                    her soul. After ‘ ‘ the spotless and precious body” had been laid in the tomb,
                    “suddenly there shone round them (the apostles) a miraculous light,” and it was
                    taken up into heaven. The first Catholic writer who relates this story is
                    Gregory of Tours (<hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 590); Epiphanius two centuries
                    earlier had declared that nothing was known as to the circumstances of Mary’s
                    death and burial; and one of the documents of the council of Ephesus implies a
                    belief that she was buried in that city. The Sleep of the Theotokos is observed
                    in the Greek Church as a great festival on August 15; the Armenian Church also
                    commemoratesit, but the Ethiopie Church celebrates her death and burial on two
                    separate days. The earliest allusion to the existence of such a festival in the
                    Western Church seems to be that found in the proceedings of the synod of
                    Salzburg in 800; it is also spoken of in the thirty-sixth canon of the reforming
                    synod of Mainz, held in 813. It was not, however, at that time universal, being
                    mentioned as doubtful in the capitularies of Charlemagne. It ought to be
                    observed that the doctrine of the bodily assumption of the Virgin into heaven,
                    although extensively believed, and indeed flowing as natural theological
                    consequence from that of her sinlessness, has never been declared to be “de
                    fide” by the Church of Pome, and is still merely a “pia sententia.” (7) The
                    Nativity of Mary <hi rend="italic">(Nativitas,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ytveθKιov</hi><hi rend="italic">τής Θεοτόκου),</hi> observed on September 8, is
                    first mentioned in one of the homilies of Andrew of Crete (<hi rend="italic"
                    >c.</hi> 750), and along with the feasts of the Purification, the Annunciation,
                    and the Assumption, it was appointed to be observed by the synod of Salzburg in
                    800, but seems to have been quite unknown at that time in the Gallican Church,
                    and even two centuries later it was by no means general in Italy. In the Roman
                    Church a large number of minor festivals in honour of the Virgin are locally
                    celebrated; and all the Saturdays of the year as well as the entire month of May
                    are also regarded as sacred to her. (J. S. BL.)</p>
