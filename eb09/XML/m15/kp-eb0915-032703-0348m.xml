                <p>The archipelago is iu some respects one of the most distinctly typical examples

                <p>The Maidive archipelago in plan may be compared to a chain suspended from a peg,
                    each link of which chain is an irregularly elliptical chaplet of islets, the
                    greater axes of these quasi-ellipses varying from about 90 miles downwards.
                    Taking separately any one of these chaplets (or <hi rend="italic">atolls),</hi>
                    we now know it to be the nearly level summit of a submarine table-mountain,
                    rising abruptly from the unfathomable ocean, and approaching the surface within
                    a distance which varies in different atolls from 20 to 45 fathoms. The
                    quasi-elliptical margin of the atoll is fringed, and the central expanse of its
                    area is more or less sparsely studded, “with oval basins of coral-rock just
                    lipping the surface of the sea, and each containing a lake of clear water”
                    (Darwin). These small oval basins, or ring-shaped reefs and islets, are in fact
                    essentially miniatures of the atoll itself.</p>
                <p>The general impression made by the Maidive atoll is vividly drawn by the French
                    adventurer Pÿrard de la Vai (1602-7):</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ Each <hi rend="italic">atollon</hi> is detached, and contains within it a
                    great multitude of small islands. It is a marvel to see one of these <hi
                    rend="italic">atollons,</hi> compassed all round by a great bank of stone,
                    insomuch that no art of man could so well enclose with walls an equal space of
                    ground Looking from the middle of an atollon you see all round you that great
                    bank of stone encircling the isles and defending them against the violence of
                    the sea. And it is a fearful thing even for the boldest to draw near this bank
                    and see the waves come on and break furiously all round . . . . so that you see
                    all round you as it were a whitened wall.”</p>
                <p>Though the barrier reef, or <hi rend="italic">banc de pierre,</hi> of which
                    Pyrard speaks, exists in most of the atolls, there is none in the most northerly
                    of the great atolls (Tiladummati and Milladummadu, two divisions of one atoll).
                    In this there are broad and safe navigable channels, from 1 to 2 miles wide,
                    between all the islands forming the chaplet. A vessel can enter the atoll by any
                    one of these channels, and steer within it in any direction, anchoring anywhere
                    en a sandy bottom in 20 to 25 fathoms. In the more southerly atolls entrance
                    channels are only found at occasional intervals, though in all they are pretty
                    numerous. Thus in Suadiva, the most southerly of the large atolls (50 miles from
                    north to south, 36 miles from east to west), which has a barrier reef on great
                    part of its contour, there are forty-two channels by which a ship can enter the
                    lagoon.</p>
                <p>It is observed that in the double part of the chain of atolls the openings are
                    most numerous on those sides which are in juxtaposition. Thus on the three
                    atolls of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n350/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0350-0329"/> Ari and North and South Nilandu there are on the
                    inner or eastern side seventy-three deep-water channels through the harrier, on
                    the outer or western side only twenty-five; whilst on the atolls of South Mâlé,
                    Felîdû, and Mulaku, which lie facing the three former, there are on the inner or
                    western side fifty-six deep-water openings, and on the outer or eastern side
                    only thirty-seven. These differences are doubtless due to differences in the
                    action of the sea caused by the juxtaposition of the two rows of atolls, and
                    analogous facts are observed elsewhere in atolls exposed to trade-winds.</p>
                <p>Immediately outside of the great chaplets or atolls the figures of the soundings
                    rise suddenly. Thus at Ihavan-diffulu (Heawandoo of charts), the most northerly
                    atoll, close to the margin of the reef the line gave 50 and 60 fathoms, and at
                    300 yards distance there was no bottom with a 300-fathom line. And this sudden
                    increase of depth applies to the deep channels between the atolls as much as to
                    the ocean east and west of them.</p>
                <p>We have spoken of the small reefs, which fringe the atolls and dot their area, as
                    also ring-shaped. This is the type, but it is not universal. The charts show
                    that where the channels or breaches through the marginal reef of the atoll are
                    few or narrow there are no minor annular reefs <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> in
                    Suadi Va); where the channels are somewhat broader, the intercepted portions of
                    reef are annular, but not the reef in the central area; where the channels are
                    broadest, almost every reef throughout the atoll is more or less perfectly
                    annular. The depth of the lagoon within these rings is generally 5 to 7 fathoms,
                    but sometimes, as in Ari atoll, it reaches 12 fathoms. The outer margin of the
                    rings is bordered with living coral, within which is a fiat surface of
                    coral-rock. On this flat, sand partially indurated, and fragments of coral,
                    &amp;c., have accumulated, and been converted into islets clothed with
                    vegetation. Such islets sometimes fill the whole ring of reef, and sometimes are
                    mere strips occupying a segment of it. Obviously the whole aggregate of actual
                    dry land in such an archipelago is infinitesimal compared with the area of the
                    atolls. The highest part of the islands is generally about G feet above water.
                    Moresby found the surface-sand usually about 3 feet thick, the upper part
                    partially mixed with vegetable matter So as to form a light soil; below this a
                    white compact sand, and then a soft sandstone 2 feet thick, below which it
                    softened to sand again, and fresh-water appeared.</p>
                <p>All the islands of any extent are well clothed with wood, including many fine
                    large trees and the ordinary shrubs of the Ceylon coast-jungle; where the jungle
                    has been cleared, grass grows luxuriantly. But the cocoa-palm is the
                    characteristic tree; and, low as the islands are, being covered with these, they
                    can be seen from a masthead at 15 miles. The appearance they present is that of
                    a tuft or line of trees rising out of the water.</p>
                <p>A good deal of vicissitude seems to go on in the formation of new islets and
                    decay of old ones, of which our survey-officers met with various instances.</p>
                <p>All the inhabited islands, and some besides, afford fresh water. But the quality
                    of water varies; and it is not uncommon to see two wells within a few feet of
                    each other, one brackish and the other excellent. None of the wells are more
                    than 6 feet deep.</p>
                <p>The whole archipelago has from the earliest reports of it formed a little
                    kingdom. Physically the number of atolls may be reckoned as nineteen, besides
                    some solitary islands; but administratively these are grouped into thirteen, and
                    the term atoll has been transferred to this division. We give in the following
                    table the list of these (political) atolls, in a second column the spelling of
                    the marine charts, and in a third the list of atolls as given by Pyrard de la
                    Vai, in the beginning of the 17th century.</p>

                <p>The list from Pyrard shows that the division in the beginning of the 17th century
                    was identical with what it now is. But we may gather that it is substantially of
                    much greater antiquity, from the statement of Ibn-Batuta (<hi rend="italic"
                    >c.</hi> 1343), who says the islands were divided into <hi rend="italic"
                    >aklim</hi><hi rend="italic">(κλίματα),</hi> each under a governor. He mentions
                    eleven of these:—Bâlibûr, Kaûnalûs, Mahal, Tilâdîb, Karâîdû, Tîm, Tiladummati,
                    Hiladummati, Barîdû, Kandakal, Mulûk,—of which indeed the names of only seven,
                    viz., (1) Tiladummati, (2) Heladummati, (3) Bâlibûr, (5) Mahal, (7) Barîdû, (8)
                    Mulûk, (12) Suweid, can be identified with those of the existing divisions. But
                    another, Karâîdû, no doubt represents Karadιva, a well-known solitary island
                    north of Mâlé atoll; Kandakal is an island of the Miladummadu atoll, called in
                    the charts Condaicoll; Tim appears near the north of Tilladummati as Oteim; and
                    the three—Kannalûs, Kandakal, and Tim—are presented prominently as the islands
                    Camdalus, Camdicall, and Otimo in the <hi rend="italic">Mappemonde</hi> made for
                    Henry II. of France (c. 1555, see Jomard’s <hi rend="italic">Facsimiles,</hi>

                    Possibly, therefore, the Moorish traveller had substituted true names of islands
                    which he remembered for the names of atolls which he had forgotten.</p>
                <p>The Maldives are inhabited by a people of old civilization, professing Islam, and
                    ruled by a sultan of ancient lineage. What the number of islands may be we
                    cannot say. They are popularly estimated at 12,000, as appears by the ancient
                    style of the sultan as “king of 12,000 islands and 13 atolls.” (See also <hi
                    rend="italic">Marco Polo,</hi> 2d ed., 1875, it 417-19.) Those marked with names
                    in the British survey amount to 602, and the inhabited islands to 178. The men
                    are of a darkish copper colour, short stature (5 feet 2 inches), and poor
                    physique, but oval contour of face, pleasing expression, and large bright eyes,
                    suggesting resemblance to both the Singhalese and Malabar people. The women are
                    fairer than the men, with regular features and clean healthy aspect. A few of
                    the people bear signs of African mixture, easily accounted for; and probably the
                    blood of the small communities has been tinged by the occasional settlement of
                    other foreigners. The people are decidedly unwarlike; and there is hardly any
                    crime of violence among them. They are said to be lax in morals and
                    conversation; but otherwise their character and disposition have favourably
                    impressed visitors. Though suspicious of strangers, they are hospitable; and
                    among themselves they are kindly, and affectionate to their kindred and in
                    attendance on the sick. They are very cleanly in person <pb break="no"

                    guessed in some books at 200,000; almost certainly one-tenth of that number
                    would be an ample estimate. Moresby states the population of 98 islands, and the
                    aggregate is 11,310. In the same proportion 178 islands would give 20,543; but
                    the aggregate quoted includes the King’s Island, which is much above the average
                    in population.</p>
                <p>The language is undoubtedly a dialect of Singhalese approaching the old <hi

                <p>Combining 1, 2, and 7, we have 61 per cent, of words of Singhalese or Sanskrit
                    origin. And an analysis by Mr Bell of one of the sultan’s letters to the Ceylon
                    Government gives 65 per cent, of such words.</p>
                <p>The origin of the name <hi rend="italic">Mal-diva</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mâldîva</hi> is obscure. Diva is a familiar word in the Indian <hi
                    rend="italic">prakrits</hi> (Sansk., <hi rend="italic">dvlρa</hi>; Pali, <hi
                    rend="italic">dipo}</hi> for an island. By a form of this word the people
                    formerly designated themselves and their country, and this survives in letters
                    of last century from the sultan to the Ceylon Government, in which he designates
                    his kingdom as <hi rend="italic">Divehi</hi><hi rend="italic">Râjjê,</hi> and
                    his subjects as <hi rend="italic">Divehi mihun,</hi> “island people.” There is a
                    very old example of this use in Ammianus Marcellinus, who, in reference to the
                    alleged excitement in the East at the accession of Julian, says that missions
                    were prepared “<hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">usque</hi> Divis <hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi> Serendivis,” from the people of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Divas</hi> and of <hi rend="italic">Serendiva</hi> or Ceylon. And this is the
                    name <hi rend="italic">Diva</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Dîba-jât</hi> (Pers,
                    plural form) by which these islands are described by the early Arabian
                    geographers. The first literary use of the whole name is Ibn Batuta’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Dhîbat-al-Mahal</hi> (14th century), an Arabized form,. sometimes
                    used <hi rend="italic">(Mahal-dib~)</hi> by the people now, though the proper
                    form seems to be <hi rend="italic">Male.</hi><hi rend="italic">Malê-diva</hi>
                    may possibly, as Bishop Caldwell (comp. <hi rend="italic">Grammar,</hi> 2ded.,
                    Introd. p. 28) and others have suggested, have meant the “islands of Malé” or
                    Malabar. On the other hand <hi rend="italic">Mâlâ</hi> (Sansk.), “a chaplet” or
                    “row,” is not an impossible etymology considering how naturally the word
                    “chaplet” occurs in the ende⅛vour to describe an atoll. But these are
                    conjectures. Under the sultan (who styles himself on coinage “Lord of Land and
                    Sea ”) there used to be six recognized viziers or councillors (but this system
                    is now obsolete), besides a chief of law and religion called <hi rend="italic"
                    >fandiari.</hi> Over each of the thirteen atolls is a king’s agent, called <hi
                    rend="italic">atolu-veri,</hi> who collects the revenue. This official is often
                    one of the royal family, or a vizier’s son, and often resides at Malé, employing
                    a deputy. On each island is a headman called <hi rend="italic">rarhu-veri.</hi>
                    There is also on each island containing forty inhabitants a <hi rend="italic"
                    >kâtibu</hi> (Ar., <hi rend="italic">kâtib,</hi> “scribe”), who acts as judge
                    and minister, celebrating marriages, &amp;c. Pyrard calls him the <hi
                    rend="italic">cure.</hi></p>
                <p>Some of the oldest accounts of these islands represent them as always governed by
                    a woman,—a notion which probably arose among the Mohammedan visitors from
                    finding that female heirs were not precluded from succession. Just the same
                    notion was held about Achιn in the 17th century, because there chanced to reign
                    there several female sovereigns in succession (see vol. i. p. 97). We do find
                    females nominally reigning on the Maldives on two of the rare occasions when we
                    have glimpses of their state, viz., in the time of Ibn Batuta, and again in the
                    last century.</p>
                <p>Islam is universally professed by the people, nor is there tradition of any other
                    religion, though there are a variety of Pagan superstitions and some doubtful
                    traces of Buddhism. Thus the <hi rend="italic">Bo-tree</hi> (or pippal), so
                    sacred among the Buddhists of Ceylon, is still cherished near mosques. Pyrard de
                    la Vai was informed that the conversion to Islam took place two centuries at
                    most before his time, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> about 1400. But, unless there
                    was a decay and revival, we know this to be wrong, as the islanders were
                    Mohammedan in the time of Ibn Batuta (1343). And this traveller tells that the
                    father of one of his wives in the islands had for his grandfather (though the
                    word used may mean “ancestor” only) the Sultan Dâûd, who was grandson of Ahmed
                    Shanû-râza, the first king who adopted Islam. Accepting the meaning of
                    “grandfather,” this would carry the conversion back to about 1200, a probable
                    epoch, for about that time there was a considerable outburst of missionary zeal
                    in Islam, which led to the conversion of the coast states of Sumatra, &amp;c.
                    Ibn Batuta records an inscription on the Jami Mosque of the King’s Island which
                    ran:— “Sultan Ahmed Shanû-râzah embraced Islam at the hands of Abu’l Barakât the
                    Berber from the West”; but no date is given.</p>
                <p>We have mentioned the occurrence of the name Dm in Ammianus. At an earlier date
                    Ptolemy notices the numerous islands lying in front of Taprobane, alleged to
                    number 1378. It is possible also that the <hi rend="italic">Maniolae</hi> of the
                    same geographer may constitute a duplicate indication of the Maldives. For in
                    the gossip of Palladius about India (see <hi rend="italic">C.</hi> Miiller <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> s <hi rend="italic">Pscudo-Callisthenes,</hi> p. 102)
                    this name <hi rend="italic">Maniolae</hi> is applied to a group of islands, 1000
                    in number, that lay near Taprobane, and respecting which the old fable of the
                    magnetic rock was current, which Ptolemy also connects with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Maniolae.</hi></p>
                <p>Cosmas (c. 545) shows distinct knowledge of the Maldives (without naming them) as
                    numerous close-set small islands round Sielediba or Taprobane, iri all of which
                    were found cocoa-nuts and fresh water. Passing next to the Arabian notices
                    translated by penaudot and Reinaud,. which date from 851, and to the work of
                    Mas’ûdi iri the next century, we find tolerably correct accounts of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dlbas,</hi> said to be 1900 in number. Al Birûni’s account (c.
                    1030) of the islands is marked by his usual perspicacity and accuracy. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Divas</hi> are islets which form themselves in the sea, appearing
                    like a ridge of sand, extending and uniting till they present a solid aspect.
                    But also with time some decompose and melt away in the sea, whilst the
                    inhabitants transfer their cocoa-trees and possessions to an island which is
                    waxing instead of waning,—circumstances corroborated by modern observation.</p>
                <p>All the old authors speak of coir (the fibre of the cocoa-nut husk) as one of the
                    staple products of these islands, and the importance of this article for marine
                    equipment led the Portuguese about 1518 to establish a factory on the Maldives.
                    Joâo Gomez, the head of the settlement, was at first well received, but his
                    arrogant and violent conduct gave great offence to the Mohammedan traders from
                    Cambay, who brought an armed flotilla against the Portuguese and put them all to
                    death. The Portuguese several times renewed the attempt to establish themselves
                    on the islands, and maintained a garrison for some time, but these endeavours
                    had no permanent result. The islanders were also frequently subject to raids at
                    the hands of the Mopla pirates of Malabar, and sometimes also, it would seem, to
                    maltreatment from the crews of European vessels. The MS. diary of Mr (afterwards
                    Sir William) Hedges, who passed through the Maldives in 1685, says: “We putt out
                    a piece of a Red Ancient to appear like a Moor’s Vessel!: not judging it safe to
                    be known to be English; Our Nation having lately gott an ill Name by abusing ye
                    Inhabitants.” Such circumstances probably led the islanders to place themselves
                    in relation with the rulers of Ceylon; and in 1645 occurs the first record of
                    the embassy from the sultan of the Maldives to the Dutch governor at Colombo,
                    which has continued to the present day, under Dutch and English, to arrive
                    annually, bringing some poor offering, as a vague token of homage and claim of
                    protection. The last political trouble of which we have notice occurred in the
                    middle of last century. In 1753 the chief minister conspired to hand over the
                    islands to the Ali raja of Cannanore. A Mopla force occupied Malé, and carried
                    off the sultan. The traitor himself was rewarded by being thrown into the sea.
                    The oppression of these foreigners made the islanders rise and expel them. The
                    sultan never returned, and a minister who <pb break="no"

                    1760. In 1754 Dupleix occupied Mâle with a small French detachment, which
                    remained several years. In 1811 the sultan wrote to the governorgeneral (Lord
                    Minto) to complain of the violent conduct of the officers of a ship under
                    British colours which had been wrecked on· the islands. Lord Minto sent back a
                    courteous answer with presents. There have been no other events during the
                    British rule in Ceylon, and the last sultan, Mohammed Moidin, reigned without
                    dispute from 1835 to 1882.</p>
                <p>We have only three substantial accounts of the Maldives from actual
                    residence:—(1) that of the Moor Ibn Batuta, who lived upon them more than a year
                    (1343-44), and filled the office of cadi; it contains much curious detail; (2)
                    the narrative of François Pyrard de la Vai, a French adventurer on board a ship
                    of St Malo, which was wrecked on a reef of the Malosmadulu atoll in 1602, and
                    who was detained five years on the islands,—a book of the greatest interest and
                    accuracy, and by far the best account of these islands in existence; (3) a
                    memoir by two officers of the Indian navy, Lieut. Young and Mr Christopher, who
                    had been employed in the survey of the islands under Captain R. Moresby in
                    1834-35, and who volunteered to remain behind at Malé, in order to acquire a
                    knowledge of the language, customs, &amp;c., of the inhabitants,— a laudable
                    effort, but the result of it was marred somewhat by the illness which prostrated
                    both officers.</p>
                <p>The sultan’s residence and the capital of the kingdom is the island of Mâlé,
                    which lies near the middle of the archipelago on the east side. It is about 1
                    mile long by I mile wide, and contains a population approaching 2000. It has
                    been at one time encompassed with walls and bastions, but these continue in
                    repair only on the north and west. On the north too is an old fort, apparently
                    of Portuguese construction, with a few old guns. On the north and west sides
                    also advantage has been taken of the encircling reef as the base of a wall which
                    has been built up so as to form the lagoon into a harbour for small craft,
                    having a depth of 6 to 12 feet, and a width of 150 yards. The town is laid out
                    in long regular streets at right angles, shaded with trees; the houses are in
                    “compounds,” with high fences excluding the street, and are surrounded with
                    fruit trees and flowers. The sultan’s palace, a large upper-roomed house,
                    occupies with its appurtenances an area of I square mile, enclosed by a shallow
                    ditch now choked with vegetation. The houses generally are large cottages of
                    about 28 feet by 12, formed of substantial wooden frame, with peaked roofs
                    thatched with cocoa-leaves; the walls are matted with cocoa-leaves, but
                    sometimes planked. There are several mosques, and at least one minaret, about 40
                    feet high, for the call to prayer. Stone-built houses, common in Pyrard’s time,
                    are so no longer; there is now but one. There are marked distinctions of rank
                    among the people. At least six classes (we hardly know whether to call them
                    cistes) are recognized, of whom the two highest form a pure aristocracy. The
                    sixth class, called <hi rend="italic">Kallo</hi> (“black”?), consists of the
                    common people generally, of whom the toddy-drawers are regarded as the
                    lowest.</p>
                <p>The employments of the common people are fishing, gathering cocoa-nuts and
                    cowries, weaving, and toddy-drawing. Women beat the cocoa-fibre and twist it
                    into yarn, make mats, prepare breadfruit by slicing and drying in the sun, spin
                    and dye cotton thread, make sweetmeats of cocoa-nut and palm-sugar. Women are
                    not secluded or veiled as in typical Moslem countries.</p>
                <p>Rice, the staple of food, is imported. Other chief food is fish (chiefly dried
                    bonito), breadfruit prepared in various ways, cocoa-nut, and a few fruits and
                    vegetables. There are a few sheep and cattle on Mâlé island, which are
                    occasionally slaughtered.</p>
                <p>From the earliest notices the production of coir, the collection of cowries, and
                    the weaving of excellent textures on these islands have been noted. This last,
                    and that of fine mats are the only manufactures in which skill is shown. The
                    mats seem to be now produced only in Suadiva atoll; the cloth chiefly, but not
                    solely, in Malosmadulu atoll.</p>
                <p>The chief exports of the islands, besides coir and cowries (a decreasing trade),
                    are cocoa-nuts, <hi rend="italic">copra (i.e.,</hi> cocoa-nut husk),
                    tortoise-shell, and dried bonito-fish. An enormous amount of this last was
                    formerly carried to Ceylon and Sumatra, the latter being supplied by traders who
                    came from Chittagong. It has been known over the East from time immemorial as
                    <hi rend="italic">koboli-mc↑s,</hi> a corruption apparently of the Maldivian <hi
                    rend="italic">kalû-bili-mâs,</hi> “black bonito fish,” sometimes further
                    corrupted to <hi rend="italic">gomulmutch.</hi></p>
                <p>Native vessels of 80 to 200 tons burthen make annual trips to Calcutta towards
                    the end of the south-west monsoon, returning with the north-east monsoon in
                    December. After leaving the Maldives they sight no land till Jagannâth. They
                    carry thither the articles named above, and bring back rice, cotton stuffs, and
                    sundries. These long voyages are not confined to the craft of the capital.
                    Moresby, in 1834-35, found that a small island in the North Nilandu atoll sent
                    annually to Bengal five or six boats of 80 to 100 tons each. On the same island
                    there was a kind of navigation school, and the natives made and repaired some
                    kind of nautical instruments. The old cash of the Maldives was the curious <hi
                    rend="italic">larin</hi> or? fishhook money” made of a bent rod of silver. This
                    has been long replaced by coins of base metal bearing the same name. The
                    Anglo-Indian rupee is current for larger payments, and cowries are still used to
                    some extent.</p>
                <p>Two alphabets are known on the islands (besides the Arabic, which appears on
                    tombstones and in other inscriptions). The first is an ancient alphabet, known
                    as <hi rend="italic">Divehi Hakura,</hi> “island letters.” This in 1835 still
                    survived in the southern atolls, and orders for these were written in it. It is
                    written, like all the Indian alphabets, from left to right, and is evidently (by
                    comparison with plate xvii. in Dr Burnell’s <hi rend="italic">Elements of South
                    Indian Palaeography)</hi> a form (with additional letters) of the old Tamil
                    character (700 to 1300 A.D.) called in Malabar <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vatteluttu,</hi> or “round hand.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The resemblance to this is much closer than to the old
                    Singhalese with which it is compared in Mr Albert Gray’s valuable paper already
                    referred to. .</p></note> The modern Maidive writing, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gabali</hi><hi rend="italic">Tana,</hi> is usually<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Usually”; but a Maldivian skipper who gave
                    James Prιnsep information wrote it from left to right (see <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jour. As. Soc. Bengal,</hi> v. 794).</p></note> written from right to left,
                    like Arabic. It is said to have been introduced in the 16th century, and has
                    gone through several variations. Some of the letters are modified from the
                    Arabic character, and nine of them are the Arabic numeral digits. On the other
                    hand numerals are represented by letters of the alphabet. The former system of
                    reckoning was duodecimal, but this is dying out.</p>
                <p>Nothing is accurately known of the flora of the islands, and Kew possesses no
                    illustration of it. Among larger trees are mentioned the banyan, pippal,
                    breadfruit, tamarind, and a large tree called <hi rend="italic">kandu,</hi>
                    affording a very light wood used for rafts, floats, &amp;c.; also species of
                    pandanus. The castor-oil tree is abundant, though not used. The cocoa-nut of the
                    islands, though of fine quality, is very small, not much larger than an orange.
                    The tree itself furnishes the only indigenous wood used for boatbuilding. The
                    <hi rend="italic">dumbari (Calophyllum inophyllum)</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >kuradi (Pemphis</hi><hi rend="italic">acidula)</hi> are used in minor
                    wood-work. A tuber, grated and steeped in water to remove its acridity, is made
                    into flour,—perhaps a <hi rend="italic">Colocasia,</hi> which Ibn Batuta
                    mentions· <hi rend="italic">{al-kalakas)</hi> as used to make a kind of
                    vermicelli. They have also sweet potatoes, pine-apples, pomegranates (bearing
                    fruit throughout the year), plantains, and most of the other tropical or
                    subtropical Indian fruits, chillies, a few areca trees, &amp;c. The double
                    cocoa-nut of the Seychelles Islands (fruit of <hi rend="italic">Lodoicea
                    Sechellarum)</hi> used to be cast up on the islands, and was believed to be a
                    submarine production<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n353/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0353-0332"/>,—hence called the sea cocoa-nut. It was valued
                    for imaginary qualities, and exported to India. The Portuguese long believed it
                    to be a product of these islands, and called it the Maidive cocoa-nut.</p>
                <p>Animals are few. Those named are rats, numerous and destructive, which climb the
                    cocoa-trees and devour the kernels; the large bat called in India “flying-fox,”
                    also said to destroy many small cocoa-nuts; tortoises; a small snake said to be
                    harmless, &amp;c. Domestic animals are rare; a few goats and cattle are reared
                    on Mâlé.</p>
                <p>The climate is not oppressive or disagreeable, but is very unhealthy for
                    strangers, whether Asiatic or European. Ibn Batuta says every visitor was
                    attacked by violent fever; Pyrard says the same; and this was substantially the
                    experience of the survey officers and crews in 1834-35. The native crews also
                    suffered much from the disease called <hi rend="italic">beri-beri</hi> (which
                    has dropsical symptoms, and is often fatal) and from violent
                    bowel-complaints.</p>
                <p>A complete report on the Maldives has recently been prepared by Mr H. C. P. Bell
                    of the Ceylon civil service, who has visited the islands, and this is now being
                    printed at Colombo. Mr Bell kindly enabled the present writer to see a copy
                    before this Article went to press, and many valuable facts have been added from
                    it. Other materials used have been—Darwin, <hi rend="italic">The Structure and
