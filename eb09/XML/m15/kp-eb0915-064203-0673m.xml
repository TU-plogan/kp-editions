                    Spottsylvania county, Virginia, January 14, 1806. In 1825 he entered the
                    American navy as midshipman, circumnavigating the globe in the “Vincennes,”
                    during a cruise of four years. In 1836 he was made lieutenant, and gazetted
                    astronomer to an exploring expedition. In 1839 he met with an accident which
                    resulted in permanent lameness, and unfitted him for active service. Maury was
                    placed in charge of the Depot of Charts and Instruments, out of which have grown
                    the United States Naval Observatory and the Hydrographic Office. He laboured
                    assiduously and with complete success to place the depot in a state of
                    efficiency. While in the “Vincennes,” and in subsequent cruises, Maury made many
                    observations as to the winds and currents, and when in charge of the
                    Hydrographic Office he set himself to collect further data by distributing to
                    captains of vessels specially prepared log-books. So successful was he in this
                    enterprise that in the course of nine years he had collected a sufficient number
                    of logs to make two hundred manuscript volumes, each with about two thousand
                    five hundred days’ observations. One result was to show the necessity for
                    combined action on the part of maritime nations in regard to ocean meteorology.
                    This led to an <pb break="no"

                    which produced the greatest benefit to navigation as well as indirectly to
                    meteorology. One result was the establishment of the meteorological department
                    of the English Board of Trade, now known as the Meteorological Office, which
                    adopted Maury’s model log-books. In 1853 he published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Letters on the Amazon and Atlantic Slopes of South America,</hi> and in 1855 he
                    was promoted to the rank of commander. On the outbreak of the American civil war
                    in 1861, Maury threw in his lot with the South, and, having lost nearly his all,
                    retired to England, where he was presented with a handsome testimonial raised by
                    public subscription. Afterwards he became imperial commissioner of emigration to
                    Maximilian of Mexico, on whose death he took up his residence in Virginia, where
                    he died on February 1, 1873.</p>
                <p>In 1848 Maury published a <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Navigation,</hi> which
                    was long used as a text-book in the United States navy. The work, however, by
                    which he is best known is his <hi rend="italic">Physical Geography of the
                    Sea,</hi> the first edition of which was published in London in 1855, and in New
                    York in 1856; it was translated into several European languages. The theories
                    which it contains are now generally admitted to be quite erroneous. Maury’s
                    reputation rests on the eminent services he rendered to navigation and
                    meteorology, he having been the first to show how the latter could be raised to
                    the certainty of a science. He was essentially a practical man; his great aim
                    was to render navigation more secure and economical, and in this he was
                    eminently successful. Other works published by Maury are the papers contributed
                    by him to the <hi rend="italic">Astronomical Observations</hi> of the United
                    States Observatory, <hi rend="italic">Letters concerning Lincs for Steamers
                    crossing the Atlantic</hi> (1854), <hi rend="italic">Physical Geography</hi>
                    (1864), and <hi rend="italic">Manual of Geography</hi> (1871). In 1859 he began
                    the publication of a series of nautical monographs.</p>
