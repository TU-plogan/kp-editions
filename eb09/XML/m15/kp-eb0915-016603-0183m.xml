                    College, Aberdeen, and from 1756 taught the school of Ruthven for some time. In
                    1758 he published a poem entitled the <hi rend="italic">Highlander,</hi> and
                    about the same period contributed several minor pieces to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scots Magazine.</hi> In 1759, while residing with a pupil at Moffat, he became
                    accidentally known to Dr Carlyle of Inveresk and Mr Home, the author of <hi
                    rend="italic">Douglas,</hi> both of them already interested in the subject of
                    ancient Highland poetry; some fragmentary “translations” from the Gaelic, which
                    in the course of a few days he supplied to Home, were much appreciated in the
                    literary circles of Edinburgh, and in 1760 a volume was published by Macpherson,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Fragments of Ancient Poetry collected in the
                    Highlands of Scotland, and translated from the Gaelic or Erse Language,</hi>
                    with a preface by Dr Blair. A sum of money was now subscribed by the faculty of
                    advocates for the purpose of enabling Macpherson to go to the Scottish Highlands
                    in search of other fragments, and the result of his labours was the publication
                    at London in 1762 of <hi rend="italic">Fingal, an Epic Poem, in six books, with
                    other lesser Poems,</hi> dedicated to Lord Bute; this was followed in 1763 by
                    <hi rend="italic">Temora,</hi> in eight books, with several other poems. For the
                    real character of these publications see <hi rend="smallcaps">Celtic
                    Literature,</hi> vol. v. p. 313-4. At the time of their appearance they greatly
                    advanced the translator both in fame and fortune; in 1764 he was appointed
                    surveyor-general of the Floridas, and on his return to England two years
                    afterwards he was permitted to retain for life the salary of the office. In 1771
                    he published <hi rend="italic">An Introduction to the History of Great Britain
                    and Ireland,</hi> and in 1775 <hi rend="italic">A History of Great Britain from
                    the Restoration to the Accession of the House of Hanover (2</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vois.</hi> 4to) and <hi rend="italic">Original Papers containing
                    the Secret History of Great Britain</hi> for the same period (also in 2 vols.
                    4to). His translation of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> published in 1773,
                    was greatly praised by Robertson and others in Scotland, but met with a severe
                    reception in England, and has not stood the test of time. About 1779 he was
                    appointed to the lucrative post of agent for the nabob of Arcot, and from 1780
                    onwards he sat in parliament for the borough of Camelford. He died at
                    Belleville, an estate which he had recently purchased in Inverness, on February
                    17, 1796, and was buried in the Poets’ Corner at Westminster Abbey. His will had
                    provided for the publication of the Ossianic poems in the original Gaelic, which
                    he is understood to have been preparing for the press at the time of his death;
                    and the work accordingly appeared in 3 vols. 8vo, in 1807, with a literal
                    translation into Latin, by Robert Macfarlane, and a dissertation on the
                    authenticity of the poems, by Sir John Sinclair.</p>
