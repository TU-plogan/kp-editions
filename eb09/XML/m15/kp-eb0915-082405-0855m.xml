                    Fabritius, an able disciple of Rembrandt, who lost his life by an explosion of a
                    powder magazine in Delft in 1654. It is to the patient researches of W. Bürger
                    (Th. Thorè), Havard, Obreeu, Soutendam, and others that we owe our knowledge of
                    the main facts of his life, discovered in the archives of his native
                    town.</p></note> Van der Meer, or Vermeer, by which name he is also known, was
                    born in Delft in 1632. There is a tradition, handed down by the Dutch writers,
                    that he was a pupil of Caret Fabritius, but, in the strict sense of the word,
                    this is almost impossible, for Fabritius was but eight years older than Van der
                    Meer, and entered the guild of St Luke only one year before our painter. From
                    his early death the works by Fabritius are few, but his contemporaries speak of
                    him as a man of remarkable power, and the paintings now ascertained to be from
                    his hand, and till recently ascribed to Rembrandt, prove him to have been deeply
                    imbued with the spirit and manner of that master. Whether Van der Meer had ever
                    any closer relation to Rembrandt than through companionship with Fabritius
                    remains as yet uncertain. In 1653 he married Catherine Bolenes, and in the same
                    year he entered the guild of St Luke of Delft, becoming one of the heads of the
                    guild in 1662, and again in 1670. He died at Delft in 1675, leaving a widow and
                    eight children. His circumstances cannot have been flourishing, for at his death
                    he left twenty-six pictures undisposed of, and his widow had to apply to the
                    court of insolvency to be placed under a curator, who, it is interesting to
                    know, was Leeuwenhoek, the naturalist.</p>
                <p>It is his works, however, that claim our attention. For more than two centuries
                    he has been almost completely forgotten, and his pictures have been sold under
                    the names <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n856/mode/1up"

                    Hooch, Metzu, Terborch, and even of Rembrandt. The honour of first recalling the
                    attention of the art-world to this most original painter belongs undoubtedly to
                    Thoré, an exiled Frenchman, who described his then known works in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Musées</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Hollande</hi> (1858-60),
                    published under the assumed name of W. Bürger. The result of his researches,
                    continued in his <hi rend="italic">Galerie</hi><hi rend="italic">Suermondt</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Galerie</hi><hi rend="italic">d’Aren· berg,</hi> was
                    afterwards given by him in a charming, though incomplete, monograph <hi
                    rend="italic">(Gazette</hi><hi rend="italic">des Beaux-Arts,</hi> 1866, pp. 297,
                    458, 542). The task has since been prosecuted with success by Havard <hi
                    rend="italic">(Les Artistes Hollandais'),</hi> and by Obreen <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Hederlandsche Kunstgeschiedenis,</hi> DI. iv.), and we are now in a position
                    to refer to Van der Meer’s works. His pictures are rarely dated, but, luckily
                    for us, one of the most important bears the date 1656, and thus gives us a key
                    to his styles. The picture referred to is the only one that has figures of life
                    size. It is the Woman and Soldier, with other two figures, of the Dresden
                    gallery, and is painted with remarkable power and boldness, great command over
                    the resources of colour, and with wonderful expression of life. For strength and
                    colour it more than holds its own beside the neighbouring Rembrandts. To this
                    early period of his career belong, from internal evidence, the Reading Girl of
                    the same gallery, the luminous and masterly view of Delft in the museum of the
                    Hague, La Laitière and the small street view, both in the collection of Μ. Six
                    van Hillegom at Amsterdam, Le Soldat et la Fillette qui Rit of Μ. Double, the
                    Country House in the gallery at Berlin, and others. In all these we find the
                    same brilliant style and vigorous work, a solid impasto and a crisp sparkling
                    touch. His first manner seems to have been influenced by the pleiad of painters
                    circling round Rembrandt, a school which we know lost favour in Holland in the
                    last quarter of the century. During the last ten or twelve years of his life Van
                    der Meer adopted a second manner. We now find his painting smooth and thin, and
                    his colours paler and softer. Instead of masculine vigour we have refined
                    delicacy and subtlety, but in both styles beauty of tone and perfect harmony are
                    conspicuous. Through all his work may be traced his love of lemon-yellow and of
                    blue of all shades. Of his second style typical examples are to be seen in La
                    Coquette of the Brunswick gallery, in the Woman Reading in the Van der Hoop
                    collection at the Hague, in the Lady at a Casement belonging to Lord Powerscourt
                    (exhibited at Burlington House, 1878), and in the Music Master and Pupil
                    belonging to the Queen (exhibited at Burlington House, 1876).</p>
                <p>Van der Meer’s works are extremely rare. There is but one in the Louvre, the Lace
                    Maker; Dresden has the two above-mentioned, while Berlin has three, all acquired
                    in the Suermondt collection, and the Czernin gallery of Vienna is fortunate in
                    possessing a fine picture, believed to represent the artist in his studio. In
                    the Arenberg gallery at Brussels there is a remarkable head of a girl, half the
                    size of life, which seems to be intermediate between his two styles. Several of
                    his paintings are to be found in private foreign collections. In all his work
                    there is a singular completeness and charm. In rendering momentary expression he
                    is a master, and his pictures attract by the perfect delineation of character as
                    well as by the technical skill of the painter. His tone is usually silvery with
                    pearly shadows, and the lighting of his interiors is equal and natural. In all
                    cases his figures seem to move in light and air, and in this respect he
                    resembles greatly his fellow-worker De Hooch, who entered the guild of St Luke
                    only two years later than Van der Meer. It is curious to read that, at one of
                    the auctions in Amsterdam about the middle of last century, a De Hooch is
                    praised as being “nearly equal to the famous Van der Meer of Delft.” So nearly
                    are they allied that the best judges are divided in opinion whether the Dutch
                    Family (“La Promenade”) of the academy of Vienna should be attributed to our
                    painter or to De Hooch. Doubtless many of Van der Meer’s works have yet to be
                    restored to their proper author; but, as he is now in vogue, much care will have
                    to be used iu judging. This is specially true in regard to the landscapes and
                    “still life ' subjects which are attributed to him. The task is made more
                    difficult by the diversity of style of this “Protean painter,” as he is called
                    by Dr Waagen, or, as Bürger names him, “the Sphinx of Delft.” (J. F. W.)</p>
