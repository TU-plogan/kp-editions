                <p>The city of Manchester and the borough of Salford are about 180 miles north-west
                    of London, and lie in 53° 29' N. lat., 2° 14' 23" W. long. The sister towns
                    stand for the most part on a ‘level plain, the rising ground being chiefly on
                    the north side. The rivers are the Irwell, the Medlock, the Irk, and the Tib,
                    the last entirely overarched and covered by streets and warehouses. The Irwell,
                    which separates Manchester from Salford, is crossed by a series of bridges; it
                    has here an average width of 91 feet and an average depth of about 7 feet; and
                    it discharges itself into the Mersey, which is about ten miles distant. The
                    chief part of the district, before it was covered with the superficial drift of
                    sand, gravel, and clay, consisted of upper New Red Sandstone with slight
                    portions of lower New Red Sandstone, magnesian marls and upper red marls, hard
                    sandstone and limestone rock, and cold clays and shales of contiguous
                    coal-fields. The town, as its thousands of brick· built houses show, has been
                    for the most part dug out of its own fields of clay. The parliamentary borough
                    of Manchester has an area of 6349 acres; the municipal area is 4294 acres. The
                    parliamentary and municipal boundaries of Salford are identical, and have an
                    area of 5208 acres.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Paries and Statues.—</hi> Of the parks and open spaces the
                    principal is the Peel Park in Salford, containing an area of about 40 acres. In
                    its centre is the building containing the Salford library, and also a valuable
                    museum of natural history and a collection of paintings known as the Langworthy
                    gallery (built and endowed by the late Mr E. R. Langworthy, a wealthy Manchester
                    merchant). Among the notable pictures may be named the Last Sleep of Argyll and
                    the Execution of Montrose, by Mr E. Μ. Ward. Seedley Park, Ordsail Park, and
                    Albert Park have been recently constructed, and are situated in Salford,—where
                    also is the Kersal Moor, a bit of wild moorland, some 21 acres in extent, now
                    under the care of the corporation of Salford. The moor has long been noted for
                    the richness of its flora, about one-eighth of the English flowering plants
                    having been gathered on its very limited area. It has also been the scene of an
                    entomological incident of some interest—the capture of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oecophara</hi><hi rend="italic">Woodiella,</hi> of which there is no other
                    recorded habitat. The Queen’s Park at Harpurhey is pleasantly situated,
                    notwithstanding that it is now completely surrounded by cottages and
                    manufactories. In the centre is a small museum, the chief interest of which
                    depends upon a series of phrenological casts made by Gall and Spurzheim and
                    completed by Bally. Philips Park is also attractive, not withstanding its close
                    proximity to some of the densest <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n483/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0483-0460"/> portions of the town. The principal parks so far
                    named were constructed from money obtained by a public subscription in 1846, but
                    the Alexandra Park at Moss Side has been entirely paid for out of the public
                    rates. It has very good ornamental grounds, but owing to the difficulties of the
                    situation the construction has been somewhat costly. In this connexion may be
                    mentioned the Botanical Gardens, which are situated at Old Trafford, and,
                    although intended chiefly for the subscribers, are open at certain times to the
                    public on liberal terms.</p>
                <p>Manchester is not remarkable for the number of its public memorials of the dead;
                    but it possesses some which should not be passed unnoticed. In front of the
                    infirmary are bronze statues of Wellington, Watt, Dalton, and Peel. A bronze
                    statue of Cobden occupies a prominent position in St Ann’s Square. The marble
                    statue of the Prince Consort, covered by a Gothic canopy of stone, is placed in
                    Albert Square, in proximity to the town-hall, the enormous proportions of which
                    have the effect of dwarfing what would otherwise be a striking monument. The
                    most picturesque is the bronze statue of Cromwell, on a huge block of rough
                    granite as pedestal. In the Peel Park are statues of Queen Victoria, the Prince
                    Consort, Sir Robert Peel, and Joseph Brotherton.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Public Buildings.—</hi> There are many fine public buildings in
                    Manchester. Among them may briefly be noticed the royal infirmary, consisting of
                    three sides of a quadrangle, one of which owes its existence to the benevolence
                    of Jenny Lind, who gave two concerts in order to raise the necessary funds. The
                    institution will accommodate about two hundred and sixty patients. The royal
                    exchange is a fine specimen of Italian architecture, and was erected in 1869;
                    the great meeting-hall is one of the largest rooms in England, the ceiling
                    having a clear area, without supports, of 120 feet in width. The exchange is
                    seen at its best on market days (Tuesday and Friday), when representatives from
                    all parts of Lancashire, and indeed of the neighbouring counties, are earnestly
                    engaged in buying and selling. The assize courts were built in 1864 from designs
                    by Waterhouse. The style is a mixture of Early English and Decorative, and a
                    large amount of decorative art has been expended on the building. The cost was
                    about £100,000. The New Bailey prison, intended for the criminals of Salford
                    hundred, was built (1787) in accordance with the suggestions of Howard, the
                    prison philanthropist, but in 1868 the present structure, at the rear of the
                    assize courts, was erected. The style of architecture is Norman, and the
                    building, which covers 0 acres, cost £170,000. The city jail is situated in Hyde
                    Road. The old town-hall was built in 1832, in imitation <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n484/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0484-0461"/> of the Erectheum of Athens, at a cost of £40,000;
                    it is now occupied by the town library. The business of the city is conducted in
                    the new town-hall, probably beyond dispute the most important municipal building
                    in the kingdom, if not in Europe. It was completed in 1877, from designs by
                    Waterhouse, who selected as the style of architecture a form of Gothic, but
                    treated it very freely as purposes of utility required. The edifice covers 8000
                    square yards, and includes more than two hundred and fifty rooms. The triangular
                    or flat-iron form of the site was a great difficulty, but the architect has
                    skilfully surmounted it. The building consists of continuous lines of corridors
                    surrounding a central courtyard and connected by bridges. The principal tower is
                    260 feet high, and affords a view which extends over a large part of South
                    Lancashire and Cheshire, and is bounded only by the hills of Derbyshire. It
                    contains a remarkable peal of bells by Taylor of Loughborough, forming an almost
                    perfect chromatic scale of twenty-one bells; each bell has on it a line from
                    section 105 of Tennyson’s <hi rend="italic">In</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoriam.</hi> The great hall is 100 feet long and 50 feet wide, and contains a
                    magnificent organ built by Cavaillé-Coll of Paris. The panels of this room are
                    being filled with mural paintings illustrating the various incidents connected
                    with the history and progress of the city. The total cost of the building has
                    been £1,053,264, inclusive of £201,925 for interest. The branch Bank of England
                    is a Doric building designed by Cockerell. The Salford town-hall is also Doric;
                    and there are besides separate town-halls for the townships of Λrdwick,
                    Chorlton, Hulme, Cheetham, Broughton, and Pendleton. The Free Trade hall is a
                    fine structure in the Lombardo-Venetian style, and its great hall will
                    accommodate five thousand people. It is used for public meetings, concerts,
                    &amp;c., and was built by Walters. The young men’s Christian association hall
                    was originally used as a natural history museum. The Royal Institution, built by
                    Sir Chari es Barry, is a proprietary institution intended for the encouragement
                    chiefly of the fine arts. In the entrance hall are casts of the Elgin Marbles,
                    given by George IV., and a statue of Dalton by Chantrey. There is a small
                    permanent gallery, and periodical exhibitions of pictures are held and courses
                    of lectures delivered. Arrangements have now (1882) been concluded by which the
                    institution will become the property of the town and be managed by a joint
                    committee of members of the town council and others interested in art and
                    literature. The Athenaeum, also designed by Barry, was founded by Richard Cobden
                    and others associated with him, for “the advancement and diffusion of
                    knowledge.” The institution has, perhaps, not developed exactly on the lines
                    contemplated by its promoters, but it has become one of the most useful in the
                    town. All the advantages enjoyed by members of high-class social clubs, with the
                    addition of facilities for educational classes and the use of an excellent
                    news-room and a well-selected library of 18,000 volumes, are offered in return
                    for a payment which does not amount to a penny a day. The mechanics’ institution
                    contains a library of 17,000 volumes, and has connected with it excellent day
                    and evening schools, and classes for technical instruction. The Portico is a
                    good specimen of the older proprietary libraries and newsrooms. It dates from
                    1806, and has a library of 20,000 volumes. The Memorial Hall was built to
                    commemorate the memory of the Nonconformist ejected ministers of 1662. The
                    Unitarian home missionary board has here its library and rooms for the education
                    of students; and the building is used for a variety of meetings, scientific,
                    educational, musical, and religious. The inconvenience arising from inadequate
                    provision for postal service is, after many years of hesitation, to be remedied
                    by the erection, now (1882) in progress, of a commodious post-office.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Means of Communication.—</hi> The opening of the Manchester and
                    Liverpool Railway in 1830 marked an important epoch in the history of modern
                    industry, and since that time Manchester has gradually been connected by rail
                    with every part of the kingdom. The enormous traffic by this means has not,
                    however, entirely superseded the use of the canals, which formerly played so
                    important a part in the cotton industry. The construction of the Bridgewater
                    Canal in 1761 was an event second in importance only to that of the introduction
                    of the railway system. There are three large railway stations, Victoria, London
                    Road, and the Central, and several minor ones. The excellence of the omnibus
                    system of the city was perhaps one principal cause for the somewhat tardy
                    adoption of tramways; but these have now rapidly developed, and ensure
                    facilities for transit between the different parts of the city and also for
                    communication with the neighbouring towns and villages. The establishment of a
                    ship canal to connect Manchester with the sea has been frequently suggested at
                    intervals for the last sixty years, and a scheme of tidal navigation elaborated
                    by Mr Hamilton Fulton is now (1882) being actively discussed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">JFater Supply.—</hi> This is under the control of the
                    corporation, which supplies not only the citizens but the surrounding
                    populations. The gathering-ground is a series of reservoirs in the valley of
                    Longdendale, chiefly along the course of the river Etherow. Woodhead, the chief
                    reservoir, 20 miles from Manchester, is 777 feet above sea-level, is 72 feet
                    deep, covers an area of 155 acres, and has a capacity of 1,235,000,000 gallons.
                    The present system of waterworks, including the portions now being constructed
                    at Audenshaw and Denton, have an area of reservoirs of 854∣ acres, and a
                    capacity of holding 5,914,000,000 gallons. The average daily supply of water was
                    in 1855 8,078,152 gallons; in 1881 it was 18,929,704 gallons. In 1877 the water
                    committee announced that in view of the increased demand it would be necessary
                    to obtain additional or fresh sources of supply. The proposal to utilize
                    Thirlmere in Cumberland for this purpose was vehemently opposed, but the scheme
                    was eventually sanctioned by parliament, and the works have been begun, but have
                    not as yet made rapid progress. Thirlmere is 533 feet above the sea, and it is
                    proposed to raise it by an embankment to 584 feet above the sea. From this
                    height it is estimated that a maximum quantity of 50,000,000 gallons might be
                    withdrawn daily.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lighting.—</hi> The corporation not only manufactures gas for
                    the lighting of the city, but sells it to out-districts. The area of
                    distribution amounts to 42 square miles, and the street mains for the gas supply
                    are 597 miles long. The entire assets of the gas-works were valued in September
                    1881 at £1,386,942. The average quantity of gas transmitted daily was
                    2,425,630,000 cubic feet. The revenue from the sale of bye-products is about
                    £90,000. Salford, which is supplied with water by Manchester, has its own
                    gas-works, the property of the ratepayers, and managed by a committee of the
                    town council.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration of Justice.—</hi> The city has a stipendiary
                    magistrate who, in conjunction with lay magistrates, tries cases of summary
                    jurisdiction in the police courts; these are held in a building erected for the
                    purpose, and having some architectural pretensions. There are also quarter
                    sessions, presided over by a recorder. Separate sessions are held for the
                    Salford hundred. Salford has also <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> police court with a
                    stipendiary magistrate. Certain sittings of the Court of Chancery for the duchy
                    of Lancaster are held in Manchester. In addition to the county court, there is
                    an ancient civil court known as the Salford Hundred Court of Record. Assizes
                    have been held since 1866.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Churches.—</hi> The chief ecclesiastical building in Manchester
                    is the cathedral, which, however, hardly corresponds to the ideas usually
                    associated with that word. It was indeed built simply as a parish church, and,
                    although a fine specimen of Perpendicular Gothic, is by no means what might be
                    expected as the cathedral of an important and wealthy diocese. Though there are
                    remains of older work, the bulk of the building belongs to the early part of the
                    15th century. The first warden was John Huntington, rector of Ashton, who built
                    the choir. The building, which was noticed for its hard stone by Leland when he
                    visited the town, did not stand time and weather well, and by 1845 some portions
                    of it were rapidly decaying. This led to its restoration by Holden, which was
                    not finished until 1868, when the tower was almost completely renovated in a
                    more durable stone than that formerly used. The total length is 220 feet and the
                    breadth 112 feet; the only parish church exceeding it in this last dimension is
                    said to be that of Coventry. There are several stained-glass windows. In the Ely
                    chapel is the altar tomb of Bishop Stanley, the father of the gallant Sir John
                    Stanley, who fought at Flodden Field. In the stalls there are some curious <hi
                    rend="italic">miserere</hi> carvings. The tower is 139 feet high, and contains a
                    peal of ten bells, chiefly from the foundry of the Kudhalls. There are two
                    organs, one by Father Smith, and a new one erected at a cost of more than £7000,
                    and enclosed in an oak case designed by the late Sir G. Scott. The church
                    endowments are considerable, and have been the subject of a special act of
                    parliament, known as the Manchester Rectory Division Act of 1845, which provides
                    &lt;£1500 per annum for the dean, and £600 to each of the four canons, and
                    divides the residue among the incumbents of the new churches formed out of the
                    old parish. There are about one hundred places of worship in Manchester
                    belonging to the Church of England, but they are not especially remarkable. Of
                    the Roman Catholic churches, the most important are the cathedral church of St
                    John in Salford, of the earliest Decorative character, with a spire 240 feet in
                    height, and the church of the Holy Name, which belongs to the Jesuits, and is
                    remarkable for its costly decoration. Salford is the seat of a Roman Catholic
                    bishopric, as Manchester is the seat of an Anglican one. Most of the
                    Nonconformist bodies have churches in the city and its environs. The
                    meeting-house of the Society of Friends is said to be the largest of the kind in
                    the kingdom, and will seat twelve hundred persons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Literature and Science.—</hi> Manchester possesses numerous
                    associations for the cultivation of literature and science. The oldest of these,
                    the Literary and Philosophical Society, founded in 1781, has a high reputation,
                    and has numbered among its working members John Dalton, Eaton Hodgkinson,
                    William Fairbairn, J. P. Joule, H: E. Roscoe, and many other famous men of
                    science. It has published a lengthy series of memoirs and proceedings. The
                    Manchester Literary Club was founded in 1862, and publishes an annual volume of
                    papers. The Manchester Statistical Society was the first society of the kind
                    established in the kingdom, and has issued <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi>
                    containing many important papers. The Scientific Students’ Association, the
                    Field Naturalists’ and Archaeologists’ Society, the Microscopical Society, the
                    Botanists’ Association, the Geological Society, and the Science Association may
                    also be named. Several printing clubs, the Chetham, Record, Holbein, and English
                    Dialect societies, have their headquarters here. Nine daily papers are
                    published, and the journalism of Manchester takes high rank. The periodicals
                    issued are between fifty and sixty in number.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">University and Schools.—</hi> There are many educational
                    facilities in Manchester and Salford. The oldest school is the Manchester
                    grammar school, which was founded in 1519 by Hugh Oldham, bishop of Exeter, who
                    was a native of Crumpsail, one of the outskirts of the town. The foundation was
                    done “out of the good mind he bore to the county of Lancashire, perceiving that
                    the children thereof, having pregnant wits, were for the most part brought up
                    rudely and idly; that knowledge might be advanced, and that the children might
                    be better taught to love, honour, and dread God and His laws.” The master and
                    usher appointed by the good bishop were to teach freely every child and scholar
                    coming to the school, “without any money or reward taken.” Some mills were
                    devised for the maintenance of the school, which was further endowed at both the
                    universities by Sarah, duchess of Somerset, in 1692. The school has been
                    reconstituted on a new basis within recent years, and has now two hundred and
                    fifty free scholars, whilst other pupils are received on payment of low fees. Mr
                    E. R. Langworthy bequeathed to it £10,000 as an endowment for scholarships.
                    Among those educated at the grammar school may be mentioned Thomas De Quincey
                    and the late Mr Harrison Ainsworth.</p>
                <p>The Owens College was founded in 1846 by John Owens, who left nearly £100,000 to
                    trustees for an institution in which should be taught “such branches of learning
                    and science as were then and might be hereafter usually taught in English
                    universities.” The college was opened in 1851, in a house which had formerly
                    been the residence of Cobden, but in 1872 it was removed to its present home, a
                    handsome Gothic building designed by Waterhouse. An appeal made to the public in
                    1867 in behalf of the college was heartily responded to, and its capital funds
                    now amount to over £400,000. The building is carefully adapted to its purposes;
                    and the chemical laboratory, a separate structure at the rear, is of the
                    completest description. The first bishop of Manchester, Dr J. Prince Lee, who
                    had an interesting library of some 6000 volumes, bequeathed it to the college,
                    which has also received gifts of books and money from various other quarters,
                    and thus has now the nucleus of an important collection. The Royal School of
                    Medicine, which was founded in 1824, and had acquired the reputation of being
                    one of the most successful of the provincial schools, has been amalgamated with
                    the college. The Medical Society has, by an arrangement with the college
                    authorities, deposited its valuable library of 22,000 volumes in the college
                    rooms. The Manchester museum is now the property of the college, and contains
                    the bulk of the specimens gathered by the Geological Society and by the now
                    extinct Natural History Society. A suitable building for the accommodation of
                    the museum has long been a decided want, and is now (1882) about to be
                    undertaken. The growing importance of the Owens College led to the project for a
                    university charter. The proposal was not received without some opposition, but
                    as the result of lengthy discussions and adjustments a scheme was evolved for a
                    university to consist of affiliated colleges, situated in different towns, but
                    having its centre in Manchester; and the charter of the Victoria University was
                    granted in 1880, with full powers to grant degrees except in medicine—an
                    exception which is to be removed. Among the other educational institutions of
                    the district are the Lancashire Independent college, the Primitive Methodist
                    college, the Baptist institute, the St Bede’s college (Roman Catholic), the
                    college for women, the Salford college for working men, the school of art, and
                    many minor institutions. The elementary education is controlled by an elected
                    school board. Salford has also a school board. Very nearly the oldest
                    educational institution in the town is the Chetham hospital, a bluecoat school
                    educating one hundred boys; and almost the latest addition to these institutions
                    is a similar institution founded by the late Aiderman Nicholls. The schools for
                    the deaf and dumb are situated at Old.</p>

                    to which Mr Thomas Henshaw left a bequest of £20,000. There is also an adult
                    deaf and dumb institution, containing a news-room, lecture-hall, chapel,
                    &lt;fcc., for the use of deaf mutes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Libraries and Museums.—</hi> Manchester is well provided with
                    libraries. The Chetham library is sometimes spoken of as the oldest free library
                    in Europe, and certainly its doors have been open without let or hindrance for
                    more than two centuries, and the building which it occupies is almost the only
                    relic now left of ancient Manchester. What had once been the barons’ hall, and
                    afterwards the residence of the clergy, was purchased by the trustees of
                    Humphrey Chetham, and by them applied to the purposes of a bluecoat school and
                    library, provision for the foundation and maintenance of which he had made by
                    will. The library, with its quiet and almost monastic corridors, forms a
                    striking contrast to the busy streets without. The contents now amount to about
                    40,000 volumes, and include many rare manuscripts and curious books, the gem of
                    the collection undoubtedly being a copy of the historical compilation of Matthew
                    Paris, with corrections in the author’s handwriting. There is a large collection
                    of matter relating to the history and archaeology of Lancashire and Cheshire. A
                    recent addition to its riches in this department is the extensive series of
                    Lancashire manuscripts bequeathed by the late Canon Raines. The collection of
                    broadsides formed by Mr J. O. Halliwell-Phillips, and the library of John Byrom,
                    rich in mystics and shorthand writers, should also be named. In addition to the
                    library, Chetham left provision for the education of a number of poor boys, and
                    the increase in the value of the endowments has raised the number to one
                    hundred, who receive a good English education and are afterwards put to some
                    useful trade or calling. An additional school has recently been erected from
                    designs by Waterhouse, who has been successful in making the new building
                    harmonize with the quaint and sober architecture of the hospital and library.
                    The Manchester Free Libraries were founded by Sir John Potter, who was
                    instrumental in promoting a public subscription from which a building was bought
                    and stocked with books, and then handed over to the town, by whose municipal
                    authorities the libraries have since been not only maintained but materially
                    increased. There is now a reference library containing about 70,000 volumes,
                    including an extensive series of English historical works and a remarkable
                    collection of books of political economy and trade. The chief object has been to
                    make a good working collection for the student and man of letters. But, although
                    the collection of objects dear to the bibliomaniac has not been considered of
                    first importance, the library now includes some literary curiosities of the
                    first rank, among them specimens of the press of Caxton and Wynkyn de Worde.
                    Affiliated to the central consulting library there are six lending libraries,
                    the Hulme library having 17,000 volumes, Ancoats 15,000, Rochdale Road 15,000,
                    Chorlton and Ard wick 17,000, Cheetham 12,000, and Deansgate 18,000. Each
                    lending library has attached to it a commodious reading-room. There are also
                    libraries in connexion with-the Athenaeum, the mechanics’ institution, the
                    Portico, the Owens College, and other institutions. The sister borough of
                    Salford has also adopted the free library system, and possesses at Peel Park a
                    large reference and lending library, whilst additional lending libraries and
                    news-rooms have been opened at Pendleton, Greengate, and Regent Road.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Recreation.—</hi> The city has always been noted for its love
                    of theatrical amusements, and the German element in its population has in the
                    last fifty years largely influenced the taste for music by which it is now
                    distinguished. The theatre royal is a patent theatre, and was opened in 1845,
                    its predecessor having been burned in the previous year. It ranks in size with
                    the large metropolitan theatres, and has connected with it memories of nearly
                    all the great actors of the present and past generation. The Prince’s theatre
                    was opened in 1864, and is an elegant and beautifully finished structure. The
                    Queen’s theatre is a substantial building with but small architectural
                    pretensions. A theatre has recently been opened in Salford. The concert-hall
                    will hold twelve hundred people. There are many musical societies; and amongst
                    other places of amusement may be mentioned the Belle Vue Zoological Gardens, the
                    Pomona Palace, and numerous music-halls, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> According to the census of 1881, the
                    municipal borough of Manchester contains a population of 341,414 (163,475 males,
                    177,939 females), while the parliamentary borough has 393,585 (189,005 males,
                    204,580 females). Salford, on the same authority, has 176,235 (84,610 males,
                    91,625 females). These figures, however, hardly convey the actual facts of the
                    case. Manchester and Salford are as closely joined as London and Southwark, and
                    are surrounded by populous districts quite as much united as the component parts
                    of what the registrar-general styles “Greater London.” There has been a seeming
                    decrease in the population of the city, which in 1871 was stated to contain
                    355,655 persons; but this appearance is fallacious, for, while the progress of
                    city improvements lias reduced the number of inhabited houses in the centre,
                    there has been a large influx into Salford, which has increased by 51,432
                    persons during the last ten years. The two boroughs, with thé urban sanitary
                    districts immediately contiguous, have a population of about 800,000 persons. In
                    the Middle Ages there were in Manchester and Salford probably not more than two
                    or three hundred burgesses and their dependants. In 1588 the population was
                    estimated at 10,000, but the parish is here meant. In 1757 the two towns
                    contained 19,839 persons,, who by 1773 had increased to 27,246, and by 1783 to
                    over 39,000. At the first census in 1801 Manchester had 75,275, and Salford
                    14,477. The last four census statements are :—</p>

                <p>The increase in rateable value has been equally remarkable. In 1815 Manchester
                    was rated at £357,778; in 1882 the estimate· was £2,761,469. The corresponding
                    values for Salford were £54,130 and £801,192.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sanitary Condition.—</hi> Manchester, like other towns, grew
                    more rapidly than the provision for its wise government; but determined efforts
                    have been made in the direction of sanitary improvement. The death-rate in 1840
                    was 34’3; in 1850, 29'6; in 1860, 28 Ό; in 1861, 30∙4; in 1862, 30'3; in 1869,
                    28’9; in 1870, 26'52; in 1871, 29 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8; in 1877, 25
                    ’ 4; in 1880, 24'7; and for nine months of 1881 it was 23’3. Whatever maybe the
                    causes of these fluctuations, it is clear that there is still ample room for
                    further improvement. The air laden with the products of the combustion, of coal,
                    and the unspeakably filthy rivers, are urgently in need of energetic remedial
                    action.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures and Commerce.—</hi> As has already been stated,
                    Manchester is the centre of the English cotton industry; but in the town itself
                    of late years the tendency has been more and more in the direction of commerce.
                    Owing to the enhanced value of land, many mills and workshops have been removed
                    to the outskirts and to neighbouring villages and towns, so that the centre of
                    Manchester and an ever-widening circle around is now chiefly devoted not so much
                    to production as to the various offices of distribution. Large and handsome
                    warehouses and shops abound, and there is every evidence of quick and opulent
                    life. It would be a mistake, however, to regard Manchester as solely dependent
                    upon the industries connected with cotton. There are other important
                    manufactures which in another community would be described as gigantic. Wool and
                    silk are manufactured on a considerable scale, though the latter industry has
                    for some years been on the decline. The miscellaneous and multifarious articles
                    grouped under the designation of smallwares occupy many hands. Machinery and
                    tools, using the term with its most comprehensive meaning so as to include alike
                    philosophical instruments and steam-engines, are made in vast quantities. The
                    chemical industries of the city are also on a large scale. In short, there are
                    but few important manufactures that are wholly unrepresented. The proximity of
                    Manchester to the rich coal-fields of Lancashire has had a marked influence upon
                    its prosperity; but for this, indeed, the rapid expansion of its industries
                    would have been impossible.</p>
                <p>It would probably be difficult to find a community in any part of the world with
                    which Manchester has no commercial relations. The enterprise of its merchants
                    has kept pace with the energy of its manufacturers, and the products of its
                    looms are to be found in every land, though doubtless the supremacy which its
                    cotton goods have held in the markets of the world tends to become .more and
                    more abated by the gradually increasing foreign competition.</p>

                    1881. These figures, though to be taken with certain reservations, indicate
                    approximately the extent of the activity of the city.</p>
                <p>The commercial institutions of Manchester are too numerous for detailed
                    description. Its chamber of commerce has for more than sixty years held a
                    position of much influence in regard to the trade of the district and of the
                    nation. There are eleven joint-stock banks, seven of which have their head
                    offices in the town; these banks, besides numerous branches in the surrounding
                    district, have sixteen branches in the town; and there are several private
                    bankers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Municipality.—</hi> The affairs of the town are regulated by a
                    council consisting of sixty-four representatives of the fifteen wards into which
                    the city is divided. The body corporate of sixteen aldermen and forty-eight
                    councillors, who are presided over by the mayor, has shown much enterprise and
                    public spirit in the energy with which it has prosecuted public improvements,
                    and in the business ability with which it has managed the vast undertakings
                    connected with the lighting and water supply of the town. The town council of
                    Salford consists also of sixteen aidermen and forty-eight councillors, and there
                    are fourteen wards.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Very little is known with certainty of the early
                    history of Manchester. It has, indeed, been conjectured, and with some
                    probability, that at Castlefield there was a British fortress, which was
                    afterwards taken possession of by the soldiers of Agricola. 11 is at all events
                    certain that a Roman station of some importance existed in this locality, and a
                    fragment of the wall still exists. In the last century considerable evidences of
                    Roman occupation were still visible; and from time to time, in the course of
                    excavation (especially during the making of the Bridgewater Canal), Roman
                    remains have been found. The coins were chiefly those of Vespasian, Antoninus
                    Pius, Trajan, Hadrian, Nero, Domitian, Vitellius, and Constantine. The period
                    succeeding the Roman occupation is for some time legendary. As late as the 17th
                    century there was a floating tradition that Tarquin, an enemy of King Arthur,
                    kept the castle of Manchester, and was killed by Launcelot of the Lake. The
                    mention of the town in authentic annals is very scanty. It was probably one of
                    the scenes of the missionary preaching of Paulinus; and it is said (though by a
                    chronicler of comparatively late date) to have been the residence of Ina, king
                    of Wessex, and his queen Ethelberga, after he had defeated Ivor, somewhere about
                    the year 689. Nearly the only point of certainty in its history before the
                    Conquest is that it suffered greatly from the devastations of the Danes, and
                    that in 923 Edward, who was then at Thelwall, near Warrington, sent a number of
                    his Mercian troops to repair and garrison it. In Domesday Book Manchester,
                    Salford, Rochdale, and Radcliffe are the only places named in South-East
                    Lancashire, a district now covered by populous towns. Large portions of it were
                    then forest, wood, and waste lands. Twenty-one thanes held the manor of Salford
                    among them. The church of St Mary and the church of St Michael in Manchester are
                    both named in Domesday, and some difficulty has arisen as to their proper
                    identification. Most antiquaries have considered that the passage refers to the
                    town only, whilst others think it relates to the parish, and that, while St
                    Mary’s is the present cathedral, St Michael’s would be the present parish church
                    of Ashton-under-Lyne. Manchester and Salford are so closely allied that it is
                    impossible to disassociate their history. Salford received a charter from
                    Ranulph de Blundeville, in the reign of Henτy HL, constituting it a free
                    borough, and Manchester in 1301 received a similar warrant of municipal
                    liberties and privileges, from its baron, Thomas Gresley, a descendant of one to
                    whom the manor had been given by Roger of Poictou, who was created by William
                    the Conqueror lord of all the land between the rivers Mersey and Ribble. The
                    Gresleys were succeeded by the De la Warres, the last of whom was educated for
                    the priesthood, " and became rector of the town. To avoid the evil of a
                    non-resident clergy, he made considerable additions to the lands of the church,
                    in order that it might be endowed as a collegiate institution. A sacred guild
                    was thus formed, whose members were bound to perform the necessary services at
                    the parish church, and to whom the old baronial hall was granted as a place of
                    residence. The manorial rights passed to Sir Reginald West, the son of Joan
                    Greslet, and he was. summoned to parliament as Baron de la Warre. The West
                    family, in 1579, sold the manorial rights for £3000 to John Lacy, who, in 1596,
                    resold them to Sir Nicholas Mosley, whose descendants enjoyed the emoluments and
                    profits to be derived from them until the middle of the present century (1845),
                    when they were purchased by the present town council of Manchester for a sum of
                    £200,000. The lord of the manor had the right to tax and toll all articles
                    brought for sale into the market of the town. But, though the inhabitants were
                    thus to a large extent taxed for the benefit of one Individual, they had a far
                    greater amount of local self-government than might have been supposed, and the
                    court leet, which was then the governing body of the town, had, though doubtless
                    in a somewhat rudimentary form, nearly all the powers and functions now
                    possessed by municipal corporations. This court had not only control over the
                    watching and watering of the town, the regulation of the water supply, and the
                    cleaning of the' streets, but also had power, which at times was used freely, of
                    interfering with what would now be considered the private liberty of their
                    fellow-citizens. Some of the regulations adopted, and presumably enforced, sound
                    grotesquely at the present day. Thus, no single woman was allowed to be a
                    householder; no person might employ other than the town musicians; and the
                    amount to be spent at wedding feasts and other festivities was carefully
                    settled. Under the protection of the barons the town appears to have steadily
                    increased in prosperity, and it early became an important seat of the textile
                    manufactures. Fulling mills were at work in the district in the 13th century;
                    and documentary evidence exists to show that woollen manufactures were carried
                    on in Ancoats at that period. In 1641 we hear of the Manchester people
                    purchasing linen yarn from the Irish, weaving it, and returning it for sale in a
                    finished state. They also brought cotton wool from Smyrna to work into fustians
                    and dimities. An Act passed in the reign of Edward VI. regulates the length of
                    cottons called Manchester, Lancashire, and Cheshire cottons. These,
                    notwithstanding their name, were probably all woollen textures. It is thought
                    that some of the Flemish weavers who were introduced into England by Queen
                    Philippa of Hainault were settled at Manchester; and Fuller has given an
                    exceedingly quaint and picturesque description of the manner in which these
                    artisans were welcomed by the inhabitants of the country they were about to
                    enrich with a new industry, one which in after centuries has become perhaps the
                    most important industry of the country. The Flemish weavers were in all
                    probability reinforced by religious refugees from the Low Countries. Leland,
                    writing in 1638, describes Manchester as the “fairest, best builded, quickest,
                    and most populous town of Lancashire.” The right of sanctuary had been granted
                    to the town, but this was found so detrimental to its industrial pursuits that
                    after very brief experience the privilege was taken away. The college of
                    Manchester was dissolved in 1547, but was refounded in Mary’s reign. Under her
                    successor the town became the headquarters of the commission for establishing
                    the Reformed religion.</p>
                <p>In the civil wars, the town was besieged by the Royalists under Lord Strange, but
                    was successfully defended by the inhabitants under the command of a German
                    soldier of fortune, Colonel Ros-worm, who complained with some bitterness of
                    their ingratitude to him. An earlier affray between the Puritans and some of
                    Lord Strange’s followers is said to have occasioned the shedding of the first
                    blood in the disastrous struggle between the king and parliament. The year 1689
                    witnessed that strange episode, the trial of those concerned in the so-called
                    Lancashire plot, which ended in the triumphant acquittal of the supposed
                    Jacobites. That the district really contained many ardent sympathizers with the
                    Stuarts was, however, shown in the rising of 1715, when the clergy ranged
                    themselves to a large extent on the side of the Pretender, and was still more
                    clearly shown in the rebellion of 1745, when the town was taken possession of by
                    Prince Charles Edward Stuart, and a regiment, known afterwards as the Manchester
                    regiment, was formed and placed under the command of Colonel Francis Townley. In
                    the fatal retreat of the Stuart troops the Manchester contingent was left to
                    garrison Carlisle, and surrendered to the duke of Cumberland. The officers were
                    taken to London, where they were tried for high treason and beheaded on
                    Kennington Common.</p>
                <p>The variations of political action in Manchester had been exceedingly marked. In
                    the 16th century, although it produced both Catholic and Protestant martyrs, it
                    was earnestly in favour of the Reformed faith, and in the succeeding century it
                    became indeed a stronghold of Puritanism. Vet the descendants of the Roundheads
                    who defeated the army of Charles I. were Jacobite in their sympathies, and by
                    the latter half of the 18th century had become imbued with the aggressive form
                    of patriotic sentiment known as anti-Jacobinism, which showed itself chiefly in
                    dislike of reform and reformers of every description. A change was, however,
                    imminent. The distress caused by war and taxation, towards the end of the last
                    and the beginning of the present century, led to bitter discontent, and the
                    anomalies existing in the parliamentary system of representation afforded only
                    too fair an object of attack. While single individuals in some portions of the
                    country had the power to return members of parliament for their pocket boroughs,
                    great towns like Manchester were entirely without representation. The
                    injudicious conduct of the authorities, also, led to an increase in the
                    bitterness with which the working classes regarded the condition of society in
                    which they found themselves compelled to toil with very little profit to
                    themselves. Their expressions of discontent, instead of being wisely regarded as
                    symptoms of disease in the body politic, were looked upon as crimes, and the
                    severest efforts were made to repress all expression of dissatisfaction. This
                    foolish policy of the authorities reached its culmination in the affair of
                    Peterloo, which may be regarded as the starting point of the modern reform
                    agitation. This was in 1819, when an immense crowd assembled on St Peter’s
                    Fields (now covered by the Free Trade hall and warehouses) to petition
                    parliament for a redress of their grievances. The authorities had the Riot Act
                    read, but in such a manner as to be quite unheard by the mass of the people; and
                    drunken yeomanry cavalry were <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n488/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0488-0465"/> then turned loose upon the unresisting mass of
                    spectators. The yeomanry appear to have used their sabres somewhat freely;
                    several people were killed and many more injured; and, although the magistrates
                    received the thanks of the prince regent and the ministry, their conduct excited
                    the deepest indignation throughout the entire country. Naturally enough, the
                    Manchester politicians took an important part in the reform agitation, and when
                    the Act of 1832 was passed, the town sent as its representatives the Right lion.
                    C. P. Thomson, vice-president of the Board of Trade, and Mr Mark Philips. With
                    one notable exception, this was the first time that Manchester had been
                    represented in parliament since its barons had seats in the House of Peers in
                    the earlier centuries. In 1654 Mr Charles Worsley and Mr R. Radcliffe were
                    nominated to represent it in Cromwell’s parliament. Worsley was a man of great
                    ability, and must ever have a conspicuous place in history as the man who
                    carried out the injunction of the Protector to “remove that bauble,” the mace of
                    the House of Commons. The agitation for the repeal of the corn laws had its
                    headquarters at Manchester, and the success which attended it, not less than the
                    active interest taken by its inhabitants in public questions, has made the city
                    the home of various projects of reform. The “United Kingdom Alliance for the
                    suppression of the liquor traffic” <hi rend="italic">was</hi> founded there in
                    1853, and during the continuance of the American War the adherents both of the
                    North and of the South deemed it desirable to have organizations to influence
                    public opinion in favour of their respective causes. A charter of incorporation
                    was granted in 1838; a bishop was appointed in 1847; and the town became a city
                    in 1853. The Lancashire cotton famine, caused by the civil war in America,
                    produced much distress in the Manchester district, and led to a national
                    movement to help the starving operatives. The relief operations then organized
                    are amongst the most remarkable efforts of modern philanthropy.</p>
                <p>Although several excellent books have been written on fubjects connected with the
                    town, there is no adequate modern history. The <hi rend="italic">History of
