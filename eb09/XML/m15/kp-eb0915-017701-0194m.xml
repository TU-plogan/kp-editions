                <p><label type="entry">MADEIRA</label>. The Madeiras, a group of islands in the
                    North Atlantic Ocean belonging to Portugal, consist of two inhabited islands
                    named Madeira and Porto Santo, and three uninhabited rocks named collectively
                    the Desertas. Funchal, the capital of Madeira, is on the south coast of the
                    principal island, in 32° 37' 45" N. lat,, 16° 55' 20" W. long. It is about 360
                    miles from the coast of Africa, 535 miles from Lisbon, 1215 from Plymouth, 240
                    from Teneriffe, and 480 from Santa Maria, the nearest of the Azores. Funchal is
                    connected by the Brazilian submarine telegraph, which belongs to a British
                    company, with Lisbon on the one hand, and on the other with Brazil.</p>
                <p>Madeira, the largest island of the group, has a length of 30 geographical miles,
                    an extreme breadth of 13 miles, and a coast-line of 80 or 90 miles. Its longer
                    axis lies east and west, in which direction it is traversed by a mountain chain,
                    the backbone of the island, having a mean altitude of 4000 feet, up to which
                    many deep ravines penetrate from both coasts, rendering travelling by land from
                    place to place a very tedious and fatiguing labour. Pico Ruivo, the highest
                    summit, stands in the centre of the island, and has a height of 6100 feet, but
                    some of the adjacent summits are very little lower. The depth and narrowness of
                    the ravines, the loftiness of the rugged peaks that tower above them, the bold
                    precipices of the coast, and the proximity of the sea afford many scenes of
                    picturesque beauty or striking grandeur which are continually changing in
                    character as the traveller advances on his way. The greater part of the interior
                    is uninhabited, for the towns, villages, and scattered huts lie either at the
                    mouths of ravines or upon the lower slopes that extend from the mountains to the
                    coast. The ridges between the ravines usually terminate in lofty headlands, one
                    of which has the height of 1920 feet, and much of the coast is bound by
                    precipices of dark basalt. The north coast, having been more exposed to the
                    erosion of the sea, is on the whole more precipitous than the south coast, and
                    presents everywhere a wilder aspect. On the south there is left very little of
                    the indigenous forest which once clothed the whole island and gave it the name
                    it bears (Madeira, from <hi rend="italic">materia,</hi> wood), but on the north
                    some of the valleys still contain native trees of fine growth. A long, narrow,
                    and comparatively low rocky promontory forms the eastern extremity of the
                    island, and here is to be seen a tract of calcareous sand, known as the Fossil
                    Bed, containing land shells and numerous bodies resembling the roots of trees,
                    probably produced by infiltration. Upon an islet off this promontory stands the
                    only lighthouse of the group. It has a flashing light visible at the distance of
                    25 miles in clear weather.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> It has been conjectured, but on insufficient
                    evidence, that the Phoenicians discovered Madeira at a very early period. Pliny
                    mentions certain Purple or Mauretanian Islands, the position of which with
                    reference to the Fortunate Islands or Canaries might seem to indicate the
                    Madeiras. There is a romantic story, of doubtful truth, to the effect that two
                    lovers, Robert Machim and Anna d’Arfet, fleeing from England to France in 1346,
                    were driven out of their course by a violent storm, and cast on the coast of
                    Madeira at the place subsequently named Machico, in memory of one of them. On
                    the evidence of a portulano dated 1351, preserved at Florence, it would appear
                    that Madeira had been discovered long previous to that date by Portuguese
                    vessels under Genoese captains. In 1419 two of the captains of Prince Henry of
                    Portugal were driven by a storm to the island called by them Porto Santo, or
                    Holy Port, in gratitude for their rescue from shipwreck. The next year an
                    expedition was sent out to colonize the island, and, Madeira being descried,
                    they made for it, and took possession on behalf of the Portuguese crown. The
                    islands were then uninhabited. For the sixty years intervening between 1580 and
                    1640, Madeira, with Portugal itself, was under Spanish rule. In 1801 British
                    troops occupied the island for a few months, commanded by General Beresford, and
                    it was again under the British flag from 1807 to 1814. Madeira is now a province
                    and an integral part of the Portuguese kingdom, entitled to send deputies to the
                    Cortes assembling at Lisbon.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Inhabitants.—</hi> The inhabitants are of Portuguese descent,
                    with probably some intermixture of Moorish and Negro blood amongst the lower
                    classes. The dress of the peasantry, without being picturesque, is peculiar.
                    Both men and women in the outlying country districts wear the <hi rend="italic"
                    >carapuça,</hi> a small cap made of blue cloth, in shape something like a
                    funnel, with the pipe standing upwards. The men have trousers of linen, drawn
                    tight, and terminating at the knees; a coarse shirt enveloping the upper part of
                    their person, covered by a short jacket, completes their attire, with the
                    exception of a pair of .rough yellow boots. The women’s outer garments consist
                    of a gaudily coloured gown, made from island material, with a small cape of
                    coarse scarlet or blue woollen cloth. At the end of 1881 the inhabitants of
                    Madeira numbered 131,906 persons, the females exceeding the males by 7060.
                    Thepopulation increases, notwithstanding the emigration to Demerara and the
                    Hawaiian Islands that occasionally takes place. There is strong reason for
                    thinking that the islands are too densely peopled, considering the small
                    proportion which cultivable ground bears to the whole, and the general want of
                    capital.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Government.—</hi> The administration of affairs is in the hands
                    of a civil governor appointed by the crown, under whom is a military officer in
                    command of the troops, which consist of a battalion of infantry, a detachment of
                    artillery, and some militia. The law of Portugal is administered by four chief
                    judges, each of whom has a separate division <hi rend="italic">(comarca)</hi> of
                    the island in his jurisdiction, within which he tries both civil and criminal
                    cases with the assistance of a jury. Magistrates elected by the people decide
                    minor cases. For municipal purposes the island is divided into nine districts,
                    called <hi rend="italic">concelhos</hi> (Porto Santo forming a tenth), each of
                    which has its popularly elected municipal chamber, whose duty it is to repair
                    the roads, light and cleanse the towns and villages, &amp;c. The chief police
                    magistrate of each district is the <hi rend="italic">admiηistrador,</hi> who is
                    appointed by the central Government. A bishop is at the head of the clergy, his
                    cathedral being at Funchal. There are forty-eight parishes, each with its church
                    and resident priest. Roman Catholicism is the established form of religion, but
                    others are now tolerated.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> By law all children of a certain age should be
                    sent to school, but this regulation is not strictly enforced, and only a small
                    fraction of the total number actually receive instruction. The chief educational
                    establishment is the Lyceo at Funchal, where there are seven professors paid by
                    Government. In 1881 the pupils at this establishment were two hundred and fifty
                    in number. There is a seminary for young priests, and a number of public primary
                    schools are scattered over the island.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> Until recently a considerable portion of the
                    land was strictly entailed in the families of the landlords <hi rend="italic"
                    >(morgados),</hi> but entails have been abolished by the legislature, and the
                    land is now absolutely free. Owing to the irremediable difficulties of the
                    surface, the roads <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n195/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0195-0178"/> are bad, except in the neighbourhood of the
                    capital. A deficient supply of water is another great obstacle to the proper
                    cultivation of the land, and the rocky nature or steep inclination of the upper
                    parts of the islands is an effectual bar to all tillage. An incredible amount of
                    labour has been expended upon the soil, partly in the erection of walls intended
                    to prevent its being washed away by the rains, and to build up the plots of
                    ground in the form of terraces, so as to lessen their slope. Water-courses, too,
                    have been constructed for purposes of irrigation, without which at regular
                    intervals the island would not produce a hundredth part of its present yield.
                    These water-courses originate high up in the ravines, are built of masonry or
                    driven through the rock, and wind about for miles until they reach the
                    cultivated land. Some of them are brought by tunnels from the north side of the
                    island through the central crest of hill. The water thus conveyed is carefully
                    dealt out according to the rights of each occupier, who takes his turn at the
                    running stream for so many hours in the day or night at a time notified to him
                    beforehand. In this climate flowing water has a saleable value as well as land,
                    for the latter is useless without a supply of the former. The agricultural
                    implements employed are of the rudest kind, and the system of cultivation is
                    extremely primitive. Very few of the occupiers are the owners of the land they
                    cultivate; but they are almost invariably the owners of the walls, cottages, and
                    trees standing thereon, the bare land alone belonging to the landlord. The
                    tenant can sell his share of the property without the consent of the landlord,
                    and if he does not so dispose of it that share passes to his heirs. In this way
                    the tenant practically enjoys fixity of tenure, for the landlord is seldom in a
                    position to pay the price at which the tenant’s share is valued. Money rents are
                    rare, the métayer system regulating almost universally the relations between
                    landlord and tenant; that is, the tenant pays to the owner a certain portion of
                    the produce, usually one half or one third. The holdings are usually very small,
                    rarely larger than one man can cultivate with a little occasional assistance.
                    Meadows and pastures are seldom to be met with, the cattle being stall-fed when
                    not feeding on the mountains. Horses are never employed for draught, all labour
                    of that kind being done by oxen, of which there is an ample supply.</p>
                <p>The two staple productions of the soil are wine and sugar. The vine was
                    introduced from Cyprus or Crete soon after the discovery of the island by the
                    Portuguese, but it was not actively cultivated until the early part of the 16th
                    century. The vines, after having been totally destroyed by the oidium disease,
                    which made its first appearance in the island in 1852, were replanted, and in a
                    few years wine was again made. The disease is now kept in check by the
                    application Of sulphur, which has the effect of increasing the quantity of
                    fruit, whilst it shortens the life of the plant. The phylloxera has also made
                    its way to the island, and every vineyard in Madeira is more or less affected by
                    it. The wine usually termed Madeira, and known in the trade as “London
                    particular,” is made from a mixture of black and white grapes, which are also
                    made separately into wines called Tinta and Verdelho, after the names of the
                    grapes. Other high-class wines, known as Bual, Sercial, and Malmsey, are made
                    from varieties of grapes bearing the same names. The exported Madeira is a
                    strong-bodied wine of fine bouquet and excellent quality, but of late years it
                    has gone out of fashion in England, the lighter wines of France and Germany
                    having to a certain extent supplanted it. Taking the four years 1878-1881, the
                    average quantity annually exported was 3045 pipes, each of 92 imperial gallons.
                    It is not usual for the merchant to possess vineyards of his own. The vines are
                    cultivated by the peasants in their small patches of land, and the general rule
                    is for the merchant·or wine manufacturer to buy the must from them, and to have
                    it conveyed as it comes from the press direct to his store, where the process of
                    fermentation and the subsequent treatment are carried on from first to last
                    under his own eye.</p>
                <p>The sugar cane is said to have been brought from Sicily about 1452, and in course
                    of time its produce became the sole staple of the island. The cultivation
                    languished, however, as the more abundant produce of tropical countries came
                    into the European market, and sugar had long ceased to be made when the
                    destruction of the vines compelled the peasants to turn their attention to other
                    things. Its cultivation was resumed, and sugar machinery imported. In 1881 about
                    6515 cwts. of sugar, valued at £14,452, were exported. A considerable quantity
                    of spirit is made by the distillation of the juice, or of the molasses left
                    after extracting the sugar, and this is consumed on the island,—not an unmixed
                    benefit to the people, for intemperate habits have greatly increased since they
                    have been subjected to the temptation of cheap spirits. The cane does not
                    flourish here as luxuriantly as within the tropics; still in localities below
                    1000 feet, where there is a good supply of water, it pays the cultivator
                    well.</p>
                <p>The grain produced on the island (principally wheat, barley, and Indian corn) is
                    not sufficient for the consumption of the people. The common potato, sweet
                    potato, and gourds of various kinds are extensively grown, as well as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Colocasia esculenta,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">kalo</hi> of the
                    Pacific islanders, the root of which yields an insipid food. Most of the common
                    table vegetables of Europe—cabbages, carrots, onions, beans, pease, &amp;c.—are
                    plentiful. Besides apples, pears, and peaches, all of poor quality, oranges,
                    lemons, guavas, mangos, loquats, custard-apples, figs, bananas, and pine-apples
                    are produced, the last two forming articles of export to the London market. The
                    date palm is occasionally seen, but its fruit is scarcely edible. On the hills
                    large quantities of the Spanish chestnut afford an item in the food of the
                    common people. A little tobacco is grown, and is made up into cigars of inferior
                    quality.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trade and Commerce.</hi> —Excepting sugar and tobacco, the
                    manufactures are insignifieant. Coarse linen and woollen articles and boots and
                    shoes are made for island use. A good deal of needlework embroidery is made by
                    the women in and about Funchal for exportation. Baskets, chairs, &lt;fcc., of
                    wicker work are also exported. According to official returns the total value of
                    exports in 1881 was £134,000, whilst the imports from foreign countries amounted
                    to £175,000 (including £128,500 from the United Kingdom), and the imports from
                    Portugal and the Azores to £112,800. The principal imports were textile fabrics,
                    hardware, grain, salt fish, salt, tea and coffee, tobacco, cask staves, timber,
                    and petroleum (the last three articles coming from America). The duties levied
                    at the custom-house amounted in the same year to about £41,000. In the course of
                    the year 710 merchant vessels entered the port, but more than half of these were
                    English steamers calling on their passage to and from the west coast of Africa,
                    the Cape of Good Hope, or Brazil. The number of Portuguese vessels was only
                    113.</p>
                <p>There is a local bank at Funchal, and also a branch of the Bank of Portugal. The
                    English merchants act as bankers for visitors, and bills or cheques can be
                    negotiated through them. Accounts are made out in reis, an imaginary coin, 4500
                    of which are equal to the pound sterling, and 1000 form the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mil-rei</hi> or dollar, equal to 4s. 5 jd. The coins in circulation are of

                    500 reis, the coinage being decimal. The French decimal system has been

                    of the International Postal Union. Consuls from Great Britain and other European
                    states, as well as from the United States and Brazil, reside at Funchal. Lines
                    of steamers from Liverpool to the British colonies on the west coast of Africa,
                    and from London and Plymouth to the Cape of Good Hope, touch at Madeira, both on
                    their outward and homeward voyages. There is steam communication with Lisbon,
                    and also with Brazil, the Cape Verds, the Canaries, and the Azores (St
                    Michael’s), as well as with Antwerp. A large coal depot for supplying the
                    steamers has been established at Funchal by a firm of British merchants.</p>
                <p>Funchal, the capital of the archipelago, lies on the south coast of Madeira, and
                    has a population of about 18,000 persons, the immediate neighbourhood being
                    inhabited by nearly as many more. It is seen to great advantage from the bay,
                    lying on its curving shore, and backed by an amphitheatre of lofty mountains,
                    some of them 4000 feet in height. Numerous country houses <hi rend="italic"
                    >(quintas)</hi> with terraced gardens, and surrounded by vineyards and patches
                    of sugar cane, adorn the slopes and give an air of cheerfulness to the
                    landscape. A small fort on an insulated rock close to the shore commands the bay
                    with its cannon, and there is a much larger fortress on an eminence behind the
                    city. There are no facilities for landing either passengers or goods, nor is
                    there any dock for vessels, which are obliged to remain in the open roadstead,
                    where, however, the anchorage is good. Vessels are protected from all winds
                    except that from the south, which, when blowing with violence, occasionally
                    drives those on shore that do not slip their cables in good time, and take to
                    the open sea. The principal edifices in the city are the cathedral and the
                    churches, none of which deserve much notice, the governor’s residence, a
                    semi-castellated building, and the substantial custom-house. The streets are for
                    the most part narrow, but fairly clean, paved with small stones, without side
                    walks, and lighted at night by petroleum lamps. There are two public walks
                    planted with trees, and a garden of small extent, but rendered gay with
                    flowering plants which would need protection in England. There are also
                    fountains of good water, a large hospital, a poorhouse, and an unsightly
                    ill-managed jail. The late empress of Brazil built a spacious and handsome
                    hospital close to the town for the reception of twenty-four consumptive patients
                    of Portuguese or Brazilian birth. The entrances of some of the larger houses are
                    through great gates into a paved vestibule, from which a double flight of stairs
                    ascends to the principal rooms. The shops are poor and without display. The
                    windows on the ground floor of the dwelling houses are filled with stout iron
                    bars, which give a prisonlike air to the streets. Three streams come down from
                    the hills and run across the town at the bottom of deep channels, which in
                    summer are dry, because the water is diverted higher up for irrigation purposes.
                    Convenient market places have been constructed for the sale of meat, vegetables,
                    and fish. Vegetables and fruit are abundant, but not of the first quality. Fish
                    is plentiful and cheap when fishing is possible, and fresh fish forms with
                    salted cod and herrings an important item in the food of the islanders. Butcher
                    meat is fairly good, with the exception of the mutton, which is very
                    inferior.</p>
                <p>The affairs of the city are managed by a municipal chamber of seven persons with
                    a president. Their revenue is derived from imposts on grain and salt imported,
                    and from duties on fresh meat and fish sold in the open market, on wine
                    exported, on houses, and on persons carrying on trade or business. It is
                    expended principally on the lighting and repairing of the streets, and the
                    maintenance of markets and public gardens.</p>
                <p>Wheel carriages are not in use; and all heavy articles are transported either on
                    the backs of mules or upon rude wooden sledges drawn by bullocks. When horses
                    are not employed, locomotion is effected either by means of hammocks, or by
                    bullock cars. The hammock is a piece of stout canvas gathered up and secured at
                    each end to a long pole carried by a couple of bearers. In place of cabs,
                    curtained cars on sledges, made to hold four persons, and drawn by a pair of
                    bullocks, are employed. They are convenient enough, but the rate of progress is
                    very slow. The common people carry heavy burdens on the head and shoulders. Such
                    aids as wheelbarrows and trucks are entirely rejected.</p>
                <p>A few daily and weekly newspapers are published at Funchal, but they are small
                    sheets, and their circulation is very limited. In a room of the building
                    occupied by the municipal chamber there is a collection of books, numbering
                    about 2800 volumes, accessible to the public. The Portuguese have a club, which
                    has a large house containing a ball room, card rooms, and a billiard room, but
                    no library.</p>
                <p>The wine trade attracted several British merchants in the last century to take up
                    their residence at Funchal, where, notwithstanding the decrease of that trade,
                    there was in 1881 a resident British population of 208 persons. A church has
                    been built where a resident chaplain conducts the services of the English
                    Established Church, and the Presbyterians of the Free Church of Scotland have
                    also erected a place of worship. The British community have formed a cemetery,
                    which is kept in admirable order. The English Club, to which strangers can
                    subscribe, has a library of 5000 volumes and a billiard table.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Meteorology.—</hi> The following results have been
                    derived from observations made for a series of eight years at the Government
                    observatory, Funchal, which has a height of 80 feet above the sea. The mean
                    annual barometrical pressure was 30’11 inches. The mean annual temperature was

                    through the months from October to May varies a good deal, but the wettest
                    months are usually November, December, January, and March. Taking a series of
                    twelve years’ observations, the mean annual rainfall was 30⅜ inches, the
                    extremes being 16 and 49 T5 inches. Tie mean daily range of the thermometer from

                <p>The remarkable mildness both in summer and winter of the climate of Madeira,
                    though it lies only 10° north of the Tropic of Cancer, is owing to its being
                    surrounded by a great ocean, from which the atmosphere obtains a large supply of
                    watery vapour. The mean humidity of the air is about 75 (saturation = 100). The
                    prevalent winds are those that blow from the north or from a few points east or
                    west of north, but these winds are much mitigated on the south coast by the
                    central range of mountains. The west wind usually brings rain. That from the
                    east is a dry wind. A hot and dry wind, the <hi rend="italic">leste</hi> of the
                    natives, occasionally blows from the easi - south-east, the direction of the
                    Great Sahara, and causes the hill region to be hotter than below, but even on
                    the coast the thermometer under its influence sometimes indicates 93°. As the
                    thermometer has never been known to fall as low as 46° at Funchal, frost and
                    snow are there wholly unknown, but snow falls on the mountains once or twice
                    during the winter, very seldom, however, below the altitude of 2000 feet.
                    Thunderstorms are rare, and scarcely ever violent.</p>
                <p>Madeira has long had a high reputation as a sanatory resort for persons suffering
                    from diseases of the chest. “When we take into consideration,” said Sir James
                    Clark in his work on <hi rend="italic">Climate, “</hi> the mildness of the
                    winter and the coolness of the summer, together with the remarkable equality of
                    the temperature during the day and night, as well as throughout the year, we may
                    safely conclude that the climate of Madeira is the finest in the northern
                    hemisphere.” Notwithstanding the ever-increasing competition of other winter

                    where there are numerous well-conducted hotels and boarding-houses, as well as
                    furnished houses, with gardens, for hire in the neighbourhood, and where English
                    and German physicians practise their profession. The island possesses one great
                    advantage over most other places frequented by invalids in affording cool and
                    comfortable summer quarters on the hills, so that they have no need to make a
                    long journey for the purpose of escaping from the heat.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Zoology.—</hi> No species of land mammal is indigenous to the
                    Madeiras. Some of the early voyagers indeed speak of wild goats and swine, but
                    these animals must have escaped from confinement. The rabbit, and those pests
                    the black rat, brown rat, and mouse, have been introduced. The first comers
                    encountered seals, and this amphibious mammal <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Monachus</hi><hi rend="italic">albivcnter)</hi> still lingers at the Desertas,
                    but its early extinction is threatened, from the same cause that has brought
                    about its extinction at the Canaries, the persistent attacks of man. Amongst the
                    thirty species of birds which breed in these islands are the kestrel, buzzard,
                    and barn owl, the blackbird, redbreast, wagtail, goldfinch, ring sparrow,
                    linnet, two swifts, three pigeons, the quail, red-legged partridge, woodcock,
                    tern, herring gull, two petrels, and three puffins. Only one species is endemic,
                    and. that is a wren <hi rend="italic">(Regulus madcirensis),</hi> but five other
                    species are known elsewhere only at the Canaries. These are the green canary <hi

                    variety of the black cap, distinguishable from the common kind by the extension
                    in the male of the cap to the shoulder. About seventy other species have been
                    seen from time to time in Madeira, chiefly stragglers from the African coast,
                    many of them coming with the <hi rend="italic">leste</hi> wind.</p>
                <p>The only land reptile is a small lizard <hi rend="italic">(Lacerta dugesii),</hi>
                    which is abundant and is very destructive to the grape crop. The loggerhead
                    turtle <hi rend="italic">(Caouana caretta,</hi> Gray) is frequently captured,
                    and is cooked for the table, but the soup is much inferior to that made from the
                    green turtle of the West Indies. The only batτachian is a frog <hi rend="italic"

                <p>About 250 species of marine fishes taken at Madeira have been scientifically
                    determined, the largest families being <hi rend="italic">Scombridae</hi> with 35
                    species, the sharks with 24, the <hi rend="italic">Sparidae</hi> with 15, the

                    with 11, and the <hi rend="italic">Carangidae</hi> with 10. Many kinds, such as
                    the mackerel, horse mackerel, groper, mullet, braise, &amp;c., are caught in
                    abundance, and afford a cheap article of diet to the people. Several species of
                    tunny are taken plentifully in spring and summer, one of them sometimes
                    attaining the weight of 300 ⅛. The only freshwater fish is the common eel, which
                    is found in one or two of the streams. (See lists and memoirs by E. T. Lowe and
                    J. Y. Johnson, published by the Zoological Society of London.)</p>
                <p>According to the latest writer on the land mollusca of the Madeiras (T. V.
                    Wollaston, <hi rend="italic">Testacea Atlantica,</hi> 1878), there have been
                    found 158 species on the land, 6 inhabiting fresh water, and 7 littoral species,
                    making a total of 171. A large majority of the land shells are considered to be
                    peculiar, but naturalists do not agree as to the distinctness of the so-called
                    species. Many of the species are variable in form or colour, and some have an
                    extraordinary number of varieties. Of the land mollusca 91 species are assigned
                    to the genus <hi rend="italic">Helix,</hi> 31 to the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pupa,</hi> and 15 to the genus <hi rend="italic">Achatina</hi> (or <hi
                    rend="italic">Lovea).</hi> About 43 species are found both living and fossil in
                    superficial deposits of calcareous sand in Madeira or Porto Santo. These
                    deposits were assigned by Lyell to the Newer Pliocene period. Some 12 or 13
                    species have not been hitherto discovered alive. As to the marine testaceous
                    mollusca it may be stated that between 300 and 400 species have been collected,
                    but they have been only partially examined, and a large number of forms await
                    identification. Few of them are remarkable for size or colour, and a
                    considerable number are very small. More than 100 species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polyzoa (Bryozoa)</hi> have been collected, and amongst them are some highly
                    interesting forms.</p>
                <p>The only order of insects which has been thoroughly examined is that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Coleoptern.</hi> By the persevering researches of the late T. V.
                    Wollaston the astonishing number of 695 species of beetles has been brought to
                    light at the Madeiras <hi rend="italic">(Insecta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Madeτensia, Cat. of Madeiran, Col.,</hi> &amp;c.). The proportion of endemic
                    kinds is very large, and it is remarkable that 200 of them are either wingless
                    or their wings are so poorly developed that they cannot fly, whilst 23 of the
                    endemic genera have all their species in this condition. This fact, Mr Darwin
                    thinks, may be mainly due to the action of natural selection combined with
                    disuse, since those beetles which were much on the wing would incur the risk of
                    being blown out into the sea, whilst those with less-developed wings had the
                    best chance of surviving. With regard to the <hi rend="italic">Lcpidoptera,</hi>
                    II or 12 species of butterflies have been seen, all of which belong to European
                    genera. Some of the species are interesting as being geographical varieties of
                    well-known types. Upλvards of 100 moths have been collected, the majority of
                    them being of a European stamp, but probably a fourth of the total number are
                    peculiar to the Madeiran group. Thirty-seven species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Neurop</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">cra</hi> have been
                    observed in Madeira, 12 of them being so far as' is known peculiar.</p>
                <p>The bristle-footed worms of the coast have been studied by Professor P.
                    Langerhans, who has met with about 200 species, of which a large number were new
                    to science. There are no modern coral reefs at these islands, but several
                    species of stony and flexible corals have been collected, though none are of
                    commercial value. There is, however, a white stony coral allied to the red coral
                    of the Mediterranean which would be valuable as an article of trade if it could
                    be obtained in sufficient quantity. Specimens of a rare and handsome red <hi
                    rend="italic">Paragorgia</hi> are to be seen in the British Museum and Liverpool
                    Museum.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Botany.—</hi> The vegetation of these islands is strongly
                    impressed with a South-European character. Many of the plants in the lower
                    region have undoubtedly been introduced and naturalized since the Portuguese
                    colonization. A large number of the remainder are found at the Cauaries and the
                    Azores, or in one of these groups, but nowhere else. Lastly, there are about a
                    hundred plants which are peculiarly Madeiran, either as distinct species or as
                    strongly marked varieties. The late Mr Lowe undertook a description of the
                    vegetation in his <hi rend="italic">Manual Flora of Madeira,</hi> but
                    unfortunately this valuable work has been left unfinished. The flowering plants
                    found truly wild belong to about 363 genera and 717 species,—the monocotyledons
                    numbering 70 genera and 128 species, the dicotyledons 293 genera and 589
                    species. The three largest orders are the <hi rend="italic">Composite,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Leguminosae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Graminaccae.</hi>
                    Forty-one species of ferns grow in Madeira, three of which are endemic species
                    and six others belong to the peculiar flora of the North Atlantic islands. About
                    100 species of moss have been collected, and 47 species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hcpaticae.</hi> A connexion between the flora of Madeira and that of the West
                    Indies and tropical America has been inferred by the presence in the former of
                    six ferns found nowhere in Europe or North Africa, but existing on the islands
                    of the east coast of America or on the Isthmus of Panama. A further relationship
                    to that continent is to be traced by the presence in Madeira of the beautiful
                    ericaceous tree <hi rend="italic">Clethra</hi><hi rend="italic">arborea,</hi>
                    belonging to a genus which is otherwise wholly American, and of a <hi

                    tree <hi rend="italic">(Dracaena</hi><hi rend="italic">Draco)</hi> is almost
                    extinct. Amongst the trees most worthy of note are four of the laurel order
                    belonging to separate genera, an <hi rend="italic">Ardisia, Pittosporurn,
                    Sideroxylon, Notetea, Rhamrnιs,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Myrica,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> a strange mixture of genera to be found on a small Atlantic
                    island. Two heaths of arborescent growth and a whortleberry cover large tracts
                    on the mountains. In some parts there is a belt of the Spanish chestnut about
                    the height of 1500 feet. There is no indigenous pine tree as at the Canaries;
                    but large tracts on the hills have been planted with <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pinus</hi><hi rend="italic">pinaster,</hi> from which the fuel of the
                    inhabitants is mainly derived. A European juniper <hi rend="italic">(J.
                    Oxy</hi><hi rend="italic">cedrus),</hi> growing to the height of 40 or 50 feet,
                    was formerly abundant, but has been almost exterminated, as its scented wood is
                    prized by the cabinetmaker. Indeed the flora has been recklessly defaced by the
                    unsparing hand of man. Several of the native trees and shrubs now gιow only in
                    situations which are nearly inaccessible, and some of the indigenous plants are
                    of the greatest rarity. There are few remains of the noble forests that once
                    clothed the island, and these are daily becoming less. On the other hand, some
                    plants of foreign origin have spread in a remarkable manner. Amongst these is
                    the common cactus or prickly pear <hi rend="italic">(Opuntia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Tuna),</hi> which in many spots on the coast is sufficiently
                    abundant to give a character to the landscape. As to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Algae,</hi> the coast is too rocky and the sea too unquiet for a luxuriant
                    marine vegetation, consequently the species are few and poor.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The hypothesis that the Madeiras during or since
                    the middle part of the Tertiary epoch formed part of a large tract of land
                    connecting the Canaries in the south and the Azores in the west with
                    south-western Europe and northern Africa has been completely discredited by the
                    discovery of the great depth of the surrounding ocean. The origin of its
                    existing fauna and flora, both of which must have been very different if such a
                    connexion had ever been a fact, is now attributed to the chance arrival from
                    Europe or Africa at distant intervals of the ancestors of the present species,
                    the winds and waves, birds and insects, having been the means of transport. This
                    immigration must have commenced at an early date if the aboriginal flora is
                    partly traceable, as is asserted, to the Miocene flora of Europe, which has been
                    found to contain genera now represented by species only living in the Atlantic
                    islands and in America.</p>
                <p>In one of the northern ravines of Madeira some masses of hypersthenite are
                    exposed to view, and these are believed to belong to a diabase formation (better
                    displayed in some of the Canary Islands than in Madeira) of much older date than
                    the beds of basalt, tuff, &amp;c., constituting the rest of the island. It is
                    therefore supposed that there existed at an ancient but unknown epoch an island
                    or the foundation of an island composed of diabase rocks, which, after being
                    subjected to denudation, were overlaid by the materials thrown out by volcanoes
                    of Miocene or later times.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n198/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0198-0181"/>
                <p>All the islands of the group are of volcanic origin, and recent soundings show
                    that they are the summits of very lofty mountains which have their bases in an
                    abyssal ocean. The greater part of what is now visible in Madeira is of
                    subaerial formation, consisting of an accumulation of basaltic and trachytic
                    lavas, beds of tuff and other ejectamenta, the result of a long and complicated
                    series of eruptions from innumerable vents. Besides this operation of building
                    up by the emission of matter from craters and clefts there is evidence that a
                    certain amount of upheaval in mass has taken place, for at a spot about 1200
                    feet above the sea in the northern valley of St Vicente, and again at about the
                    same height on Pico Juliana in Porto Santo, there have been found fragments of
                    limestone accompanied by tuffs containing marine shells and echinoderms of the
                    Miocene Tertiary epoch. We have here proof that during or since that epoch
                    portions at least ∙f these islands have been bodily uplifted more than 1000
                    feet. The fossils are sufficiently well preserved to admit of their genera and
                    in many instances even their species being made out.</p>
                <p>That there were pauses of considerable duration whilst the island of Madeira was
                    being increased in height is proved by several facts. The leaf bed and the
                    accompanying carbonaceous matter, frequently termed lignite, although it
                    displays no trace of structure, which lie under 1200 feet of lavas in the valley
                    of St Jorge, afford proof that there had been sufficient time for the growth of
                    a vegetation of high order, many of the leaf impressions having been identified
                    as belonging to species of trees and shrubs which still exist on the island. It
                    is evident, moreover, that great alterations and dislocations had taken place in
                    the rocks of various localities before other lavas and tuffs had been thrown
                    upon them.</p>
                <p>There are no data for determining when volcanic action commenced in this
                    locality, but looking at the enormous depth of the surrounding sea it is clear
                    that a vast period of time must have elapsed to allow of a great mountain
                    reaching the surface and then rising several thousand feet into the air. Again,
                    considering the comparatively feeble agents for effecting the work of denudation
                    (neither glaciers nor thick accumulations of alpine snow being found here), and
                    then the enormous erosion that has actually taken place, the inference is
                    inevitable that a very great lapse of time was required to excavate the deep and
                    wide ravines that everywhere intersect the island. Nor is anything known as to
                    the period of the cessation of volcanic action. At the present day there are no
                    live craters, or smoking crevices, as at the Canaries and Cape Verds, nor any
                    hot springs, as at the Azores. On the slopes which descend from the central
                    ridge to the sea, especially in the neigbourhood of Funchal, there are many
                    hills with conical shapes of more or less regularity, which seem to have been
                    formed at a comparatively modern epoch. Volcanic cinders and slag are lying upon
                    several of them, which look as if they had been thrown out of a furnace
                    yesterday. Yet round the base of others there may be traced streams of lava
                    flowing from a higher source, and showing that, subsequent to the construction
                    of these lateral cones, modern as they look, molten matter issued from higher
                    vents, which assumed, on cooling, the character of ordinary compact basalt.</p>
                <p>If we examine the general configuration of Madeira, we shall see a mountain
                    chain, about 30 miles in length, running east and west, and throwing off lateral
                    ridges, that give it an extreme breadth of about 12 miles. Peaks rise about the
                    middle to a height of more than 6000 feet; and deep ravines, lying between the
                    lateral ridges, strike for the most part north and south from the central ridge
                    to the sea. In the sections afforded by the ravines, the nucleus of the island
                    is seen to consist of a confused mass of more or less stratified rock, upon
                    which rest beds of tuff, scoriae, and lava, in the shape of basalt, trap, and
                    trachyte, the whole traversed by dykes. These beds are thinnest near the central
                    axis; as they approach the coast they become thicker and less intersected by
                    dykes. At the centre of the island there are several summits of nearly the same
                    altitude, and these are in some places connected by narrow walls and ridges,
                    which are frequently quite impassable, whilst at others they are separated by
                    ravines of great depth. On all sides are seen vertical dykes, projecting like
                    turrets above the weathered surface of the softer beds.</p>
                <p>In various parts of the island may be seen elevated tracts of comparatively level
                    ground. These are supposed to have been formed by the meeting of numerous
                    streams of lava flowing from cones and points of eruption in close proximity,
                    various ejectamenta assisting at the same time to fill up inequalities. Deep
                    down in some of the lateral ravines may be seen ancient cones of eruption which
                    have been overwhelmed by streams of melted matter issuing from the central
                    region, and afterwards exposed to view by the same causes that excavated the
                    ravines. These ravines may be regarded as, having been formed at first by
                    subterranean movements, both gradual and violent, which dislocated the rocks,
                    and cut clefts through which streams flowed to the sea. In course of time the
                    waters, periodically swollen by melted snows and the copious rains of winter,
                    would cut deeper and deeper into the heart of the mountains, and would undermine
                    the lateral cliffs, until the valleys became as large as we now find them. Even
                    the Curral, which, from its rounded shape and its position in the centre of the
                    island, has been usually deemed the ruins of a crater, is thought to be nothing
                    more than a valley scooped out in the way described. The rarity of crateriform
                    cavities in Madeira is very remarkable. There exists, hoλvever, to the east of
                    Funchal, on a tract 2000 feet high, the Lagoa, a small but perfect crater, 500
                    feet in diameter, and with a depth of 150 feet; and there is another, which is a
                    double one, in the district known as Fanal, in the north-west of Madeira, nearly
                    5000 feet above the sea. The basalt of which much of the outer part of the
                    island is composed is of a dark colour and a tough texture, with small
                    disseminated crystals of olivine and augite. It is sometimes full of vesicular
                    cavities, formed by the expansion of imprisoned gases. A rudely columnar
                    structure is very often seen in the basalt, but there is nothing so perfect as
                    the columns of Staffs, or the Giant’s Causeway. The trachytic rocks are small in
                    quantity compared with'those of the basaltic class. The tufa is soft and
                    friable, and generally of a yellow colour; but where it has been overflowed by a
                    hot stream of lava it has assumed a red colour. Black ashes and fragments of
                    pumice are sometimes found in the tufaceous strata.</p>
                <p>The mineral contents of the rocks of Madeira are unimportant. There are no
                    metallic ores, nor has any sulphur been found; but a little iron pyrites and
                    specular iron are occasionally met with. The basalt yields an excellent
                    building-stone, various qualities of which are quarried near Cama dos Lobos, 5
                    or 6 miles west of Funchal.</p>
                <p>At Porto Santo the trachytic rocks bear a much greater proportion to the basaltic
                    than in Madeira. An adjacent islet is formed of tuffs and calcareous rock,
                    indicating a submarine origin, upon which supramarine lavas have been poured.
                    The older series contains corals and shells (also of the Miocene Tertiary
                    epoch), with water-worn pebbles, cemented together by carbonate of lime, the
                    whole appearing to havê been a coral reef near an ancient beach. The calcareous
                    rock is taken in large quantities to Funchal, to be burnt into lime for building
                    purposes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Porto Santo.</hi> —This forms a single concelho and parish,
                    about 25 geographical miles north-east of Madeira. It has a length of 6⅜
                    geographical miles and a width of 3. A stationary population of about 1750
                    persons inhabits 435 houses, chiefly collected at one spot known as the Villa,
                    where a lieutenant-governor resides. The island is very unproductive, water
                    being scarce and wood wholly absent. Around the little town there is a
                    considerable tract of pretty level ground covered by calcareous sand containing
                    fossil land shells. At each end of the island there are hills, of which Pico do
                    Facho, the highest, reaches the altitude of 1600 feet. Barley, but little else,
                    is grown here, the limited requirements of the inhabitants being supplied from
                    Funchal by means of small sailing vessels.</p>
