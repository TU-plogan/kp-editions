                    Koran <hi rend="italic">(sur.</hi> xxxiii. 60); the old name was Yathrib, the
                    Lathrippa of Ptolemy and Iathrippa of Stephanus Byzantius.</p>
                <p>Medina stands in a sort of basin at the northern extremity of an elevated plain,
                    on the western skirt of tl∣e mountain range which divides the Red Sea
                    coast-lands from the central plateau of Arabia. At an hour’s distance to the
                    north it is dominated by Mount Ohod, an outlying spur of the great mountains,
                    which is now visited by the pious as the scene of the well-known battle (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mohammed),</hi> and the site of the tomb and mosque of the
                    Prophet’s uncle Hamza. To the east the plain is bounded by a long line of hills
                    eight or ten hours distant, over which the Nejd road runs. A number of torrent
                    courses (of which W. Kanât to the north, at the foot of Mount Ohod, and W.'Akik,
                    some miles to the south, are the most important) descend from the mountains,
                    forming considerable streams and pools after rain, and converge in the <pb

                    at a place called Zagh&lt;4ba, whence they descend to the sea through the
                    “mountains of the Tibâma”—the rough country between Medina and its port of
                    Yanbu'—under the name of W. Idanι. Southwards from Medina the plain extends
                    unbroken, but with a slight rise, as far as the eye can reach. The convergence
                    of torrent courses in the neighbourhood of Medina makes this one of the
                    best-watered spots in northern Arabia. The city lies close to one of the great
                    volcanic centres of the peninsula, which was in violent eruption as lateas Ï266
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> when the lava stream approached within an hour’s
                    distance of the walls, and dammed up W. Kauât. The result of this and older
                    prehistoric eruptions has been to confine the underground water, so important in
                    Arabian tillage, which can be reached at any point of the oasis by sinking deep
                    wells. Many of the wells are brackish, and the natural fertility of the volcanic
                    soil is in many places impaired by the salt with which it is impregnated; but
                    the date palm grows well everywhere, and the groves, interspersed with gardens
                    and corn-fields, which surround the city on all sides except the west, have been
                    famous from the time of the Prophet. Thus situated, Medina was originally a city
                    of agriculturists, not like Mecca a city of merchants; nor, apart from the
                    indispensable trade in provisions, has it ever acquired commercial importance
                    like that which Mecca owes to the pilgrimage.<note anchored="true"

                    marrying only among themselves. The townsmen proper, on the other hand, are a

                    at the Prophet’s mosque for persons who send a fee from a distance, as well as
                    the alms which the citizens are accustomed to collect when they go abroad,
                    especially in Turkey, keep up an idle population greatly in excess of that which
                    the district would naturally support in the present defective state of
                    agriculture. The population of the city and suburbs may be from 16,000 to 20,000

                    oasis.</p></note> The glory of Medina, and the only im portant building, is the
                    mosque of the Prophet, in the eastern part of the city, a spacious enclosed
                    court between 400 and 500 feet in length from north to south, and two-thirds as
                    much in breadth. The minarets and the lofty dome above the sacred graves are
                    imposing features, but the circuit is hemmed in by houses or narrow lanes, and
                    is not remarkable except for the principal gate (Bâb el-Salâm) at the southern
                    end of the west front, facing the sacred graves, which is richly inlaid with
                    marbles and fine tiles, and adorned with golden inscriptions. This gate leads
                    into a deep portico, with ten rows of pillars, running along the southern wall.
                    Near the further end of the portico, but not adjoining the walls, is a sort of
                    doorless house or chamber hung with rich curtains, which is supposed to contain
                    the graves of Mohammed, Abubekr, and 'Omar. To the north of this is a smaller
                    chamber of the same kind, draped in black, which is said to represent the house
                    or tomb of Fâtima. Both are enclosed within an iron railing, so closely
                    interwoven with brass wire-work that a glimpse of the so-called tombs can only
                    be got through certain apertures where intercessory prayer is addressed to the
                    prophet, and pious salutations are paid to the other saints.<note

                    and the tomb is seldom entered except by the servants of the mosque. It contains
                    the treasures of the mosque in jewels and plate, which were once very
                    considerable but have been repeatedly plundered, last of all by the Wahhabis in
                    the beginning of the present century.</p></note> The portico in front of the
                    railing is not ineffective, at least by night light. It is paved with marble,
                    and in the eastern part with mosaic, laid with rich carpets; the southern wall
                    is clothed with marble pierced with windows of good stained glass, and the great
                    railing has a striking aspect; but an air of tawdriness is imparted by the
                    vulgar painting of the columns, especially in the space between the tomb and the
                    pulpit, which has received, in accordance with a tradition of the Prophet, the
                    name of the Garden (rauda), and is decorated with barbaric attempts to carry out
                    this idea in colour.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The

                    and tomb was called by the Prophet one of the, gardens of Paradise probably
                    arose from a mistake.</p></note> The throng of visitors passing along the south
                    wall from the Bâb el-Salâm to salute the tombs is separated from the Garden by a
                    wooden partition about 8 feet high, painted in arabesques. The other three sides
                    of the interior court have porticos of less depth and mean aspect, with three or
                    four rows of pillars. Within the court are the-well of the Prophet and some palm
                    trees said to have been planted by FAtima.</p>
                <p>The original mosque was a low building of brick roofed with palm branches, and
                    much smaller than the present structure. The wooden pulpit from which Mohammed
                    preached appears to have stood on the same place with the present pulpit in the
                    middle of the south portico. The dwelling of the Prophet and the huts of his
                    women adjoined the mosque. Mohammed died in the hut of 'Aisha, and was buried
                    where he died; Abubekr and 'Omar were afterwards buried beside him. Now in 711
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> the mosque, which had previously been enlarged by
                    'Omar and 'Othmân, was entirely reconstructed on a grander scale and in
                    Byzantine style by Greek and Coptic artificers at the command of the caliph
                    Walid and under the direction of'Omar ibn'Abd el-'Aziz. The enlarged plan
                    included the huts above named, which were pulled down. Thus the place of the
                    Prophet’s burial was brought within the mosque; but the recorded discontent of
                    the city at this step shows that the feeling which regards the tomb as the great
                    glory of thé mosque, and the pilgrimage to it as the most meritorious that can
                    be undertaken except that to Mecca, was still quite unknown. It is not even

                    graves. Ibn 'Abd Rabbih, in the beginning of the 10th century <hi rend="italic"
                    >Çlkd,</hi> Cairo ed., iii. 366), describes the enclosure as a hexagonal wall,
                    rising within three cubits of the ceiling of the portico, clothed in marble for
                    more than a man’s height, and above that height daubed with the unguent called
                    khalûk. This may be supplemented from Istakhri, who calls it a lofty house
                    without a door. That there are no gravestones or visible tombs within is certain
                    from what is recorded of occasions when the place was opened up for repairs. Ibn
                    Jubair (p. 193 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    y</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi> and Samhudi speak of a small casket adorned with
                    silver, fixed in the eastern wall, which was supposed to be opposite the head of
                    the Prophet, while a silver nail in the south wall indicated the point to which
                    the corpse faced, and from which the salutation of worshippers was to be
                    addressed (Burton misquotes). The European fable of the coffin suspended by
                    magnets is totally unknown to Moslem tradition. The smaller chamber of Fâtima is
                    pretty modern. In the time of Ibn Jubair and of Ibn Batιita (unless the latter,
                    as is so often the case, is merely copying his predecessor) there was only a
                    small marble trough north of the rauda (or grave) which “is said to be the house
                    of Fâtima or her grave, but God only knows.” It is more probable that Fâtima was
                    buried in the Baki, where her tomb was also shown in the 12th century (Ibn
                    Jubair, p. 198 ⅛7.).</p>
                <p>The mosque was again extended by El-Mahdi (781 A.D.), and was burned down in
                    1256. Of its appearance before the fire we have two authentic accounts by Ibn
                    'Abd Pιabbih early in the 10th century, and by Ibn Jubair, who visited it in
                    1184. The old mosque had a much finer and more regular appearance than the
                    present one; the interior walls were richly adorned with marble and mosaic
                    arabesques of trees and the like, and the outer walls with stone marquetry; the
                    pillars of the south portico (seventeen in each row) were in white plaster with
                    gilt capitals, the other pillars were of marble. Ibn 'Abd Rabbih speaks of
                    eighteen gates, of which in Ibn Jubair’s time, as at present, all but four were
                    walled up. There were then three minarets. After the fire which took place just
                    at the time of the fall of the caliphate, the mosque long lay in a miserable
                    condition. Its repair was chiefly due to the Egyptian sultans, especially to
                    Kâit Bey, whose restoration after a second fire in 1481 amounted almost to a
                    complete reconstruction. Of the old building nothing seems to have remained but
                    some of the columns and part of the walls; and, as the minarets have also been
                    rebuilt and two new ones added, the architectural character is now essentially
                    Egyptian. The great dome above the tomb, the railing roun I it, and the pulpit,
                    all date from Kâit Bey’s restoration.</p>
                <p>The suburbs, which occupy as muclι space as the city proper, and are partly
                    walled in, lie south-west of the town, from which they are separated by an open
                    space, the halting-place of caravans. Through the suburbs runs the watercourse
                    called W. Buthân, a tributary of W. Kandt, which the Yanbu' road crosses by a
                    stone bridge. The suburbs are the quarter of the peasants. Thirty or forty
                    families with their cattle occupy a single courtyard (hôsh), and form a kind of
                    community often at feud with its neighbours. The several clans of Medina must
                    have lived in much, the same way at the time of the Prophet. The famous cemetery
                    called Bakι el-Gharkad, the resting-place of a multitude of the “companions” of
                    the Prophet, lies immediately to the west of the city. It once contained many
                    monuments, the chief of which are described by Ibn Jubair. Burckhardt in 1815
                    found it a mere waste, but some of the mosques have since been rebuilt.</p>

                    the country round Medina with an inviolable character like that of the Haram
                    round Mecca; but this provision has never been observed with strictness. After
                    the fall of the caliphs, who maintained a governor in Medina, the native emirs
                    enjoyed a fluctuating measure of independence, interrupted by the aggressions of
                    thesherifs of Mecca, or controlled by an intermittent Egyptian protectorate. The
                    Turks after the conquest of Egypt held Medina for a time with a firmer hand; but
                    their rule grew weak, and was almost nominal long before the Wahhabis took the
                    city in 1804. A Turko-Egyptian force retook it in 1812, and the Turks still
                    maintain a pasha with a military establishment, while the cadi and chief agha of
                    the mosque (a eunuch) are sent from Constantinople. But the internal government
                    is largely in Arab hands, and is said to be much better than that of Mecca.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">S&gt;urces.—</hi> Medina has been described from personal
                    observation by Burckhardt, who visited it in 1815, and Burton, who made the
                    pilgrimage in 1853. Sadlier on bis journey from Ça(if to Yanbu <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> (1819) was not allowed to enter the holy city.
                    Burckhardt was prevented by ill health from examining the city and country with
                    his usual thoroughness. Little is added to our information by the report of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Abd el-Razzdk, who performed the pilgrimage in 1878,
                    on a medical commi-sion from the English Government The chief Arabic authority
                    besides Ibn ‘Abd Rabbih and Ibn Jubair is Samhιidf, of whose history Wüstenfeld
                    published an abstract in the Gottingen <hi rend="italic">Abhandlungen,</hi> vol.
                    ix., 1861. It goes down to the end of the 15th century. The topography of the
                    country about Medina is interesting both historically and geographically; Bekrf,
                    YAkιit, and other Arabic geographers supply much material on this topic, but
                    completer European accounts are wanting to permit of its full utilization.
                    Medina now offers a more promising, but also a more perilous, field for an
                    explorer than Mecca. (W. 1*. S.)</p>
