                    (1809-1846), one of the most elegant geometers of modern times, was born in
                    1809, near Strabane, Ireland. After an exceptionally brilliant undergraduate
                    career in Trinity College, Dublin, he was elected fellow in 1832. From 1832 to
                    1843 he held the chair of mathematics; and during his tenure of this post, for
                    which he was specially fitted, he improved in a most marked manner the position
                    of his university as a mathematical centre. In 1843 he was transferred to the
                    chair of natural philosophy, for which he was not nearly so well qualified.
                    Overwork, mainly on subjects beyond the natural range of his powers, induced
                    mental disease; and he died by his own hand in 1846. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Works</hi> have been published in a collected form (Dublin University Press
                    Series, 1880). Their distinguishing feature is the geometry,—which has rarely
                    been applied either to pure space problems or to known physical questions such
                    as the rotation of a rigid solid or the properties of Fresnel’s wave-surface
                    with such singular elegance. In this respect his work takes rank with that of
                    Poinsot. No higher praise could be given. One specially remarkable geometrical
                    discovery of Maccullagh’s is that of the “modular generation of surfaces of the
                    second degree”; and a noteworthy contribution to physical optics is his “theorem
                    of the polar plane.” But his methods, which, in less known subjects, were almost
                    entirely tentative, were altogether inadequate to the solution of the more
                    profound physical problems to which his attention was mainly devoted, such as
                    the theories of double refraction, of crystalline reflexion, &amp;c. Here not
                    only are the utmost powers of analysis required, but also the highest physical
                    knowledge; and in consequence Maccullagh’s work was entirely overshadowed by
                    that of contemporaries, such as Cauchy and Green. See, on this point, Stokes’s
                    “Report on Double Refraction” (2?. <hi rend="italic">A.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Deport,</hi> 1862). The story of his later days painfully suggests the
                    comparison of a high-bred but slight racer tearing itself to pieces in the vain
                    endeavour to move a huge load, which a traction-engine could draw with ease and
                    promptitude. He wasted, on problems altogether beyond his strength, powers of no
                    common order, which, had they only been suitably directed, might have immensely
                    extended our knowledge. Such, at least, is the estimate which we cannot avoid
                    forming from a perusal of his published works. He had “conical refraction” in
                    his hand for years without knowing its value. The reader who wishes to see the
                    other side of the question (Maccullagh represented as standing to Fresnel in the
                    same relative position as Newton to Kepler) is referred to the <hi rend="italic"
