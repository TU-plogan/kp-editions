                <p><label type="entry">MANDATE <hi rend="smallcaps">(Mandatum)</hi></label>. The
                    contract of <hi rend="italic">mandatum,</hi> in Roman law was constituted by one
                    person (the <hi rend="italic">mandatarius)</hi> promising to do something
                    gratuitously at the request of another (the <hi rend="italic">mandator),</hi>
                    who undertakes to indemnify him against loss. The jurist distinguished the
                    different cases of mandatum according as the object of the contract was the
                    benefit of the mandator or a third person singly, or the mandator and a third
                    person, the mandator and the mandatarius, or the mandatarius and a third person
                    together. When the benefit was that of the mandatarius alone, the obligations of
                    the contract were held not to arise, although the form of the contract might
                    exist, the commission being held to be merely advice tendered to the
                    mandatarius, and acted on by him at his own risk. Mandatum was classified as one
                    of the contracts established by consent of the parties alone; but, as there was
                    really no obligation of any kind until the mandatarius had acted on the mandate,
                    it has with more propriety been referred to the contracts created by the supply
                    of some fact (re). The obligations of the mandatarius under the contract were,
                    briefly, to do what he had promised according to his instructions, observing
                    ordinary diligence in taking care of any property entrusted to him, and handing
                    over to his principal the results of his action, including the right to sue in
                    his name. On the other hand, the principal was bound to recoup him his expenses
                    and indemnify him against loss through obligations he might have incurred.</p>
                <p>The essentials and the terminology of the contract are preserved in most modem
                    systems of law. But in English law mandate, under that name, can hardly be said
                    to exist as a separate form of contract. To some extent the law of mandatum
                    corresponds partly to our law of principal and agent, partly to that of
                    principal and surety. Story, disputing the assertion that “in the laws of
                    England the contract of mandatum is of no use,” points out that “the common law
                    does not indeed comprehend under that appellation all the contracts of mandate
                    according to the civil law, such, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n495/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0495-0472"/> for example, as mere naked acts of agency, where
                    there is no bailment of anything to the agent. But for the most part the
                    principles applicable to all the various classes of mandate have a place in our
                    law, although they may be differently named.” The difference, however, is more
                    than one of name. English law in this as in other cases reaches its end by a
                    different method through different principles from those of the civil law,
                    though the end may be the same.</p>
                <p>Mandate is retained by Story and others to signify the contract more generally
                    known as gratuitous bailment. It is restricted, as he points out; to personal
                    property, and it implies the delivery of something to the bailee, both of which
                    conditions are unknown in the mandatum of the civil law. Mandate in this later
                    sense is further distinguished from deposit in that the custody of the thing is
                    the principal object of the latter contract, while in the former it is something
                    to be done with respect to the thing, though Story holds that custody and
                    performance concur in both contracts, —this by way of correction of Sir W.
                    Jones’s distinction that mandate consists in feasance and deposit in
                    custody.</p>
