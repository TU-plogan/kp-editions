                <p><label type="entry">MEGAPODE</label>, the name given generally to a-small but
                    remarkable Family of birds, highly characteristic of some parts of the
                    Australian Region, to which it is almost peculiar. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Megapodiidae</hi> with the <hi rend="italic">Cracidae</hi> form that division
                    of the Order <hi rend="italic">Gallinae</hi> named by Professor Huxley <hi
                    rend="italic">Peristeropodes (Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1868, p. 296), and
                    norρhologically seem to be the lowest of the Order, with which apparent fact may
                    perhaps be correlated their singular habit of leaving their eggs to be hatched
                    without incubation, burying them in the ground (as many Reptiles do) or heaping
                    over them a mound of earth, leaves, and rotten wood. This habit attracted
                    attention more than three hundred years ago,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Antonio Pigafetta, one of the survivors of Magellan's
                    glorious but disastrous voyage, records in his journal, under date of April
                    1521, among the peculiarities of the Philippine Islands, then first discovered
                    by Europeans, the existence of a bird there, about the size of a Fowl, which
                    laid its eggs, as big as a Duck’s, in the sand, and left them to be hatched by
                    the heat of the sun <hi rend="italic">(Premier Voyage</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >autour</hi><hi rend="italic">du Monde,</hi> ed. Aτnoretti, Paris, A.R. ix. p.
                    88). More than a hundred years later the Jesuit Nieremberg, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae,</hi> published at Antwerp
                    in 1635, described (p. 207) a bird called “Daie,” and by the natives named
                    “Tapun,” not larger than a Dove, which, with its tail (!) and feet, excavated a
                    nest in sandy places and laid therein eggs bigger than those of a Goose. The
                    publication at Rome in 1651 of Hernandez’s <hi rend="italic">Hist. Avium
                    Novae</hi><hi rend="italic">Hispaniae</hi> shews that his papers must have been
                    accessible to Nieremberg, who took from them the passage just mentioned, but, as
                    not unusual with him, misprinted the names which stand in Hernandez’s work (p.
                    56, cap. 220) “Daic” and “Tapum” respectively, and omitted his predecessor’s
                    important addition “Viuit in Philippicis.” Not long after, the Dominican
                    Navarrete, a missionary to China, made a considerable stay in the Philippines,
                    and returning to Europe in 1673 wrote an account of the Chinese empire, of which
                    Churchill <hi rend="italic">(Collection of Voyages and Travels,</hi> vol. i.)
                    gave an English translation in 1704. It is therein stated (p. 45) that in many
                    of the islands of the Malay Archipelago “there is a very singular bird call’d
                    <hi rend="italic">Tdbon,"</hi> and that “What I and many more admire is, that it
                    being no biggei' in Body than an ordinary Chicken, tho’ long legg’d, yet it lays
                    an Egg larger than a Gooses, so that the Egg is bigger than the bird itself. . .
                    . In order to lay its Eggs, it digs ill the Sand above a yard in depth; after
                    laying, it fills up the hole and makes it even with the rest; there the Eggs
                    hatch with the heat of the Sun and Sand.” He adds further information which need
                    not be quoted here. Gemelli Careri, who travelled from 1663 to 1699, and in the
                    latter year published an account of his voyage round the world, gives similar
                    evidence respecting this remarkable bird, which he calls “Tavon,” in the
                    Philippine Islands ( I <hi rend="italic">ay. du tour du Monde,</hi> ed. Paris,
                    1727, v. pp. 15/, 158). The Megapode of Luzon is fairly described by Camel or
                    Camelli in his observations on the Birds of the Philippines communicated by
                    Petiver to the Royal Society in 1703 <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.,</hi>
                    xxiii. p. 1398). In 1726 Valentyn published his elaborate work on the East
                    Indies, wherein (deel iii. bk. v. p. 320) he very correctly describes the
                    Megapode of Amboina under the name of “Malleloe,” and also a larger kin&lt;l
                    found in Celebes, so as to shew he had in the course of his long residence in
                    the Dutch settlements become personally acquainted with both.</p></note> but the
                    accounts given of it by various travellers were generally discredited by
                    naturalists,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thus
                    Willughby <hi rend="italic">(Ornilhologia,</hi> p. 297), or Ray for him, who

                    blamed for their hesitation, considering the number of other marvels narrated by
                    the same worthy father. Buffon also <hi rend="italic">(Oiseaux,</hi> ix. p. 436)
                    was just as sceptical in regard’to the relation of Careri.</p></note> and as
                    examples of the birds, probably from their unattractive plumage, appear not to
                    have been brought to Europe, no one of them was seen by any ornithologist or
                    scientifically described until near the end of the first quarter of the present
                    century. The first member of the Family to receive authoritative recognition was
                    one of the largest, inhabiting the continent of Australia, where it is known as
                    the Brush-Turkey, and was originally described by Latham in 1821 under the name
                    of the New-Holland Vulture, a misleading designation which he subsequently tried
                    to correct on perceiving its Galline character. It is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Talegallus lathami</hi> of modern ornithologists, and is nezrly the size of a
                    hen Turkey. Six smaller species of the same genus have since been described, all
                    from New Guinea or the neighbouring islands, but two of them, <hi rend="italic"
                    >T. pyrrhopygius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">T. bruyni,</hi> have been separated
                    to form a group <hi rend="italic">Aepypodcus</hi> The Australian bird is of a
                    sooty-brown colour, relieved beneath by the lighter edging of some of the
                    feathers, but the head and neck are nearly bare, beset with fine bristles, the
                    skin being of a deep pinkish-red, passing above the breast into a large wattle
                    of bright yellow. The tail is commonly carried upright and partly folded,
                    something like that of a domestic Fowl.</p>
                <p>The next form of which we may speak is another inhabitant of Australia, commonly
                    known in England as the Mallee-bird, but to the colonists as the “Native
                    Pheasant”—the <hi rend="italic">Lipoa</hi><hi rend="italic">ocellata,</hi>
                    described by Gould in the zoological <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> for 1840
                    (p. 126), which has much shorter tarsi and toes, the head entirely clothed, and
                    the tail expanded. Its plumage presents a pleasing combination of greys and
                    browns of various tints, interspersed with black, white, and buff, the
                    wing-coverts and feathers <pb break="no"

                    subcircular patch, whence the trivial scientific name of the bird is given,
                    while a stripe of black feathers with a median line of white extends down the
                    front of the throat, from the chin to the breast. There is but one species of
                    this genus known, as is also the case with the next to be mentioned, which is a
                    singular bird long known to inhabit Celebes, but not fully described until
                    1846,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As we have seen,
                    it was mentioned in 1726 by Valentyn, and a young example was in 1830 described

                    >Megacephalon,</hi> has since commonly borne the latter appellation. This is a
                    very remarkable form, bearing a helmet-like protuberance on the back of its
                    head, all of which as well as the neck is bare and of a bright red colour; the
                    plumage of the body is glossy black above, and beneath roseate-white.</p>
                <p>Of the Megapodes proper, constituting the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Megapodius,</hi> many species have been described, but authorities are greatly
                    at variance as to the validity of several, and here it would be impossible to
                    name all that have been supposed to exist. Some are only known from very young
                    examples—mere chickens; and some have even been described from their eggs alone.
                    In 1870 Mr G. R. Gray enumerated twenty species, of which sixteen were
                    represented in the British Museum, and several have been described since; but
                    ten years later Professor Schlegel recognized only seventeen species, of which
                    examples of twelve were contained in the Leyden Museum <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">des</hi><hi rend="italic">Pays-Bas,</hi> viii.,
                    Monogr. 41, pp. 56-86), while Μ. Oustalet, in his elaborate monograph of the
                    Family <hi rend="italic">(Ann. Sc. Nat.,</hi><hi rend="italic">Zoologie,</hi>
                    ser. 6, vols. x. and xi.), admits nineteen species. The birds of this genus
                    range from the Samoa Islands in the east, through the Tonga group, to the New
                    Hebrides, the northern part of Australia, New Guinea and its neighbouring
                    islands, Celebes, the Pelew Islands, and the Ladrones, and have also outliers in
                    detached portions of the Indian Region, as the Philippines (where indeed they
                    were first discovered by Europeans), Labuan, and even the Nicobars—though none
                    are known from the intervening islands of Borneo, Java, or Sumatra. Within what
                    may be deemed their proper area they are found, says Mr Wallace <hi
                    rend="italic">(Geogr. Distr. Animals,</hi> ii. p. 341) “on the smallest islands
                    and sand-banks, and can evidently pass over a few miles of sea with ease.”
                    Indeed proof of their roaming disposition is afforded by the fact that the bird
                    described by Lesson <hi rend="italic">(Voy.</hi><hi rend="italic">Coquille:
                    Zoologie,</hi> p. 703) as <hi rend="italic">Alecthelia urvillii,</hi> but now
                    considered to be the young of <hi rend="italic">Megapodius freycineti,</hi> flew
                    on board his ship when more than 2 miles from the nearest land (Guebé), in an
                    exhausted state, it is true, but that may be attributed to its extreme youth.
                    The species of <hi rend="italic">Megapodius</hi> are about the size of small
                    Fowls, the head generally crested, the tail very short, the feet enormously
                    large, and, with the exception of <hi rend="italic">Μ. wallacii (Proc. Zool.
                    Society,</hi> 1860, <hi rend="italic">Aves,</hi> pl. 171), from the Moluccas,
                    all have a sombre plumage.</p>
                <p>The extraordinary habit possessed by the Megapodes generally of relieving
                    themselves of the duty of incubation, as before mentioned,—a habit which
                    originally attracted the attention of travellers, whose stories were on that
                    very account discredited,—as well as the highly developed condition of the young
                    at birth, has been so fully described by Gould <hi rend="italic">(Handb. B.
                    Australia,</hi> ii. pp. 152- 175), G. R. Gray <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool.

                    Archipelago,</hi> i. pp. 415-419; ii. pp. 147-149), and so often repeated by
                    other writers, as to be very commonly known, and here there seems no necessity
                    to enter into further details concerning it. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.
