                <p><label type="entry">MAMMALIA</label></p>
                <p>MAMMALIA (French, <hi rend="italic">Mammifères</hi>; German, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Säuge-</hi><hi rend="italic">thiere)</hi> is the name invented by Linnaeus
                    (from the Latin, <hi rend="italic">mamma),</hi> and now commonly used by
                    zoologists, for one of the classes of vertebrated animals, which, though the
                    best known and undoubtedly the most important group of the animal kingdom, has
                    never received any generally accepted vernacular designation in our language.
                    The unity of structure of the animals composing this class, and their definite
                    demarcation from other vertebrates, were not recognized until comparatively
                    modern times, and hence no word was thought of to designate what zoologists now
                    term a mammal. The nearest equivalents in common use are “beast” and
                    “quadruped,’’ both of which, however, cover a different ground, as they are
                    often used to include the larger four-footed reptiles, and to exclude certain
                    undoubted mammals, as Man, Bats, and Whales.</p>
                <p>The limits of the class as now understood by zoologists are perfectly well
                    defined, and, although certain forms still existing on the earth (though not
                    those mentioned above as excluded by the popular idea) are of exceedingly
                    aberrant structure, exhibiting several well-marked characters which connect them
                    with the lower vertebrated groups, common consent retains them in the class with
                    which the great proportion of their characters ally them, and hitherto no traces
                    of any species showing still more divergent or transitional characters have been
                    discovered. There is thus a great interval, not bridged over by any known forms,
                    recent or extinct, between mammals and other vertebrates.</p>
                <p>In the gradual order of evolution of living beings, mammals taken altogether are
                    certainly the highest in organization, as they were probably the last to appear
                    on the earth’s surface, though this must be said with some reservation, pending
                    further knowledge of the early history of the class of birds. But, as in
                    speaking of all other large and greatly differentiated groups, this expression
                    must not be understood in too limited a sense. The tendency to gradual
                    perfection for their particular station in life, which all groups manifest,
                    leads to various lines of specialization, or divergence from the common or
                    general type, which may or may not take the direction of elevation. A too
                    complex and sensitive condition of organization may in some circumstances of
                    life be disadvantageous, and modification may then take place in a retrograde
                    direction. In mammals, as in other classes, there are low forms as well as high
                    forms, but by any tests that can be applied, especially those based on the state
                    of development of the central nervous system, it will be seen that the average
                    exceeds the average of any other class, that many species of this class far
                    excel those of any other in perfection of structure, and that it contains one
                    form which is unquestionably the culminating point yet arrived at amongst
                    organized beings.</p>
                <p>With regard to the time of the first appearance of mammals upon the earth, the
                    geological record is provokingly imperfect. At the commencement of the Tertiary
                    period they were abundant, and already modified into most of the leading types
                    at present existing. It was at one time thought that they first came into being
                    at this date, but the discovery of fragments of numerous small species has
                    revealed the existence of some forms of the class at various periods throughout
                    almost the whole of the age of the deposition of the Secondary rocks. This
                    subject will be reverted to later on.</p>
                <p>It hardly need be said that mammals are vertebrated animals, and possess all the
                    characteristics common to the members of that division of the animal kingdom.
                    They are separated from the <hi rend="italic">Ichthyopsida</hi> (fishes and
                    amphibia) and agree with the <hi rend="italic">Sauropsida</hi> (reptiles and
                    birds) in the possession during their development of an amnion and allantois,
                    and in never having external branchiae or gills. They differ from reptiles and
                    resemble birds in being warm-blooded, and having a heart with four cavities and
                    a complete double circulation. They differ from both birds and reptiles in the
                    red corpuscles of the blood being nucleated and, with very few exceptions,
                    circular in outline; in the lungs being freely suspended in a thoracic cavity,
                    separated from the abdomen by a complete muscular partition, the diaphragm,
                    which is the principal agent in inflating the lungs in respiration; in having
                    but one aortic arch, which curves over the left bronchus; in the skin being more
                    or less clothed with hair, and never with feathers; in the greater perfection of
                    the commissural system of the cerebral hemispheres, which has either a complete
                    corpus callosum, or an incomplete one associated with a very larger anterior
                    commissure; in having no syrinx or inferior vocal organ, but a complete larynx
                    at the upper end of the trachea; in having a mandible of which each ramus
                    (except in very early developmental conditions) consists of a single bone on
                    each side, articulating to the squamosal, without the intervention of a quadrate
                    bone; in having a pair of laterally placed occipital condyles instead of one
                    median one; and in the very obvious character of the female being provided with
                    mammary glands, by the secretion of which the young (produced alive and not by
                    means of externally hatched eggs) are nourished for some time after birth.</p>
                <p>In common with all vertebrated animals, mammals have never more than two pairs of
                    limbs. In the great majority of the class both are well-developed and
                    functional, and adapted for terrestrial progression, as the larger number of
                    mammals live ordinarily on the surface of the earth. They are, however, by no
                    means limited to this situation. Some species spend the greater part of their
                    lives beneath the surface, their fore limbs being specially modified for
                    burrowing; others are habitually arboreal, their limbs being fitted for climbing
                    or hanging to boughs of trees; some are as aerial as birds, the fore limbs being
                    developed into wings of a special character; others are as aquatic as fishes,
                    the limbs assuming the form of fins or paddles. In many of the latter the hinder
                    extremities are either completely suppressed, or present only in a rudimentary
                    state. In no known mammal are the fore limbs absent.</p>
                <p>The hinder extremity of the axis of the body is usually prolonged into a tail,
                    which may be a mere pendent appendage, or modified to perform various functions,
                    as grasping boughs in climbing, or even gathering food, in the case of the
                    prehensile-tailed Monkeys and Opossums, swimming in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cetacea,</hi> and acting as a flap to drive away troublesome insects from the
                    skin in the <hi rend="italic">Ungulata.</hi></p>
                <p>GENERAL ANATOMICAL CHARACTERS OF THE MAMMALIA.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tegumentary Structures.</hi></p>
                <p>The external surface of the greater number of members of the class is thickly
                    clothed with a peculiarly modified form of epidermis, commonly called hair. This
                    consists of hard, elongated, slender, cylindrical or tapering, filiform,
                    unbranched masses of epidermic material, growing from a short papilla sunk at
                    the bottom of a follicle in the derm or true skin. Such hairs upon different
                    parts of the same <pb facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n369/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0369-0348"/> animal, or upon different animals, assume various
                    forms, and are of various sizes and degrees of rigidity,—as seen in the delicate
                    soft velvety fur of the Mole, the stiff bristles of the Pig, and the spines of
                    the Hedgehog and Porcupine, all modifications of the same structures. These
                    differences arise mainly from the different arrangement of the constituent
                    elements into which the epithelial calls are modified. Each hair is composed
                    usually of a cellular pithy internal portion, containing much air, and a denser
                    or more horny cortical part. In some animals, as Deer, the substance of the hair
                    is almost entirely composed of the medullary or cellular substance, and it is
                    consequently very easily broken; in others the horny part prevails almost
                    exclusively, as in the bristles of the Wild Boar. In the Three-toed Sloth <hi
                    rend="italic">(Bradypus)</hi> the hairs have a central horny axis and a pithy
                    exterior. Though generally nearly smooth, or but slightly scaly, the surface of
                    some hairs is strongly imbricated, notably so in some Bats, while in the
                    Two-toed Sloth <hi rend="italic">(Choloepus)</hi> they are longitudinally
                    grooved or fluted. Though usually more or less cylindrical or circular in
                    section, they are often elliptical or flattened, as in the curly-haired races of
                    men, the terminal portion of the hair of Moles and Shrews, and conspicuously in
                    the spines of the Rodents <hi rend="italic">Xerus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Platacanthomys.</hi> Hair having a property of mutual cohesion or “felting,”
                    which depends upon a roughened scaly surface and a tendency to curl, as in
                    domestic Sheep (in which animals this property has been especially cultivated by
                    selective breeding), is called “wool.”</p>
                <p>In a large number of mammals hairs of one kind only are scattered pretty evenly
                    over the surface, but in many there are two kinds, one longer, stiffer, and
                    alone appearing on the surface, and the other shorter, finer, and softer,
                    constituting the under fur, analogous to the down of birds. In most cases hairs
                    of a different character from those of the general surface grow in special
                    regions, forming ridges or tufts on the median dorsal or ventral surface or
                    elsewhere. The tail is very often completed in this way by variously disposed
                    elongated hairs. The margins of the eyelids are almost always furnished with a
                    special row of stiffish hairs, called <hi rend="italic">cilix</hi> or eyelashes,
                    and in most mammals specially modified hairs, constituting the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vibrissx</hi> or whiskers, endowed, through the abundant nerve supply of their
                    basal papillae, with special tactile powers, grow from the lips and cheeks. In
                    some mammals the hairy covering is partial and limited to particular regions; in
                    others, as the Hippopotamus and the <hi rend="italic">Sirenia,</hi> though
                    scattered over the whole surface, it is extremely short and scanty; but in none
                    is it reduced to so great an extent as in the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> in
                    which it is limited to a few small bristles confined to the neighbourhood of the
                    lips and nostrils, and often only present in the young or even foetal
                    condition.</p>
                <p>Some kinds of hairs, as those of the mane and tail of the Horse, appear to
                    persist throughout the life-time of the animal; but more generally, as in the
                    case of the body hair of. the same animal, they are shed and renewed
                    periodically, generally annually. Many mammals have a longer hairy coat in
                    winter, which is shed as summer comes on; and some few, which inhabit countries
                    covered in winter with snow, as the Arctic Fox, Variable Hare, and Ermine,
                    undergo a complete change of colour in the two seasons, being white in winter,
                    and grey or brown in summer. The several species of Cape Mole <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Chrysochloris),</hi> the Desmans or Water Moles <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Myogale∖</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Potamogale</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >velox</hi> are remarkable as being the only mammals whose hair reflects those
                    iridescent tints so common in the feathers of tropical birds.</p>
                <p>The principal and most obvious purpose of the hairy covering is to protect the
                    skin against external influences, especially cold and damp. Its function in the
                    hairless <hi rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> is supplied by the specially modified
                    and thickened layer of adipose tissue beneath the skin called “blubber.”</p>
                <p>True scales, or flat imbricated plates of horny material, covering the greater
                    part of the body, so frequently occurring in reptiles, are found in one family
                    only of mammals, the <hi rend="italic">Manidx</hi> or Pangolins; but these are
                    also associated with hairs growing from the intervals between the scales or on
                    the parts of the skin not covered by them. Similarly imbricated epidermic
                    productions form the covering of the under surface of the tail of the flying
                    Rodents of the genus <hi rend="italic">Anomalurus</hi>; and flat scutes, with
                    the edges in apposition, and not overlaid, clothe both surfaces of the tail of
                    the Beaver, Rats, and others of the same order, and also of some Insectivores
                    and Marsupials. The Armadillos alone have an ossified exoskeleton, composed of
                    plates of true bony tissue, developed in the derm or corium, and covered
                    withscutes of horny epidermis. Other epidermic appendages are the horns of
                    Ruminants and Rhinoceroses,—the former being elongated, tapering, hollow caps of
                    hardened epidermis of fibrillated structure, fitting on and growing from conical
                    projections of the frontal bone, and always arranged in pairs, while the latter
                    are of similar structure, but without any internal bony support, and situated in
                    the median line. Callosities, or bare patches covered with hardened and
                    thickened epidermis, are found over the ischial tuberosities of many apes, the
                    sternum of camels, on the inner side of the limbs of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Equidx,</hi> the grasping under surface of the tail of prehensile-tailed
                    monkeys, &amp;c. The greater part of the skin of both species of one-horned
                    Asiatic Rhinoceros is immensely thickened and stiffened by increase of the
                    tissue both of the derm and epiderm, constituting the well known jointed
                    “armour-plated” hide of those animals.</p>
                <p>With very few exceptions, the terminal extremities of the digits of both limbs
                    are more or less protected or armed by epidermic plates or sheaths, constituting
                    the various forms of nails, claws, or hoofs. These are wanting in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> alone. A perforated spur, with a special secreting
                    gland in connexion with it, is found attached to the hind leg of the males of
                    the two species of <hi rend="italic">Monotremata,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ornithorhynchus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Echidna.</hi></p>
                <p>Besides the universally distributed sebaceous glands connected with the pilose
                    system, most mammals have special glands situated in modified portions of the
                    integument, often involuted to form a shallow recess or a deep sac with a narrow
                    opening, situated in various parts of the surface of the body, and which secrete
                    odorous substances, by the aid of which individuals appear to recognize one
                    another, and which probably afford the principal means by which wild animals are
                    able to become aware of the presence of other members of the species, even at
                    great distances. Although the commencement of the modifications of portions of
                    the external covering for the formation of special secretions may be at present
                    difficult to understand, the principle of natural selection will readily explain
                    how such organs can become fixed and gradually increase in development in any
                    species, especially as there would probably be a corresponding modification and
                    increased sensibility of the olfactory organs. Such individuals as by the
                    intensity and peculiarity of their scent had greater power of attracting the
                    opposite sex would certainly be those most likely to leave descendants to
                    inherit and in their turn propagate the modification.</p>
                <p>To this group of structures belong the suborbital gland or “crumen” of Antelopes
                    and Deer, the frontal gland of the Muntjak and of Bats of the genus <hi

                <p>The dental system of mammals may be considered rather more in detail than space
                    permits for some other portions of their structure, both on account of the
                    important part it plays in the economy of the animals of this class, and of its
                    interest to zoologists as an aid in classification and identification of
                    species. Owing to the imperishable nature of their tissues, teeth are preserved
                    for an indefinite time, and in the case of extinct species often offer the only
                    indications available from which to derive an idea of the characters,
                    affinities, and habits of the animal to which they have belonged. Hence even
                    their smallest modifications have received great attention from comparative

                <p>Teeth are present in nearly all mammals, and are applied to various purposes.
                    They are, however, mainly subservient to the function of alimentation, being
                    used either in procuring food by seizing and killing living prey or gathering
                    and biting off portions of vegetable material, and more indirectly in tearing or
                    cutting through the hard protective coverings of food substances, as the husks
                    and shells of nuts, or in pounding, crushing, or otherwise mechanically dividing
                    the solid materials before swallowing, so as to prepare them for digestion in
                    the stomach. Certain teeth are also, in many animals most efficient weapons of
                    offence and defence, and for this purpose alone, quite irrespective of
                    subserviency to the digestive process, are they developed in the male sex of
                    many herbivorous animals, in the females of which they are absent or
                    rudimentary.</p>
                <p>Teeth belong essentially to the tegumentary or dermal system of organs, and, as
                    is well seen in the lower vertebrates, pass by almost insensible gradations into
                    the hardened spines and scutes formed upon the integument covering the outer
                    surface of the body, but in mammals they are more specialized in structure and
                    limited in locality.. In this class they are developed only in the gums or
                    fibro-mucous membrane covering the alveolar borders of the upper and lower jaw
                    or the premaxillary and maxillary bones and the mandible. In the process of
                    development, for the purpose of giving them that support which is needful for
                    the performance of their functions, they almost always become implanted in the
                    bone,—the osseous tissue growing up and moulding itself around the lengthening
                    root of the tooth, so that ultimately they become apparently parts of the
                    skeleton. In no mammal, however, does ankylosis or bony union between the tooth
                    and jaw normally take place, as in many fishes and reptiles,—a vascular layer of
                    connective tissue, the alveolo-dental membrane, always intervening.<note

                    species of Shrews are, however, said to become ankylosed to the jaw in adult
                    age.</p></note></p>
                <p>The presence of two or more roots, frequently met with in mammals, implanted into
                    corresponding distinct sockets of the jaw, is peculiar to animals of this
                    class.</p>
                <p>The greater number of mammalian teeth when fully formed are not simple and
                    homogeneous in structure, but are composed of several distinct tissues.</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">pulp,</hi> a soft substance, consisting of a very
                    delicate gelatinous connective tissue, in which numerous cells are imbedded, and
                    abundantly supplied with blood-vessels and nerves, constitutes the central axis
                    of all the basal part of the tooth, and affords the means by which the vitality
                    of the whole is preserved. The nerves which pass into the pulp and endow the
                    tooth with sensibility are branches of the fifth pair of cranial nerves. The
                    pulp occupies a larger relative space, and performs a more important purpose in
                    the young growing tooth than afterwards, as by the calcification and conversion
                    of its outer layers the principal hard constituent of the tooth, the dentine, is
                    formed. In teeth which have ceased to grow the pulp occupies a comparatively
                    small space, which in the dried tooth is called the pulp cavity. This
                    communicates with the external surface of the tooth by a small aperture at the
                    apex of the root, through which the branches of blood-vessels and nerves, by
                    which thg tooth receives its nutrition and sensitiveness, pass in to be
                    distributed in the pulp. In growing teeth the pulp cavity is widely open below,
                    while in advanced age it often becomes obliterated, and the pulp itself entirely
                    converted into bone-like material.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">dentine</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ivory</hi> forms the
                    principal constituent of the greater number of teeth. When developed in its most
                    characteristic form, it is a very hard but elastic substance, white, with a
                    yellowish tinge, and slightly translucent. It consists of an organic matrix,
                    something like but not identical with that of bone, richly impregnated with
                    calcareous salts (chiefly phosphate of lime), these constituting in a fresh
                    human tooth 72 per cent, of its weight. When subjected to microscopical
                    examination it is seen to be everywhere permeated by nearly parallel branching
                    tubes which run, in a slightly curving or wavy manner, in a general direction
                    from the centre towards the free surface of the tooth. These tubes communicate
                    by open mouths with the pulp cavity, and terminate usually near the periphery of
                    the dentine, by closed ends or loops, though in Marsupials and certain other
                    mammals they penetrate into the enamel. They are occupied in the living tooth by
                    soft gelatinous fibrils connected with the cells of the pulp. A variety of
                    dentine, permeated by canals containing blood-vessels, met with commonly in
                    fishes and in some few mammals, as the Megatherium, is called vasodentine. Other
                    modifications of this tissue occasionally met with are called osteo-dentine and
                    secondary dentine,— the latter being a dentine of irregular structure which
                    often fills up the pulp cavity of old animals.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">enamel</hi> constitutes a thin investing layer, complete
                    or partial, of the outer or exposed and working surface of the dentine of the
                    crown of the teeth of most mammals. This is the hardest tissue met with in the
                    animal body, containing from 95 to 97 per cent, of mineral substances (chiefly
                    phosphate and some carbonate of lime, with traces of fluoride of calcium). Its
                    ultimate structure consists of prismatic fibres, placed generally with their
                    long axes at right angles to the free surface of the tooth. Enamel is easily
                    distinguished from dentine with the naked eye, by its clear, bluish-white,
                    translucent appearance.</p>
                <p>4. The <hi rend="italic">cementum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">crusta</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">petrosa</hi> is always the most externally placed of the hard
                    tissues of which teeth are composed, as will be understood when the mode of
                    development of these organs is considered. It is often only found as a thin
                    layer upon the surface of the root, but sometimes, as in the complex-crowned
                    molar teeth of the Horse and <pb

                    important part, covering and filling in the interstices between the folds of the
                    enamel. In appearance, histological structure, and chemical composition it is
                    closely allied to osseous tissue, containing lacunae and canaliculi, though only
                    when it is of considerable thickness are Haversian canals present in it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Development of the Teeth.—</hi> The two principal constituents
                    of the teeth, the dentine and the enamel, are developed from the two layers of
                    the buccal mucous membrane, the dentine from the submucous, the enamel from the
                    epithelial layer. The latter dips down into the substance of the gum, and forms
                    the enamel organ or germ, the first rudiment of the future tooth, which is
                    constantly present even in those animals in which the enamel is not found as a
                    constituent of the perfectly-formed tooth. Below the mass of epithelial cells
                    thus embedded in the substance of the gum, and remaining connected by a narrow
                    neck of similar structure with the epithelium of the surface, a portion of the
                    vascular submucous areolar tissue becomes gradually separated and defined from
                    that which surrounds it, and assumes a distinct form, which is that of the crown
                    of the future tooth,—a single cone in the case of simple teeth, or with two or
                    more eminences in the complex forms. This is called the dental papilla or
                    dentine germ, and by the gradual conversion of its tissue into dentine the bulk
                    of the future tooth is formed, the uncalcified central portion remaining as the
                    pulp. The conversion of the papilla into hard tissue commences at the outer
                    surface of the apex, and gradually proceeds downwards and inwards, so that the
                    form of the papilla exactly determines the form of the future dentine, and no
                    alteration either in shape or size of this portion of the tooth, when once
                    calcified, can take place by addition to its outer surface. In the meanwhile
                    calcification of portion of the cells of the enamel organ, which adapts itself
                    like a cap round the top of the dentinal papilla, and has assumed a somewhat
                    complex structure, results in the formation of the enamel coating of the crown
                    of the tooth. While these changes are taking place the tissues immediately
                    surrounding the tooth germ become condensed and differentiated into a capsule,
                    which appears to grow up from the base of the dental papilla, and encloses both
                    this and the enamel germ, constituting the follicle or tooth sac. By the
                    ossification of the inner layer of this follicle, the cementum is formed. This
                    substance therefore, unlike the dentine, increases from within outwards, and its
                    growth may therefore be the cause of considerable modification of form and
                    enlargement, especially of the roots, of certain teeth, as those of Seals and
                    some <hi rend="italic">Cetacea.</hi> The delicate homogeneous layer which coats
                    the enamel surface of newly-formed teeth, in which cementum is not found in the
                    adult state, and known as Nasmyth’s membrane, is considered by Tomes as probably
                    a film of this substance, too thin to exhibit its characteristic structure,
                    though by others it is believed to be derived from the external layer of the
                    enamel organ. The homology of the teeth with the dermal appendages, hairs,
                    scales, and claws has already been alluded to, and it will now be seen that in
                    both cases two of the primary embryonic layers are concerned in their
                    development, the mesoblast and epiblast, although in very different proportions.
                    In the hair or nail the part derived from the epiblast forms the principal bulk
                    of the organ, the mesoblast only constituting the papilla or matrix. In the
                    tooth the epiblastic portion is limited to the enamel, always of relatively
                    small bulk and often absent, while the dentine (the principal constituent of the
                    tooth) and the cementum are formed from the mesoblast.</p>
                <p>When more than one set of teeth occur in mammals, those of the second set are
                    developed in a precisely similar manner to the first, but the enamel germ,
                    instead of being derived directly from an independent part of the oral
                    epithelium, is formed from a budding out of the neck of the germ of the tooth
                    succeeded. In the case of the true molars which have no predecessors, the germ
                    of the first has an independent origin, but that of the others is derived from
                    the neck of the germ of the tooth preceding it in the series. The foundations of
                    the permanent teeth are thus laid as it were almost simultaneously with those of
                    their predecessors, although they remain in many cases for years before they are
                    developed into functional activity.</p>
                <p>Although the commencement of the formation of teeth takes place at an early
                    period of embryonic life, they are in nearly all mammals still concealed beneath
                    the gum at the time of birth. The period of eruption, or “cutting” of the teeth
                    as it is called, that is, their piercing through and rising above the surface of
                    the mucous membrane, varies much in different species. In some, as Seals, the
                    whole series of teeth appear almost simultaneously; but more often there are
                    considerable intervals between their appearance, the front teeth usually coming
                    into place first, and those at the back of the mouth at a later period.<note

                    rend="italic">General Characters.—</hi> The simplest form of tooth may be
                    exemplified on a large scale by the tusk of the Elephant ' (fig. 1, I.). It is a
                    hard mass almost entirely composed of dentine, of a conical shape at first, but
                    during growth becoming more and more cylindrical or uniform in width. The enamel
                    covering, present on the apex in its earliest condition, soon disappears, but a
                    thin layer of cementum covers the circumference of the tooth throughout life. On
                    section it will be seen that the basal portion is hollow, and contains a large
                    conical pulp, as broad at the base as the tooth itself, and deeply imbedded in
                    the bottom of a recess or socket in the upper maxillary bone. This pulp
                    continues to grow during the lifetime of the animal, and to be converted at its
                    surface into dentine. The tooth therefore continually elongates, but the use to
                    which the animal subjects it in its natural state causes the apex to wear away,
                    at a rate generally proportionate to the growth at the base, otherwise it would
                    become of inconvenient length and weight. Such teeth of indefinite growth are
                    said to be “rootless,” or to have “persistent pulps.”</p>
                <p>One of the corresponding front teeth of man (fig. 1, II. and III.) may be taken
                    as an example of a very different condition. After its crown is fully formed by
                    calcification of the germ, the pulp, though continuing to elongate, begins to
                    contract in diameter; a neck or slight constriction is formed; and the remainder
                    of the pulp is converted into the root (or fang), a tapering conical process
                    which is imbedded in the alveolar cavity of the bone, and has at its extremity a
                    minute perforation, through which the vessels and nerves required to maintain
                    the vitality of the tooth enter the pulp cavity, very different from the widely
                    open cavity at the base of the growing tooth. When the crown of the tooth is
                    broad and complex in character, instead of having a single root, it may be
                    supported by two or more roots, each of which is implanted in a distinct
                    alveolar recess or socket, and to the apex of which a branch of the common pulp
                    cavity is continued (fig. 1, IV.). Such teeth are called “rooted teeth.” When
                    they have once attained their position in the jaw, with the neck a little way
                    above the level of the upper margin of the alveolus, and embraced by the gum or
                    tough fibro-vascular membrane which covers the alveolar border, and having the
                    root fully formed, they can never increase in length or alter their position. If
                    they appear to do so in old age it is only in consequence of absorption and
                    retrocession of the surrounding alveolar margins. If, as <pb
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n372/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0372-0351"/> often happens, their surface wears away in
                    mastication, it is never renewed. The open cavity at the base of the imperfectly
                    developed rooted tooth (fig. 1, II.) causes it to resemble the persistent
                    condition of the rootless tooth. The latter is therefore a more primitive
                    condition, the formation of the root being a completion of the process of tooth
                    development. Functionally it is, however, difficult to say that the one is a
                    higher form than the other, as they both serve important and different purposes
                    in the animal economy.</p>
                <p>As is almost always the case in nature, intermediate conditions between these two
                    forms of teeth are met with. Some, as the molars of the Horse, and of many
                    Rodents, are for a time rootless, and have growing pulps producing a very long
                    crown with parallel sides, the summit of which may be in use and beginning to
                    wear away while the base is still growing, but ultimately the pulp contracts,
                    forms a neck and distinct roots, and ceases to grow. The canine tusks of the
                    Musk Deer and of the Walrus have persistent pulps, and are open at their base
                    until the animal is of advanced age, when they close, and the pulp ceases to be
                    renewed.</p>
                <p>The simplest form of the crown of a tooth is that of a cone; but this may be
                    variously modified. It may be flattened, with its edges sharp and cutting, and
                    pointed at the apex, as in the laterally compressed premolars of most <hi
                    rend="italic">Carnivora,</hi> or it may be chisel-or awl-shaped, with a straight
                    truncated edge, as in the human incisors; or it may be broad, with a flat or
                    rounded upper surface. Very often there is a more or less prominent ridge
                    encircling the whole or part of the base of the crown just above the neck,
                    called the cingulum, which serves as a protection to the edge of the gum in
                    masticating, and is best developed in flesheating and insectivorous animals, in
                    which the gums are liable to be injured by splinters of bone or other hard
                    fragments of their food. The form of the crown is frequently rendered complex by
                    the development upon its surface of elevations or tubercles called cusps, or by
                    ridges usually transverse, but sometimes variously curved or folded. When the
                    crown is broad and the ridges greatly developed, as in the molars of the
                    Elephant, Horse, and Ox (fig. 1, V.), the interspaces between them are filled
                    with cementum, which supports them and makes a solid compact mass of the whole
                    tooth. When such a tooth wears away at the surface by friction against the
                    opposed tooth of the other jaw, the different density of the layers of the
                    substances of which it is composed—enamel, dentine, and cementum— arranged in
                    characteristic patterns, causes them to wear unequally, the hard enamel ridges
                    projecting beyond the others, thus giving rise to a grinding surface of great
                    mechanical advantage.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Succession of Teeth.—</hi> The dentition of all mammals
                    consists of a definite set of teeth almost always of constant and determinate
                    number, form, and situation, and, with few exceptions, persisting in a
                    functional condition throughout the natural term of the animal’s life. In many
                    species these are the only teeth which the animal ever possesses. —the set which
                    is first formed being permanent, or, if accidentally lost, or decaying in
                    extreme old age, not being replaced by others. These animals are called
                    Monophyodont. But, in the larger number of mammals, certain of the teeth are
                    preceded by others, which may be only of a very transient, rudimentary, and
                    functionless character (being in the Seals, for example, shed either before or
                    within u few days after birth), or may be considerably developed, and
                    functionally occupy the place of the permanent teeth for a somewhat lengthened
                    period, during the growth and development of the latter and of the jaws. In all
                    cases these teeth disappear (by the absorption of their roots and shedding of
                    the crowns) before the frame of the animal has acquired complete maturity as
                    evidenced by the coalescence of the epiphyses of the osseous system. As these
                    teeth are, as a general rule, present during the period in which the animal is
                    nourished by the milk of the mother, the name of “milk teeth” (French <hi
                    rend="italic">dents</hi><hi rend="italic">de lait,</hi> German <hi rend="italic"
                    >Milchzähne)</hi> has been commonly accorded to them, although it must be
                    understood that the epoch of their presence is by no means necessarily
                    synchronous with that of lactation·. Animals which possess such teeth are called
                    Diphyodont. No mammal is known to have more than two sets of teeth; and the
                    definite and orderly replacement of certain members of the series is a process
                    of quite a different nature from the indefinite succession which takes place in
                    all the teeth continuously throughout the lifetime of the lower vertebrates.</p>
                <p>When the milk teeth are well developed, and continue in place during the greater
                    part of the animal’s growth, as is especially the case with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ungulata,</hi> and, though to a less degree, with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Primates</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Carnivora,</hi> their use is
                    obvious, as taken all together they form structurally a complete epitome on a
                    small scale of the more numerous and larger permanent set (see fig. 3), and,
                    consequently, are able to perform the same functions, while time is allowed for
                    the gradual maturation of the latter, and especially while the jaws of the
                    growing animal are acquiring the size and strength sufficient to support the
                    permanent teeth. Those animals, therefore, that have a well-developed and
                    tolerably persistent set of milk teeth may be considered to be in a higher state
                    of development, <hi rend="italic">quoad</hi> dentition, than those that have the
                    milk teeth absent or rudimentary.</p>
                <p>It is a very general rule that individual teeth of the milk and permanent set
                    have a close relationship to one another, being originally formed, as mentioned
                    above, in exceedingly near proximity, and with, at all events as far as the
                    enamel germ is concerned, a direct connexion. Moreover, as the latter ultimately
                    come to occupy the position in the alveolar border temporarily held by the
                    former, they are spoken of respectively as the predecessors or successors of
                    each other. But it must be understood that milk teeth may be present which have
                    no successors in the permanent series, and, what is far more general, permanent
                    teeth may have no predecessors in the milk series.</p>
                <pb facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n373/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0373-0352"/>
                <p>The complete series of permanent teeth of most mammals forms a complex machine,
                    with its several parts adapted for different functions,—the most obvious
                    structural modification for this purpose being an increased complexity of the
                    individual components of the series from the anterior towards the posterior
                    extremity of such series. Since, as has just been said, the complete series of
                    the milk teeth often presents structurally and functionally a similar machine,
                    but composed of fewer individual members, and the anterior of which are as
                    simple, and the posterior as complex, as those occupying corresponding positions
                    in the permanent series,—and since the milk teeth are only developed in relation
                    to the anterior or lateral, never to the most posterior of the permanent
                    series,—it follows that the hinder milk teeth are usually more complex than the
                    teeth of which they are the predecessors in the permanent series, and represent
                    functionally, not their immediate successors, but those more posterior permanent
                    teeth which have no direct predecessors. This character is clearly seen in those
                    animals in which the various members of the molar series are well differentiated
                    from each other in form, as the <hi rend="italic">Carnivora,</hi> and also in
                    Man.</p>
                <p>In animals which have two sets of teeth the number of the teeth of the permanent
                    series which are preceded by milk teeth varies greatly, being sometimes, as in
                    Marsupials and some Rodents, as few as one on each side of each jaw, and
                    sometimes including the larger portion of the series.</p>
                <p>Although there are difficulties in some cases in arriving at a satisfactory
                    solution of the question, it is, on the whole, safest to assume that when only
                    one set of teeth is present, these correspond to the permanent teeth of the
                    Diphyodonts. When this one set is completely developed, and remains in use
                    throughout the animal’s life, there can be no question on this subject. When, on
                    the other hand, the teeth are rudimentary and transient, as in the Whalebone
                    Whales, it is possible to consider them as representing the milk series; but
                    there are weighty reasons in favour of the opposite conclusion.<note

                    rend="italic">General Arrangement, Homologies, and Notation of Teeth of
                    Mammals.—</hi> The teeth of the two sides of the jaws are always alike in number
                    and character, except in cases of accidental or abnormal variation, and in the
                    one remarkable instance of constant deviation from bilateral symmetry among
                    mammals, the tusks of the Narwhal (see fig. 49, p. 398), in which the left is of
                    immense size, and the right rudimentary. In those animals also, as the Dolphins
                    and some Armadillos, which have a very large series of similar teeth, not always
                    constant in number in different individuals, there may be differences in the two
                    sides; but, apart from these, in describing the dentition of any mammal, it is
                    quite sufficient to give the number and characters of the teeth of one side
                    only. As the teeth of the upper and the lower jaws work against each other in
                    masticating, there is a general correspondence or harmony between them, the
                    projections of one series, when the mouth is closed, fitting into corresponding
                    depressions of the other. There is also a general resemblance in the number,
                    characters, and mode of succession of both series, so that, although individual
                    teeth of the upper and lower jaws may not be in any strict sense of the term
                    homologous parts, there is a great convenience in applying the same descriptive
                    terms to the one which are used for the other.</p>
                <p>The simplest dentition as a whole is that of many species of Dolphin (fig. 2), in
                    which the crowns are single-pointed, slightly curved cones, and the roots also
                    single and tapering, and all alike in form from the anterior to the posterior
                    end of the series, though it may be with some slight difference in size, those
                    at the two extremities of the series being rather smaller than the others. Such
                    a dentition is called Homodont, and in the case cited, as the teeth are never
                    changed, it is also Monophyodont. Such teeth are adapted only for catching
                    slippery living prey, as fish.</p>
                <p>In a very large number of mammals the teeth of different parts of the series are
                    more or less differentiated in character, and have different functions to
                    perform. The front teeth are simple and one-rooted, and are adapted for cutting
                    and seizing. They are called “incisors.” The back teeth have broader and more
                    complex crowns, tuberculated or ridged, and they are supported on two or more
                    roots. They crush or grind the food, and are hence called “molars.” Many animals
                    have, between these two sets, a tooth at each corner of the mouth, longer and
                    more pointed than the others, adapted for tearing or stabbing, or for fixing
                    struggling prey. From the conspicuous development of such teeth in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Carnivora,</hi> especially the Dogs, they have received the name
                    of “canines.” A dentition with its component parts so differently formed that
                    these distinctive terms are applicable to them is called Heterodont. In most
                    cases, though by no means invariably, animals with Heterodont dentition are also
                    Diphyodont.</p>
                <p>This general arrangement is extremely obvious in a considerable number of
                    mammals; and closer examination shows that, under very great modifications in
                    detail, there is a remarkable uniformity of essential characters in the
                    dentition of a large number of members of the class belonging to different
                    orders and not otherwise closely allied, so much that it has been possible
                    (chiefly through the researches of Professor Owen) to formulate a common plan of
                    dentition from which the others have been derived by the alteration of some and
                    suppression of other members of the series, and occasionally, but very rarely,
                    by addition. The records of palaeontology fully confirm this view, as by tracing
                    back many groups now widely separated in dental characters we find a gradual
                    approximation to a common type. In this generalized form of mammalian dentition
                    (which is best exemplified in the genera <hi rend="italic">Λnoplotherium</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Homalodontotherium)</hi> the entire number of teeth
                    present is 44, or 11 above and 11 below on each side. Those of each jaw are
                    placed in continuous series without intervals between them; and, although the
                    anterior teeth are simple and single-rooted, and the posterior teeth complex and
                    with several roots, the transition between the two kinds is gradual.</p>
                <p>In dividing and grouping such teeth for the purpose of description and
                    comparison, more definite characters are required than those derived merely from
                    form or function. The first step towards a classification has been made by the
                    observation that the upper jaw is composed of two bones, the premaxilla and the
                    maxilla, and that the suture between these bones separates the <pb
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n374/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0374-0353"/> three anterior teeth from the others. These three
                    teeth then, which are implanted by their roots in the premaxilla, form a
                    distinct group, to which the name of “incisor” is applied. This distinction is,
                    however, not so important as it appears at first sight, for, as mentioned when
                    speaking of the development of the teeth, their connexion with the bone is only
                    of a secondary nature, and, although it happens conveniently for our purpose
                    that in the great majority of cases the segmentation of the bone coincides with
                    the interspace between the third and fourth tooth of the series, still, when it
                    does not happen to do so, as in the case of the Mole, we must not give too much
                    weight to this fact, if it contravenes other reasons for determining the
                    homologies of the teeth. The eight remaining teeth of the upper jaw offer a
                    natural division, inasmuch as the posterior three never have milk predecessors,
                    and, although some of the anterior teeth may be in the same case, the particular
                    one preceding these three always has such a predecessor. These three then are
                    grouped apart as the “molars,” or “true molars,” as some of the teeth in front
                    of them often have a molariform character. Of the five teeth between the
                    incisors and molars the most anterior, or that which is usually situated close
                    behind the premaxillary suture, almost always, as soon as any departure takes
                    place from the simplest and most homogeneous type, assumes a lengthened and
                    pointed form, and is the tooth so developed as to constitute the “canine” or
                    “laniary” tooth of the <hi rend="italic">Carnivora,</hi> the tusk of the Boar,
                    &amp;c. It is customary therefore to call this tooth, whatever its size or form,
                    the “canine.” The remaining four are the “premolars” or “false molars.” This
                    system of nomenclature has been objected to as being artificial, and in many
                    cases not descriptive, the distinction between premolars and canine especially
                    being sometimes not obvious, but the terms are now in such general use, and are
                    so practically convenient—especially if, as it is best to do in all such cases,
                    we forget their original signification, and treat them as arbitrary signs—that
                    it is not likely they will be superseded by any that have been proposed as
                    substitutes for them.</p>
                <p>With regard to the lower teeth the difficulties are greater, owing to the absence
                    of any suture corresponding to that which defines the incisors above; but, as
                    the number of the teeth is the same, as the corresponding teeth are preceded by
                    milk teeth, and as in the large majority of cases it is the fourth tooth of the
                    series which is modified in the same way as the canine (or fourth tooth) of the
                    upper jaw, it is quite reasonable to adopt the same divisions as with the upper
                    series, and to call the first three, which are implanted in the part of the
                    mandible opposite to the premaxilla, the incisors, the next the canine, the next
                    four the premolars, and the last three the molars. It may be observed that when
                    the mouth is closed, especially when the opposed surfaces of the teeth present
                    an irregular outline, the corresponding upper and lower teeth are not exactly
                    opposite, otherwise the two series could not fit into one another, but as a rule
                    the points of the lower teeth shut into the interspaces in front of the
                    corresponding teeth of the upper jaw. This is seen very distinctly in the canine
                    teeth of the <hi rend="italic">Carnivora,</hi> and is a useful guide in
                    determining the homologies of the teeth of the two jaws. Objections have
                    certainly been made to this view, because, in certain rare cases, the tooth
                    which, according to it, would be called the lower canine has the form and
                    function of an incisor (as in Ruminants and Lemurs), and on the other hand (as
                    in <hi rend="italic">Oreodon,</hi> an extinct Ungulate from North America) the
                    tooth that would thus be determined as the first premolar has the form of a
                    canine; but it should not be forgotten that, as in all such cases, definitions
                    derived from form and function alone are quite as open to objection as those
                    derived from position and relation to surrounding parts, or still more so.</p>
                <p>For the sake of brevity the complete dentition, arranged according to these
                    principles, is often described by the following formula, the numbers above the
                    line representing the teeth of the upper, those below the line those of the
                    lower jaw: — incisors ∣∈∣, canines ∣∈∣, premolars *~*, molars ∣∈∣ = ⅛≡Γι &gt;
                    <hi rend="superscript"> tota</hi> l 44. ∙^- <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> &gt;
                    however, initial letters may be substituted for the names of each group, and it
                    is quite unnecessary to give more than the numbers of the teeth on one side of
                    the mouth, the formula may be conveniently abbreviated into—</p>
                <p>*⅜&gt; <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> T» <hi rend="italic">P</hi> τ&gt; <hi
                    rend="superscript"> m</hi> I <hi rend="superscript"> =</hi> ⅛ι &gt; t°t <hi
                    rend="superscript"> a</hi> l 44.</p>
                <p>The individual teeth of each group are always enumerated from before backwards,
                    and by such a formula as the following—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic"> i</hi> 1, <hi rend="italic"> i</hi> 2, <hi rend="italic"> i 3,

                    ml, m2, m3</hi> a special numerical designation is given by which each one can
                    be indicated. In mentioning any single tooth, such a sign as — will mean the
                    first upper molar, <hi rend="subscript"> m</hi> ’ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    the first lower molar, and so on. The use of such signs saves much time and
                    space in description.</p>
                <p>It was part of the view of the founder of this system of dental notation that, at
                    least throughout the group of mammals whose dentition is derived from this
                    general type, each tooth has its strict homologue in all species, and that in
                    those cases in which fewer than the typical fιumber are present (as in all
                    existing mammals except the genera <hi rend="italic">Sus, Gymnura, Talpa,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Myogale)</hi> the teeth that are missing can be accurately
                    defined. According to this view, when the number of incisors falls short of
                    three it is assumed that the absent ones are missing from the outer and
                    posterior end of the series. Thus when there is but one incisor present, it is
                    <hi rend="italic">i</hi> 1; when two, they are <hi rend="italic">i</hi> 1 and
                    <hi rend="italic">i 2.</hi> Furthermore, when the premolars and the molars are
                    below their typical number, the absent teeth are missing from the fore part of
                    the premolar series, and from the back part of the molar series. If this were
                    invariably so, the labours of those who describe teeth would be greatly
                    simplified; but there are unfortunately so many exceptions that a close scrutiny
                    into the <pb facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n375/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0375-0354"/> situation, relations, and development of a tooth
                    may be required before its nature can be determined, and in some cases the
                    evidence at our disposal is scarcely sufficient for the purpose.</p>
                <p>The milk dentition is expressed by a similar formula, <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    for deciduous being commonly added before the letter expressive of the nature of
                    the tooth. As the three molars and (almost invariably<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">IIyrax</hi> alone among
                    existing mammals which have four premolars has also four milk
                    molars.</p></note>) the first premolar of the permanent series have no
                    predecessors, the typical milk dentition would be expressed as follows— <hi
                    rend="italic">di ⅜, de ⅜, dm</hi> f = {∙ = 28. The teeth which precede the
                    premolars of the permanent series are all called molars in the milk dentition,
                    although, as a general rule, in form and function they represent in a condensed
                    form the whole premolar and molar series of the adult. When there is a marked
                    difference between the premolars and molars of the permanent dentition, the
                    first milk molar resembles a premolar, and the last has the characters of the
                    posterior true molar.</p>
                <p>The dentition of all the animals of the orders <hi rend="italic">Primates,
                    Carnivora, Insectivora, Chiroptera,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ungulata</hi> can
                    clearly be derived from the above-described generalized type. The same may be
                    said of the Rodents, and even the <hi rend="italic">Proboscidea,</hi> though
                    with greater modification, at least in the existing members of the order. It is
                    also apparent in certain extinct Cetaceans, as <hi rend="italic">Zeuglodon</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Squalodon,</hi> but it is difficult to find any traces of
                    it in existing <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sirenia,</hi> or
                    any of the so-called <hi rend="italic">Edentata.</hi> All the Marsupials,
                    different as they are in their general structure and mode of life, and variously
                    modified as is their dentition, present in this system of organs some deep-lying
                    common characters which show their unity of origin. The genêralized type to
                    which their dentition can be reduced presents considerable resemblance to that
                    of the placental mammals, yet differing in details. It is markedly heterodont,
                    and susceptible of division into incisors, canines, premolars, and molars upon
                    the same principles. The whole number is, however, not limited to forty-four.
                    The incisors may be as numerous as five on each side, and are almost always
                    different in number in the upper and the lower jaw. The premolars and molars are
                    commonly seven, as in the placental mammals, but their arrangement is reversed,
                    as there are four true molars and three premolars; and finally the milk
                    dentition of all known Marsupials, existing or extinct, is (if not entirely
                    absent) limited to a single tooth on each side of each jaw, this being the
                    predecessor of the last permanent premolar.</p>
                <p>In very few mammals are teeth entirely absent. Even in the Whalebone Whales their
                    germs are formed in the same manner and at the same period of life as in other
                    mammals, and even become partially calcified, but they never rise above the
                    gums, and completely disappear before the birth of the animal. In soine species
                    of the order <hi rend="italic">Edentata,</hi> the true Anteaters and the
                    Pangolins, no traces of teeth have been found at any age. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monotremata</hi> are in like case, although the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ornithorhynchus</hi> has flattened, ridged, horny plates at the back of both
                    jaws, which answer the purpose of molar teeth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Modifications of the Teeth in Relation to their Functions.</hi>
                    —The principal functional modifications noticed in the dentition of <hi
                    rend="italic">Mammalia</hi> may be roughly grouped as (1) piscivorous, (2)
                    carnivorous, (3) insectivorous, (4) omnivorous, and (5) herbivorous, each
                    having, of course, numerous variations and transitional conditions.</p>
                <p>1. The essential characters of a piscivorous dentition are best exemplified in
                    the Dolphins, and also (as modifications of the carnivorous type) in the Seals.
                    It consists of an elongated, rather narrow mouth, wide gape, with numerous
                    subequal, conical, sharp-pointed, recurved teeth adapted simply to rapidly
                    seize, but not to divide or masticate, active, slippery, but not powerful prey.
                    All animals which feed on fish as a rule swallow and digest them entire, a
                    process which the structure of prey of this nature, especially the intimate
                    interblending of delicate, sharp-pointed bones with the muscles, renders very
                    advantageous, and for which the above-described type of dentition is best
                    adapted.</p>
                <p>2. The carnivorous type of dentition is shown in its most perfect development
                    among existing mammals in the. <hi rend="italic">Felidae.</hi> The function
                    being here to seize and kill struggling animals, often of large size and great
                    muscular power, the canines are immensely developed, trenchant, and piercing,
                    and are situated wide apart so as to give the firmest hold when fixed in the
                    victim’s body. The jaws are as short as is consistent with the free action of
                    the canines, so that no power may be lost. The incisors are very small, so as
                    not to interfere with the penetrating action of the canines, and the crowns of
                    the molar series are reduced to scissor-like blades, with which to pare off the
                    soft tissues from, the large bones, or to divide into small pieces the less
                    dense portions of the bone for the sake of nutriment afforded by the blood and
                    marrow it contains. The gradual modification between this and the two following
                    types will be noticed in their appropriate places.</p>
                <p>3. In the most typical insectivorous animals, as the Hedgehogs and Shrews, the
                    central incisors are elongated, pointed, and project forwards, those of the
                    upper and lower jaw meeting like the blades of a pair of forceps, so as readily
                    to secure small active prey, quick to elude capture, but powerless to resist
                    when once seized. The crowns of the molars are covered with numerous sharp edges
                    and points, which working against each other, rapidly cut up the hard cased
                    insects into little pieces, fit for swallowing and digestion.</p>
                <p>4. The omnivorpus type, especially that adapted for the consumption of soft
                    vegetable substances, such as fruits of various kinds, may be exemplified in the
                    dentition of Man, of most Monkeys, and of the less modified Pigs. The incisors
                    are moderate, subequal, and cutting. If the canines are enlarged, it is usually
                    for other purposes than those connected with food, and only in the male sex. The
                    molars have their crowns broad, flattened, and elevated into rounded
                    tubercles.</p>
                <p>5. In the most typically herbivorous forms of dentition, as seen in the Horse and
                    Kangaroo, the incisors are well developed and trenchant, adapted for cutting off
                    the herbage on which the animals feed; the canines are rudimentary or
                    suppressed; the molars are large, with broad crowns, which in the simplest forms
                    have strong transverse ridges, but may become variously complicated in the
                    higher degrees of modification which this type of tooth assumes.</p>
                <p>The natural groups of mammals, or those which in our present state of knowledge
                    we have reason to believe are truly related to each other, may each contain
                    examples of more than one of these modifications. Thus the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Primates</hi> have both omnivorous and insectivorous forms. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> show piscivorous, carnivorous, insectivorous, and
                    omnivorous modifications of their common type of dentition. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Ungulata</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Rodentia</hi> have among
                    them the omnivorous and various modifications, both simple and complex, of the
                    herbivorous type. The <hi rend="italic">Marsupialia</hi> exhibit examples of all
                    forms, except the purely piscivorous. Other orders, more restricted in number or
                    in habits, as the <hi rend="italic">Proboscidea</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cetacea,</hi> naturally do not show so great a variety in the dental structure
                    of their members.</p>
                <p>In considering the taxonomic value to be assigned to <pb
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n376/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0376-0355"/> the modifications of teeth of mammals, two
                    principles, often opposed to each other, which have been at work in producing
                    these modifications, must be held in view :—(1) the type, or ancestral form, as
                    we generally now call it, characteristic of each group, which in most mammals is
                    itself derived from the still more generalized type described above; and (2)
                    variations which have taken place from this type, generally in accordance with
                    special functions which the teeth are called upon to fulfil in particular cases.
                    These variations are sometimes so great as completely to mask the primitive
                    type, and in this way the dentition of many animals of widely different origin
                    has come to present a remarkable superficial resemblance, as in the case of the
                    Wombat (a Marsupial), the Aye-Aye (a Lemur), and the Rodents, or as in the case
                    of the Thylacine and the Dog. In all these examples indications may generally be
                    found of the true nature of the case by examining the earlier conditions of
                    dentition; for the characters of the milk teeth or the presence of rudimentary
                    or deciduous members of the permanent set will generally indicate the route by
                    which the specialized dentition of the adult has been derived. It is perhaps
                    owing to the importance of the dental armature to the well-being of the animal
                    in procuring its sustenance, and preserving its life from the attacks of
                    enemies, that great changes appear to have taken place so readily, and with such
                    comparative rapidity, in the form of these organs, changes often accompanied
                    with but little modification in the general structure of the animal. Of this
                    proposition the Aye-Aye <hi rend="italic">(Chiromys)</hi> among Lemurs, the
                    Walrus among Seals, and the Narwhal among Dolphins form striking examples; as,
                    in all, the superficial characters of their dentition would entirely separate
                    them from the animals with which all other evidence (even including the mode of
                    development of their teeth) proves their close affinity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Skeleton.</hi></p>
                <p>The skeleton is a system of hard parts, forming a framework which supports and
                    protects the softer organs and tissues of the body. It consists of dense fibrous
                    and cartilaginous tissues, of which portions remain through life in this state,
                    but the greater part is transformed during the growth of the animal into bone or
                    osseous tissue. This is characterized by a peculiar histological structure and
                    chemical composition, being formed mainly of a gelatinous basis, strongly
                    impregnated with salts of lime, chiefly phosphate, and disposed in a definite
                    manner, containing numerous minute nucleated spaces or cavities called lacunae,
                    connected together by delicate channels or canaliculi, which radiate in all
                    directions from the sides of the lacunae. Parts composed of bone are, next to
                    the teeth, the most imperishable of all the organs of the body, often retaining
                    their exact form and internal structure for ages after every trace of all other
                    portions of the organization has completely disappeared, and thus, in the case
                    of extinct animals, affording the only means of attaining a knowledge of their
                    characters and affinities.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>In the Armadillos and their extinct allies alone is an ossified exoskeleton, or
                    bony covering developed in the skin, present. In all other mammals the skeleton
                    is completely internal. It may be described as consisting of an axial portion
                    belonging to the head and trunk, and an appendicular portion belonging to the
                    limbs. There are also certain bones called splanchnic, being developed within
                    the substance of some of the viscera. Such are the <hi rend="italic">os
                    cordis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">os penis</hi> found in some mammals.</p>
                <p>It is characteristic of all the larger bones of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mammalia,</hi> that their ossification takes its origin from several distinct
                    centres. One near the middle of the bone, and spreading throughout its greater
                    portion, constitutes the <hi rend="italic">diaphysis,</hi> or “shaft,” in the
                    case of the long bones. Others near the extremities, or in projecting parts,
                    form the <hi rend="italic">epiphyses,</hi> which remain distinct during growth,
                    but ultimately coalesce with the rest of the bone.</p>
                <p>The axial skeleton consists of the skull, the vertebral column (prolonged at the
                    posterior extremity into the tail), the sternum, and the ribs.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">skull</hi> of adult mammals, all the bones, except the
                    lower jaw, the auditory ossicles, and the bones of the hyoid arch, are immovably
                    articulated together, their edges being in close contact, often interlocking by
                    means of fine denticulations projecting from one bone and fitting into
                    corresponding depressions of the other, and held together by the periosteum, or
                    fibrous membrane investing the bones, passing directly from one to the other,
                    permitting no motion, beyond perhaps a slight yielding to external pressure. In
                    old animals there is a great tendency for the different bones to become actually
                    united by the extension of ossification from one to the other, with consequent
                    obliteration of the sutures. The cranium, thus formed of numerous originally
                    independent ossifications, retaining through life more or less of their
                    individuality, or all fused together, according to the species, the age, or even
                    individual peculiarity, consists of a brain case, or bony capsule for enclosing
                    and protecting the brain, and a face for the support of the organs of sight,
                    smell, and taste and of those concerned in seizing and masticating the food. The
                    brain case articulates directly with the anterior cervical vertebra, by means of
                    a pair of oval eminences, called condyles, placed on each side of the large
                    median foramen which transmits <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0377-0356"/> the spinal cord. It consists of a basal axis,
                    continuous serially with the axes or centra of the vertebrae, and of an arch
                    above, roofing over and enclosing the cavity which contains the cephalic portion
                    of the central nervous system (see fig. 4). The base with its arch is composed
                    of three segments placed one before the other, each of which is comparable to a
                    vertebra with a greatly expanded neural arch. The hinder or occipital segment
                    consists of the basi-occipitâl, ex-occipital, and supra-occipital bones; the
                    middle segment of the basi-sphenoid, ali-sphenoid, and parietal bones; and the
                    anterior segment of the presphenoid, orbito-sphenoid, and frontal bones. The
                    axis is continued forwards into the mesethmoid, or septum of the nose, around
                    which the bones of the face are arranged in a manner so extremely modified for
                    their special purposes that anatomists who have attempted to trace their serial
                    homologies with the more simple portions of the axial skeleton have arrived at
                    very diverse interpretations. The characteristic form and structure of the face
                    of mammals is mainly dependent upon the size and shape of (1) the orbits, a pair
                    of cup-shaped cavities for containing the eyeball and its muscles, which may be
                    directed forwards or laterally, placed near together or wide apart, and may be
                    completely or only partially encircled by bone; (2) the nasal fossae, cavities
                    on each side of the median nasal septum, and forming the passage for the air to
                    pass between the external and the internal nares, and containing in their upper
                    part the organ of smell; (3) the zygomatic arch,, a bridge of bone for the
                    purpose of muscular attachment, which extends from the side of the face to the
                    skull, overarching the temporal fossa; (4) the roof of the mouth, with its
                    alveolar margin for the implantation of the upper teeth. The face is completed
                    by the mandible, or lower jaw, consisting of two lateral rami, articulated by a
                    hinge joint with the squamosal (a cranial bone interposed between the posterior
                    and penultimate segment of the brain case, where also the bony capsule of the
                    organ of hearing is placed), each being composed of a single solid piece of
                    bone, and united together in the middle line in front, at the symphysis,—which
                    union may be permanently ligamentous or become completely ossified. Into the
                    upper border of the mandibular rami the lower teeth are implanted.</p>
                <p>In only those species in which the brain holds a large relative proportion to the
                    rest of the body, as in Man and the smaller species of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Primates</hi> and some other orders, does the external form of the skull
                    receive much impress from the real shape of the cavity containing the brain. The
                    size and form of the mouth, and the modifications of the jaws for the support of
                    teeth of various shape and number, the ridges and crests on the cranium for the
                    attachment of the muscles necessary to put this apparatus in motion, outgrowths
                    of bone for the enlargement of the external surface required for the support of
                    sense organs or of weapons, such as horns or antlers (which outgrowths, to
                    prevent undue increase of weight, are filled with cells containing air), cause
                    the principal variations in the general configuration of the skull. These
                    variations are, however, only characteristically developed in perfectly adult
                    animals, and are in many cases more strongly marked in the male than the female
                    sex. Throughout all the later stages of growth up to maturity the size and form
                    of the brain case remain comparatively stationary, while the accessory parts of
                    the skull rapidly increase and take on their distinctive development
                    characteristic of the species.</p>
                <p>The hyoidean apparatus in mammals supports the tongue and larynx, and consists of
                    a median portion below, the basi-hyal, from which two pairs of half arches, or
                    cornua, extend upwards and outwards. The anterior is the most important, being
                    connected with the periotic bone of the cranium. It may be almost entirely
                    ligamentous, but more often has several ossifications, the largest of which is
                    usually the stylo-hyal. The posterior cornu (thyro-hyal) is united at its
                    extremity with the thyroid cartilage of the larynx, which it suspends in
                    position. The median portion, or basi-hyal, is sometimes, as in the Howling
                    Monkeys, enormously enlarged and hollowed, admitting into its cavity an air-sac
                    connected with the organ of voice.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">vertebral column</hi> consists of a series of distinct
                    bones called vertebrae, arranged in close connexion with each other along the
                    dorsal side of the neck and trunk, and in the median line.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For the sake of uniformity, in all the
                    following descriptions of the vertebral column, the long axis of the body is
                    supposed to be in the horizontal position.</p></note> It is generally prolonged
                    posteriorly beyond the trunk, to form the axial support of the appendage called
                    the tail. Anteriorly it is articulated with the occipital region of the skull.
                    The number of distinct bones of which the vertebral column is composed varies
                    greatly among the <hi rend="italic">Mammalia,</hi> the main variation being due
                    to the elongation or otherwise of the tail. Apart from this, in most mammals the
                    number is not far from thirty, though it may fall as low as twenty-six (as in
                    some Bats), or rise as high as forty <hi rend="italic">{IIyrax</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Choloepus').</hi> The different vertebrae, with some exceptions,
                    remain through life quite distinct from each other, though closely connected by
                    means of fibrous structures which allow of a certain, but limited, amount of
                    motion between them. The exceptions are the following :—near the posterior part
                    of the trunk, in nearly all mammals which possess completely developed hinder
                    limbs, two or more vertebrae become ankylosed together to form the “sacrum,” the
                    portion of the vertebral column to which the pelvic girdle is attached; also, in
                    certain species of Whales and of Armadillos, there are constant ossifie unions
                    of certain vertebrae of the cervical region.</p>
                <p>Although the vertebrae of different regions of the column of the same animal or
                    of different animals present great diversities of form, there is a certain
                    general resemblance among them, or a common plan on which they are constructed,
                    which is more or less modified by alteration of form or proportions, or by the
                    addition or suppression of parts to fit them to fulfil their special purpose in
                    the economy. An ordinary or typical vertebra consists in the first place of a
                    solid piece of bone, the body or centrum (fig. 5, c), of the form of a disk or
                    short cylinder. The bodies of contiguous vertebrae are connected together by a
                    very dense, tough, and elastic material called the “intervertebral substance,”
                    of peculiar and complex arrangement. This substance forms the main, and in some
                    cases the only,, union between the vertebrae. Its elasticity provides for the
                    vertebrae always returning to their normal relation to each other and to the
                    column generally, when they have been disturbed therefrom by muscular action. A
                    process (p) arises on each side from the dorsal surface of the body. These,
                    meeting in the middle line above, form together an arch, surmounting a space or
                    short canal <hi rend="italic">(nc).</hi> As in this space lies the posterior
                    prolongation of the great cerebrospinal nervous axis, or spinal cord, it is
                    called the neural canal, and the arch is called the neural arch, in
                    contradistinction to another arch on the ventral surface of the <pb
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n378/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0378-0357"/> body of the vertebra, called tlιe haemal arch.
                    The last is, however, never formed in mammals by any part of the vertebra
                    itself, but only by certain distinct bones placed more or less in apposition to
                    it—the ribs in the thoracic, and the “chevron bones” in the caudal region. In
                    most cases the arch of one vertebra is articulated with that of the next by
                    distinct surfaces with synovial joints, placed one on each side, called
                    “zygapophyses” (2), but these are often entirely wanting when flexibility is
                    more needed than strength, as in the greater part of the caudal region of
                    long-tailed animals. In addition to the body and the arch, there are certain
                    projecting parts called processes, chiefly serving for the attachment of the
                    numerous muscles which move the vertebral column. Of these two are single and
                    median,—the spinous process or neural spine, or neurapophysis (⅛∙), arising from
                    the middle of the upper part of the arch, and the hypapophysis from the under
                    surface of the body. This, however, is as frequently absent as the former is
                    constant. The other processes are paired and lateral. They are transverse
                    processes <hi rend="italic">(t),</hi> of which there may be two, an upper and a
                    lower, in which case the former is called, in the language of Owen (to whom we
                    are indebted for the terminology of the parts of vertebrae in common use),
                    “diapophysis,” and the latter “parapophysis.” Other processes less constantly
                    present are called respectively “metapophyses” (τn) and “anapophyses” (a).</p>
                <p>The vertebral column is divided for convenience of description into five regions,
                    the cervical, thoracic or dorsal, lumbar, sacral, and caudal. This division is
                    useful, especially as it is not entirely arbitrary, and in most cases is capable
                    of ready definition; but at the contiguous extremities of the regions the
                    characters of the vertebrae of one are apt to blend into those of the next
                    region, either normally or as peculiarities of individual skeletons.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">cervical</hi> region constitutes the most anterior portion
                    of the column, or that which joins the cranium. The vertebrae which belong to it
                    are either entirely destitute of movable ribs, or if they have any these are
                    small, and do not join the sternum. As a general rule they have a considerable
                    perforation through the base of the transverse process (the vertebrarterial
                    canal (fig. 7, t), or, as it is sometimes described, they have two transverse
                    processes, superior and inferior, which, meeting at their extremities, enclose a
                    canal. This, however, rarely applies to the last vertebra of the region, in
                    which only the upper transverse process is usually developed. The transverse
                    process, moreover, very often sends down near its extremity a more or less
                    compressed plate (inferior lamella), which, being considered to be serially
                    homologous with the ribs of the thoracic vertebrae (though not developed
                    autogenously), is often called the “costal” or “pleurapophysial” plate. This is
                    usually largest on the sixth, and altogether wanting on the seventh vertebra.
                    The first and second cervical vertebrae, called respectively “atlas” and “axis,”
                    are specially modified for the function of supporting and permitting the free
                    movements of the head. They are not united together by the intervertebral
                    substance, but connected only by ordinary ligaments and synovial joints.</p>
                <p>The cervical region in mammals presents the remarkable peculiarity that, whatever
                    the length or flexibility of the neck, the number of vertebrae is the same,
                    viz., seven, with only three known exceptions, the Manatee and Hoffman’s
                    Two-toed Sloth <hi rend="italic">(Choloepus</hi><hi rend="italic">ho</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ff</hi><hi rend="italic">manni),</hi> which both have but six, and
                    the Three-toed Sloth <hi rend="italic">(Bradypus tridactylus),</hi> which has
                    nine, though in this case the last two usually support movable ribs, though not
                    sufficiently developed to reach the sternum.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">dorsal</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">thoracic,</hi> as it
                    would be more correctly termed) region consists of the vertebrae which succeed
                    those of the neck, having ribs movably articulated to them. These ribs arch
                    round the thorax,—the anterior one, and most usually the greater number of those
                    that follow, being attached below to the sternum.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">lumbar</hi> region consists of those vertebrae of the trunk
                    in front of the sacrum which bear no movable ribs. It may happen that, as the
                    ribs decrease in size posteriorly, the last being sometimes more or less
                    rudimentary, the step from the thoracic to the lumbar region may be gradual and
                    rather undetermined in a given species. But most commonly this is not the case,
                    and the distinction is as well defined here as in any other region. As a general
                    rule there is a certain relation between the number of the thoracic and lumbar
                    vertebrae, the whole number being tolerably constant in a given group of
                    animals, and any increase of the one being at the expense of the other. Thus in
                    all known Artiodactyle <hi rend="italic">Ungulata</hi> there are 19 dorso-lumbar
                    vertebrae; but these may consist of 12 dorsal and 7 lumbar vertebrae, or 13
                    dorsal and 6 lumbar, or 14 dorsal and 5 lumbar. The smallest number of
                    dorso-lumbar vertebrae in mammals occurs in some Armadillos, which have but 14.
                    The number found in Man, the higher Apes, and most Bats, viz., 17, is
                    exceptionally low 19 prevails in the Artiodactyles, nearly all Marsupials, and
                    very many Rodents; 20 or 21 in <hi rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> and most <hi
                    rend="italic">Insectivora;</hi> and 23 in <hi rend="italic">Perissodactyla.</hi>
                    The highest and quite exceptional numbers are in the Two-toed Sloth <hi
                    rend="italic">(Choloepus)</hi> 27, and the Hyrax 30. The prevailing number of
                    rib-bearing vertebrae is 12 or 13, any variation being generally in excess of
                    these numbers.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sacral</hi> region offers more difficulties of definition.
                    Taking the human “os sacrum” for a guide for comparison, it is generally defined
                    as consisting of those vertebrae between the lumbar and caudal regions which are
                    ankylosed together to form a single bone. It happens, however, that the number
                    of such vertebrae varies in different individuals of the same or nearly allied
                    species, especially as age advances, when a certain number of the tail vertebrae
                    generally become incorporated with the true sacrum. Other suggested-tests, as
                    those vertebrae which have a distinct additional (pleurapophysial) centre of
                    ossification between the body and the ilium, those to which the ilium is
                    directly articulated, or those in front of the insertion of the ischio-sacral
                    ligaments, being equally unsatisfactory or unpractical, the old one of
                    ankylosis, as it is found to prevail in the average condition of adults in each
                    species, is used in the enumeration of the vertebrae in the following pages. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> having no iliac bones, have no part of the
                    vertebral column modified into a sacrum.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">caudal</hi> vertebrae are those placed behind the sacrum,
                    and terminating the vertebral column. They vary in number greatly,—being reduced
                    to 5, 4, or even 3, in a most rudimentary condition, in Man and in some Apes and
                    Bats, and being numerous and powerfully developed, with strong and complex
                    processes, in many mammals, especially among the <hi rend="italic">Edentata,

                    African Long-tailed Manis. Connected with the under surface of the caudal
                    vertebrae of many mammals which have the tail well developed are certain bones
                    formed more or less like an inverted arch, called chevron bones, or by the
                    French <hi rend="italic">os en</hi><hi rend="italic">V.</hi> These are always
                    situated nearly opposite to an intervertebral space, and are generally
                    articulated both to the vertebra in front and the vertebra behind, but sometimes
                    chiefly or entirely either to one or the other.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sternum</hi> of mam mals is a bone, or generally a series
                    of bones, placed longitudinally in the mesial line, on the inferior or ventral
                    aspect of the thorax, and connected on each side with the vertebral column by a
                    series of more or less ossified bars called “ribs.” It is present in all
                    mammals, but varies much in character in the different groups. It usually
                    consists of a series of distinct segments placed one before the other, the
                    anterior being called the presternum or “manubrium sterni” of human anatomy, and
                    the posterior the xiphisternum, or xiphioid or ensiform process, while the
                    intermediate segments, whatever their number, constitute the mesosternum or
                    “body.” In the Whalebone Whales the presternum alone is developed, and but a
                    single pair of ribs is attached to it.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">ribs</hi> form a series of long, narrow, and more or less
                    flattened bones, extending laterally from the sides of the vertebral column,
                    curving downwards towards the median line of the body below, and mostly joining
                    the sides of the sternum. The posterior ribs, however, do not directly
                    articulate with that bone, but are either attached by their extremities to the
                    edges of each rib in front of them, and thus only indirectly join the sternum,
                    or else they are quite free below, meeting·no part of the skeleton. These
                    differences have given rise to the division into “true” and “false” ribs (by no
                    means good expressions), signifying those that join the sternum directly and
                    those that do not; and of the latter, those that are free below are called
                    “floating” ribs. The portion of each rib nearest the vertebral column and that
                    nearest the sternum differ in their characters, the latter being usually but
                    imperfectly ossified, or remaining permanently cartilaginous. These are called
                    “costal cartilages,” or when ossified “sternal ribs.”</p>
                <p>In the anterior part of the thorax the vertebral extremity of each rib is divided
                    into two parts, “bead” and “tubercle”; the former is attached to the side of the
                    body of the vertebra, the latter to its transverse process; the former
                    attachment corresponds to the interspace between the vertebrae, the head of the
                    rib commonly articulating partly with the hinder edge of the body of the
                    vertebra antecedent to that which bears its tubercle. Hence tho body of the last
                    cervical vertebra usually supports part of the head of the first rib.</p>
                <p>In the posterior part of the series the capitular and tubercular attachments
                    commonly coalesce, and the rib is attached solely to its corresponding vertebra.
                    The number of pairs of ribs is of course the same as that of the thoracic
                    vertebrae.</p>
                <p>The appendicular portion of the framework consists, when completely developed, of
                    two pairs of limbs, anterior and posterior.</p>
                <p>The anterior limb is present and fully developed in all mammals, being composed
                    of a shoulder girdle and three segments belonging to the limb proper, viz., the
                    upper arm or brachium, the fore-arm or antibrachium, and the hand or manus.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">shoulder girdle</hi> in the large majority of mammals is in
                    a rudimentary or rather modified condition, compared to that in which it exists
                    in other vertebrates. In the <hi rend="italic">Monotremata</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ornithorhynchus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Echidna')</hi> alone is the ventral
                    portion, or coracoid, complete and articulates with the sternum below, as in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Sauropsida.</hi> In all other mammals this portion, though
                    ossified from a distinct centre, forms only a process, sometimes a scarcely
                    distinct tubercle, projecting from the anterior border of the glenoid cavity of
                    the scapula. The last-named bone is always well developed, generally broad and
                    flat (whence its vernacular name “blade bone ”), with a ridge called the “spine”
                    on its outer surface, generally ending in a free curved process, the “acromion.”
                    As the scapula affords attachment to many of the muscles which act upon the
                    anterior limb, its form and the development of its processes are greatly
                    modified according to the uses to which the member is put. It is most reduced
                    and simple in character in those animals whose limbs are mere organs of support,
                    as the Ungulates, and most complex when they are also used for grasping,
                    climbing, or digging. The development or absence of the clavicle or
                    “collar-bone,” an accessory bar which connects the sternum with the scapula and
                    steadies the shoulderjoint, has a somewhat similar relation, though its complete
                    absence in the Bears shows that this is not an invariable rule. A complete
                    clavicle is found in Man and all the <hi rend="italic">Primates,</hi> in <hi

                    side, articulating with the humerus at their proximal, and with the carpus at
                    their distal extremity. In their primitive and unmodified condition these bones
                    may be considered as placed one on each border of the limb, the radius being
                    preaxial or anterior, and the ulna postaxial or posterior, when the distal or
                    free end of the limb is directed outwards or away from the trunk. This is their
                    position in the earliest embryonic condition, and is best illustrated in adult
                    mammals in the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> where the two bones are fixed
                    side by side and parallel to each other. In the greater number of mammals the
                    bones assume a very modified and adaptive position, usually crossing each other
                    in the forearm, the radius in front of the ulna, so that the preaxial bone
                    (radius), though external (in the ordinary position of the limb) at the upper
                    end, is internal at the lower end; and the hand, being mainly fixed to the
                    radius, also has its preaxial border internal. In the large majority of mammals
                    the bones are fixed in this position, but in some few, as in Man, a free
                    movement of crossing and uncrossing—or pronation and supination, as it is
                    termed—is allowed between them, so that they can be placed in their primitive
                    parallel condition, when the hand (which moves with the radius) is said to be
                    supine, or they may be crossed, when the hand is said to be prone.</p>
                <p>In most mammals which walk on four limbs, and in which the hand is permanently
                    prone, the ulna is much reduced in size, and the radius increased, especially at
                    the upper end; and the articular surface of the latter, instead of being
                    confined to the external side of the trochlea of the humerus, extends all across
                    its anterior surface, and the two bones, instead of being external and internal,
                    are anterior and posterior. In many hoofed or ungulated mammals, and in Bats,
                    the ulna is reduced to little more than its upper articular extremity, and
                    firmly ankylosed to the radius,—stability of these parts being more essential
                    than mobility.</p>
                <p>The terminal segment of the anterior limb is the hand or manus. Its skeleton
                    consists of three divisions :—(1) the “carpus,” a group of small, more or less
                    rounded or angular bones with flattened surfaces applied to one another, and,
                    though articulating by synovial joints, having scarcely any motion between them;
                    (2) the “metacarpus,” a series of elongated bones placed side by side, with
                    their proximal ends articulating by almost immovable joints with the carpus;</p>
                <p>(3) the “phalanges” or bones of the digits, usually three in number to each,
                    articulating to one another by freely movable hingejoints, the first being
                    connected in like manner to the distal end of the corresponding metacarpal
                    bone.</p>
                <p>To understand thoroughly the arrangement of the bones of the carpus in mammals,
                    it is necessary to study their condition in some of the lower vertebrates. Fig.

                    The upper or proximal row contains three bones, to which Gegenbaur has applied
                    the terms <hi rend="italic">radiale</hi> (r), <hi rend="italic"
                    >intermedium,</hi> (t), and <hi rend="italic">ulnare</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(u),</hi> the first being on the radial or preaxial side of the limb. The lower
                    or distal row contains five bones, called <hi rend="italic">carpale</hi> 1, 2,
                    3, 4, and <hi rend="italic">5</hi> respectively, commencing on the radial side’
                    Between these two rows, in the middle of the carpus, is a single bone, the <hi
                    rend="italic">centrale</hi> (c). In this very symmetrical carpus it will be
                    observed that the <hi rend="italic">radiale</hi> supports on its distal side two
                    bones, <hi rend="italic">carpale</hi> 1 and 2; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >intermedium</hi> is in a lino with the <hi rend="italic">centrale</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">carpale</hi> 3, which together form a median axis of the hand,
                    while the <hi rend="italic">ulnare</hi> has also two bones articulated with its
                    distal end, viz., <hi rend="italic">carpale</hi> 4 and 5. Each of the carpals of
                    the distal row supports a metacarpal.</p>
                <p>In the carpus of the <hi rend="italic">Mammalia</hi> there are usually two
                    additional bones developed in the tendons of the flexor muscles, one on each
                    side of the carpus, which may be called the radial and ulnar sesamoid bones; the
                    latter is most constant and generally largest, and is commonly known as the
                    pisiform bone. The fourth and fifth carpals of the distal rows are always united
                    into a single bone, and the centrale is very often absent. As a general rule all
                    the other bones are present and distinct, though it not unfrequently happens
                    that one or more may have coalesced to form a single bone, or may be altogether
                    suppressed.</p>

                <p>The metacarpal bones, with the digits which they support, are never more than
                    five in number, and are described numerically—first, second, &amp;c., counting
                    from the radial towards the ulnar side. The digits are also sometimes named (1)
                    the pollex, (2) index, (3) medius, (4) annularis, (5) minimus. One or more may
                    be in a rudimentary condition, or altogether suppressed. If one is absent, it is
                    most commonly the first. Excepting the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> no
                    mammals have more than three phalanges to each digit, but they may occasionally
                    have fewer by suppression or ankylosis. The first or radial digit is an
                    exception to the usual rule, one of its parts being constantly absent, for,
                    while each of the other digits has commonly a metacarpal and three phalanges, it
                    has only three bones altogether; whether the missing one is a metacarpal or one
                    of the phalanges is a subject which has occasioned much discussion, and has not
                    yet been satisfactorily decided. The terminal phalanges of the digits are
                    usually specially modified to support the nail, claw, or hoof, and are called
                    “ungual phalanges.” In walking, some mammals (as the Bears) apply the whole of
                    the lower surface of the carpus, metacarpus, and phalanges to the ground; to
                    these the term “plantigrade” is applied. Many others (as nearly all the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ungulata')</hi> only rest on the last one or two phalanges of the
                    toes, the first phalanx and the metacarpals being vertical and in a line with
                    the fore-arm. These are called “digitigrade.” Intermediate conditions exist
                    between these two forms, to which the terms “phalangigrade” (as the Camel) and
                    “subplantigrade,” (as in most <hi rend="italic">Carnivora)</hi> are applied.
                    When the weight is borne entirely on the distal surface of the ungual phalanx,
                    and the horny structures growing around it, as in the Horse, the mode of
                    progression is called “unguligrade.”</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Chiroptera</hi> the digits are enormously elongated, and
                    support a cutaneous expansion constituting the. organ of flight. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> the manus is formed into a <pb
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n381/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0381-0360"/> paddle, being covered by continuous integument,
                    which conceals all trace of division into separate digits, and without sign of
                    nails or claws. In the Sloths the manus is long and very narrow, habitually
                    curved, and terminating in two or three pointed curved claws in close apposition
                    with each other, incapable, in fact, of being divaricated, so that it is reduced
                    to the condition of a hook, by which the animal suspends itself to the boughs of
                    the trees among which it lives. These are only examples of the endless
                    modifications to which the distal extremity of the limb is subjected in
                    adaptation to the various purposes to which it is applied.</p>
                <p>The posterior limb is constructed upon a plan very similar to that of the
                    anterior extremity. It consists of a pelvic girdle and three segments belonging
                    to the limb proper, viz., the thigh, the leg, and the foot or ρes.</p>
                <p>The pelvic girdle is present in some form in all mammals, though in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Sirenia</hi> it is in an
                    exceedingly rudimentary condition. In all mammals except those belonging to the
                    two orders just named, each lateral half of the pelvic girdle consists
                    essentially, like the corresponding part of the anterior limb, of a flattened
                    rod of bone crossing the long axis of the trunk, having an upper or dorsal and a
                    lower or ventral end. The upper end diverges from that of the opposite side, but
                    the lower end approaches, and, in most cases, meets it, forming a symphysis,
                    without the intervention of any bone corresponding to the sternum. The pelvic
                    girdle differs from the shoulder girdle in being firmly articulated to the
                    vertebral column, thus giving greater power to the hinder limb in its function
                    of supporting and propelling the body. Like the shoulder girdle, it bears on its
                    outer side, near the middle, a cup-shaped articular cavity (“acetabulum ”), into
                    which the proximal end of the first bone of the limb proper is received. Each
                    lateral half of the girdle is called the “os innominatum,” and consists
                    originally of three bones which unite at the acetabulum. The “ilium” or upper
                    bone is that which articulates with the sacral vertebrae. Of the two lower bones
                    the anterior or “pubis” unites with its fellow of the other side at the
                    symphysis; the posterioris the “ischium.” These two form two bars of bone,
                    united above and below, but leaving a space between them in the middle, filled
                    only by membrane, and called the “thyroid” or “obturator” foramen. The whole
                    circle of bone formed by the two innominate bones and the sacrum is called the
                    pelvis. In the <hi rend="italic">Monotremata</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Marsupial·ia,</hi> a pair of thin, flat, elongated bones called epipubic or
                    marsupial bones are attached to the fore part of the pubis, and project forward
                    into the muscular wall of the abdomen.</p>
                <p>The first segment of the limb proper has one bone, the femur, corresponding with
                    the humerus of the upper limb. The second segment has two bones, the tibia and
                    fibula, corresponding with the radius and ulna. These bones always lie in their
                    primitive unmodified position, parallel to each other, the tibia on the preaxial
                    and the fibula on the postaxial side, and are never either permanently crossed
                    or capable of any considerable amount of rotation, as in the corresponding bones
                    of the fore limb. In the ordinary walking position the tibia is internal, and
                    the fibula external. In many mammals the fibula is in a more or less rudimentary
                    condition, and it often ankyloses with the tibia at one or both extremities. The
                    patella or “kneecap” is found in an ossified condition in all mammals, with the
                    exception of some of the <hi rend="italic">Marsupialia.</hi> It is a large
                    sesamoid bone developed in the tendon of the extensor muscles of the thigh,
                    where the tendon passes over the front of the knee-joint, to which it serves as
                    a protection. There are frequently smaller ossicles, one or two in number,
                    situated behind the femoral condyles, called “fabellae.”</p>
                <p>The terminal segment of the hind limb is the foot or pes. Its skeleton presents
                    in many particulars a close resemblance to that of the manus, being divisible
                    into three parts :—(1) a group of short, more or less rounded or square-shaped
                    bones, constituting the tarsus; (2) a series of long bones placed side by side,
                    forming the metatarsus; and (3) the phalanges of the digits or toes.</p>
                <p>The bones of the tarsus of many of the lower <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi>
                    closely resemble both in number and arrangement those of the carpus, as shown in
                    fig. 11. They have been described in their most generalized condition by
                    Gegenbaur under the names expressed in the first column of the following table.
                    The names in the second column are those by which they are most generally known
                    to English anatomists, while in the third column some synonyms occasionally
                    employed are added</p>

                <p>The bones of the tarsus of mammals present fewer diversities of number and
                    arrangement than those of the carpus. The proximal row (see fig. 12) always
                    consists of two bones, the astragalus <hi rend="italic">(a,</hi> which probably
                    represents the coalesced scaphoid and lunar of the hand) and the calcaneum (c).
                    The former is placed more to the dorsal side of the foot than the latter, and
                    almost exclusively furnishes the tarsal part of the tibio-tarsal or ankle-joint.
                    The calcaneum, placed more to the ventral or “plantar” side of the foot, is
                    elongated backwards to form a more or less prominent tuberosity, the “tuber
                    calcis,” to which the tendon of the great extensor muscles of the foot is
                    attached. The navicular bone (n) is interposed between the proximal and distal
                    row on the inner or tibial side of the foot, but on the outer side the bones of
                    the two rows come into contact. The distal row, when complete, consists of four
                    bones, which, beginning on the inner side, are the three cuneiform bones,
                    internal (c <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>), middle (c <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi>), and external (c <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>), articulated to the
                    distal surface of the navicular, and the cuboid (cδ), articulated with the
                    calcaneum. Of these the middle cuneiform is usually the smallest in animals in
                    which all five digits are developed; but when the hallux is wanting the internal
                    cuneiform may be rudimentary or altogether absent. The three cuneiform bones
                    support respectively the first, second, and third metatarsals, and the cuboid
                    supports the fourth and fifth; they thus exactly correspond with the four bones
                    of the distal row of the carpus.</p>
                <p>In addition to these constant tarsal bones, there may be supplemental or sesamoid
                    bones :—one situated near the middle of the tibial side of the tarsus, largely
                    developed in many <hi rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rodentia</hi>; another, less frequent, on the fibular side; and a third, often
                    developed in the tendons <pb
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n382/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0382-0361"/> of the plantar surface of the tarsus, is
                    especially large in Armadillos. There is also usually a pair of sesamoid bones
                    on the plantar aspect of each metatarso-phalangeal articulation.</p>
                <p>The metatarsal bones never exceed five in number, and the phalanges follow the
                    same numerical rule as in the manus, never exceeding three in each digit.
                    Moreover, the first digit, counting from the tibial side, or hallux, resembles
                    the pollex of the haud in always having one segment less than the other digits.
                    As the function of the hind foot is more restricted than that of the hand, the
                    modifications of its structure are less striking. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cetacea</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Sirenia</hi> it is entirely wanting,
                    though in some members of the first-named order rudiments of the bones of the
                    first and second segment of the limb have been detected.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Digestive System.</hi></p>
                <p>The search after the purpose which every modification of structure subserves in
                    the economy is always full of interest, and, if conducted with due caution and
                    sufficient knowledge of all the attendant circumstances, may lead to important
                    generalizations. It must always be borne in mind, however, that adaptation to
                    its special function is not the only cause of the particular form or structure
                    of an organ, but that this form, having in all probability been arrived at by
                    the successive and gradual modification of some other different form from which
                    it is now to a greater or less degree removed, has other factors besides use to
                    be taken into account. In no case is this principle so well seen as in that of
                    the organs of digestion. These may be considered as machines which have to
                    operate upon alimentary substances in very different conditions of mechanical
                    and chemical combination, and to reduce them in every case to the same or
                    precisely similar materials; and we might well imagine that the apparatus
                    required to produce flesh and blood out of coarse fibrous vegetable substances
                    would be different from that which had to produce exactly the same results out
                    of ready-made flesh or blood; and in a very broad sense we find that this is so.
                    If we take a large number of carnivorous animals, belonging to different
                    fundamental types, and a large number of herbivorous animals, and strike a kind
                    of average of each, we shall find that there is, pervading the first group, a
                    general style, if we may use the expression, of the alimentary organs, different
                    from that of the others. There is a specially carnivorous and a specially
                    herbivorous modification of these parts. But, if function were the only element
                    which has guided such modification, it might be inferred that, as one form must
                    be supposed to be best adapted and most perfect in its relation to a particular
                    kind of diet, that form would be found in all the animals consuming that diet.
                    But this is far from being the case. The Horse and the Ox, for instance,—two
                    animals whose food in the natural state is precisely similar,—are yet most
                    different as regards the structure of their alimentary canal, and the processes
                    involved in the preparation of that food. Again, the Seal and the Porpoise, both
                    purely fish-eaters, which seize and swallow and digest precisely the same kind
                    of prey in precisely the same manner, have a totally different arrangement of
                    the alimentary canal. If the Seal’s stomach is adapted in the best conceivable
                    manner for the purpose it has to fulfil, why is not the Porpoise’s stomach an
                    exact facsimile of it, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa?</hi> We can only
                    answer, the Seal and Porpoise belong to different natural groups of animals,
                    formed on different primitive types, or descended from differently constructed
                    ancestors. On this principle only can we account for the fact that, whereas,
                    owing to the comparatively small variety of the different alimentary substances
                    met with in nature, few modifications would appear necessary in the organs of
                    digestion, there is really endless variety in the parts devoted to this
                    purpose.</p>
                <p>The digestive apparatus of mammals, as in other vertebrates, consists mainly of a
                    tube with an aperture placed at or near either extremity of the body,—the oral
                    and the anal orifice,—with muscular walls, the fibres of which are so arranged
                    as by their regular alternate contraction and relaxation to drive onwards the
                    contents of 1 the tube from the first to the last of these apertures. The <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> anterior or commencing portion of this tube and the
                    parts around it are greatly and variously modified in relation to the functions
                    assigned to them of selecting and seizing the food, and preparing it by various
                    mechanical and chemical processes for the true digestion which it has afterwards
                    to undergo before it can be assimilated into the system. For this end it is
                    dilated into a chamber or cavity called the mouth, bordered externally by the
                    lips, usually muscular and prehensile, and supported by a movable framework
                    which carries the teeth,—organs the structure and modifications of which have
                    been already described. The roof of the mouth is formed by the palate,
                    terminating behind by a muscular, contractile arch, having in Man and some few
                    other species a median projection called uvula, beneath which the mouth
                    communicates with the pharynx. The anterior part of the palate is composed of
                    mucous membrane tightly stretched over the flat or slightly concave bony lamina
                    which separates the mouth from the nasal passages, and is generally raised into
                    a series of transverse ridges, which sometimes, as in Ruminants, attain a
                    considerable development. In the floor of the mouth, between the rami of the
                    mandible, and supported behind by the hyoidean apparatus, lies the tongue, an
                    organ the free surface of which, especially in its posterior part, is devoted to
                    the sense of taste, but which also by its great mobility, being composed almost
                    entirely of muscular fibres, performs important mechanical functions connected
                    with masticating and procuring food. Its modifications of form in different
                    mammals are very numerous. Between the long, extensile, vermiform tongue of the
                    Anteaters, which is essential to the peculiar mode of feeding of those animals,
                    and the short, sessile, and almost functionless tongue of the Porpoise, every
                    intermediate condition is found. Whatever the form, the upper surface is always
                    covered with numerous fine papillae, in which the terminal filaments of the
                    gustatory nerve are distributed.</p>
                <p>In connexion with the buccal cavity is an extensive and complex glandular
                    apparatus which pours its secretions into it—secretions which constitute the
                    fluid commonly known as saliva. This apparatus consists of small glands embedded
                    in the mucous membrane or submucous tissue lining the cavity of the mouth, and
                    which are of two kinds (the follicular and the racemose), and of others in which
                    the secreting structure is aggregated in distinct masses removed some distance
                    from the cavity, other tissues besides the lining membrane being usually
                    interposed, and pouring their secretion into the cavity by a distinct tube or
                    duct, which traverses the mucous membrane. To the latter alone the name of
                    “salivary glands” is ordinarily appropriated, although the distinction between
                    them and the smaller racemose glands is only one of convenience for descriptive
                    purposes, their structure being more or less identical; and, as the fluids
                    secreted by all become mixed in the mouth, their functions are, at all events in
                    great part, common. Under the name of salivary glands are commonly included —(1)
                    the “parotid,” situated very superficially on the side of the head, below or
                    around the cartilaginous external auditory meatus, and the secretion of which
                    enters the mouth by a duct (often called Steno’s or Stenson’s) which crosses the
                    masseter muscle and opens into the upper and back part of the cheek; and (2) the
                    “submaxillary,” situated<pb
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n383/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0383-0362"/> in the neck, near or below the angle of the
                    mandible, and sending a long duct (Wharton’s) forwards to open in the fore-part
                    of the floor of the cavity of the mouth, below the apex of the tongue. These are
                    the most largely developed and constant of the salivary glands, being met with
                    in various degrees of development in almost all animals of the class. Next in
                    constancy are (3) the “sublingual,” closely associated with the last-named, at
                    all events in the locality in which the secretion is poured out; and (4) the
                    “zygomatic,” found only in some animals in the cheek, just under cover of the
                    anterior part of the zygomatic arch, its duct entering the buccal cavity near
                    that of the parotid.</p>
                <p>The most obvious function common to the secretion of these various glands, and to
                    that of the smaller ones placed in the mucous membrane of the lips, the cheeks,
                    the tongue, the palate and fauces, is the mechanical one of moistening and
                    softening the food, to enable it the more readily to be tasted, masticated, and
                    swallowed, though each kind of gland may contribute in different manner and
                    different degree to perform this function. The saliva is, moreover, of the
                    greatest importance in the first stage or introduction to the digestive process,
                    as it dissolves or makes a watery extract of all soluble substances in the food,
                    and so prepares them to be further acted on by the more potent digestive fluids
                    met with subsequently in their progress through the alimentary canal. In
                    addition to these functions it seems now well established by experiment that
                    saliva serves in Man and many animals to aid directly in the digestive process,
                    particularly by its power of inducing the saccharine transformation of
                    amylaceous substances. As a general rule, in mammals the parotid saliva is more
                    watery in its composition, while that of the submaxillaries, and still more the
                    sublingual, contains more solid elements and is more viscid, so much so that
                    some anatomists consider the latter, together with the small racemose glands of
                    the cheeks, lips, and tongue, as mucous glands, retaining the name of salivary
                    only for the parotid. These peculiar properties are sometimes illustrated in a
                    remarkable degree, as, for example, the great secretion of excessively viscid
                    saliva which lubricates the tongue of the Anteaters and Armadillos, associated
                    with enormously developed submaxillary glands; while, on the other hand, the
                    parotids are of great size in those animals which habitually masticate dry and
                    fibrous food.</p>
                <p>After the preparation which the aliment has undergone in the mouth,—the extent of
                    which varies immensely in different forms, being reduced almost to nothing in
                    such animals as the Seals and Cetaceans, which, to use the familiar expression,
                    “bolt” their food entire,—it is swallowed, and is carried along the oesophagus
                    by the action of its muscular coats into the stomach. In the greater proportion
                    of mammals this’ organ is a simple saccular dilatation of the alimentary canal,
                    but in others it undergoes remarkable modifications and complexities. The lining
                    of the stomach is thickly beset with tubular glands, which are generally
                    considered to belong to two different forms, recognizable by their structure,
                    and different in their function—the most numerous and important secreting the
                    gastric juice (the active agent in stomachic digestion), and hence called
                    “peptic” glands, the others concerned only in the elaboration of mucus. The
                    relative distribution of these glands in different regions of the walls of the
                    stomach varies greatly in different animals, and in many species there are large
                    tracts of the mucous membrane which do not secrete a fluid having the properties
                    of gastric juice, and often constitute more or less distinct cavities devoted to
                    storing and perhaps softening or otherwise preparing the food for digestion.
                    Sometimes there is a great aggregation of glands forming distinct thickened
                    patches of the stomach wall, as in the Beaver and Koala, or even collected in
                    pyriform pouches with a common narrow opening into the cavity, as in the Manatee
                    and the curious African Rodent <hi rend="italic">Lophyomys.</hi> The action of
                    the gastric fluid is mainly exerted upon the nitrogenous elements of the food,
                    which it dissolves and modifies so as to render them capable of undergoing
                    absorption, which is partly effected by the blood-vessels of the stomach, though
                    the greater part passes through the pylorus, an aperture surrounded by a
                    circular muscular valve, into the intestinal canal. Here it comes in contact
                    with the secretion of a vast number of small glands called the crypts of
                    Lieberkuhn, somewhat similar to those of the stomach, and also of several
                    special glands of a different character, namely, the small racemose, duodenal,
                    or Brunner’s glands, the pancreas, and the liver.</p>
                <p>The intestinal canal varies greatly in relative length and capacity in different
                    animals, and it also offers manifold peculiarities of form, being sometimes a
                    simple cylindrical tube of nearly uniform calibre throughout, but more often
                    subject to alterations of form and capacity in different portions of its
                    course,—the most characteristic and constant being the division into an upper
                    and narrower and a lower and wider portion, called respectively the small and
                    the large intestine, the former being divided quite arbitrarily and artificially
                    into duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, and the latter into colon and rectum. One of
                    the most striking peculiarities of this part of the alimentary canal is the
                    frequent presence of a diverticulum or blind pouch, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >caput</hi><hi rend="italic">caecum</hi><hi rend="italic">coli,</hi> as it was
                    first called, a name generally abbreviated into “caecum,” situated at the
                    junction of the large and the small intestine, a structure presenting an immense
                    variety of development, from the smallest bulging of a portion of the side wall
                    of the tube to a huge and complex sac, greatly exceeding in capacity the
                    remainder of the alimentary canal. It is only in herbivorous animals that the
                    caecum is developed to this great extent, and among these there is a curious
                    complementary relationship between the size and complexity of the organ and that
                    of the stomach. Where the latter is simple the caecum is generally the largest,
                    and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Both caecum and colon are often
                    sacculated, a disposition caused by the arrangement of the longitudinal bands of
                    muscular tissue in their walls; but the small intestine is always smooth and
                    simple-walled externally, though its lining membrane often exhibits various
                    contrivances for increasing the absorbing surface without adding to the general
                    bulk of the organ, such as the numerous small villi by which it is everywhere
                    beset, and the more obvious transverse, longitudinal, or reticulating folds
                    projecting into the interior, met with in many animals, of which the “valvulae
                    conniventes” of Man form well-known examples. Besides the crypts of Lieberkuhn
                    found throughout the intestinal canal, and the glands of Brunner confined to the
                    duodenum, there are other structures in the mucous membrane, about the nature of
                    which there is still much uncertainty, called “solitary” and “agminated” glands,
                    the latter more commonly known by the name of “Peyer’s patches.” These were
                    formerly supposed to be secretory organs, which discharged some kind of fluid
                    into the intestine, but are now more generally considered to belong to the group
                    of structures of somewhat mysterious function of which the lymphatic and lacteal
                    <pb facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n384/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0384-0363"/> glands are members. The solitary glands are found
                    scattered irregularly throughout the whole intestinal tract; the agminated, on
                    the other hand, are always confined to the small intestine, and are most
                    abundant in its lower part. They are subject to great variation in number and in
                    size, and even in different individuals of the same species, and also differ in
                    character at different periods of life, becoming atrophied in old age.</p>
                <p>The distinct glands situated outside of the walls of the intestinal canal, but
                    which pour their secretion into it, are the pancreas and the liver. The latter
                    is the most important on account of its size, if not on account of the direct
                    action of its secretion in the digestive process. This large gland, so complex
                    in structure and function, is well developed in all mammals, and its secreting
                    duct, the bile duct, always opens into the duodenum or that portion of the canal
                    which immediately succeeds the stomach. It is situated in the right side of the
                    abdomen in contact with the diaphragm and the stomach, but varies greatly in
                    relative size, and also in form, in different groups of mammals. In most mammals
                    a gall-bladder, consisting of a pyriform diverticulum from the gall duct, is
                    present, but in many it is wanting, and it is difficult to find the rationale of
                    its presence or absence in relation to use or any other circumstance in the
                    animal economy.</p>
                <p>The descriptions of the livers of various animals to be· met with in treatises or
                    memoirs on comparative anatomy are very difficult to understand for want of a
                    uniform system of nomenclature. The difficulty usually met with arises from the
                    circumstance that this organ is divided sometimes, as in Man, Ruminants, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> into two main lobes, which have been always
                    called respectively right and left, and in other cases, as in the lower Monkeys,
                    <hi rend="italic">Carnivora, Insectivora,</hi> and many other orders, into a
                    larger number of lobes. Among the latter the primary division usually appears at
                    first sight tripartite, the whole organ consisting of a middle, called “cystic”
                    or “suspensory” lobe, and two lateral lobes, called respectively right and left
                    lobes. This introduces confusion in describing livers by the same terms
                    throughout the whole series of mammals, as the right and left lobes of the
                    Monkey or Dog, for instance, do not correspond with parts designated by the same
                    name in Man and the Sheep. There are, moreover, conditions in which neither the
                    bipartite nor the tripartite system of nomenclature will answer, which we should
                    have considerable difficulty in describing without some more general system. In
                    order to arrive at such a system it appears desirable to consider the liver in
                    all cases as primarily divided by the umbilical vein (seefig.14, <hi
                    rend="italic">u)</hi> into two segments, right and left. This corresponds with
                    its development and with the condition characteristic of the organ in the
                    inferior classes of vertebrates. The situation of this division can almost
                    always be recognized in adult animals by the persistence of some traces of the
                    umbilical vein in the form of the round ligament, and by the position of the
                    suspensory ligament.</p>
                <p>When the two main parts into which the liver is thus divided are entire, as in
                    Man, the Ruminants, and <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> they may be spoken of as
                    the right and left lobes; when fissured, as the right and left segments of the
                    liver, reserving the term lobe for the subdivisions. This will involve no
                    ambiguity, for the terms right and left lobe will no longer be used for
                    divisions of the more complex form of liver. In the large majority of mammals
                    each segment is further divided by a fissure, more or less deep, extending from
                    the free towards the attached border, which are called right and left lateral
                    fissures (fig. 14, <hi rend="italic">rlf</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ilf).</hi>
                    When these are more deeply cut than the umbilical fissure («), the organ has
                    that tripartite or trefoil-like form just spoken of, but it is easily seen that
                    it is really divided into four regions or lobes, those included between the
                    lateral fissures being the right and left central (re and <hi rend="italic"
                    >lc)</hi> separated by the umbilical fissure, and those beyond the lateral
                    fissures on each side being the right and left lateral lobes <hi rend="italic"
                    >(rl</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ll).</hi> The essentially bipartite character of
                    the organ and its uniformity of construction throughout the class are thus not
                    lost sight of, even in the most complex forms. The left segment of the liver is
                    rarely complicated to any further extent, except in some cases by minor or
                    secondary fissures marking off small lobules, generally inconstant and
                    irregular, and never worthy of any special designation. On the other hand, the
                    right segment is usually more complex. The gall bladder, when present, is always
                    attached to the under surface of the right central lobe, sometimes merely
                    applied to it, in other cases deeply embedded in its substance. In many cases
                    the fossa in which it is sunk is continued to the free margin of the liver as an
                    indent, or even a tolerably deep fissure <hi rend="italic">(cf).</hi> The portal
                    fissure (p), through which the portal vein and hepatic artery enter and the gall
                    duct emerges from the liver, crosses this lobe transversely, near the attached
                    border of the liver. The right lateral lobe always has the great vena cava <hi
                    rend="italic">(yc)</hi> either grooving its surface or tunnelling through its
                    substance near the inner or left end of its attached border; and a prolongation
                    of the lobe to the left, between the vein and the portal fissure, sometimes a
                    mere flat track of hepatic substance, but more often a prominent tongue-shaped
                    process, is the so-called “Spigelian lobe ”(s). From the under surface of the
                    right lateral lobe a portion is generally partially detached by a fissure, and
                    called the “caudate lobe” (c). In Man this is almost obsolete, but in most
                    mammals it is of considerable magnitude, and has very constant and
                    characteristic relations. It is connected by an isthmus at the left (narrowest
                    or attached) end to the Spigelian lobe, behind which isthmus the vena cava is
                    always in relation to it, channelling through or grooving its surface. It
                    generally has a pointed apex, and is deeply hollowed to receive the right
                    kidney, to the upper and inner side of which it is applied.</p>
                <p>Considerations derived from the comparatively small and simple condition of the
                    liver of the Ungulates, compared with its large size and complex form in the <hi

                    that the first type is related to a herbivorous and the latter to a carnivorous
                    diet. The exceptions to such a proposition are very numerous. The fact of the
                    great difference between the liver of the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> and
                    that of the Seals cannot be accounted for by difference of habits of life,

                <p>The blood <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> of mammals is always red, and during the
                    life of the animal hot, having a nearly uniform temperature, varying within a
                    few degrees on each side of 100° Fahr. The corpuscles are, as usual in
                    vertebrates, of two kinds: —(1) colourless, spheroidal, nucleated, and
                    exhibiting amoeboid movements; while (2) the more numerous, on which depends the
                    characteristic hue of the fluid in which they are suspended, are coloured,
                    non-nucleated, flattened, slightly biconcave disks, with circular outline in all
                    known species except the Camels and Llamas, where they have the elliptical form
                    characteristic of the red corpuscles of nearly all the other vertebrates, though
                    adhering to the mammalian type in absence of nucleus and relatively small size.
                    As a rule they are smaller as well as more numerous than in other classes, but
                    vary considerably in. size in different species, and not always in relation to
                    the magnitude of the animal, a Mouse, for instance, having as large corpuscles
                    as a Horse. Within the limits of any natural group there is, however, very often
                    some such relation, the largest corpuscles being found among the large species
                    and the smallest corpuscles among the small species of the group, but even to

                <p>The heart of mammals consists of four distinct cavities, two auricles and two
                    ventricles. Usually the ventricular portion is externally of conical form, with
                    a simple apex, but in the <hi rend="italic">Sirenia</hi> it is broad and
                    flattened, and a deep notch separates the apical portion of each ventricle. A
                    tendency to this form is seen in the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> and the
                    Seals. It is characteristic of mammals alone among vertebrates that the right
                    auriculo-ventricular valve is tendinous like the left, consisting of flaps held
                    in their place by fibrous ends <hi rend="italic">(chordae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tendiniae)</hi> which arise from projections from the muscular walls of the
                    ventricular cavity <hi rend="italic">(musculi papillares').</hi> In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Monotremata</hi> a transition between this condition and the
                    simple muscular flap of the <hi rend="italic">Sauropsida</hi> is observed. In
                    most of the larger Ungulates a distinct but rather irregular ossification is
                    developed in the central tendinous portion of the base of the heart.</p>
                <p>The orifices of the aorta and pulmonary artery are each guarded by three
                    semilunar valves. The aorta is single, and arches over the left bronchial tube.
                    After supplying the tissues of the heart itself with blood by means of the
                    coronary arteries, it gives off large vessels (“carotid ”) to the head and
                    (“brachial”) to the anterior extremities. The mode in which these vessels arise
                    from the aorta varies much in different mammals, and the study of their
                    disposition affords some guide to classification. In nearly all cases the right
                    brachial and carotid have a common origin (called “innominate artery” in
                    anthropotomy). The other two vessels may come off from this, as is the rule in
                    Ungulates, the common trunk constituting the “anterior aorta” of veterinary
                    anatomy; or they may be detached in various degrees, both arising separately
                    from the aorta, as in Man, or the left carotid from the innominate and the left
                    brachial from the aorta, a very common arrangement, or the last two from a
                    common second or left innominate as in some Bats and Insectivores. The aorta,
                    after giving off the intercostal arteries, passes through the diaphragm into the
                    abdomen, and, after supplying the viscera of that cavity by means of the
                    gastric, hepatic, splenic, mesenteric, renal, and spermatic vessels, gives off
                    in the lumbar region a large branch (iliac) to each of the hinder extremities,
                    which also supplies the pelvic τisc⅛ra, and is continued onwards in the middle
                    line, greatly diminished in size, along the under surface of the tail. In
                    certain mammals, arterial plexuses, called <hi rend="italic">retia
                    mirabilia,</hi> formed by the breaking up of the vessel into an immense number
                    of small trunks, which may run in a straight course parallel to one another (as
                    in the limbs of Sloths and Slow Lemurs), or form a closely packed network, as in
                    the intracranial plexuses of Ruminants, or a sponge-like mass of convoluted
                    vessels, as in the intercostale of Cetaceans, are peculiarities of the vascular
                    system the meaning of which is not in all cases clearly understood. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cetaced</hi> they are obviously receptacles for containing a large
                    quantity of oxygenated blood available during the prolonged immersion, with
                    consequent absence of respiration, to which these animals are subject.</p>
                <p>The vessels which return the blood to the heart from the head and upper
                    extremities usually unite, as in Man, to form the single <hi rend="italic">vena
                    cava superior</hi> or precaval vein, but in some Insectivores, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chiroptera,</hi> and Rodents, and in the Elephant, and all Marsupials and
                    Monotremes, the two superior caval veins enter the right auricle without
                    uniting, as in birds. In Seals and some other diving mammals there is a large
                    venous sinus or dilatation of the inferior cava immediately below the diaphragm.
                    In the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> the purpose of this is supplied by the
                    immense abdominal venous plexuses. As a rule the veins of mammals are furnished
                    with valves, but these are said to be altogether wanting in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> and in the superior and inferior cava, subclavian
                    and iliac veins, the veins of the liver (both portal and hepatic), heart, lungs,
                    kidneys, brain, and spinal chord of other mammals. Many of the veins within the
                    cranium are included in spaces formed by the separation of the laminae of the
                    dura mater, and do not admit of being dilated beyond a certain size; these are
                    termed sinuses. The portal circulation in mammals is limited to the liver, the
                    portal vein being formed by the superior and inferior mesenteric, the splenic,
                    the gastroepiploic, and the pancreatic veins. The kidney is supplied solely by
                    arterial blood, and its veins empty their contents only into the inferior
                    cava.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">absorbent</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lymphatic</hi> system
                    of vessels is very completely developed in the <hi rend="italic">Mammalia.</hi>
                    Its ramifications extend through all the soft tissues of the body, and convey a
                    colourless fluid called lymph, containing nucleated corpuscles, and also, during
                    the process of digestion, the chyle, a milky fluid taken up by the lymphatics
                    (here called lacteals) of the small intestine, and pour them into the general
                    vascular system, where they mix with the venous blood. The lymphatic vessels of
                    the hinder extremities, as well as those from the intestinal canal, unite in the
                    abdomen to form the “thoracic duct,” the hinder end or commencement of which has
                    a dilatation called the <hi rend="italic">receptaculum chyli.</hi> The duct,
                    which is of irregular size and sometimes double, often dividing and uniting
                    again in its course, or even becoming plexiform, passes forwards close to the
                    bodies of the thoracic vertebrae, and empties itself, by an orifice guarded by a
                    valve, into the great left brachiocephalic vein, having previously received the
                    lymphatics <pb facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n386/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0386-0365"/> from the thorax and the left side of the head and
                    left anterior extremity. Those from the right side of the head and right
                    anterior limb usually enter by a small distinct trunk into the corresponding
                    part of the right brachiocephalic vein. The duct, and also the principal
                    lymphatic vessels, are provided with valves.</p>
                <p>Lymphatic glands, rarely met with in the <hi rend="italic">Sauropsida,</hi> are
                    usually present in mammals, both in the general and in the lacteal system, the
                    latter being called “mesenteric glands.” They are round or oval masses, situated
                    upon the course of the vessels, which break up in them and assume a plexiform
                    arrangement, and then reunite as they emerge. No structures corresponding to the
                    pulsating “lymphatic hearts” of the lower vertebrates have been met with in
                    mammals.</p>
                <p>Associated with the vascular and lymphatic systems are certain bodies, the
                    functions of which are not properly understood, and which are usually, on
                    account of their general appearanee, grouped together under the name of
                    “ductless glands.” Of these the “spleen” is the largest, and single, always
                    placed in mammals in relation to the fundus or left end of the stomach, to which
                    it is attached by a fold of peritoneum. It is dark-coloured and spongy in
                    substance, and has a depression on one side or “hilus,” into which the splenic
                    artery, a branch of the cceliac axis of the abdominal aorta, enters, and from
                    which the vein, which joins the portal system, emerges. It varies much in size
                    and form in different mammals, being relatively very small’in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cetacea.</hi> It is sometimes almost spherical, but more often
                    flattened, oval, triangular, or elongated, and occasionally, as in Monotremes
                    and most Marsupials, triradiate. The “suprarenal bodies” or “adrenals” are two
                    in number, each situated either in contact with or at a short distance in front
                    of the anterior extremity of the kidney. They are abundantly supplied with
                    nerves, and are much larger relatively in early than in adult life. The “thyroid
                    body,” or rather bodies, for there are generally two, though in Man and some
                    other species connected by an isthmus passing across the middle line, are
                    constant in mammals, though only met with in a rudimentary condition, if at all,
                    in other vertebrates. They are situated in the neck, in contact with the sides
                    of the anterior extremity of the trachea. The “thymus lies in the anterior part
                    of the thorax, between the sternum and the great vessels al the base of the
                    heart, and differs from the thyroid in being median and single, and having a
                    central cavity. It attains its greatest development during the period of
                    lactation, and then diminishes and generally disappears before full growth is
                    attained.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Respiratory Organs.—</hi> Mammals breathe occasionally through
                    the mouth, but usually, and in many cases exclusively, through the nostrils or
                    nares. These are apertures, always paired (except in the toothed <hi
                    rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> where they unite to form a single external opening),
                    and situated at the fore part of the face, generally at or beneath the end of
                    the muzzle, a median prominence above the mouth. This is sometimes elongated to
                    form a proboscis, to the extremity of which the nostrils are carried, and which
                    attains its maximum of development in the Elephant. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cetacea</hi> the nostrils are situated at a considerable distance behind the
                    anterior end of the face, upon the highest part of the head, and are called
                    “blow-holes,” from the peculiar mode of respiration of these animals. The
                    nostrils are kept open by means of cartilages which surround their aperture, and
                    which many animals have the power of moving so as to cause partial dilatation or
                    contraction. In diving animals, as Seals and <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi>
                    they can be completely closed at will so as to prevent the entrance of water
                    when beneath the surface. The passage to which the nostrils lead is in most
                    mammals filled by a more or less complex sieve-like apparatus, formed of the
                    convoluted turbinal bones and cartilages, over which a moist, vascular, ciliated
                    mucous membrane is spread, and which intercepts particles of dust, and also aids
                    in warming the inspired air before it reaches the lungs. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Proboscidea,</hi> in which these functions are performed by the
                    walls of the long tubular proboscis, this apparatus is entirely wanting. The
                    narial passages have the organ of smell situated in their upper part, and
                    communicate posteriorly with the pharynx, and through the glottis with the
                    “trachea” or windpipe, a tube by which the air is conveyed to and from the
                    lungs. The permanent patency of the trachea during the varied movements of the
                    neck is provided for by its walls being stiffened by a series of cartilaginous
                    rings or hoops, which in most mammals are incomplete behind. Having entered the
                    thorax, the trachea bifurcates into the two bronchi, one of which enters, and,
                    dividing dichotomously, ramifies through, each lung. In some of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Artiodactyla</hi> a third
                    bronchus is given off from the lower part of the trachea, above its bifurcation,
                    and enters the right lung.</p>
                <p>The upper end of the trachea is modified into the organ of voice or “larynx,” the
                    air passing through which to and from the lungs is made use of to set the edges
                    of the “vocal cords,” fibrous bands stretched one on each side of the tube, into
                    vibration. The larynx is composed of several cartilages, of which the “thyroid,”
                    the “cricoid,” and the “arytenoid” are the principal, moved upon one another by
                    muscles, and suspended from the hyoidean arch. By alteration of the relative
                    position of these cartilages the cords can be tightened or relaxed, approximated
                    or divaricated, as required to modulate the tone and volume of the voice. A
                    median tongue-shaped fibro-cartilage at the top of the larynx, the “epiglottis,”
                    protects the “glottis,” or aperture by which the larynx communicates with the
                    pharynx, from the entry of particles of food during deglutition. The form of the
                    larynx and development of the vocal cords present many variations in different
                    members of the class, the greatest modification from the ordinary type being met
                    with in the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> where the arytenoid cartilages and
                    epiglottis are united in a tubular manner, project into the nasal passage, and,
                    being grasped by the muscular posterior margin of the palate, provide a direct
                    channel of communication from the lungs to the external surface. An approach to
                    this condition is met with in the Hippopotamus and some other Ungulates. Nearly
                    all mammals have a voice, although sometimes it is only exercised at seasons of
                    sexual excitement. Some Marsupials and Edentates appear to be quite mute. In no
                    mammal is there an inferior larynx, or “syrinx, as in birds.</p>
                <p>The thoracic cavity of mammals differs from that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sauropsida</hi> in being completely separated from the abdomen by a muscular
                    partition, the “diaphragm,” attached to the vertebral column, the ribs, and the
                    sternum. This is much arched, with the convexity towards the thorax, so that
                    when its fibres contract it is flattened and the cavity of the thorax increased,
                    and when they are relaxed the cavityisdiminished. The lungs are suspended freely
                    in the thorax, one on each side of the heart, being attached only by the root,
                    which consists of the bronchus or air-tube, and pulmonary arteries and veins by
                    which the blood is passed backwards and forwards between the heart and the
                    lungs. The remaining part of the surface of each lung is covered by serous
                    membrane, the “pleura,” and, whatever the state of distension or contraction of
                    the chest-wall, is accurately in contact with it. Inspiration is effected by the
                    contraction of the diaphragm, and by the intercostal and other muscles elevating
                    or bringing forward the ribs, and thus throwing the sternum farther away from
                    the vertebral column. As the surface of the lung must follow the chest-wall, the
                    organ <pb facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n387/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0387-0366"/> is itself expanded, and air rushes in through the
                    trachea to fill all the minute cells in which the ultimate ramifications of the
                    bronchi terminate. In ordinary expiration very little muscular power is
                    expended, the elasticity of the lungs and surrounding parts being sufficient to
                    cause a state of contraction and to drive out at least a portion of the air
                    contained in the cells, when the muscular stimulus is withdrawn. The lungs are
                    sometimes simple externally, as in the <hi rend="italic">Sirenia</hi> (where
                    they are greatly elongated) and the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> but they are
                    more often divided by deep fissures into one or more lobes. The right lung is
                    usually larger and more subdivided than the left. It often has a small distinct
                    lobe behind, wanting on the left side, and hence called <hi rend="italic"
                    >lobulus azygos.</hi></p>
                <p>Most mammals have in connexion with the air passages certain diverticuli or
                    pouches containing air, the use of which is not always easy to divine. The
                    numerous air sinuses situated between the outer and inner tables of the bones of
                    the head, which in Man are represented by the antrum of Highmore and the frontal
                    and sphenoidal sinuses, and which attain their maximum of development in the
                    Indian Elephant, are obviously for the mechanical purpose of allowing expansion
                    of the bone surface without increase of weight. They are connected with the
                    nasal passages. The Eustachian tubes pass from the back of the pharynx into the
                    cavity of the tympanum, into which and the mastoid cells they allow air to pass.
                    In the <hi rend="italic">Equidae</hi> there are large post-pharyngeal air sacs
                    in connexion with them. The Dolphins have an exceedingly complicated system of
                    air sacs in connexion with the nasal passages just within the nostrils, and the
                    Tapir and Horses have blind sacs in the same situation. In the males of some
                    Seals <hi rend="italic">{Cystophora</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Macrorhinus</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> y</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi>
                    large pouches, which the animal can inflate with air, but which at other times
                    are flaccid, and which are not developed in the young animal or the female,
                    arise from the upper part of the nasal passages, and lie immediately under the
                    skin of the face. These are very analogous, although not in the same situation,
                    to the gular pouch of the male Bustard. The larynx has frequently membranous
                    pouches in connexion with it, into which air passes. These may be lateral and
                    opening just above the vocal cords, constituting the <hi rend="italic">sacculi
                    laryngis,</hi> found in a rudimentary state in Man, and attaining an enormous
                    development, reaching to the shoulders and axillae, in some of the Anthropoid
                    Apes; or they may be median, opening in front either above or below the thyroid
                    and cricoid cartilages, as in the Howling and other Monkeys, and also in the
                    Whalebone Whales and Great Anteater.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Urinary Organs.—</hi> The kidneys of mammals are more compact
                    and definite in form than in other vertebrates, being usually more or less oval,
                    with an indent on the side turned towards the middle line from and into which
                    the vessels and ducts pass. They are distinctly divided into a cortical
                    secretory portion, composed mainly of convoluted tubes, and containing
                    Malpighian bodies, and a medullary excreting portion, formed of straight tubes
                    converging towards a papilla, embraced by the commencement of the ureter or duct
                    of the organ. The kidneys of some mammals, as most Monkeys, Carnivores, Rodents,
                    &amp;c., are simple, with a single papilla into which all the renal tubuli
                    enter. In others, as Man, there are many pyramids of the medullary portion, each
                    with its papilla, opening into a division (calyx) of the upper end of the
                    ureter. Such kidneys are, either in the embryonic condition only or throughout
                    life, lobulated on the surface. In some cases, as in Bears, Seals, and
                    especially the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> the lobulation is carried
                    further, the whole organ being composed of a mass of renules, loosely united by
                    connective tissue, and with separate ducts, which soon join to form the common
                    ureter. In all mammals except the Monotremes the ureters terminate by slit-like
                    valvular openings in the urinary bladder. This receptacle when filled discharges
                    its contents through the single median urethra, which in the male is almost
                    invariably included in the penis, and in the females of some species of Rodents,
                    Insectivores, and Lemurs has a similar relation to the clitoris. In the
                    Monotremes, though the bladder is present, the ureters do not enter into it, but
                    into the urogenital canal some distance below it, the orifice of the genital
                    duct intervening.</p>

                <p>The brain of mammals shows a higher condition of organization than that of other
                    vertebrates. The cerebral hemispheres have a greater preponderance compared to
                    other parts, especially to the so-called optic lobes, or corpora quadrigemina,
                    which are completely concealed by them. The commissural system of the
                    hemispheres is much more complete, both fornix and corpus callosum being present
                    in some form; and, when the latter is rudimentary, as in Marsupials and
                    Monotremes, its deficiency is made up for by the great size of the anterior
                    commissure. The lateral lobes of the cerebellum, wanting in lower vertebrates,
                    are well developed and connected by a transverse commissure, the pons Varolii.
                    The whole brain, owing especially to the size of the cerebral hemispheres, is
                    considerably larger relatively to the bulk of the animal than in other classes,
                    but it must be recollected that the size of its brain depends upon many
                    circumstances besides the degree of intelligence which an animal possesses,
                    although this is certainly one. Man’s brain is many times larger than that of
                    all other known mammals of equal bulk, and even three times as large as that of
                    the most nearly allied Ape. Equal bulk of body is here mentioned, because, in
                    drawing any conclusions from the size of the brain compared with that of the
                    entire animal, it is always necessary to take into consideration the fact that
                    in every natural group of closely allied animals the larger species have much
                    smaller brains relatively to their general size than the smaller species, so
                    that, in making any effective comparison among animals belonging to different
                    groups, species of the same size must be selected. It may be true that the brain
                    of a Mouse is, as compared with the size of its body, larger than that of a Man,
                    but, if it were possible to reduce an animal having the general organization of
                    a Man to the size of a Mouse, its brain would doubtless be very many times
                    larger; and conversely, as shown by the rapid diminution of the relative size of
                    the brain in all the large members of the Rodent order, a Mouse magnified to the
                    size of a Man would, if the general rule were observed, have a brain exceedingly
                    inferior in volume. Although the brain of the large species of Whales is, as
                    commonly stated, the smallest in proportion to the bulk of the animal of any
                    mammal, this does not invalidate the general proposition that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> have very large brains compared with terrestrial
                    mammals, as the <hi rend="italic">Ungulata,</hi> or even the aquatic <hi
                    rend="italic">Sirenia,</hi> as may be proved by placing the brain of a Dolphin
                    by the side of that of a Sheep or Pig, or a Manatee of equal general weight. It
                    is only because the universally observed difference between the slower ratio of
                    increase of the brain compared with that of the body becomes so enormous in
                    these immense creatures that they are accredited with small brains.</p>
                <p>The presence or absence of “sulci” or fissures on the surface of the hemisphere,
                    dividing it into “convolutions” or “gyri,” and increasing the superficies of the
                    cortical grey matter, as well as allowing the pia mater with its nutrient
                    blood-vessels to penetrate into the cerebral substance, follow somewhat similar
                    rules. They are related partly to the high or low condition of organization of
                    the species, but also <pb

                <p>The researches of palaeontologists, founded upon studies of casts of the interior
                    of the cranial cavity of extinct forms, have shown that, in many natural groups
                    of mammals, if not in all, the brain has increased in size, and also in
                    complexity of surface foldings, with the advance of time,—indicating in this, as
                    in so many other respects, a gradual progress from a lower to a higher type of
                    development.</p>
                <p>The twelve pairs of cranial nerves generally recognized in veftebrates are all
                    usually found in mammals, though the olfactory nerves are excessively
                    rudimentary, if not altogether absent, in the Toothed Whales. The spinal cord,
                    or continuation of the central nervous axis, lies in the canal formed by the
                    neural arches of the vertebrae, and gives off the compound double-rooted nerves
                    of the trunk and the extremities corresponding in number to the vertebrae,
                    through the interspaces between which they pass out to their destination. The
                    cord is somewhat enlarged at the two points where it gives off the great nerves
                    to the anterior andthe posterior extremities, which from their interlacements
                    soon after their origin are called respectively the brachial and lumbar
                    plexuses. The ganglionic or sympathetic portion of the nervous system is well
                    developed, and presents few modifications.</p>
                <p>The sense of touch is situated in the skin generally, but is most acute in
                    certain regions more or less specialized for the purpose by the presence of
                    tactile papillae, such as portions of the face, especially the lips and end of
                    the snout, and the extremities of the limbs when these are used for other
                    purposes than mere progression, and the under surface of the end of the tail in
                    some Monkeys. The “vibrissae” or long stiff bristles situated on the face of
                    many mammals are rendered extremely sensitive to touch by the abundant supply of
                    branches from the fifth nerve to their basal papillae. In Bats, the extended
                    wing membranes, and probably also the large ears and the folds and prominences
                    of skin about the face of some species, are so sensitive as to receive
                    impressions even from the different degrees of resistance of the air, and so
                    enable the animals to avoid coming in contact with obstacles to their nocturnal
                    flight.</p>
                <p>The organs of the other special senses are confined to the head. Taste is
                    situated in the papillae scattered on the dorsal surface of the tongue. The
                    organ of smell is present in all mammals except the Toothed Whales. It consists
                    of a ramification of the olfactory nerves over a plicated, moist, mucous
                    membrane, supported by folded plates of bone, placed on each side of the septum
                    nasi in the roof, or often in a partially distinct upper chamber of the nasal
                    passage, so arranged that, of the air passing into the lungs in inspiration,
                    some comes in contact with it, causing the perception of any odorous particles
                    with which it may be charged. Many mammals possess intense powers of smelling
                    certain odours which others are quite unable to appreciate, and the influence
                    which this sense exercises over the wellbeing of many species is very great,
                    especially in indicating the proximity of others of the same kind, and giving
                    warning of the approach of enemies. The development and modification of the
                    sense of smell is probably associated with that of the odorous secretion of the
                    cutaneous glands.</p>
                <p>The organ of sight is quite rudimentary, and even concealed beneath the
                    integument, in some burrowing Rodents and Insectivores, and is most imperfectly
                    developed in the <hi rend="italic">Platanista,</hi> or Freshwater Dolphin of the
                    rivers of India. In all other mammals the · eyeball has the structure
                    characteristic of the organ in the higher <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi>
                    consisting of parts through which the rays of light are admitted, regulated, and
                    concentrated upon the sensitive expansion of the optic nerve lining the
                    posterior part of the ball. A portion of the fibro-vascular and highly pigmented
                    layer, the choroid, which is interposed between the retina and the outer
                    sclerotic coat, is in many mammals modified into a brilliantly coloured
                    light-reflecting surface, the <hi rend="italic">tapetum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lucidum.</hi> There is never a pecten or marsupium, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sauropsida,</hi> nor is the sclerotic ever supported by a ring of flattened
                    ossicles, as is so frequently the case in the lower vertebrated classes. The
                    eyeball is moved in various directions by a series of muscles—the four recti,
                    two obliqui, and, except in the higher <hi rend="italic">Primates,</hi> a
                    posterior retractor muscle called choanoid. It is protected by the lids,
                    generally distinctly separated into an upper and a lower-movable flap, which,
                    when closed, meet over the front of the eye in a more or less horizontal line;
                    but sometimes, as in the <hi rend="italic">Sirenia,</hi> the lids are not
                    distinct, and the aperture is circular, closing to a point. In almost all
                    mammals below the <hi rend="italic">Primates,</hi> except the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cetacea,</hi> a <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> nictitating membrane” or third
                    eyelid is placed at the inner corner of the eyeball, and works horizontally
                    across the front of the ball within the true lids. Its action is instantaneous,
                    being apparently for the purpose of cleaning the front of the transparent
                    cornea, a function which is unnecessary in animals whose eyes are habitually
                    bathed in water, and which in Man and his nearest allies is performed by winking
                    the true eyelids. Except in <hi rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> the surface is kept
                    moist by the secretion of the lacrymal gland, placed under the upper lid at its
                    outer side, and the lids are lubricated by the Harderian and Meibomian glands,
                    the former being situated at the inner side of the orbit, and especially related
                    to the nictitating membrane, the latter in the lining membrane of the lids.</p>
                <p>The organ of hearing is enclosed in a bony capsule (periotic) situated in the
                    side of the head, intercalated between the posterior (occipital) and the
                    penultimate (parietal) segment of the skull. It has, in common with other
                    vertebrates, three semicircular canals and a vestibule, but the cochlea is more
                    fully developed than in <hi rend="italic">Sauropsida,</hi> and, except in the
                    Monotremes, spirally convoluted. The tympanic cavity is often dilated below,
                    forming a smooth rounded prominence on the base of the skull, the tympanic
                    bulla. The three principal ossicles, the “malleus,” “incus,” and “stapes,” are
                    always present, but variable in characters. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sirenia,</hi><hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> and Seals they are massivem form,
                    being in the first-named order of larger size than in any other mammals. In the
                    <hi rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> the malleus is ankylosed to the tympanic; in
                    other mammals it is connected only with the membrana tympani. The stapes in the
                    lower orders —Edentates, Marsupials, and Monotremes—has a great tendency to
                    assume the columnar form of the corresponding bone in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sauropsida,</hi> its two rami entirely or partially coalescing.<note

                    permanently in a few mammals, as the American Monkeys; but commonly, by the
                    growth of the squamosal bone, it becomes deeply buried at the bottom of a bony

                    which is continued to the surface of the skin in a fibrous or
                    fibro-cartilaginous form. In Whales, owing to the thickness of the subcutaneous
                    adipose tissue, this is of great length, and is also extremely narrow. In most
                    aquatic and burrowing animals the meatus opens upon the surface by a simple
                    aperture, but <pb facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n389/mode/1up"

                    projecting fold of skin, strengthened by fibro-cartilages, called the pinna or
                    auricle, or “external ear,” of very variable size and shape, generally movably
                    articulated on the skull, and provided with muscles to vary its position, as it
                    helps to collect and direct the vibrations of sound into the meatus.</p>

                    >Insectivora,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chiroptera)</hi> or permanently pass
                    out of the abdominal cavity through the inguinal canal, forming a projection
                    beneath the skin of the perineum, or becoming suspended in a distinct pouch of
                    the integument called scrotum. All the Marsupials have a pedunculated scrotum,
                    the position of which differs from that of other mammals, being in front of,
                    instead of behind, the preputial orifice. The presence, absence, or comparative
                    size and number of the accessory generative glands—prostate, vesicular, and
                    Cowper’s glands, as they are called—vary much in different groups of mammals.
                    The penis is almost always completely developed, consisting of two corpora
                    cavernosa attached to the ischial bones, and of a median corpus spongiosum
                    enclosing the urethra, and forming the glans at the distal portion of the organ.
                    In Marsupials, Monotremes, and the Sloths and Anteaters, the corpora cavernosa
                    are not attached directly to the ischia, and in the last-named the penis is
                    otherwise of a very rudimentary character, the corpus spongiosum not being
                    present. In many Marsupials the glans penis is bifurcated. In most <hi

                <p>In the female, the ovaries retain permanently their original abdominal position,
                    or only descend a short distance into the pelvis. They are of comparatively
                    smaller size than in other vertebrates, and have a definite flattened oval form,
                    and are enclosed in a more or less firm “tunica albugenia.” The oviduct has a
                    trumpet-like, and usually fimbriated abdominal aperture, and is more or less
                    differentiated into three portions :—(1) a contracted upper part, called in Man
                    and the higher mammals “Fallopian tube”; (2) an expanded part with muscular
                    walls, in which the ovum undergoes the changes by which it is developed into the
                    foetus, called the “uterus”; (3) a canal, the “vagina,” separated from the last
                    by a valvular aperture, and terminating in the urino-genital canal, or common
                    urinal and genital passage, which in higher mammals is so short as scarcely to
                    be distinct from the last. The complete distinction of the oviducts of the two
                    sides throughout their whole length, found in all lower vertebrates, only occurs
                    in this class in Monotremes, a prevailing mammalian characteristic being their
                    more or less perfect coalescence in the middle line to form a single median
                    canal. In the Marsupials this union only includes the lower part of the vagina;
                    in most <hi rend="italic">Placentalia</hi> it extends to the whole vagina and a
                    certain portion of the uterus, which cavity is then described as “bicornuate.”
                    In the higher mammals, as in Man, and also in some of the Edentates, the whole
                    of the uterus is single, the contracted upper portion of the oviducts or
                    Fallopian tubes, as they are then called, entering its upper lateral angles by
                    small apertures. In certain lower forms of mammals the urino-genital canal opens
                    with the termination of the rectum into a common cloaca, as in other
                    vertebrates; but it is characteristic of the majority of the class that the two
                    orifices are more or less distinct externally.</p>
                <p>Mammary glands, which secrete the milk by which the young are nourished during
                    the first portion of their existence after birth, are present in both sexes in
                    all mammals, though usually only functional in the female. In the Monotremes
                    alone, their orifices are mere scattered pores in the skin, but in all others
                    they are situated upon the end of conical elevations, called mammillae or teats,
                    which, taken into the mouth of the young animal, facilitate the process of
                    sucking. These are always placed in pairs upon some part of the ventral surface
                    of the body, but varying greatly in number and position in different groups. In
                    the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> where the prolonged action of sucking would
                    be incompatible with their subaqueous life, the ducts of the glands are dilated
                    into large reservoirs from which the contents are injected into the mouth of the
                    young animal by the action of a compressor muscle.</p>
                <p>Secondary sexual characters, or modifications of structure peculiar to one sex,
                    but not directly related to the reproductive function, are very general in
                    mammals. They almost always consist of the acquisition or perfection of some
                    character by the male as it attains maturity, which is not found in the female
                    or the young in either sex. In a large number of cases these clearly relate to
                    the combats in which the males of many species engage for the possession of the
                    females during the breeding season; others are apparently ornamental, and of
                    many it is still difficult to apprehend the meaning. Many suggestions on this
                    subject will, however, be found in the chapters devoted to it in Darwin’s work
                    on <hi rend="italic">The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex,</hi>
                    where most of the best-known instances are collected. Superiority of size and
                    strength in the male of many species is a well-marked secondary sexual character
                    related to the purpose indicated above, being probably perpetuated by the
                    survivors or victors in combats transmitting to their descendants those
                    qualities which gave them advantages over others of their kind. To the same
                    category belong the great development of the canine teeth of the males of many
                    species which do not use these organs in procuring their food, as the Apes,
                    Swine, Musk and some other Deer, the tusk of the male Narwhal, the antlers of
                    Deer, which are present in most cases only in the males, and the usual
                    superiority in size and strength of the horns of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bovidae.</hi> Other secondary sexual characters, the use of which is not so
                    obvious, or which may only relate to ornament, are the presence of masses or
                    tufts of long hair on different parts of the body, as the mane of the male Lion
                    and Bison, the beards of some Ruminants and Bats (as <hi rend="italic">Taphozous
                    melanopogon),</hi> Monkeys, and of Man, and all the variations of coloration in
                    the sexes, in which, as a general rule, the adult male is darker and more
                    vividly coloured than the female. Here may also be mentioned the presence or the
                    greater development of odoriferous glands in the male, as in the Musk Deer, and
                    the remarkable perforated spur with its gland and duct, so like the poison-tooth
                    of the venomous serpents, found in the males of both <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ornithorhynchus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Echidna,</hi> the use of which is at

                    examination and study, the subject has been more fully worked out. There are,
                    however, some points which require notice, as peculiar to the mammalian class,
                    and as affording at least some hints upon the difficult subject of the

                <p>The nourishment of the foetus during intra-uterine life takes place through the
                    medium of certain structures, partly belonging to the foetus itself and partly
                    belonging to the inner parietes of the uterus of the parent. These in their
                    complete form constitute the complex organ called the “placenta,” which serves
                    as the medium of communication between the mother and foetus, and in which the
                    physiological processes that are concerned in the nutrition of the latter take
                    place; but, as we shall see, though a placenta, in the usual acceptation of the
                    term, is peculiar to the mammalian class, it is not in all of its members that
                    one is developed. The structures to which we shall have especially to refer are
                    the outer tunic of the ovum, to which, however formed, the term “chorion” is
                    commonly applied, and two sac-like organs connected with the body cavity of the
                    embryo, both formed from the splanchnic mesoblast, lined by a layer of the
                    hypoblast. These are the “umbilical vesicle” or “yolk sac” and the
                    “allantois.”</p>
                <p>The umbilical vesicle is a thin membrane enclosing the yolk, which by the
                    doubling in of the ventral walls of the embryo becomes gradually formed into a
                    distinct sac external to the body, with a pedicle'(the omphalo-enteric duct) by
                    which for a time a communication is maintained between its cavity and the
                    intestinal canal. In the walls of this sac blood-vessels (omphalo-meseraic or
                    vitelline) are developed in connexion with the vascular system of the embryo,
                    through which, either by their contact with the outer surface of the walls of
                    the ovum, or by the absorption through them of the contents of the yolk sac, the
                    nutrition of the embryo in the lower vertebrates chiefly takes place. In mammals
                    the umbilical vesicle plays a comparatively subordinate part in the nourishment
                    of the foetus, its function being generally superseded by the allantois.</p>
                <p>The last-named sac commences at a very early period as a diverticulum from the
                    hinder end of the alimentary tract of the embryo. Its proximal portion
                    afterwards becomes the urinary bladder, the contracted part between this and the
                    cavity of the allantois proper constituting the urachus, which passes out of the
                    body of the foetus at the umbilicus together with the vitelline duct. The
                    mesoblastic tissue of the walls of the allantois soon becomes vascular; its
                    arteries are supplied with foetal blood by the two hypogastric branches of the
                    iliacs, or main divisions of the abdominal aorta, and the blood is returned by
                    venous trunks which unite to form the single umbilical vein which runs to the
                    under surface of the liver, where, part of it joining the portal vein and part
                    entering the vena cava directly, it is brought to the heart. These are the
                    vessels which, with their surrounding membranes, constitute the umbilical cord,
                    the medium of communication between the foetus and the placenta, when that organ
                    is fully developed.</p>
                <p>The nature of the foetal membranes of the <hi rend="italic">Monotremata</hi> is
                    not known. In the <hi rend="italic">Marsupialia</hi> the observations made many
                    years ago by Professor Owen, upon the development of the Kangaroo, have recently
                    been confirmed by Dr H. C. Chapman,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Proc. Acad. Nat. Sc. Philadelphia,</hi>
                    December 27, 1881; <hi rend="italic">Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist.,</hi> April

                    stages are still much to be desired. As far as is known, up to the period of the
                    very premature birth of these animals the outer covering of the ovum or chorion
                    is free from villi and not adherent to the uterine walls, for, though fitting
                    into the folds of the latter, it is perfectly and readily separable in its
                    entire extent from them. The umbilical vesicle is large, vascular, and adherent
                    to a considerable portion of the chorion, while the allantois is relatively
                    small, and, though the usual blood-vessels can be traced in it, it does not
                    appear to contract any connexion with the chorion, and therefore much less with
                    the walls of the uterus, of such a nature as to constitute a placenta. While in
                    the uterus the nourishment of the foetus seems therefore to be derived from the
                    umbilical vesicle, as in reptiles and birds, rather than from the uterine walls
                    by means of the allantoic vessels, as in the higher mammals. The latter vessels,
                    in fact, play even a much less important part in the development of these
                    animals, not only than in the placental mammals, but even than in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sauropsida,</hi> for they can scarcely have the respiratory
                    function assigned to them in that group. Pulmonary respiration and the lacteal
                    secretion of the mother very early supersede all other methods of providing the
                    due supply both of oxygen and of food required for the development and growth of
                    the young animal. In this sense the Marsupials may be looked upon as the most
                    typically “mammalian” of the whole class. In no other group do the
                    milk-secreting glands play such an important part in providing for the
                    continuity of the race.</p>
                <p>In the third primary division of the <hi rend="italic">Mammalia,</hi> the
                    so-called <hi rend="italic">Placentalia,</hi> the umbilical vesicle generally
                    does not quite unite with the chorion, and disappears as development proceeds,
                    so that no trace of it can be seen in the membranes of an advanced embryo; but
                    it may persist until the end of intra-uterine life as a distinct sac in the
                    umbilical cord, or lying between the allantois and amnion. The disappearance or
                    persistence of the umbilical vesicle does not. according to our present
                    knowledge, appear to be correlated with a higher or lower general grade of
                    development, as might be presupposed. It is stated to have been found in Man
                    even up to the end of intra-uterine life, and also in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carnivora,</hi> while in the <hi rend="italic">Ungulata</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> it disappears at an earlier age. In many, if not all,
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Rodentia,</hi><hi rend="italic">Insectivora,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Chiroptera,</hi> it plays a more important part, becoming
                    adherent to a considerable part of the inner surface of the chorion, to which it
                    conveys blood-vessels, although villi do not appear to be developed from the
                    surface of this part, as they are on the portion of the chorion supplied by the
                    allantoic vessels. These orders thus present to a certain extent a transitional
                    condition from the Marsupials, although essentially different, in possessing the
                    structures next to be described.</p>
                <p>The special characteristic of the whole of the placental mammals constituting the
                    majority of the class, is that the allantois and its vessels become intimately
                    blended with a smaller or greater part of the parieties of the ovum, forming a
                    structure on the outer surface of which villi are developed, and which,
                    penetrating into corresponding cavities of the “decidua,” or soft, vascular,
                    hypertrophied lining membrane of the uterus, constitutes the placenta. This
                    organ may be regarded, as Professor Turner says, both in its function and in the
                    relative arrangement of its constituent textures, as a specially modified
                    secreting gland, the ducts of which are represented by the extremities of the
                    blood-vessels of the foetal system. The passage of material from the maternal to
                    the foetal system of vessels is not a simple percolation or diffusion through
                    their walls, but is occasioned by the action of a layer of cells derived from
                    the maternal or uterine structures, and interposed between the blood-vessels of
                    the maternal part of the placenta and those of the villi covering the chorion,
                    in which the embryonic vessels ramify.</p>
                <p>The numerous modifications in the details of the structure of this organ relate
                    to increasing the absorbing capacity of the vessels of the chorion, and are
                    brought about either by increasing the complexity of the foetal villi and
                    maternal crypts over a limited area, or by increasing the area of the part of
                    the chorion covered by the placental villi, or by various combinations of the
                    two methods.</p>
                <pb facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n391/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0391-0370"/>
                <p>The first class of variations has given rise to a distinction into two principal
                    kinds of placenta—(1) simple or non-deciduate, and (2) deciduate. In the former
                    the foetal villi are received into corresponding depressions of the maternal
                    surface, from which at the period of parturition they are simply withdrawn. In
                    the second or more complex form the relation is more intimate, a layer of
                    greater or less thickness of the lining membrane of the uterus, called-
                    “decidua,” becoming so intimately blended with the chorion as to form part of
                    the placenta proper, or that structure which is cast off as a solid body at
                    parturition. In other words, in the one case the line of separation between the
                    placenta and uterus at birth takes place at the junction of the foetal and
                    maternal structures, in the other through the latter, so that a portion of them,
                    often of considerable thickness, and containing highly organized structures, is
                    cast off with the former. It has been thought that the distinction between these
                    two forms of placentation is so important as to constitute a sufficiently valid
                    basis for a primary division of the placental mammals into two groups. It has,
                    however, been shown that the distinction is one rather of degree than of kind,
                    as intermediate conditions may exist, and it is not improbable that in different
                    primary groups the simpler, non-deciduate form may have become developed
                    independently into one or other of the more complex kinds.</p>
                <p>Apart from its intimate structure, the placenta may be met with of very varied
                    general form. It may consist of villi scattered more or less regularly over the
                    greater part of the surface of the chorion, the two extremities or poles being
                    usually more or less bare. This form is called the “diffused placenta.” It is
                    probably a primitive condition, from which most of the others are derived,
                    although its existence must presuppose the absence of the umbilical vesicle as a
                    constituent of the chorionic wall. It is found at present in the Manis among
                    Edentates, the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sirenia,</hi>
                    the Perissodactyle Ungulates, and the Camels, Pigs, and Chevrotains among the
                    Artiodactyles. Such placentae are always non-deciduate. In the true Ruminants or
                    <hi rend="italic">Pecora,</hi> among the Artiodactyle Ungulates, the villi are
                    aggregated in masses called cotyledons, with bare spaces between. Such a
                    placentation is called “polycotyledonary.” In another modification the villi are
                    collected in a more or less broad band encircling the chorion, leaving a very
                    large portion of the two poles bare, constituting the “zonary placenta,”
                    characteristic of the <hi rend="italic">Carnivora,</hi> and also occurring in
                    the Elephant, Hyrax, and <hi rend="italic">Orycteropus.</hi> The fact of the
                    form of the placenta of these three last-named animals agreeing together, and
                    with that of the <hi rend="italic">Carnivora,</hi> does not, however,
                    necessitate the ascription of zoological affinities, as the placenta jof the <hi
                    rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> has been shown to be at first discoidal, and to
                    become zonary by spreading round the chorion in the course of development. In
                    the other cases, although it must be admitted that the early stages have not
                    been well observed, it is quite probable that it may be derived from a diffused
                    placenta, in which the foetal villi have disappeared from a larger space than
                    usual of the two poles of the ovum.</p>
                <p>Iu another form one pole only of the chorion is non-vascular, the placenta
                    assuming a dome or bell shape, as in the Lemurs and the Sloths. The transition
                    from this, by the gradual restriction of the vascular area, is easy to the oval
                    or discoidal form of placenta of the Anteaters, Armadillos, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Primates.</hi> The discoidal placenta of the Rodents,
                    Insectivores, and <hi rend="italic">Chiroptera,</hi> though showing so much
                    superficial resemblance to that of the last-named order as to have caused them
                    formerly to be associated in one primary group, is now known to be developed in
                    another manner, not by the concentration of villi from a diffused to a limited
                    area, but by retaining the area to which it was originally restricted in
                    consequence of the large surface of chorion occupied, as before mentioned, by
                    the umbilical vesicle. To compensate for the smallness of area, the complex or
                    deciduate structure has been developed. We may conclude that, although the
                    characters and arrangement of the foetal structures may not have that extreme
                    importance which has been attributed to them by some zoologists, they will form,
                    especially when more completely understood, valuable aids in the study of the
                    natural affinities and evolution of the <hi rend="italic">Mammalia.</hi><note

                <p>CLASSIFICATION OF THE MAMMALIA.</p>
                <p>As stated at the commencement of this article, the mammalian class, as at present
                    known either by existing or extinct forms, is completely isolated from all other
                    groups of the animal kingdom, but it is impossible to refrain from speculating
                    as to its origin and nearest affinities. In arranging the classes of vertebrates
                    in a linear series it is customary to place them in the following order— <hi
                    rend="italic">Pisces, Amphibia,</hi><hi rend="italic">Reptilia,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Aves,</hi><hi rend="italic">Mammalia,—</hi> an order which may
                    possibly indicate the relative degree of elevation to which the most completely
                    developed members of each class attain, though it would be a great mistake to
                    suppose that such an arrangement expresses the true relationship of one to the
                    other, and still less must it be imagined that in the process of evolution any
                    of the higher classes are necessarily derived directly from those nearest below
                    them in this serial arrangement. On the contrary, some arguments recently set
                    forth by Professor Huxley<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society of London,</hi> vol.
                    xxviii., 1879, p. 395.</p></note> point very strongly to the conclusion that, in
                    looking among vertebrates for the progenitors of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mammalia,</hi> we must pass over all known forms of birds and reptiles, and go
                    straight down to the <hi rend="italic">Amphibia.</hi> In addition to the
                    characters derived from the conformation of the pelvis upon which the argument
                    is primarily based, the following reasons are given for this conclusion :—“The
                    <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> are the only air-breathing <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vertebrata</hi> which, like mammals, have a dicondylian skull. It is only in
                    them that the articular element of the mandibular arch remains cartilaginous,
                    while the quadrate ossification is small, and the squamosal extends down over it
                    to the osseous elements of the mandible, thus affording an easy transition to
                    the mammalian condition of those parts. The pectoral arch of the Monotremes is
                    as much amphibian as it is sauropsidian; the carpus and the tarsus of all <hi
                    rend="italic">Sauropsida,</hi> except the <hi rend="italic">Chelonia,</hi> are
                    modified away from the Urodele type, while those of the mammal are directly
                    reducible to it. Finally, the fact that in all <hi rend="italic">Sauropsida</hi>
                    it is a right aortic arch which is the main conduit of arterial blood leaving
                    the heart, while in mammals it is a left aortic arch which performs this office,
                    is a great stumbling-block in the way of the derivation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mammalia</hi> from any of the <hi rend="italic">Sauropsida.</hi> But, if we
                    suppose the earliest forms of both the <hi rend="italic">Mammalia</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Sauropsida</hi> to have had a common Amphibian origin, there
                    is no difficulty in the supposition that, from the first, it was a left aortic
                    arch in the one series, and the corresponding right aortic arch in the other,
                    which became the predominant feeder of the arterial system.”</p>
                <p>There is so much in common between the very aberrant Monotremes, upon the
                    structure of which the above conclusions are mainly based, and all other known
                    mammals that we cannot but suppose they are derived, perhaps at some remote
                    period, from one stock, some of the predominating characters of which survive in
                    the existing <pb facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n392/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0392-0371"/> Monotremes, though lost in most other members of
                    the class. These “Prototheria,” as Professor Huxley terms them, have in their
                    turn probably been derived from the same source as that in which the existing
                    <hi rend="italic">Amphibia</hi> on the one hand and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sauropsida</hi> on the other have had their origin. The great divisions of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> may be looked upon therefore as parallel, or
                    rather diverging groups, each tending towards its own specialization, not in any
                    way in the light of ancestor and descendant. No further advance of the
                    Sauropsidian type, which has reached its highest perfection in the modern volant
                    birds, would bring it nearer to the mammalian organization.</p>
                <p>Restricting ourselves now to the class of mammals, as differentiated from other
                    vertebrates, it will be unnecessary to repeat the oft-told history of the
                    various attempts to express the prevailing knowledge of their structure and
                    affinities in a systematic manner called a classification. The systems of Ray,
                    Linnaeus, Cuvier, Owen, Milne-Edwards, Huxley, and others mark successive epochs
                    of that knowledge. A perfect arrangement of any group of animals can only be
                    obtained simultaneously with a perfect knowledge of their structure and life
                    history, and from this, it need scarcely be said, we are still very far removed.
                    If, as was formerly the case, classifications could be confined to existing
                    species, the work would be far less difficult. By the extinction of intermediate
                    forms the surviving groups have mostly come to be much isolated, and their
                    limits can be readily determined and defined. The discovery of extinct species,
                    which appears to be taking place at a constantly increasing rate, is by degrees
                    breaking down these boundaries, and making definitions impossible, though at the
                    same time it is throwing much light upon the affinities and probable origin of
                    many groups now widely separated. A source of difficulty, and perhaps error,
                    which this advancing knowledge has introduced, arises from the necessity of
                    determining the position and relation of so many forms by the bones and teeth
                    alone, without any hope of deriving aid from all those other structures of which
                    we avail ourselves in the case of recent animals. These considerations will show
                    that any classification advanced at present must be regarded as provisional.
                    There are, however, some positions which seem to be so firmly established that
                    it is very unlikely that we shall be dislodged from them by any further increase
                    of knowledge, and which we should carefully distinguish from others which are
                    acknowledged to be doubtful, and adopted rather for convenience, owing to the
                    necessity of having some arrangement, than as representingunimpeachable
                    truth.</p>
                <p>One of the most certain and fundamental points in the classification of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mammalia</hi> is, that all the animals now composing the class can
                    be grouped primarily in three natural divisions, which, presenting very marked
                    differentiating characters, and having no existing, or yet certainly
                    demonstrated extinct, intermediate or transitional forms, may be considered as
                    subclasses of equal value, taxonomically speaking, though very different in the
                    numbers and importance of the animals at present composing them. These three
                    groups are often called by the names originally proposed for them by De
                    Blainville—(1) <hi rend="italic">Or nithodelphia,</hi> (2) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Didelphia,</hi> (3) <hi rend="italic">Monodelphia,—</hi> the first being
                    equivalent to the order <hi rend="italic">Monotremata,</hi> the second to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Marsupialia,</hi> and the third including all the remaining
                    members of the class. Although actual palaeontological proof is wanting, there
                    is much reason to believe that each of these, as now existing, are survivors of
                    distinct branches to which the earliest forms of mammals have successively given
                    rise, and for which hypothetical branches Huxley has proposed the names of <hi
                    rend="italic">Prototheria, Metatheria,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eutheria,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Proceedings of the Zoological Society,</hi> 1880, p.
                    649.</p></note> names which, being far less open to objection than those of
                    Blainville, we shall here use as equivalents for the latter.</p>
                <p>The characters of the <hi rend="italic">Prototheria</hi> can only be deduced from
                    the two existing families, as hitherto no extinct animals which can be referred
                    to other divisions of this remarkable and well-characterized group have been
                    discovered. These two isolated forms, in many respects widely dissimilar, yet
                    having numerous common characters which unite them together and distinguish them
                    from the rest of the <hi rend="italic">Mammalia,</hi> are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Omithorhynchidae</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Echidnidae,</hi> both
                    restricted in their geographical range to the Australian region of the globe.
                    Taken altogether they represent the lowest type of evolution of the mammalian
                    class, and most of the characters in which they differ from the other two
                    subclasses tend to connect them with the inferior vertebrates, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sauropsida</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Amphibia;</hi> for, though
                    the name <hi rend="italic">Ornithodelphia</hi> owes its origin to the
                    resemblance of the structure of the female reproductive organs to those of
                    birds, there is nothing especially bird-like about them.</p>
                <p>Their principal distinctive characters are these. The brain has a very large
                    anterior commissure, and a very small corpus callosum, agreeing exactly in this
                    respect with the next group. The cerebral hemispheres, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Echidna</hi> at least, are well developed and convoluted on the surface. The
                    auditory ossicles present a low grade of development, the malleus being very
                    large, the incus small, and the stapes columelliform. They have no true teeth,
                    though the jaws of <hi rend="italic">Ornithorhynchus</hi> are provided with
                    horny productions, which functionally supply their place. The coracoid bone is
                    complete, and articulates with the sternum, and there is a large “interclavicle”
                    or episternum in front of the sternum, and connecting it with the clavicles.
                    There are also “epipubic” bones. The oviducts (not differentiated into uterine
                    and Fallopian portions) are completely distinct, and open as in oviparous
                    vertebrates separately into a cloacal chamber, and there is no distinct vagina.
                    The testes of the male are abdominal in position throughout life, and the vasa
                    deferentia open into the cloaca, not into a distinct urethral passage. The
                    penis, attached to the ventral wall of the cloaca, is perforated by a canal in
                    the greater part of its length, but not at the base, which is open as in
                    reptiles and those birds which have such an organ, and brought only temporarily
                    in contact with the termination of the vasa deferentia, so as to form a seminal
                    urethra when required, but never transmits the urinary secretion. This condition
                    is a distinct advance on that of the <hi rend="italic">Sauropsida</hi> in the
                    direction of the more complete development of these parts in most of the other
                    <hi rend="italic">Mammalia.</hi> The ureters do not open into the bladder, but
                    behind it into the dorsal wall of the genito-urinary passage. The mammary glands
                    have no distinct nipple, but pour out their secretion through numerous apertures
                    in the skin. The early stages of the development of the young are not yet fully
                    known, but they are produced in a very rudimentary condition, and appear never
                    to be nourished by means of an allantoic placenta.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Metatheria</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Didelphia</hi> are
                    represented at present by numerous species, presenting great diversities of
                    general appearance, structure, and habits, although all united by many essential
                    anatomical and physiological characters, which, taken altogether, give them an
                    intermediate position between the <hi rend="italic">Prototheria</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Eutheria.</hi> In the structure of the brain and the presence of
                    epipubic bones they agree with the former, while in the structure of the ear
                    bones and the shoulder girdle and the presence of teats on the mammary glands
                    they resemble the latter, the reproductive organs belonging to neither one nor
                    the other type, but presenting a special character representing an intermediate
                    grade of development. The ureters open into the base of the bladder. The
                    oviducts are differentiated into <pb
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n393/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0393-0372"/> uterine and Fallopian portions, and open into a
                    long and distinct vagina, quite separate from the cystic urethra. The penis is
                    large, but its crura are not directly attached to the ischia. The spongy body
                    has a large bifurcated bulb. The young are born in an exceedingly rudimentary
                    condition, and are never nourished by means of an allantoic placenta, but are
                    transferred to the nipple of the mother, to which they remain firmly attached
                    for a considerable time, nourished by the milk injected into the mouth by
                    compression of the muscle covering the mammary gland. They are therefore, as
                    previously remarked (see p. 369), the most typically mammalian of the whole
                    class. The nipples are nearly always concealed in a fold of the abdominal
                    integument or “pouch” (marsupium) which serves to support and protect the young
                    in their early helpless condition. The existing species of this group are
                    entirely confined to the Australian region and the American continent, though in
                    former times they had a more extended geographical range. The earliest mammals
                    hitherto discovered appear (as far as the scanty evidence at present obtainable
                    permits any such conclusion to be hazarded) to have belonged to this type,
                    although it is reasonable to conclude that <hi rend="italic">Prototheria</hi>
                    (unless upon the improbable supposition that the existing forms have resulted
                    from a process of degradation), and perhaps <hi rend="italic">Eutheria,</hi>
                    were their contemporaries far back in the Mesozoic age</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Eutheria, Monodelphia,</hi> or “placental mammals” (so
                    called because the foetus is always nourished while within the uterus of the
                    mother by means of an allantoic placenta) include at present by far the greater
                    proportion of the class. While the survivors of the other groups have probably
                    been for a long time in a stationary condition, these have, as there is already
                    good evidence to show throughout all the Tertiary geological age, and by
                    inference for some time before, been multiplying in numbers and variations of
                    form, and attaining higher stages of development and specialization in various
                    directions. They consequently exhibit far greater diversity of external or
                    adaptive modification than is met with in either of the other subclasses,·— some
                    being fitted to live as exclusively in the water as fishes, and others to
                    emulate the aerial flight of birds.</p>
                <p>To facilitate the study of the different component members of this large group,
                    it is usual to separate them into certain divisions which are called “orders.”
                    In the main zoologists are now of accord as to the general number and limits of
                    these divisions among the existing forms, but the affinities and relationships
                    of the orders to one another are far from being understood, and there are very
                    many extinct forms already discovered which do not fit at all satisfactorily
                    into any of the orders as commonly defined.</p>
                <p>Commencing with the most easily-distinguished, we may first separate a group
                    called <hi rend="italic">Edentata,</hi> composed of several very distinct forms,
                    the Sloths, Anteaters, and Armadillos, which under great modifications of
                    characters of limbs and digestive organs, as well as habits of life, have just
                    enough in common to make it probable that they are the very specialized
                    survivors of an ancient group, most of the members of which are extinct, but
                    which the researches of palaeontology have not yet revealed to us. The
                    characters of their cerebral, dental, and in many cases of their reproductive
                    organs show an inferior grade of organization to that of the generality of the
                    subclass. The next order, about the limits of which there is no difficulty, is
                    the <hi rend="italic">Sirenia,</hi> aquatic vegetable-eating animals, with
                    complete absence of hind limbs, and low cerebral organization,— represented in
                    our present state of knowledge by but two existing genera, the Dugongs and
                    Manatees, and by a few extinct forms, which, though approaching a more
                    generalized mammalian type, show no special characters allying them to any of
                    the other orders. Another equally well-marked and equally isolated, though far
                    more numerously represented and diversified order, is that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> composed of the various forms of Whales, Dolphins,
                    and Porpoises. In aquatic habits, external fish-like form, and absence of hind
                    limbs they resemble the last, though in all other characters they are as widely
                    removed as are any two orders among the <hi rend="italic">Eutheria.</hi> The
                    association by systematists of the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Sirenia</hi> in one group can only be made either in ignorance of
                    their true structure, or in an avowedly artificial system.</p>
                <p>All the remaining orders are more nearly allied together, the steps by which they
                    have become modified from one general type being in most cases not difficult to
                    realize. Their dentition especially, however diversified in detail, always
                    responds to the formula already described (see p. 353); and, although the
                    existing forms are broken up into groups in most cases easy of definition, the
                    discoveries already made in palaeontology have in great measure filled up the
                    gaps between them.</p>
                <p>Very isolated among existing <hi rend="italic">Eutheria</hi> are the two species
                    of Elephant constituting the order called <hi rend="italic">Proboscidea.</hi>
                    These, however, are now known to be the survivors of a large series of similar
                    animals, Mammoths, Mastodons, and <hi rend="italic">Dinothéria,</hi> which as we
                    pass backwards in time gradually assume a more ordinary or generalized type; and
                    the interval which was lately supposed to exist between even these and the rest
                    of the class is partially bridged over by the discovery in American Eocene and
                    early Miocene formations of the gigantic <hi rend="italic">Dinocerata,</hi>
                    evidently offshoots of the great group of hoofed animals, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ungulata,</hi> represented in the actual fauna by the Horses, Rhinoceroses,
                    Tapirs, Swine, and Ruminants. Almost as isolated as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proboscidea</hi> among existing mammals are the few small species constituting
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Hyrax,</hi> and in their case palaeontology affords
                    no help at present, and therefore, pending further discoveries, it has been
                    thought advisable in most recent systems to give them the honour of an order to
                    themselves, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Hyracoidea.</hi> But the number
                    of extinct forms already known allied to the <hi rend="italic">Ungulata,</hi>
                    but not coming under the definition of either of the two groups <hi
                    rend="italic">{Artiodactyla</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Perissodactyla')</hi>
                    under which all existing species range themselves, is so great that either many
                    new orders must be made for their reception or the definition of the old order
                    <hi rend="italic">Ungulata</hi> so far extended as to receive them all, in which
                    case both <hi rend="italic">Proboscidea</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hyracoidea</hi> might be included within it. Again the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rodentia,</hi> or gnawing animals—Rabbits, Rats, Squirrels, Porcupines,
                    Beavers, &amp;c.—are, if we look only at the present state of the class, most
                    isolated. No one can doubt what is meant by a Rodent animal, or have any
                    difficulty about defining it clearly, at least by its dental characters; yet our
                    definitions break down before the extinct South American <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mesotherium,</hi> half Rodent and half Ungulate, which leads by an easy
                    transition to the still more truly Ungulate Toxodon, for the reception of which
                    a distinct order <hi rend="italic">(Toxodontia)</hi> has been proposed. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Insectivora</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> again
                    are at present quite distinct orders, but they merge into one another through
                    fossil forms, and are especially connected by the large group of primitive <hi
                    rend="italic">Carnivora,</hi> so abundantly represented in the Eocene deposits
                    both of America and Europe, to which Cope has given the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Creodonta.</hi> The transition from the Insectivores to the Lemurs
                    is not great, and, strange to say, however different they now appear, the early
                    forms of Lemurs are not easily distinguished from the primitive Ungulates. The
                    Bats or <hi rend="italic">Chiroptera</hi> are allied to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Insectivora</hi> in all characters but the extraordinary modification of their
                    anterior extremities into wings, but this, like the want of the hind limbs in

                    of any knowledge of intermediate or transitional forms, they can be perfectly
                    separated, and form as well defined an order as any in the class. Lastly, we
                    have the important and well-characterized group, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Primates,</hi> including all the Monkeys and Man, and the question is not yet
                    solved as to how and through what forms it is linked on to the other groups. It
                    is commonly assumed that the Lemurs are nothing more than inferior <hi
                    rend="italic">Primates,</hi> but the interval between them in the actual fauna
                    of the world is very great, and our knowledge of numerous extinct species
                    recently discovered in America, said to be intermediate in characters, is not
                    yet sufficiently perfect to enable us to form a definite opinion upon the
                    subject.</p>
                <p>The distinctive characters of the generally recognized orders of mammals, with an
                    account of their subdivisions and the principal forms contained in each, will be
                    given further on.</p>
                <p>GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF MAMMALIA.</p>
                <p>The existing species of few classes of the animal kingdom are better known than
                    those of the <hi rend="italic">Mammalia,</hi> and, owing to the comparatively
                    limited methods of locomotion or transport which most of them possess, the area
                    of distribution of each species is more definite and restricted than in some
                    other classes. In the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Distribution</hi> the various regions into which naturalists
                    have divided the earth’s surface, according to the prevailing characters of its
                    animal inhabitants, have been described, and in the latter the main facts
                    connected with the distribution of mammals have been treated of. In the account
                    of each group contained in the present article the particular circumstances
                    relating to its geographical range will be mentioned. There is little therefore
                    needed here, except a brief summary of the most important facts relating to this
                    interesting subject.</p>
                <p>As regards their distribution over the surface of the earth, mammals may be
                    divided into three groups according to their principal methods of locomotion—(1)
                    aerial, (2) aquatic, and (3) terrestrial.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Aerial Mammals.—</hi> This group only comprises the animals
                    composing the single order <hi rend="italic">Chiroptera,</hi> which differ from
                    all other mammals in the fact that their principal means of transport from place
                    to place is by aerial flight, as in the majority of birds and insects. Broad
                    expanses of water, which form natural barriers to the spread of terrestrial
                    mammals, are therefore no obstacles to their distribution; accordingly we find
                    the general rule that mammals are not inhabitants of oceanic islands modified in
                    their case. But even in this group, notwithstanding their exceptional powers of
                    locomotion, different species, genera, and families inhabit very definite areas.
                    Each zoological region of the earth has its characteristic Bats; and those of
                    the New World and of the Old World are, with very few exceptions, quite
                    distinct. This subject will be more fully treated of under the order <hi
                    rend="italic">Chiroptera.</hi><hi rend="italic">2</hi><hi rend="italic">.
                    Aquatic Mammals.—</hi> Many mammals grouped for the present purpose as
                    terrestrial pass a great portion of their lives in brooks, lakes, or rivers,
                    and, being dependent upon such waters for obtaining their subsistence, are
                    necessarily confined to their vicinity; but the truly aquatic mammals, or those
                    living constantly in the water, and unable to move their quarters from place to
                    place by land, are the orders <hi rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Sirenia,</hi> with which may also be grouped the Seals, forming
                    the Pinniped division of the order <hi rend="italic">Carnivora.</hi></p>
                <p>For the marine <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> animals mostly of large size and
                    endowed with powers of rapid locomotion, there are obviously no barriers to
                    universal distribution over the surface of the earth covered by sea, excent such
                    as are interposed by uncongenial temperature or absence of suitable food.
                    Nevertheless it was thought some years ago that the fact of a Whale or a Dolphin
                    occurring in a sea distant from that in which it had usually been found was
                    sufficient justification for considering it as a distinct species and imposing a
                    new name upon it. There are now, however, so many cases known in which Cetaceans
                    from the northern and southern seas, from the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans,
                    present absolutely no distinguishing external or anatomical characters upon
                    which specific determination can be based that the opposite view is gaining
                    ground; and, as some species are undoubtedly very widely distributed, almost
                    cosmopolitan in fact, there seems little reason why many others should not be
                    included in the same category. The evidence is satisfactory enough in those
                    cases in which the intermediate regions are inhabited by the same forms, the
                    cases of “continuous areas” of distribution. In those in which the areas of
                    distribution are apparently discontinuous, there may be more room for doubt; but
                    it must not be forgotten that the negative evidence is here of much less value
                    than in the case of land animals, as the existence of Cetaceans in any
                    particular part of the ocean is most'easily overlooked. The great Sperm Whale
                    <hi rend="italic">{Physeter</hi><hi rend="italic">macrocephalus)</hi> is known
                    to be almost cosmopolitan, inhabiting or passing through all the tropical and
                    temperate seas, although not found near either pole. At least three of the
                    well-known species of Rorqual <hi rend="italic">{Balaenoptera)</hi> of the
                    British coasts are represented in the North Pacific, on the South American
                    shores, and near New Zealand by species so closely allied that it is difficult
                    to point out any valid distinctive characters, though it may perhaps be
                    desirable to wait for a more complete examination of a large series of
                    individuals before absolutely pronouncing them to be specifically identical.
                    There is nothing yet known by which we can separate the“Humpback Whales” <hi
                    rend="italic">{Megaptera) of</hi> Greenland, the Cape of Good Hope, and Japan.
                    The same may be said of the common Dolphin of the European seas <hi
                    rend="italic">{Delphinus</hi><hi rend="italic">delphis)</hi> and the so-called
                    <hi rend="italic">D. bairdii</hi> of the North Pacific and <hi rend="italic">D.
                    forsteri</hi> of the Australian seas. The Pilot Whale <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Globicephalus</hi><hi rend="italic">mêlas)</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pseudorca</hi> of the North Atlantic and of New Zealand are also precisely
                    alike, as far as present knowledge enables us to judge. Many other similar cases
                    might be given. Captain Maury collected much valuable evidence about the
                    distribution of the larger <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> and, finding Right
                    Whales <hi rend="italic">{Balstna)</hi> common in both northern and southern
                    temperate seas, and absent in the intermediate region, laid down the axiom that
                    “the torrid zone is to the Right Whale as a sea of fire, through which he cannot
                    pass.” Hence all cetologists have assumed that the Right Whale of the North
                    Atlantic <hi rend="italic">{B. hiscay</hi><hi rend="italic">ensis),</hi> that of
                    the South Seas <hi rend="italic">{B. australis),</hi> and that of the North
                    Pacific <hi rend="italic">{B. japonica)</hi> are necessarily distinct species.
                    The anatomical structure and external appearance of all are, however, as far as
                    yet known, marvellously alike, and, unless some distinguishing characters can be
                    pointed out, it seems scarcely justifiable to separate them upon geographical
                    position alone; as, although the tropical seas may be usually avoided by them,
                    it scarcely seems impossible, or even improbable, that some individuals of
                    animals of such size and rapid powers of swimming may not have at some time
                    traversed so small a space of ocean as that which divides the present habitual
                    localities of these supposed distinct species. If identity or diversity of
                    structural characters is not to be allowed as a test of species in these cases,
                    as it is usually admitted to be in others, the study of their geographical
                    distribution becomes an impossibility.</p>
                <p>Although many species are thus apparently of such wide distribution, others are
                    certainly restricted; thus the <pb

                    >(Balaena</hi><hi rend="italic">mysticetus)</hi> has been conclusively shown to
                    be limited in its range to the region of the northern circumpolar ice, and no
                    corresponding species has been met with in the southern hemisphere. In this
                    case, not only temperature, but also the peculiarity of its mode υf feeding, may
                    be the cause. The Narwhal and the Beluga have a very similar distribution,
                    though the latter occasionally ranges farther south. The Hyperoodons are
                    restricted to the North Atlantic, never entering, as far as is yet known, the
                    tropical seas. Other species are exclusively tropical or austral in their range.
                    One of the true Whalebone Whales <hi rend="italic">(Neobalaena</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">marginata)</hi> has only been met with hitherto in the seas round
                    Australia and New Zealand, a large Ziphiυid <hi rend="italic">(Berardius
                    arnouxi)</hi> only near the last-named islands.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> are not limited to the ocean, or even to salt
                    water, some entering large rivers for considerable distances, and some being
                    exclusively fluviatile. One species of <hi rend="italic">Platanista</hi> is
                    extensively distributed throughout nearly the whole of the river systems of the
                    Ganges, Brahmaputra, and Indus, ascending as high as there is water enough to
                    swim in, but apparently never passing out to sea. The individuals inhabiting the
                    Indus and the Ganges must therefore have been for long ages isolated without
                    developing any definite distinguishing anatomical characters, for those by which
                    the supposed <hi rend="italic">P. indi</hi> was formerly separated from <hi
                    rend="italic">P. gangetica</hi> have been shown by Anderson to be of no constant
                    value. <hi rend="italic">Orcella</hi><hi rend="italic">fluminalis</hi> appears
                    to be limited to the Irawaddy river, and at least two distinct species of
                    Dolphin, belonging to different genera, are found in the waters of the upper
                    Amazon. It is remarkable, however, that none of the great lakes or inland seas
                    of the world are, according to our present knowledge, inhabited by Cetaceans. A
                    regular seasonal migration has been observed in many of the oceanic. <hi
                    rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> especially those inhabiting the North Atlantic, but
                    further observations upon this subject are still much needed.</p>
                <p>The great difference in the manner of life of the <hi rend="italic">Sirenia,</hi>
                    as compared with that of the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> causes a
                    corresponding difference in their geographical distribution. Slow in their
                    movements, and feeding exclusively upon vegetable substances, water-grasses, or
                    fuci, they are confined to rivers, estuaries, or coasts where these grow, and
                    are not denizens of the open sea, although of course there is a possibility of
                    accidental transport by the assistance of oceanic currents across considerable
                    distances. Of the three genera existing within historic times, one <hi
                    rend="italic">(Manatus)</hi> is exclusively confined to the shores of the
                    tropical Atlantic and the rivers entering into it, individuals scarcely
                    specifically distinguishable being found both on the American and the African
                    side of the ocean. The Dugong <hi rend="italic">(Halicore)</hi> is distributed
                    in different colonies, at present isolated, throughout the Indian Ocean from
                    Arabia to North Australia. The <hi rend="italic">llhytina</hi> or Northern
                    Sea-Cow was, for some time before its extinction, limited to a single island in
                    the extreme north of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
                <p>The Pinnipeds, although capable of traversing long reaches of ocean, are less
                    truly aquatic than the last two groups, always resorting to the land or to
                    extensive icefloes for the purposes of breeding. The geographical range of each
                    species is generally more or less restricted, usually according to climate, as
                    they are mostly inhabitants either of the Arctic or Antarctic seas and adjacent
                    temperate regions, very few being found within the tropics. For this reason the
                    northern and the southern species are for the most part quite distinct. In fact,
                    the only known exception is the case of a colony of the Sea-Elephant <hi
                    rend="italic">(Macrorhinus</hi><hi rend="italic">leoninus),</hi> the general
                    range of which is in the southern hemisphere, inhabiting the coast of
                    California. Even in this case a different specific name has been given to the
                    northern form, but the characters by which it is distinguished are not of great
                    importance, and probably, except for the abnormal geographical distribution,
                    would never have been discovered. The most remarkable circumstance connected
                    with the distribution of the Pinnipeds is the presence of members of the order
                    in the three isolated great lakes or inland seas of Central Asia— the Caspian,
                    Aral, and Baikal—which, notwithstanding their long isolation, have varied but
                    slightly from species now inhabiting the Polar Seas.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Terrestrial Mammals.—</hi> One of the most important facts
                    connected with the present distribution of terrestrial mammals, but one of which
                    the cause is sufficiently obvious, is their entire absence, except where
                    introduced by the direct agency of man, from all oceanic islands, including even
                    the great New Zealand group. Another, equally striking, but less easily
                    explained, is the very marked isolation as regards its mammalian fauna of the
                    Australian region of zoologists. When once the narrow neutral ground on the
                    border line between this and the Oriental region is passed, there is not found,
                    notwithstanding the vast extent of land it comprises, a single indigenous
                    placental or monodelphous mammal, except a few species of a single family <hi
                    rend="italic">(Muridae)</hi> of the very wide spread order <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bodentia,—</hi> the Wild Dog or Dingo having been in all probability
                    introduced. On the other hand, the members of the other two subclasses, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Prototheria</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ornitho~ delphia</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Metatlιeria</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Didelphia,</hi> are
                    almost entirely restricted to this region. It might have been said entirely, but
                    for the presence of one family <hi rend="italic">(Didelphidae)</hi> of the
                    latter group in America.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Eutheria</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Monodelphia</hi> are
                    distributed throughout the remaining geographical regions, as described in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Distribution,</hi> and in many cases form valuable
                    indications by which the natural boundaries of these divisions have been traced.
                    Many anomalies, otherwise inexplicable in the present range of families and
                    species, have been cleared up by the study of their distribution in former
                    geological epochs, a subject in relation to which the present facts of
                    distribution should always be studied. There are few lines of evidence so
                    conclusive as this in favour of the existing species being modified lineal
                    descendants of those which have lived in previous times upon the earth.<note

                <p>As already intimated, such knowledge as we yet posses» of the history of mammals
                    in past times is of very recent growth, and is still extremely incomplete. The
                    very rapid advances which have been made in the last few years, especially in
                    consequence of the explorations of rich fossiliferous beds in North America,
                    have not only completely changed the present aspect of the science, but give
                    such promise for the future that any sketch which we might now attempt of this
                    branch of the subject could only be regarded as representing a transient phase
                    of knowledge. It will be well, however, to gather together in this place the
                    leading facts now ascertained with regard to the most ancient forms, as, owing
                    to the uncertainty of their relationship with any of the existing orders, they
                    will be most conveniently treated of separately, while the ascertained facts
                    relating to the geological history of the forms more nearly allied to those now
                    living will be more appropriately described under the account of the different
                    groups into which the class may now be divided.</p>

                <p>The hitherto discovered remains of mammals which existed anterior to the Tertiary
                    period all belong to creatures of very small size, the largest scarcely
                    exceeding the common Polecat or Squirrel. Some are known only by a few isolated
                    teeth, others by nearly complete sets of these organs, and the majority by more
                    or less perfect specimens of the rami of the lower jaw. It is a very curious
                    circumstance that this part of the skeleton alone has been preserved in such a
                    large number of instances. No complete cranium has ever been found, nor is there
                    satisfactory evidence of the structure of the vertebral column or of the limbs
                    of any single individual. The species already described from European strata
                    amount to nearly thirty, which have been arranged in fifteen genera. Of these by
                    far the greater number have been found at a single spot near Swanage in
                    Dorsetshire, in a bed of calcareous mud only 40 feet long, 10 feet wide, and
                    averaging <hi rend="italic">5</hi> inches in depth. The marvellous results
                    obtained by the exploration by Mr S. H. Beckles of this small fragment of the
                    earth’s surface show by what accidents, as it were, our knowledge of the past
                    history of life has been gained, and what may still remain in store where little
                    thought of at present. A bed, apparently equally rich, has recently been
                    discovered in the Territory of Wyoming, North America, the contents of which are
                    being made known by Professor Marsh.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Mammals of the Triassic Period.—</hi> The Rhaetic
                    formations, so named from the Rhaetian Alps of Bavaria, are the highest beds of
                    the Trias, and are situated above the New Red Sandstone, and just below the
                    Lias. In 1847 Professor Pleininger of Stuttgart, while assiduously sifting some
                    sand from this formation, belonging to the Keuper of Diegerloch and
                    Steinenbronn, discovered, among an immense mass of teeth, scales, and
                    unrecognizable fragments of skeletons of fish and saurians, two minute teeth,
                    each with well-defined, enamelled, tuberculated crowns and distinct roots,
                    plainly showing their mammalian character. These, the oldest known evidence of
                    the class, were considered by their discoverer to indicate a predaceous and
                    carnivorous animal of very small size, to which he gave the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Microlestes</hi><hi rend="italic">antiquus.</hi> Subsequently Mr
                    C. Moore discovered in a bone bed of Rhaetic age filling a fissure in the
                    mountain limestone at Holwell, near Frome in Somersetshire, various isolated
                    teeth with their crowns much worn, but apparently including both upper and lower
                    molars and a canine, which are assigned by Professor Owen to Pleininger’s genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Microlestes,</hi> and described specifically as <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ. moorei.</hi> Under the name of <hi rend="italic"

                    Jour. Geol. Soc.,</hi> vol. xx. p. 411, 1864.</p></note> has described a single
                    tooth with two roots which he discovered in a Rhaetic marlstone at Watchet in
                    Somersetshire, and which may be even somewhat older than the last. Professor
                    Dawkins finds the nearest analogue of this tooth among recent mammals in the
                    large trenchant premolar of the Rat-Kangaroo or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hypsiprymnus</hi> (see vol. xiii. p. 840, fig. 4), a resemblance not concurred
                    in by Professor Owen, who refers it to the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Microlestes.</hi> The minute size and worn condition of the tooth render it
                    extremely difficult to form a decided opinion upon its characters, and therefore
                    upon the affinities of the animal to which it belonged.</p>
                <p>Still more satisfactory evidence of the presence of mammals at a period at least
                    as ancient as the European Trias is afforded by the discovery of three nearly
                    perfect mandibular rami in the Chatham coal-field of North Carolina by Dr
                    Emmons, who, however, placed them as far back in age as the Permian, or
                    altogether beyond the Mesozoic stage, a conclusion not now received. Of this
                    animal, called <hi rend="italic">Dromatherium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sylvestre,</hi> the complete dentition of the lower jaw is known, and consists
                    of three pointed incisors, separated by intervals, one canine, and ten molars,
                    of which the first three have simple subcompressed crowns, and the remainder are
                    multicuspid. The jaw figured by Dr Emmons<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">American Geology,</hi> part vi., p. 93,

                    considered it to belong to a placental Insectivore, but the number of molar
                    teeth exceeds that of any existing member of that order, and is only found in
                    some Marsupials. It was associated in the same bed with thecodont reptiles.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Mammals of the Jurassic Period.—</hi> In the ascending order
                    of geological age the next remains of mammals have been met with in the Lower
                    Oolite at Stonesfield in Oxfordshire, where they are associated with wing cases
                    of insects, Plesiosaurs, Crocodiles, and Ptérodactyles. From this bed several
                    specimens have been met with at various times, which have been placed in three
                    genera.</p>
                <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Amphitherium,</hi> Blainville, 1838. The specimen <hi
                    rend="italic">(A. prevostii,</hi> see fig. 15) ppon which this genus was
                    founded, was discovered in 1812, and examined in 1818 at Oxford by Cuvier, who
                    pronounced it to be mammalian, and to resemble the jaw of an Opossum. This
                    conclusion was afterwards disputed by De Blainville and others, who believed it
                    to be reptilian, but the original determination is now generally accepted.<note

                    interesting fossil, with a history of the discussion regarding its nature, is

                    and Birds.</hi></p></note> Three rami of mandibles, all more or less perfect,
                    are now known. The length of the jaw is rather less than an inch. It contains
                    sixteen teeth, which, as defined by shape only, are— <hi rend="italic">i</hi> 3,
                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 1, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> 6, <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
                    6, so that if the upper jaw had a corresponding number there would be sixty-four
                    teeth in all,—a greater number than in any existing heterodont mammal, though
                    equalled by some of the species from the Purbeck. Ιhe nearest approach to this
                    number is in <hi rend="italic">Myrmecdbius</hi> among recent Marsupials. The
                    incisors are rather long and slender, the canines apparently not much larger
                    than the incisors, all the premolars and molars two-routed—the former with a
                    single large pointed cusp and small basal cusp on one or both sides, the latter
                    quinquecuspidate. The lower margin <pb

                    the mylohyoid groove persistent, as in some of the existing Marsupials and in
                    Whalebone Whales. This groove, a remnant of that which originally lodges
                    Meckel’s cartilage, mistaken for a suture, was once considered evidence of the
                    reptilian nature of these jaws. A second species is described as <hi

                    quadrate form, of very little height, and supports six subequal cusps. Its

                <p>The freshwater bed previously alluded to, situated at Durdlestone Bay near
                    Swanage, belongs to the Middle Purbeck series, intervening between the Middle
                    Oolite and the Wealden. The first discovery of mammalian bones was made in this
                    spot by Mr W. R. Brodie in 1854, but the subsequent explorations of Mr S. H.
                    Beckles have yielded a surprising number of species. They are associated with
                    numerous saurians, insects, and freshwater shells, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paludina, Planorbis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cyclas.</hi> No less than
                    eleven genera from this locality alone are fully described in Professor Owen’s
                    memoir. These may be grouped as follows :—</p>
                <p>A. With teeth arranged on the insectivorous type. Mandibular incisors more than
                    two; canines well developed; premolars and molars cuspidate, seven or more :—(a)
                    molars and premolars more than eight, mostly twelve <hi rend="italic"
                    >(βpa-lacotherium, Amblothervum, Peralestes, Achyrodon, Pera-spalax, Peramus,
                    Stylodon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bolodon—</hi> the last known only by the
                    maxillary teeth); (ό) molars and premolars seven or eight <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Triconodon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tria-canthodon).</hi> As any synopsis of
                    the characters of these genera would be scarcely intelligible without minute
                    descriptions and reference to figures, the reader who desires further
                    information is referred to the memoir cited above.</p>
                <p>B. With a single, strong, pointed, slightly curved incisor, placed close to the
                    median line as in Rodents. No canine. Three or four compressed, trenchant,
                    obliquely grooved premolars, increasing in size from first to last, and two
                    small molars with low multituberculated crowns. Genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plagiaulax,</hi> Falconer. This remarkable and highly specialized type has been
                    the occasion of one of the most interesting discussions on the inferences which
                    may be drawn as to the affinities and habits of an otherwise unknown animal from
                    the structure of a small portion of its organization which occurs in the annals
                    of natural history, a discussion carried on with great ability, ingenuity, and
                    wealth of illustration on both sides. Dr Falconer maintained that it was more
                    nearly allied to the Rat-Kangaroo <hi rend="italic">[Hypsiprymnus}</hi> than to
                    any other existing form, and that, as it is known that these animals feed upon
                    grass and roots, “it may be inferred of <hi rend="italic">Plagiaulax</hi> that
                    the species were herbivorous or frugivorous. I can see nothing in the character
                    of their teeth,” he adds, “to indicate that they were either insectivorous or
                    omnivorous.” Professor Owen, on the other hand, from the same materials came to
                    the conclusion that “the physiological deductions from the above-described
                    characteristics of the lower jaw and teeth of <hi rend="italic">Plagiaulax</hi>
                    are that it was a carnivorous Marsupial.</p>
                <p>It probably found its prey in the contemporary small insectivorous mammals and
                    Lizards, supposing no herbivorous form like <hi rend="italic">Stereognathus</hi>
                    to have co-existed during the Upper Oolite period.” It is impossible here to
                    give at any length the arguments by which these opposing views are respectively
                    supported, but it may be indicated that the first-mentioned is strongly
                    countenanced by the consideration of the following facts :— (1) all existing
                    Marsupials may be divided, as far as their dentition is concerned, into two
                    groups—(a) those which have a pair of large more or less procumbent incisors
                    close to the symphysis of the lower jaw, and rudimentary or no canines
                    (diprotodont dentition; families <hi rend="italic">Phascolomyidae,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Macropodidx</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Phalangistidae),</hi> and (δ) those which have numerous small
                    incisors, and large pointed canines (polyprotodont dentition; families <hi
                    rend="italic">Peramelidae, Dasyuridae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Didelphidae)</hi>; (2) the vast majority of the former group are purely
                    vegetable feeders, and almost all of the latter are carnivorous or
                    insectivorous; and (3) <hi rend="italic">Plagiaulax,</hi> so far as its
                    structure is known, belongs obviously to the former group, and, as we have no
                    sure basis for inferences as to the habits of an unknown animal but the
                    knowledge of the habits of such as are known, we have no grounds for supposing
                    that, its habits differed from those of its structural congeners.<note

                <p>That the two types of dentition still found among Marsupials should have existed
                    side by side in so remote a period of time as that in which the Purbeck bone bed
                    was deposited, and that one of these types should have already attained so
                    singular a degree of specialization, is one of the most remarkable facts yet
                    revealed by mammalian palaeontology. Whether the teeth of the upper jaw

                    Purbecks, some being even considered to be generically identical. Both
                    polyprotodont and diprotodont types are represented, the latter by a species

                <p>It will be of very great interest to know the mode of succession of the teeth of
                    those early mammals, as it may throw some light upon the question of the
                    relation of the succession of teeth in mammals generally with the same process
                    in the inferior classes of the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata.</hi> There is,
                    however, as yet very little, if any, reliable evidence upon the subject, but
                    such as there is rather points to the fact of an absence or very feeble
                    development of the diphyodont condition, resembling that of modern Marsupials.
                    If this is so, it may lead to the somewhat startling conclusion that in the
                    transition from the lower vertebrate to the mammal, by whatever process it took
                    place, the indefinite reproduction of the teeth of the former was lost, and that
                    a monophyodont condition supervened, which was again superseded by the peculiar
                    definite diphyodont mode of succession characteristic of the most highly
                    organized mammals.</p>
                <p>There is nothing yet known in the structure of these small mammals of the
                    Mesozoic ages of the world to connect them with the surviving representatives
                    (the Monotremes) of the hypothetical <hi rend="italic">Prototheria;</hi> but
                    whether their position was among the <hi rend="italic">Metatheria</hi> or <hi

                    which both these branches have been derived, it is impossible at present to say.

                <p>This scanty evidence of mammalian life must bear a very small proportion to that
                    which doubtless existed during the greater part of the vast Mesozoic period. The
                    Cretaceous formations have as yet yielded no trace of the presence of animals of
                    this class; but the number and variety of species met with in the earliest
                    Tertiary formations, when already differentiation into most of the existing
                    leading divisions had taken place, strikingly proves the imperfect state of our
                    geological record during the immediately antecedent ages of the world.</p>
                <p>CHARACTERS OF THE DIFFERENT ORDERS AND FAMILIES AND OF THE PRINCIPAL FORMS OF THE
                    MAMMALIA.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Subclass</hi> PROTOTHERIA <hi rend="smallcaps">or</hi>
                    ORNITHODELPHIA.</p>
                <p>The principal distinguishing characteristics of this group have been already
                    given (p. 371). They apply not only to the subclass, but of course equally to
                    the one order <hi rend="smallcaps">Monoteemata,</hi> in which the few known
                    members of the group are commonly associated. In addition to the more important
                    characters enumerated above, the following, which are common to all existing
                    species, may be mentioned.</p>
                <p>The dorso-thoracic vertebrae are nineteen in number, and have no terminal
                    epiphyses to their bodies. The transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae
                    are of autogenous formation, and remain suturally connected with the remainder
                    of the vertebra until the animal is full-grown. Though in this respect they
                    present an approximation to the <hi rend="italic">Sauropsida</hi> (Reptiles and
                    Birds), they differ from that group, inasmuch as there is not a gradual
                    transition from these autogenous transverse processes of the neck (or cervical
                    ribs, as they may be considered) into the thoracic ribs, for in the seventh
                    vertebra the costal element is much smaller than in the other, indicative of a
                    very marked separation of neck from thorax, not seen in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sauropsida.</hi> The. upper ends of the ribs are attached to the sides of the
                    bodies of the dorsal vertebrae only, and not to the transverse processes. The
                    sternal ribs are well ossified, and there are distinct partly ossified
                    intermediate ribs. The cerebral cavity, unlike that of the lower Marsupials or
                    the Reptiles, with which they have so many structural affinities, is large and
                    hemispherical, flattened below and arched above, and about as broad, as long.
                    The cribriform plate of the ethmoid is nearly horizontal. The cranial walls are
                    very thin, and smoothly rounded externally, and the sutures become completely
                    obliterated in adult skulls, as in Birds. The broad occipital region slopes
                    upwards and forwards, and the face is produced into a long and depressed
                    rostrum. The bony palate is prolonged backwards, so that the posterior nares are
                    nearly on a level with the glenoid fossa. The mandible is without distinct
                    ascending ramus; the coronoid process and angle are rudimentary, and the two
                    halves are loosely connected at the symphysis. The fibula has a broad, flattened
                    process, projecting upwards from its upper extremity above the articulation,
                    like an olecranon. In the male there is an additional, flat, curved ossicle on
                    the hinder and tibial side of the plantar aspect of the tarsus, articulating
                    chiefly to the tibia, which supports in the adult a sharp-pointed perforated
                    horny spur, with which is connected the duct of a gland situated beneath the
                    skin of the back of the thigh, the function of which is not yet clearly
                    understood. (A rudimentary spur is found in the young female <hi rend="italic"
                    >Omithorhynchus,</hi> but this disappears when the animal becomes adult.) The
                    stomach is subglobular, simple; the alimentary canal has no ileo-caecal valve,
                    or marked distinction between large and small intestine, but has a small,
                    slender vermiform caecum with glandular walls. The liver is divided into the
                    usual number of lobes characteristic of the <hi rend="italic">Mammalia,</hi> and
                    is provided with a gallbladder.</p>
                <p>Although agreeing in so many important characters, the existing members of the
                    group evidently represent two very diverging branches, perhaps as far removed as
                    are the members of some of the accepted orders of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eutheria.</hi> It would, however, be encumbering zoological science with new
                    names to give them any other than the ordinarily known family designations of
                    <hi rend="italic">Ornithorhynchidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    placed below the extremity of the rostrum. No laterally placed horny teeth,

                    in mode of life of various animals of this section might lead to their division

                <p>The brain is generally small in proportion to the size of the animal, and the
                    surface folding of the cerebral hemispheres, though well marked in the larger
                    species, is never very complex in character, and is absent in the smaller and
                    medium-sized species. The arrangement of the folding of the inner wall of the

                    different families. Except in the genus <hi rend="italic">Phascolomys,</hi> the
                    number of incisors in the upper and lower jaws is never equal. The true molars
                    are very generally four in number on each side of each jaw. The chief
                    peculiarity in the dentition lies, however, in the mode of succession. There is
                    no vertical displacement and succession of the teeth, except in the case of a
                    single tooth on each side of each jaw, which is always the hindermost of the
                    premolar series, and is preceded by a tooth having more or less of the
                    characters of a true molar (see fig. 23), and is the only tooth comparable to
                    those called “milk teeth” in the diphyodont <hi rend="italic">Eutheria.</hi> In
                    some cases (as in <hi rend="italic">Hypsiprymnus)</hi> this tooth retains its
                    place and function until the animal has nearly, if not quite, attained its full
                    stature, and is not shed and replaced by its successor until after all the other
                    teeth of the permanent series, including the posterior molars, are fully in
                    place and use. In others, as the Thylacine, it is most rudimentary in form and
                    size, being shed or absorbed before any of the other teeth have cut the gum, and
                    therefore quite functionless. It must further be noted that there are some
                    Marsupials, as the Wombat, Koala, Myrmecobius, and the Dasyures, in which no
                    such milk tooth, even in a rudimentary state, has yet been discovered, possibly
                    in some cases from want of materials for observation at the right stage of
                    development.</p>
                <p>Epipubic or marsupial bones are present in both sexes of nearly all species. In
                    one genus alone, <hi rend="italic">Thylacinus,</hi> they are not ossified. The
                    number of dorso-lumbar vertebrae is always nineteen, although there are some
                    apparent exceptions caused by the last lumbar being <pb

                    pairs of ribs is nearly always thirteen. The tympanic bone remains permanently
                    distinct. The carotid canal perforates the basi-sphenoid. The lacrymal foramen
                    is situated upon or external to the anterior margin of the orbit, and there are
                    generally large vacuities in the bony palate. The angle of the mandible is
                    (except in <hi rend="italic">Tarsipes)</hi> more or less inflected. The hyoid
                    bones have always a peculiar form, consisting of a small, more or less
                    lozenge-shaped basi-hyal, broad cerato-hyals, with the remainder of the anterior
                    arch usually unossified, and stout, somewhat compressed thyro-hyals. There are
                    two anterior venae cavae,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    which a “vena azygos” enters. In the male the testes are always contained in a
                    scrotum which is suspended by a narrow pedicle to the abdomen in front of the
                    penis. The vasa deferentia open into a complete and continuous urethra, which is
                    also the passage by which the urine escapes from the bladder, and is perfectly
                    distinct from the passage for the faeces, although the anus and the termination
                    of the urethro-sexual canal are embraced by the same sphincter muscle. The glans
                    is often bifurcated anteriorly. In the female the oviducts never unite to form a
                    common cavity or uterus, but open separately into the vagina, which at least for
                    part of its course is double. During the very short period in which the embryo
                    is contained in the uterus, its nourishment seems to be derived from the
                    umbilical vesicle, the allantoic vessels not reaching the surface of the chorion
                    to form a true placenta. The mammae vary much in number, but are always
                    abdominal iu position, have long teats, and in most of the species are more or
                    less enclosed in a fold of the integument forming a pouch or marsupium, though
                    in some this is entirely wanting, and the newly-born, blind, naked, and helpless
                    young, attached by their mouths to the teat, are merely concealed and protected
                    by the hairy covering of the mother’s abdomen. In this stage of their existence
                    they are fed by milk injected into their stomach by the contraction of the
                    muscles covering the mammary gland, the respiratory organs being modified
                    temporarily, much as they are permanently iu the <hi rend="italic"

                    posterior nares, and so maintaining a free communication between the lungs and
                    the external surface independently of the mouth and gullet, thus averting the
                    danger of suffocation while the milk is passing down the latter passage.</p>
                <p>The existing species of Marsupials are, with the exception of one family (the <hi
                    rend="italic">Diddphidae),</hi> limited in geographical distribution to the
                    Australian region, forming the chief mammalian fauna of Australia, New Guinea,
                    and some of the adjacent islands. The <hi rend="italic">Didelphidae</hi> are
                    almost purely neotropical, one or two species ranging northwards into the
                    Nearctic region. Fossil remains of members of this family have also been found
                    in Europe in strata of the Eocene and early Miocene period.</p>
                <p>In dividing the Marsupials into minor groups, it may be observed that one of the
                    most obvious distinctive characters among them is derived from the form and
                    arrangement of the teeth. In certain species, as the Opossums, Dasyures, and
                    Tlιylacines, the incisors are numerous, small, and subequal in size and the
                    canines large, as in the typical placental Carnivores (fig. <hi rend="italic"
                    >24</hi>; compare with that of Lion, vol. xiv. p. 680). To these the term
                    “polyprotudont” is applied, and they are all more or less carnivorous in their
                    habits. In others the central incisors are very prominent, and the lateral
                    incisors and canines absent or subordinate in function (fig. 25). These are
                    called “diprotodont,” and they are all wholly or in great part vegetable
                    feeders.</p>
                <p>In one group of these, the Wombats, there are but two incisors above and the same
                    number below; but all the others, including the Kangaroos, Koalas, and
                    Phalangen?, have two incisors below and as many as six above, three on each
                    side, but of these the first or central pair is the most fully developed.·</p>
                <p>Though this division is extremely convenient, a difficulty in accepting it as
                    marking a radical separation of the order into two primary stocks is caused by
                    the <hi rend="italic">Peramelidae,</hi> which combine a polyprotodont form <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> dentition with a peculiar structure of the hind feet, so
                    exactly resembling that of some of the best-marked di protodonts, as the
                    Kangaroos, that it is difficult to believe that it can have been developed
                    independently. Taking various combinations of characters into consideration, the
                    existing Marsupials readily group themselyes into six very natural families, the
                    characters of which can be thus defined :—</p>

                    >cynocephalus,</hi> though smaller than a common Wolf, is the largest predaceous
                    Marsupial at present existing. It is now entirely confined to the island of
                    Tasmania, although fragments of bones and teeth found in caves afford evidence
                    that a closely allied species once inhabited the Australian mainland. The
                    general colour of the Thylacine is greybrown, but it has a series of transverse
                    black bands on the hinder part of the back and loins, whence the name of “Tiger”
                    frequently applied to it by the colonists. It is also called “Wolf,” and
                    sometimes, though less appropriately, “Hyaena.” Owing to the havoc it commits
                    among the sheepfolds, it has been nearly exterminated in all the more settled
                    parts of Tasmania, but still finds shelter in the almost impenetrable rocky
                    glens of the more mountainous regions of the island. The female produces four

                    Vertebrae :C 7, D 13, I. 6, 8 2, C 18-20. The true Dasyures are mostly
                    inhabitants of the Australian continent and Tasmania, where in the economy of
                    nature they take the place of the smaller predaceous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carnivora,</hi> the Cats, Civets, and Weasels of other parts of the world. They
                    hide themselves in the daytime in holes among rocks or in hollow trees, but
                    prowl about at night in search of the small living mammals and birds which
                    constitute their prey. .The species are not numerous, and divide themselves into

                    in being a larger and heavier animal, with a disproportionally large and broad
                    head. Its teeth are relatively larger and more massive, and hence more crowded
                    in the jaws; the premolars especially are scarcely compressed but rather
                    conical; the lower molars want a cusp placed near the middle of the inner
                    border, found developed in different degrees in all the species of the first
                    section. This animal is peculiar to Tasmania, where it is commonly known by the
                    name of “Devil.” Its prevailing colour is black, its size about that of an
                    English Badger, and its disposition remarkably savage and voracious.</p>

                    possessing an additional premolar,—the dentition being <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                    ⅜, c⅛, <hi rend="italic">p⅜, m</hi> ⅜; total 46, —and having the teeth generally
                    developed upon an insectivorous rather than a carnivorous pattern, the upper
                    middle incisors being larger and inclined forwards, the canines relatively
                    smaller, and the molars with broad crowns, armed with prickly tubercles. The
                    muzzle is pointed. Ears moderately rounded and nearly naked. Fore feet with five
                    subequal toes, with compressed, slightly curved pointed claws. Hind feet with
                    the four outer toes subequal, with claws similar to those in the fore feet; the
                    hallux almost always distinct and partially opposable, though small and
                    nailless, sometimes absent. The food of these animals is almost entirely
                    insects, which some pursue among the branches of trees, while others are purely
                    terrestrial. They are found throughout Australia, and also in New Guinea and the
                    Aru and some of the adjacent islands. Variations in the details of the dentition
                    and of the structure of the hind limbs, and in the length and arrangement of the
                    hairy covering of the tail, have given rise to several subdivisions which will
                    probably be accepted as generic by most zoologists, although further
                    investigations are required before their limits can be very satisfactorily

                <p>The animals of this genus, commonly called “Bandicoots” in Australia, are all
                    small, and live entirely on the ground, making nests composed of dried leaves,

                    worms, roots, and bulbs constitute their ordinary diet. The various species are

                    most remarkable modifications from the normal mammalian type. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Primates</hi> must be placed at the head of the series. The
                    position of the others is quite arbitrary, as none of the hitherto proposed
                    associations of the orders into larger groups stand the test of critical
                    investigation, and palaeontological researches have already gone far to show
                    that they are all modifications of a common heterodont, diphyodont, pentadactyle
                    form.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Order</hi> EDENTATA.</p>
                <p>The name assigned to this group (which some zoologists think ought rather to be
                    ranked as a subclass than an order) by Cuvier is often objected to as
                    inappropriate, for though some of the members are edentulous, others have very
                    numerous teeth; and the Linnaean name <hi rend="italic">Bruta</hi> is
                    occasionally substituted. But that term is quite as objectionable, especially as
                    the group to which Linnaeus applied it is by no means equivalent to the order as
                    now understood, as the names of the genera contained in it, viz., <hi
                    rend="italic">Elephas,</hi><hi rend="italic">Trichechus, Bradypus, Myrmecophaga,
                    Manis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dasypus,</hi> will indicate. It contained, in
                    fact, all the animals then known which are comprised in the modern orders of <hi
                    rend="italic">Probosddea,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sirenia,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Edentata,</hi> together with the Walrus, one of the <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">Probosddea,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">Elephas</hi> stands
                    first in the list of genera, and was probably in the mind of Linnaeus when he
                    assigned the name to the group. Cuvier’s order included the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ornithorhynchus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Echidna,</hi> the structure of which
                    was then imperfectly known, and which are now by common consent removed to an
                    altogether different section of the class, but otherwise its limits are those
                    now adopted. The name <hi rend="italic">Edentata</hi> is so generally used, and
                    its meaning so well understood, that it would be very undesirable to change it
                    now; in fact similar <pb facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n405/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0405-0384"/> reasons might be assigned for ceasing to use
                    nearly all the other current ordinal designations, for it might be equally well
                    objected that all the <hi rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> are not flesheaters, many
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Marsupialia</hi> have not pouches, and so forth.</p>
                <p>If the teeth are not always absent, they invariably exhibit certain
                    imperfections, which are indeed almost the only common characters which bind
                    together the various extinct and existing members of the order. These are—that
                    they are homodont and, with the remarkable exception of the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Tal·usia,</hi> monophyodont; they are never rooted but have
                    persistent pulps; they are always deficient in one of the constituents which
                    enter into the formation of the complete mammalian tooth, the enamel, and are
                    never present either in the upper or lower jaw in the fore part of the mouth,
                    the situation occupied by the incisors of other mammals.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In some few Armadillos the suture between the
                    premaxilla and maxilla passes behind the first upper tooth, but in a∏ the other

                    maxilla.</p></note></p>
                <p>There is so great a difference in structure and habits between some of the
                    existing animals assigned to this order that, beyond the negative characters
                    just mentioned, there seems little to connect them. The Sloths and Anteaters,
                    for instance, in mode of life, general conformation of limbs, structure of
                    digestive organs, &amp;c., appear at first sight almost as widely separated as
                    any mammals. Palaeontology has, however, thrown great light upon their
                    relations, and proved their real affinities. Perfectly intermediate forms have
                    been discovered in the great Ground Sloths of America, which have the dentition
                    and general form of the head of the Sloths, combined with the limbs and trunk of
                    the Anteaters. It is highly probable that the existing members of the order are
                    very much differentiated representatives of a large group, the greater number of
                    which are now extinct, and which have become so without ever attaining a high
                    grade of organization. The great diversity of structure of the existing
                    families, the high degree of specialization to which many have attained, the
                    paucity of species and even of individuals, their limited area of distribution,
                    and their small size compared with known ancestral forms, all show that this is
                    an ancient and a waning group, the members of which seem still to hold their own
                    either by the remoteness and seclusion of their dwelling-places, by their
                    remarkable adaptation of structure to special conditions of life, or by aid of
                    the peculiar defensive armature with which they are invested. Their former
                    history can, however, only be thus surmised, rather than read, at present; for,
                    though we have ample evidence of the abundance and superior magnitude of certain
                    forms in the most recent or post-Tertiary geological age, and in one part of the
                    world, beyond this time, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in the true Tertiary
                    period, and in other parts of the world than America, the remains of animals of
                    this order hitherto discovered are only fragmentary, giving a most imperfect
                    idea of their actual structure, and affording no indications which serve to
                    connect them with any other branch of the class.</p>
                <p>The existing members of the order readily group themselves into five distinct
                    families, the limits of which are perfectly clear. These are (1) <hi
                    rend="italic">Bradypodidae,</hi><hi rend="italic">or</hi> Sloths; (2) <hi
                    rend="italic">Myrmecophagidae,</hi> or Anteaters; (3) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dasypodidae,</hi> or Armadillos; (4) <hi rend="italic">Manidae,</hi> Pangolins
                    or Scaly Anteaters; and (5) <hi rend="italic">Orycteropodidae,</hi> Aard-varks
                    or African Anteaters. The geographical distribution of these families coincides
                    with their structural distinction, the first three being inhabitants of the New
                    and the last two of the Old World. It has been usual to arrange these families
                    into two large groups or suborders :—(1) the <hi rend="italic">Phyllophaga,</hi>
                    leaf-eaters, also called <hi rend="italic">Tardigrada,</hi> containing the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bradypodidae</hi> alone; and (2) the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Entom,ophaga,</hi> insect-eaters, or <hi rend="italic">Vermilingua,</hi>
                    containing all the other families, from which sometimes the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orycteropodidae</hi> are separated as a third suborder under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Effodientia.</hi> Such an arrangement is, however, an artificial
                    one, founded on superficial resemblance. The bonds which unite the <hi
                    rend="italic">Manidae</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Myrmecophagidae</hi> are
                    mainly to be found in the structure of the mouth, especially the extensile
                    character of the tongue, the great development of the submaxillary glands, and
                    the absence of teeth. These characters are exactly analogous to those found in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Echidna</hi> among Monotremes, the Woodpeckers among
                    Birds, and the Chamaeleon among Reptiles,—the fact probably being that in
                    countries where Termites and similar insects flourish various distinct forms of
                    vertebrates have become modified in special relation to this abundance of
                    nutritious food, which could only be made available by a peculiar structure of
                    the alimentary organs. A close study of the more essential portions of the
                    anatomy of these animals<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Zoological Society</hi> of London,
                    1882, p. 358.</p></note> leads to the belief that all the American Edentates at
                    present known, however diversified in form and habits, belong to a common stock.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Bradypodidae,</hi><hi rend="italic">Megathe-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">riidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Myrmecophagidae</hi> are
                    closely allied, the modifications seen in the existing families relating only to
                    food and manner of life. The ancestral forms may have been omnivorous, and
                    gradually separated into the purely vegetable and purely animal feeders; from
                    the former are developed the modern Sloths, from the latter the Anteaters. The
                    Armadillos <hi rend="italic">(Dasypodidae)</hi> are another modification of the
                    same type, retaining some generalized characters, as those of the alimentary
                    organs, but in other respects, as their defensive armature, remarkably
                    specialized. The two Old-World families <hi rend="italic">Manidae</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Orycteropodidae</hi> are so essentially distinct, both from the
                    American families and from each other, that it may even be considered doubtful
                    whether they are derived from the same primary branch of mammals, or whether
                    they may not be offsets of some other branch, the remaining members of which
                    have been lost to knowledge.</p>

                    others in the details of the structure of the teeth. They are very deeply
                    implanted, of prismatic form (quadrate in transverse section); and the component
                    tissues—hard dentine (fig. 35, <hi rend="italic">d),</hi> softer vaso-dentine
                    <hi rend="italic">(v),</hi> and cementum (c)—are so arranged that, as the tooth
                    wears, the surface always presents a pair of transverse ridges, thus producing a
                    triturating apparatus comparable to the “bilophodont” molar of <hi rend="italic"

                    >Macropus,</hi> and others, though produced in a different manner. In all the
                    other genera the teeth are more or less cylindrical, though sometimes laterally
                    compressed or even longitudinally grooved on the sides, and on the grinding
                    surface the prominent ridge of hard dentine follows the external contour, and is
                    surrounded only by a thin layer of cementum, as in the existing Sloths. The
                    genera of which the remains are best known are <hi rend="italic">Mylodon</hi>
                    (fig. 37), <hi rend="italic">Lesto-don, Scelidotherium, Gryphotherium,</hi> and

                    upper and lower jaws is large and removed by a considerable interval from the
                    others. The osteological characters of these genera have been fully described in
                    the works of Cuvier, Owen, Burmeister, Leidy, Gervais, Reinhardt, and
                    others.</p>
                <p>No Eocene Edentates have yet been found in America. In the Miocene of the Pacific
                    coast of North America some remains have been discovered, assigned by Marsh to
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Moropus,</hi> the type of a distinct family, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Moropidae.</hi> There are two species, one about as large as a
                    Tapir, and one nearly twice that size. In the Lower Pliocene, well-preserved
                    remains of Edentates of very large size have been found at several widely
                    separated localities in Idaho and California. These belong to the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Morotherium,</hi> of which two species are known. East of the
                    Rocky Mountains, in the Lower Pliocene of Nebraska, a large species apparently
                    of the genus <hi rend="italic">Moropus</hi> has been discovered. None of these
                    have as yet been fully described or figured. Marsh believes that North America
                    was the original home of the Edentates, and that they spread to the southern
                    portion of the continent towards the close of the Tertiary period.</p>

                    slender, with an exceedingly short symphysis, no distinct coronoid process, and
                    a slightly elevated, elongated, flattened, condylar articular surface.
                    Vertebrae: 0 7, D 15-16, I. 3-2, S 6, C 31. Clavicles rudimentary. In the manus,
                    the first digit is very slender, the second also slender, with compressed
                    phalanges of nearly equal length. The third digit is immensely developed; though
                    its proximal phalanx is extremely short, its ungual phalanx is so long that the
                    entire length of the digit exceeds that of the second. The fourth has a long and
                    rather slender metacarpal, and three phalanges diminishing in size, the ungual
                    phalanx being very small. The fifth has the metacarpal nearly as long, but not
                    so stout as the fourth, and followed by two small phalanges, the last
                    rudimentary and conical. Claws are developed upon all but the fifth. In walking
                    the toes are kept strongly flexed, and have their points turned upwards and
                    inwards, the weight being supported upon a callous pad over the end of the fifth
                    digit, and by the dorsal surfaces of the third and fourth digits. The hind feet
                    are short and rather broad, with five subequal claws, the fourth rather longest,
                    the first shortest; the whole sole is placed on the ground in walking. Body
                    rather compressed, clothed with long, coarse hair. Tail about as long as the
                    body, and covered with very long hair; not prehensile. Ears small, oval, erect.
                    Eyes very small. Stomach consisting of a subglobular, thin-walled, cardiac
                    portion, and a muscular pyloric gizzard with dense epithelial lining. No
                    ileocolic valve, and a short wide ill-defined caecum. Mammae two, pectoral.</p>
                <p>There is one species, <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">jubata,</hi> the
                    Great Anteater, or Ant Bear, measuring 4 feet in length without the tail, and
                    upwards of 2 feet in height at the shoulder. Its prevailing colour is grey, with
                    a broad black band, bordered with white, commencing on the chest, and passing
                    obliquely over the shoulder, diminishing gradually in breadth as it approaches
                    the loins, where it ends in a point.</p>

                <p>It is extensively distributed in the tropical parts of South and Central America,
                    frequenting low swampy savannas, along the banks of rivers, and the depths of
                    the humid forests, but is novyhere abundant. Its food consists mainly of
                    termites, to obtain which it opens their nests with its powerful sharp anterior
                    claws, and as the insects swarm to the damaged part of their dwelling, it draws
                    them into its mouth by means of its long, flexible, rapidly-moving tongue
                    covered with glutinous saliva. The Great Anteater is quite terrestrial in its
                    habits, being never known to climb trees, nor does it burrow underground like
                    the Armadillos. Though generally an inoffensive animal, when attacked it can
                    defend itself vigorously and effectively with its sabre-like anterior claws. The
                    female bears but a single young at a birth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tamandua.—</hi> This genus closely resembles the last in
                    anatomical structure, but the head is much less elongated, the fur is short and
                    bristly, the tail, tapering, prehensile, with the under side throughout and the
                    whole of the terminal portion naked and scaly. The stomach is similar to that of
                    <hi rend="italic">Myrmecophaga,</hi> but with the muscular pyloric gizzard not
                    quite so strongly developed. There is a distinct ileo-colic valve and short
                    globular caecum. The fore foot has a very laτge claw on the third toe,
                    moderate-sized claws on the second and fourth, a very minute one on the first,
                    and none on the fifth, which is entirely concealed within the skin. The hind
                    foot has five subequal claws. Vertebrae: C 7, D 17, I. 2, S 5, C 37. There are
                    very rudimentary clavicles.</p>
                <p>The Tamandua <hi rend="italic">{T. tciradactyla)</hi> is much smaller than the
                    Great Anteater, and differs essentially from it in its habits, being mainly
                    arboreal. It is an inhabitant of the dense primeval forests of South and Central
                    America. As different individuals vary much in their coloration, it is possible
                    that there may be more than one species. The usual colour is yellowish-white,
                    with a broad black lateral band, covering nearly the whole of the side of the
                    body.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cycloturus.—</hi> The skull is much shorter even than in <hi
                    rend="italic">Tamandua,</hi> and is arched considerably in the longitudinal
                    direction. It differs from that of the other members of the family mainly in the
                    long canal for the posterior nares not being closed by bone below, as the
                    greater part of the palatines and the pterygoids do not meet in the middle line.
                    The mandible has a prominent, narrow, recurved coronoid and a well-developed
                    angular process; it is strongly decurved in front. Vertebrae: C 7, D 16, I. 2, S
                    4, C 40. Ribs remarkably broad and flat. Clavicles well developed. Manus
                    remarkably modified. The third digit is greatly developed at the expense of all
                    the others; it has a stout short metacarpal and but two phalanges, of which the
                    most distal is large, compressed, pointed, and much curved, and bears a very
                    strong hook-like claw. The second digit has the same number of phalanges, and
                    bears a claw, but is very much more slender than the third. The fourth is
                    represented only by the metacarpal, and one nailless phalanx, the first and
                    fifth only by very rudimentary metacarpals. The pes is also completely modified
                    into a climbing organ. The hallux is rudimentary, consisting of a metatarsal and
                    one phalanx, concealed beneath the skin, but the other four toes are subequal
                    and much curved, with long pointed compressed claws. The tuber calcanei is
                    directed towards the plantar surface, and parallel with it and extending to
                    about double its length is a greatly elongated sesamoid ossicle. These together
                    support a prominent calcarine cushion to which the nails are opposed in
                    climbing. Stomach pyriform, with muscular walls, but no distinct gizzard-like
                    portion, as in the foregoing genera. The commencement of the colon provided with
                    two small caeca, resembling those of many Birds, narrow at the base, and rather
                    dilated at their terminal blind ends, and communicating with the general cavity
                    by very minute apertures. Tail longer than the body, tapering, bare on the under
                    surface, and very prehensile. Fur soft and silky.</p>
                <p>This genus has also but one species certainly known, the Little or Two-toed
                    Anteater (C ’. <hi rend="italic">didactylus),</hi> an animal not larger than a
                    Rat, of a general yellowish colour, and exclusively arboreal in its habits. It

                <p>The greater part of the skin strongly ossified. On the back and sides the union
                    of numerous quadrate or polygonal scutes forms a hard shield, usually consisting
                    of an anterior (scapular) and posterior (pelvic) solid portion (which overhang
                    on each side the parts of the body they respectively cover, forming chambers
                    into which the limbs are withdrawn), and a variable number of rings between,
                    connected by soft flexible skin so as to allow of curvature of the body. The top
                    of the head has also a similar shield (cephalic), and the tail is usually
                    encased in bony rings or plates. The outer or exposed surfaces of the limbs are
                    protected by irregular bony scutes, not united at their margins; but the skin of
                    the inner surface of the limbs and under side of the body is soft and more or
                    less clothed with hair. Hairs also in many species project through apertures
                    between the bony scutes of the baςk. The ossified dermal plates are everywhere
                    covered by a layer of horny epidermis. Teeth numerous, simple, of persistent
                    growth, and usually monophyodont, but in one genus (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Tatusia)</hi> a succession of teeth has been observed. Zygomatic arch of skull
                    complete. Cervical vertebrae with extremely short, broad, and depressed bodies.
                    The atlas free, but the second and third, and often several of the others,
                    ankylosed together both by their bodies and arches. Lumbaι∙ vertebrae λvith
                    accessory zygomatic processes, and very large metapophyses, supporting the bony
                    carapace. Clavicles well developed. A third trochanter on the femur. Tibia and
                    fibula ankylosed at their distal extremities. Fore feet with strongly developed,
                    curved claws, adapted for digging and scratching, three, four, or five in
                    number. Hind feet plantigrade, with five toes, all provided with nails. Tongue
                    long, pointed, and extensile, though to a less degree than in the Anteaters.
                    Submaxillary glands largely developed. Stomach simple. Placenta discoidal,
                    deciduate.</p>
                <p>The animals of this family are commonly called Armadillos, a word of Spanish
                    origin, having reference to their armour-like covering. The existing species are
                    all of small or moderate size. They are mostly, though not universally,
                    nocturnal in their habits. They are omnivorous, feeding on roots, insects,
                    worms, reptiles, and carrion. They are harmless and inoffensive creatures,
                    offering no resistance when caught, their principal means of escape from their
                    enemies being the extraordinary rapidity with which they can burrow in the
                    ground, and the tenacity with which they retain their hold in their subterranean
                    retreats. Notwithstanding the shortness of their limbs they can run with great
                    rapidity. Most of the species are esteemed good eating by the natives of the
                    countries in which they live. They are all inhabitants of the open plains or the
                    forests of the tropical and temperate parts of South America, with the exception
                    of one species (<hi rend="italic">Tatusia peba),</hi> which ranges as far north
                    as Texas. Of the existing genera, <hi rend="italic">Chlamydophorus</hi> stands
                    apart from the rest in the formation of its external covering; but in all other
                    respects <hi rend="italic">Tatusia</hi> is the most aberrant form, exhibiting a
                    different type of structure of the fore feet, which in all the others shows
                    modifications, though in very varying degrees, of the same type.</p>
                <p>Subfamily Chlamydophorinae.—In most anatomical characters, especially the

                    behind, pointed in front. Muzzle subcylindrical and depressed. A conspicuous
                    rounded, rough prominence on the frontal bone, just before each orbit. Tympanic
                    prolonged into a tubular auditory meatus, curving upwards round the base of the
                    zygoma. Vertebrae: C 7, D 11, I. 3, S 10, C 15. Upper part of head and trunk
                    covered with four-sided homy plates (with very small thin ossifications
                    beneath), forming a shield, free, and overhanging the sides of the trunk, and
                    attached only along the middle line of the back. The plates are arranged in a
                    series jot distinct transverse bands, about twenty in number between the occiput
                    and the posterior truncated end, and nol divided into solid thoracic and pelvic
                    shields with movable bands between. The hinder end of the body is abruptly
                    truncated and covered by a vertically-placed, strong, solid, bony shield, of an
                    oval (transversely extended) form, covered by thin epidermic plates. This shield
                    is firmly ankylosed by five bony processes to the lιindeι part of the pelvis.
                    Through a notch in the middle of its loweι border the tail passes out. The
                    latter is rather short, cylindrical in its proximal half, and expanded and

                    stout, compressed, slightly curved, obtusely pointed claws,—the third the
                    longest, the second nearly equal to it, the fourth the next, the first and fifth
                    shorter and nearly equal.</p>
                <p>To this genus belongs one of the best-known^species of the group, the Six-banded
                    Armadillo or Encoubert (Z&gt;. <hi rend="italic">sexcinctus)</hi> of Brazil and
                    Paraguay. A very similar species, <hi rend="italic">D. villosus,</hi> the Hairy
                    Armadillo, replaces it south of the Rio Plata. There are also two very small
                    species, <hi rend="italic">D. vellerosus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">D.
                    minutus,</hi> from the Argentine Republic and North Patagonia. The latter
                    differs from the other three in having no tooth implanted in the premaxillary
                    bone.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Xenurus.—</hi> Teeth ⅜ or ⅜, of moderate size and
                    subcylindrical. The most posterior placed a little way behind the anterior root
                    of the zygoma, but far from the hinder margin of the palate. Cranium somewhat
                    elongated, much constricted behind the orbits, and immediately in front of the
                    constriction considerably dilated. Mandible slender; coronoid process very small
                    and sharp-pointed, sometimes obsolete. Vertebrae: C 7, D 12-13, I. 5, S 10, C18.
                    Head broad behind. Ears rather large and rounded, wide apart. Movable bands of
                    carapace 12-13. Tail considerably shorter than the body, and slender, covered
                    with nearly naked skin, with but a few small, scattered, dermal bony plates,
                    chiefly on the under surface and near the apex. On the fore feet the first and
                    second toes are long and slender, with small claws and the normal number of
                    phalanges; the other toes have but two phalanges; the third has an immense
                    falcate claw; the fourth and fifth similar but smaller claws. The hind feet are
                    comparatively small, with five toes, with small, triangular, blunt nails; the
                    third longest, the first shortest. The best known species of this genus, the
                    Tatouay or Cabassou, <hi rend="italic">X. unicinctus,</hi> is, after <hi
                    rend="italic">Priodon gigas,</hi> the largest of the group. It is found, though
                    not abundantly, in Surinam, Brazil, and Paraguay. Others, <hi rend="italic"
                    >X.</hi><hi rend="italic">hispidus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lugubris,</hi>
                    have been described, but little is as yet known of them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Priodon.—</hi> Teeth variable in number, and generally
                    differing on the two sides of each jaw, usually from 20 to 25 on each side above
                    and below, so that as many as 100 may be present altogether, but as life
                    advances the anterior teeth fall out, and all traces of their alveoli disappear.
                    The series extends as far back as the hinder edge of the anterior root of the
                    zygoma. They are all very small; in the anterior half of each series they are
                    strongly compressed’ having flat sides and a straight free edge; the posterior
                    teeth are more cylindrical, with flat, truncated, free surfaces. Vertebrae: C7,
                    D 12, L3, S10, C 23. Head small, elongated, conical. Ears moderate, ovate.
                    Carapace with 12-13 movable bands. Tail nearly equal to the body in length,
                    gradually tapering, closely covered with quadrangular scales, arranged in a
                    quincunx pattern. Fore feet with five toes, formed on the same plan as those of
                    <hi rend="italic">Xenurus,</hi> but with the claw of the third of still greater
                    size, and that of the others, especially the fifth, proportionately reduced.
                    Hind foot short and rounded, with five very short toes, with short, broad, flat
                    obtuse nails. The only known species, the Great Armadillo <hi rend="italic">(P.
                    gigas),</hi> is by far the largest of existing, members of the family, measuring
                    rather more than 3 feet from the tip of the nose to the root of the tail, the
                    tail being about 20 inches long. It inhabits the forests of Surinam and Brazil.
                    The powerful falcate claws of its fore feet enable it to dig with great
                    facility. Its food consists chiefly of termites and other insects, but it is
                    said to attack and uproot newly-made graves for the purpose of devouring the
                    flesh of the bodies contained in them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tolypeutes.—</hi> Teeth ⅜ or ⅞, rather large in proportion to
                    the size of the skull, the hinder end of the series reaching nearly to the
                    posterior margin of the palate. Vertebrae: C 7, D11, I. 3, S 12,.C 13. Ears
                    placed low on the sides of the head, rather large, broadly ovate. Carapace with
                    its scapular and pelvic shields very free at the sides of the body, forming
                    large chambers into which the limbs can be readily withdrawn. Only three movable
                    bands. Tail short, conical, covered with large bony tubercles. The fore feet
                    formed on the same type as the last, but the peculiarities carried out to a
                    still greater extent. The claw of the third toe is very long and falcate, the
                    first and fifth greatly reduced and sometimes wanting. On the hind foot the
                    three middle toes have broad, flat, subequal nails, forming together a kind of
                    tripartite hoof; the first and fifth much shorter and with more compressed
                    nails.</p>
                <p>The Armadillos of this genus have the power of rolling themselves up into a
                    perfect ball, the shield on the top of the head and the tuberculated dorsal
                    surface of the tail exactly fitting into and filling up the apertures left by
                    the notches at either end of the carapace. This appears to be their usual means
                    of defence when frightened or surprised, as they do not burrow like the other
                    species. They run very quickly, with a very peculiar gait, only the tips of the
                    claws of the fore feet touching the ground. Three species are described :— <hi
                    rend="italic">T. tricinctus,</hi> the Apar; <hi rend="italic">T. conurus,</hi>
                    the Matico; and <hi rend="italic">T. muriei.</hi></p>
                <p>Subfamily Tatusiinae.—This contains but one genus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tatusia.</hi> —Teeth f or ∣, very small, subcylindrical. The first and second
                    subcompressed, the last considerably smaller than the others. Theypre-sent the
                    remarkable peculiarity (unique among Edentates, so far as is yet known) of all
                    being, with the exception of the last, preceded by two-rooted milk teeth, which
                    are not changed until the animal has nearly attained its full size. Vertebrae: C
                    7, D 9-11, I. 5, S 8, C 20-27. Head narrow, with a long,,, narrow,
                    subcylindrical. obliquely-truncated snout. Ears rather large, ovate, and erect,
                    placed close together on the occiput. Carapace with seven to nine distinct
                    movable bands. Body generally elongated and narrow. Tail moderate or long,
                    gradually tapering; its dermal plates forming ve∏r distinct rings for the
                    greater part of its length. Fore feet with four visible toes, and a concealed
                    clawless rudiment of the fifth. Claws all long, slightly curved, and very
                    slender, the third and fourth <pb
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n409/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0409-0388"/> subequal and alike, the first and fourth much
                    shorter. Hind feet with five toes, all armed with strong, slightly-curved,
                    conical, obtusely pointed nails. The third longest, then the second and fourth;
                    the first and fifth much shorter than the others.</p>
                <p>This genus differs from all the other Armadillos in having a pair of inguinal
                    mammae, in addition to the usual pectoral pair, and in producing a large number
                    (four to ten) of young at a birth, all the others having usually but one or
                    two.</p>
                <p>The Peba Armadillo, <hi rend="italic">T. septemcincta,</hi> is a well-known
                    species, having an extensive range from Texas to Paraguay. It is replaced in the
                    more southern regions of South America by a smaller species, with shorter tail,
                    the Mulita (7 ’. <hi rend="italic">hybrida),</hi> so called from the resemblance
                    of its head and ears to those of a mule. <hi rend="italic">T. ka}τpleri</hi> is
                    a large species or variety from Surinam.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Fossil remains of <hi rend="italic">Dasypodidae</hi> have been found by Lund and
                    others in the caves of Brazil in deposits of Pleistocene age. Some are
                    attributable to existing genera, but others are assigned to distinct
                    modifications of the type called <hi rend="italic">Euryodon, Chlamydotherium,
                    Eιιtatus,</hi> &amp;c. In the same region, but still more abundantly in the
                    fluviatile deposits which cover the country in the neighbourhood of Buenos
                    Ayres, are found the remains of one of the most remarkable forms of mammals yet
                    discovered, the Glyptodons, or <hi rend="italic">Hoplophoridae</hi> (fig. 39).
                    They differ from the existing <hi rend="italic">Dasypodidae</hi> in their large
                    size, and in having the carapace composed of a solid piece (formed by the union
                    of a multitude of bony dermal scutes) without any movable rings, and in having
                    also a ventral piece or plastron. The facial portion of the skull is very short.
                    A long process of the maxillary bone descends from the anterior part of the
                    zygomatic arch. The ascending ramus of the mandible is remarkably high. The
                    teeth are ⅜ in all known species, all much alike, having two deep grooves or
                    flutings on each side, so as to divide them into three nearly distinct lobes
                    (fig. 40). The vertebral column is almost entirely ankylosed into a solid tube,
                    but there is a complex joint at the base of the neck, to allow the head being
                    retracted within the carapace. The limbs are very strong, and the feet short
                    andbroad, resembling externally those of an elephant or tortoise. Many species
                    of the family have been described and figured, especially by Burmeister (in the

                <p>Covered externally (except the under surface of the body and inside of the limbs)
                    with large imbricated horny scales, with scattered hairs growing in the
                    intervals. No teeth. Tongue long, vermiform, and protractile. No accessory
                    articular processes to the lumbar vertebrae, but the anterior zygapophyses
                    largely developed and very concave, completely embracing the semicylindri-cal
                    surfaces of the posterior zygapophyses. Limbs short, with five complete digits
                    on each foot. Scaphoid and lunar bone of carpus united. Uterus bicornuate.
                    Placenta diffused and non-deciduate. The species are mainly terrestrial and
                    fossorial, though one is partially arboreal. All belong to the Ethiopian and
                    Oriental regions of the Old World.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manis.—</hi> Skull somewhat of the form of an elongated cone,
                    with the small end turned forwards; very smooth and free from crests and ridges.
                    No distinction between the orbits and temporal fossa*. The zygomatic arch
                    usually incomplete, owing to the absence of the malar bone. No distinct lacrymal
                    bone. Palate long and narrow. The pterygoids extend backwards as far as the
                    tympanies, but do not meet in the middle line below. Tympanic ankylosed to the
                    surrounding bones, and more or* less bullate, but not produced into a tubular
                    auditory meatus. Kami of mandible very slender and straight, without any angle
                    or coronoid process. From near the anterior extremity of the upper edge a sharp,
                    conical, tooth-like process projects upwards and outwards. No clavicles. No
                    third trochanter to the femur. Ungual phalanges bifid at their terminations.
                    Caudal vertebrae with very long strong transverse processes and numerous chevron
                    bones. Tongue long, vermiform, flattened towards the tip. The retractor or
                    sterno-glossal muscles arise from the hinder extremity of the immensely
                    prolonged ensiform cartilage of the sternum. Stomach with thick, muscular walls
                    and lining membrane, and with a special gland near the middle of the great
                    curvature, consisting of a mass of complex secreting follicles, the ducts of
                    which terminate in a common orifice. No caecum. A gall-bladder. Head small,
                    depressed, narrow, pointed in front, with a very small mouth-opening. Eyes and
                    pinna of ear very small. Body elongated, narrow. Tail more or less elongated,
                    convex above, flat underneath. The whole of the upper surface of the head, the
                    upper surface and sides of the body, the whole of the tail, and the outer sides
                    of the extremities covered with large, overlapping, horny scales, with usually a
                    few stiff hairs growing between and projecting beyond them. The sides and under
                    surface of the head, the under surface of the body, and the inner sides of the
                    limbs without scales but with a rather scanty covering of hair. Limbs short. In
                    walking the dorsal surface and outer sides of the phalanges of the two outer
                    digits of the front feet alone rest on the ground, the points of the nails
                    turning upwards and inwards. The third toe the longest, with a powerful
                    compressed curved claw, the second and fourth with similar but smaller claws,
                    that of the pollex often almost rudimentary. Hind feet plantigrade, with hallux
                    very short, and four other toes subequal, with moderate, curved, subcompressed
                    nails.</p>
                <p>The animals of this genus, called Pangolins or Scaly Anteaters, are all of small
                    or moderate size, terrestrial and burrowing, and feed mainly on termites. One
                    small African species climbs trees. They can roll themselves up in a ball when
                    in danger. Their peculiar elongated form, short limbs, long, gradually-tapering
                    tail, and scaly covering give them on a superficial inspection more the
                    appearance of reptiles than of mammals. The species are not numerous, but may be
                    grouped into three sections. (1) <hi rend="italic">Manis</hi> proper. Tail
                    considerably exceeding in length both head and body. Scales not covering the
                    dorsal surface of the manus. On fore feet the first toe exceedingly small, but
                    with a distinct short nail; second, fourth, and fifth subequal, with moderate
                    compressed claws; third greatly exceeding the others, with a much larger falcate
                    claw. <hi rend="smallcaps">Two</hi> species, both from West Africa: <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ. longicaudata</hi> (vertebrae: C 7, D 13, I. 5, S 3, C 46), and
                    <hi rend="italic">Μ. tricuspus</hi> (vertebrae: C 7, D 13, I. 6, S 3, C 44). (2)
                    All the others have the scaly covering of the fore limbs extending to the claws,
                    and the tail not exceeding the length of the head and body. On the fore feet the
                    first and fifth toes are equal and very small, the second and fourth equal and
                    longer, the third longest, but not so disproportionately so as in the other
                    section. The tails of most of these are broad at the base and taper towards the
                    extremity. They constitute the genus <hi rend="italic">Pholidotus</hi> of Gray,
                    and include <hi rend="italic">Μ. gigantea,</hi> West Africa, the largest species
                    of the group, of which the head and body measure 2 feet 6 inches, and the tail
                    the same. Vertebrae: C 7, D 13, I. 6, S 4, C 28. <hi rend="italic">Μ.

                    nearly as broad as the body for the whole of its length, and rounded at the end,
                    constitutes the genus <hi rend="italic">Smutsia</hi> of Gray.</p>

                <p>External surface scantily covered with bristle-like hairs. Teeth numerous, and of
                    peculiar and complex structure, being traversed by a number of parallel vertical
                    pulp-canals. Lumbar vertebrae with no accessory zygapophyses. Femur with a third
                    trochanter. Fore feet without pollex, but all the other digits well developed,
                    with strong moderate-sized nails, suited to digging, the plantar surfaces of
                    which rest on the ground in λvalking. Hind feet with five sαbequal toes. Mouth
                    elongated and tubular. Tongue subvermi-form. Placenta broadly zonular. Feed on
                    animal substances. Terrestrial and fossorial in habits. Limited to the Ethiopian

                    eight in the lower jaw; but they are never all in place at one time, as the
                    small anterior teeth are shed before the series is completed behind. In the
                    adult they number usually five on each side above and below, of which the first
                    two are simple and compressed, the next two larger and longitudinally grooved at
                    the sides, the most posterior simple and cylindrical. The structure of all these
                    teeth is quite peculiar among mammals, though resembling that of some fishes.
                    Their summits are rounded before they are worn; their bases do not taper to a
                    root, but are evenly truncated and continually growing. Each tooth is made up of
                    an aggregation of parallel dental systems, having a slender pulp cavity in the
                    centre, from which the dentinal tubes radiate outwards, and being closely packed
                    together each system assumes a polygonal outline as seen in transverse section.
                    No evidence of any vertical succession of teeth has been discovered. Skull
                    moderately elongated. The facial portion sub- •cylindrical and slightly
                    tapering. The zygoma complete and slender. The palate ends posteriorly in the
                    thickened transverse border of the palatines, and is not continued back by the
                    pterygoids. The tympanic is annular, and not ankylosed to the surrounding bones.
                    The mandible is slender anteriorly,, but rises high posteriorly, with a slender
                    recurved coronoid, and an ascending pointed process on the hinder edge below the
                    condyle, which is small, oval, and looks forwards as much as upwards. Vertebrae:
                    C 7, D 13, I. 8, S 6, C 25. The large number of lumbar vertebrae is peculiar
                    among Edentates. Tongue less vermiform than in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Myrmecophaga,</hi> being thick and fleshy at the base, and gradually tapering
                    to the apex. The salivary apparatus is developed much in the same manner as in
                    that genus, but the duct of the submaxillary gland has no reservoir. The stomach
                    consists of a large subglobular cardiac portion, with a very thick, soft, and
                    corrugated lining membrane, and a smaller muscular, pyloric part, with a
                    comparatively thin and smooth lining. There is a very distinct ileo-caecal
                    valve, and a considerable-sized caecum; also a gall-bladder. No pollex to the
                    fore foot. All the other usual toes well developed, with strong, subcompressed
                    nails, flatter on the hind foot. Head elongated, with a tubular snout, terminal
                    nostrils, and small mouthopening. Ears large, pointed, erect. Tail nearly as
                    long as the body, cylindrical, very thick at the base, tapering to the
                    extremity.</p>
                <p>The best known species is the Cape Anteater (0. <hi rend="italic">capcnsis),</hi>
                    or “Aard-Vark” (Earth Pig) of the Dutch colonists, from South Africa, an animal
                    not altogether unlike a Pig in size and general appearance. It lives in burrows
                    in the ground, and feeds chiefly on ants and other insects. A second species, or

                <p>The purely aquatic habits and Fish-like form of the animals of this order caused
                    them to be formerly confounded with the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> but a
                    more intimate knowledge of their structure has shown that they really belong to
                    a widely different type of the class.</p>
                <p>The head is rounded and not disproportionate in size as compared with the trunk,
                    from which it is scarcely separated by any externally visible constriction or
                    neck. Nostrils valvular, separate, and placed above the fora part of the obtuse,
                    truncated muzzle. Eyes very small, with imperfectly formed eyelids, capable,
                    however, of contraction, and with a well-developed nictitating membrane. Ear
                    without any pinna. Mouth of small or moderate size, with tumid lips beset with
                    stiff bristles. General form of the body depressed fusiform. No dorsal fin. Tail
                    flattened and horizontally expanded. Fore limbs paddle-shaped, the digits being
                    enveloped in a common cutaneous covering, though sometimes rudiments of nails
                    are present. No trace of hind limbs. External surface covered with a tough,
                    finely wrinkled, or very rugous skin, naked, or with fine hairs sparsely
                    scattered over it.</p>
                <p>The skeleton is remarkable for the massiveness and density of most of the bones
                    of which it is composed, especially the skull and ribs, which must add to the
                    specific gravity of these slow-moving animals, and aid in keeping them to the
                    bottom of the shallow waters in which they dwell, while feeding on aquatic
                    vegetables. The skull presents many peculiarities, among which may be indicated
                    the large size and backward position of the anterior narial aperture, a further
                    modification of that met with in the Tapirs among Ungulates, and presenting some
                    approach to that so characteristic of the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea.</hi> The
                    nasal bones are generally absent in the recent forms, or are only found in a
                    most rudimentary condition, attached to the edge of the frontals, far away from
                    the middle line; but in some at least of the extinct species these bones, though
                    small in size, are normal in situation and relations. In very few other respects
                    does the skull present any resemblance to that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cetacea.</hi> In the spinal column none of the vertebrae are united together to
                    form a sacrum, and the flat ends of the bodies do not ossify separately, so as
                    to form disk-like epiphyses in the young state, as in nearly all other mammals.
                    The anterior caudal vertebrae have well-developed chevron bones. In one genus
                    <hi rend="italic">(Manatus)</hi> there are only six cervical vertebrae. There
                    are no clavicles. The humerus has a small but distinct trochlear articulation at
                    the elbow-joint. The two bones of the forearm are about equally developed, and
                    generally ankylosed together at both extremities. The carpus is short and broad,
                    and the digits five in number with moderately elongated and flattened phalanges,
                    which are never increased in number beyond the limit usual in the <hi

                <p>Two kinds of teeth, incisors and molars, separated by a wide interval, are
                    generally present. The former may be developed into tusks in the upper jaw, or
                    may be quite rudimentary. The molars vary much in character. In one genus <hi
                    rend="italic">(Rytina)</hi> no teeth of any kind are present, at least in the
                    adult. In all, the anterior part of the palate, and a corresponding surface on
                    the prolonged symphysis of the lower jaw, are covered with rough horny plates of
                    peculiar structure, which doubtless assist in mastication. The tongue is small
                    and fixed in position, with a surface resembling that of the plates just spoken
                    of. The salivary glands are largely developed. The stomach is compound, being
                    divided by a valvular constriction into two principal cavities, the first of
                    which is provided with a singular glandular pouch near the cardiac end, and the
                    second usually with a pair of elongated, conical, caecal sacs or diverticula.
                    The intestinal canal is long, and with very muscular walls. There is a caecum,
                    either simple, conical, and with extremely thick walls, as in <hi rend="italic"

                    the shore. Their food consists entirely of aquatic plants, either marine algae
                    or freshwater grasses, upon which they browse beneath the surface, as the
                    terrestrial herbivorous mammals do upon the green pastures on shore. They are
                    generally gregarious, slow and inactive in their movements, mild, inoffensive,
                    and apparently unintelligent in disposition. Though occasionally found stranded
                    by the tide or waves, there is no satisfactory evidence that they voluntarily
                    leave the water to bask or feed on the shore. The habit of the Dugong of raising
                    its round head out of water, and carrying its young under the fore fin, seems to
                    have given rise, among the imaginative early voyagers in the Indian Ocean, to
                    the legendary beings, half human and half fish, in allusion to which the name
                    <hi rend="italic">Sirenia</hi> was bestowed by liliger on the order, though
                    certainly the face of a Dugong, when closely inspected, does not bear the
                    slightest resemblance to that of the mermaid of romance. The species now
                    existing are very few, and there is reason to believe that the time is not far
                    distant when they will all become extinct. One species, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhytina stelleri,</hi> of the North Pacific, was totally exterminated through
                    the agency of man during the last century; and the others, being valuable for
                    their flesh as food, for their hides, and especially for the oil obtained from
                    the thick layer of fat which lies immediately beneath their skin, rapidly
                    diminish in numbers as civilized populations occupy the regions forming their
                    natural habitat. The surviving species are confined to the tropical regions of
                    the shores of both sides of the Atlantic and the great rivers which empty
                    themselves into that ocean, and to the coasts of the Indian Ocean from the Red
                    Sea to North Australia. In the Miocene and early Pliocene epoch Sirenians
                    abounded in the seas of Europe, and their remains have been found in deposits of
                    corresponding periods of North America. Evidence has also been discovered of the
                    existence of an animal of the group in the seas at the bottom of which the

                    far to bridge over the distinction between them.</p>

                    before the posterior come into use; similar in characters from beginning to end
                    of the series; with square, enamelled crowns, the grinding surface raised into
                    tuberculated transverse ridges. The upper teeth with two ridges and three roots,
                    the lower teeth with an additional (posterior) ridge or talon and two roots. The
                    cervical vertebrae present the remarkable anomaly of being reduced to six in
                    number, the usual vertebral formula being C 6, D 15-18, I. and C 25-29. Rostrum
                    of the skull, formed by the union of the premaxillae in front of the anterior
                    narial aperture, shorter than the length of the aperture and scarcely deflected
                    from the basi-cranial axis. Tail entire, rounded or shovel-shaped. Rudimentary

                    rivers which empty themselves into, the Atlantic within the tropics. The

                    though they differ but little from each other in anatomical characters and in
                    habits. They are rather fluviatile than marine, ascending large rivers almost to
                    their sources. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Manatee.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    incisors, directed downwards and forwards, partially coated with enamel. In the
                    male they have persistent pulps, and bevelled cutting edges, which project a
                    short distance from the mouth, but in the female, though they remain through
                    life in the alveolar cavity, they are not exserted, and, the pulp cavity being
                    filled with osteodentine, they soon cease to grow (as in the female Narwhal). In
                    the young there is also a second small deciduous incisor on each side above. At
                    this age there are also beneath the horny plate which covers the anterior
                    portion of the mandible four pairs of slender conical teeth lodged in wide
                    alveolar depressions. These become absorbed before the animal reaches maturity.
                    The molars are usually ⅜, sometimes ∣, altogether, but not all in place at once,
                    as the first falls before the last rises above the gum; they are more or less
                    cylindrical in section, except the last, which is compressed and grooved
                    laterally, without distinction into crown and Toot, increasing in size from
                    before backwards, with persistent pulps and no enamel. The summits of the crowns
                    are tuberculated before wearing, afterwards flattened or slightly concave. Skull
                    with rostrum formed by the union of the premaxillae in front of the narial
                    aperture, longer than the aperture itself, bending downwards at a right angle
                    with the basi-cranial axis, and enclosing the sockets of the large incisor
                    tusks. Anterior part of the lower jaw bent down in a corresponding manner.
                    Vertebrae: C7, D18-19, I. and C 30. Tail broadly notched in the middle line, and
                    with two pointed lateral lobes. No nails on the fore limbs. Caecum single.</p>
                <p>The Dugongs are more distinctly marine in their habits than the Manatees, feeding
                    chiefly on sea-water algae. They inhabit the shallow bays and creeks of the Red
                    Sea, east coast of Africa, Ceylon, islands of the Bay of Bengal and the
                    Indo-Malayan Archipelago (including the Philippines), and the north coast of
                    Australia, ranging from Barrow Reefs on the west to Moreton Bay on the east.
                    Though the distinctive characters are not very obvious, they have been divided
                    into three species, according to the localities which they respectively inhabit
                    :— <hi rend="italic">H. tabernaculi</hi> from the Red Sea, <hi rend="italic">H.

                    Australia. The last-named has lately been the object of a regular “fishery,”
                    chiefly on account of its oil, which is peculiarly clear, limpid, and free from
                    disagreeable smell, and is said to have the same medical properties as cod-liver
                    oil. Although often stated in books to attain the length of 20 feet when adult,
                    there does not appear to be any evidence from actual specimens in museums that
                    Dugongs ever reach half that size, 8 feet being the common length of adult
                    animals.</p>

                    his accomplished companion, the German naturalist Steller, he was wrecked upon
                    it in 1741. Twenty-seven years afterwards (1768), as is commonly supposed, the

                    for the interesting account of its anatomy and habits left by Steller, and the
                    few more or less perfect skeletons which have recently rewarded the researches
                    carried on in the frozen soil of the islands around which it dwelt. There is no
                    evidence at present of its having inhabited any other coasts than those of the
                    islands just named, though it can hardly be supposed that its range was always
                    so restricted. When first discovered it was extremely numerous in the shallow
                    bays round Behring’s Island, finding abundant nutriment in the large laminariae
                    growing in the sea. Its extirpation is entirely due to the Russian hunters and
                    traders who followed upon the track of the explorers, and who, upon Steller’s
                    suggestion, lived upon the flesh of the great Sea-cows. Its restricted
                    distribution, large size, inactive habits, fearlessness of man, and even its
                    affectionate disposition towards its own kind when wounded or in distress, all
                    contributed to accelerate its final extinction.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Extinct</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Sirenia.</hi></p>
                <p>The Miocene and early Pliocene seas of Europe abounded in Sirenians, to which the
                    generic name of <hi rend="italic">Halitherium</hi> was given by Kaup. They had
                    large tusk-like incisors in the upper jaw, as in the existing Dugongs, though
                    not so greatly developed. Their molar teeth were ⅛ or ⅞, anteriorly simple and
                    single-rooted, posteriorly those above with three and those below with two
                    roots, and with enamelled and tuberculated or ridged crowns, in all which
                    respects they more resemble those of the Manatee than of the Dugong. The
                    anterior molars were deciduous. Some species at least had nasal bones, short,
                    broad, but normal in position, whereas in all the existing genera these bones
                    are quite rudimentary. Another and still more important evidence of conformity
                    to the general mammalian type is the better development of the pelvic bone, and
                    the presence of a small styliform femur articulated to the acetabulum, although
                    no traces of any other part of the limb have been discovered. These ancient
                    Sirenians were thus, in dental, cranial, and other osteological characters, less
                    specialized than are either of the existing species, and, if the intermediate
                    links could be discovered, might well be looked upon as ancestral forms from
                    which the latter have been derived, but at present the transitional conditions
                    have not been detected. So far as is yet known, when changes in the physical
                    conditions of the European seas rendered them unfitted to be the habitation of
                    Sirenians, the Halitherium type still prevailed. If the existing Dugongs and
                    Manatees are descended from it, their evolution must have taken place during the
                    Pliocene and Pleistocene epochs, the one in seas to the east, the other to the
                    west of the African continent, which has long formed a barrier to their
                    intercommunication. Halitherium remains have been found in many parts of
                    Germany, especially near Darmstadt, also in France, Italy, Belgium, Malta, the
                    isthmus of Suez, &amp;c. Until lately none were known from England, probably
                    owing to the absence of beds of an age corresponding to those in which they are
                    found on the European continent; but recently a skull and several teeth have
                    been detected among the rolled debris of Miocene formations, out of which the
                    Red Crag of Suffolk is partially composed. The species are not yet
                    satisfactorily characterized. Some of them appear to have attained a larger size
                    than the existing Manatee or Dugong. One of these from the Pliocene of Italy and
                    France, having but ⅛ molar teeth, has been separated generically under the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">Felsinotherium</hi> by Capellini, by whom it has been fully
                    described. A portion of a skull found in Belgium has been named <hi
                    rend="italic">Crassitherium</hi> by Van Beneden; and some compressed teeth,
                    somewhat similar to but larger than those of the Dugong, discovered in the
                    department of Lot-et-Garonne, France, gave origin to the genus <hi rend="italic"

                    >Halitherium,</hi> but the skull is otherwise very similar, as are the molar
                    teeth. The incisors are very large, exserted, strongly compressed, almost
                    sabre-like, rounded on the upper or anterior surface, sharp below, concave on
                    the external and convex on the inner side, and transversely striated.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pachyacanthus</hi> of Brandt, from the Vienna basin, is also,
                    according to Van Beneden, another form of <hi rend="italic">Sirenia,</hi> of
                    which, however, the skull is not known. In various Miocene and perhaps Eocene
                    marine formations of the United States of America remains of Sirenians have been
                    found, but mostly in such a fragmentary condition that they afford at present
                    little evidence of the early history of the group in that country. A more
                    satisfactory discovery is that of a nearly complete skull and some bones from a
                    limestone Tertiary formation in Jamaica. It is of smaller size than the Manatee,
                    and as far as the teeth are concerned, of a still more generalized character
                    than <hi rend="italic">Halitherium,</hi> the dentition being apparently <hi
                    rend="italic">i ⅜, c ⅜, p ⅜,</hi> wι∣=48. The incisors are small, not developed
                    into tusks; thé canines (wanting in all existing Sirenians) are rather larger
                    than the incisors, judging by the sockets; and the molars are bilophodont, and
                    covered with enamel. It has been described by Professor Owen under the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Prorastomus sirenoides.</hi> Unfortunately we have no
                    knowledge of the geological antiquity of the formation in which it was embedded.
                    Lastly must be mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Eothcrium egyptiacum,</hi> Owen,
                    founded on the cast of a brain, with a small quantity of surrounding bone,
                    discovered in the nummulitic limestone of Eocene age of the Mokattam Hills, near
                    Cairo. The brain is narrower than in <hi rend="italic">Manatus,</hi> and
                    resembles that of <hi rend="italic">Halitherium.</hi> This is of interest as the

                <p>This is perhaps the most distinctly circumscribed and natural of all the larger
                    groups into which the class is divided.</p>
                <p>The external form is Fish-like, the body being fusiform, passing anteriorly into
                    the head without any distinct constriction or neck, and posteriorly tapering off
                    gradually towards the extremity of the tail, which is provided with a pair of
                    lateral, pointed expansions of skin supported by dense fibrous tissue, called
                    “flukes,” forming together a horizontally placed triangular propelling organ,
                    notched in the middle line behind.</p>
                <p>The head is generally large, in some species attaining to even more than
                    one-third of the entire length of the animal, and the aperture of the mouth is
                    always wide, and bounded by stiff immobile lips. The fore limbs are reduced to
                    the condition of flattened ovoid paddles, encased in a continuous integument,
                    showing no external sign of division into fore arm and manus, or of separate
                    digits, and without any trace of nails. There are no sigμs of hind limbs visible
                    externally. The general surface of the skin is smooth and glistening, and devoid
                    of hair, although in many species there are a few fine bristles in the
                    neighbourhood of the mouth, which may persist through life or be present only in
                    the young state. Immediately beneath the skin, and intimately connected with it,
                    is a thick layer of fat, held together by a dense mesh of areolar tissue,
                    constituting the « blubber,” which serves the purpose of the hairy covering of
                    other mammals in retaining the heat of the body. In nearly all species a
                    compressed median dorsal tegumentary fin is present. The eye is small, and is
                    not provided with a nictitating membrane or true lacrymal apparatus. The
                    external auditory meatus is a very minute aperture in the skin situated at a
                    short distance behind the eye, and there is no vestige of a pinna. The nostrils
                    open separately or by a single crescentic valvular aperture, not at the
                    extremity of the snout, but near the vertex.</p>
                <p>The bones generally are spongy in texture, the cavities being filled with oil. In
                    the vertebral column, the cervical region is remarkably short and immobile, and
                    the vertebrae, originally always seven in number, are in many species more or
                    less fused together into a solid mass. The odontoid process of the axis, when
                    that bone is free, is usually very obtuse, or even obsolete. None of the
                    vertebrae are united <pb facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n413/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0413-0392"/> together to form a sacrum. The lumbar and caudal
                    vertebrae are numerous and large, and, as their arches are not connected by any
                    articular processes (zygapophyses), they are capable of a very free motion in
                    all directions. The epiphyses at the ends of the vertebral bodies are very
                    distinct flattened disks, not uniting until after the animal has attained its
                    full dimensions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is
                    an important distinction from the <hi rend="italic">Sirenia,</hi> but a
                    character common to nearly all other mammals. It is doubtful whether there is
                    any foundation for the statement that these epiphyses remain ununited for an
                    exceptionally long period in the <hi rend="italic">Cet(tcea.</hi></p></note>
                    There are largely developed chevron bones, the presence of which indicates the
                    distinction between the caudal and lumbar vertebrae.</p>
                <p>The skull is modified in a very peculiar manner. The brain-case is short, broad,
                    and high, almost spherical in fact. The supra-occipital bone rises upwards and
                    forwards from the foramen magnum, to meet the frontale at the vertex, completely
                    excluding the parietals from the upper region of the cranium. The frontale are
                    expanded laterally to form the roof of the orbits. The anterior narial aperture
                    opens upwards, and has in front of it a more or less horizontally prolonged
                    rostrum, formed of the maxillae, premaxillae, vomer, and mesethmoid cartilage,
                    extending forwards to form the upper jaw or roof of the mouth.</p>
                <p>There are no clavicles. The humerus is freely movable on the scapula at the
                    shoulder-joint, but beyond this the articulations of the limb are imperfect,
                    flattened ends of the bones coming in contact with each other, with fibrous
                    tissue interposed, allowing of scarcely any motion. The radius and ulna are
                    distinct, and about equally developed, and much flattened, as are all the bones
                    of the manus. There are four, or more commonly five, digits, and the number of
                    the phalanges of the second and third digits always exceeds the normal number in
                    mammals, sometimes very considerably; they present the exceptional character of
                    having epiphyses at both ends.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A character repeated in some of the Seals.</p></note> The
                    pelvis is represented by a pair of small styliform bones placed longitu dinally,
                    suspended below and at some distance from the vertebral column at the
                    commencement of the caudal region. These appear to represent the ischia, as the
                    crura of the corpora cavernosa are attached to them. In some species, to the
                    outer surface of these are fixed other small bones or cartilages, the rudiments
                    of the hind limb.</p>
                <p>Teeth are generally present, but exceedingly variable in number. In the existing
                    species, they are of simple, uniform character, all having conical or compressed
                    crowns and single roots, and are never preceded by milk teeth. They are
                    therefore homodont and monophyodont. In one group, the Mystacocetes, the teeth
                    are absent (except in the foetal condition), and the palate is provided with
                    numerous transversely placed horny laminae or “baleen.” The salivary glands are
                    rudimentary or absent. The stomach is multilocular. The intestinal canal simple,
                    and only in some species provided with a small caecum. The liver is very little
                    fissured, and there is no gall-bladder. The vascular system is greatly
                    complicated by arterial and venous plexuses, or <hi rend="italic">retia
                    mirabilia.</hi> The larynx is of peculiar shape, the arytenoid cartilages and
                    the epiglottis being much elongated, and together forming a tubular
                    prolongation, which projects into the posterior nares, and when embraced by the
                    soft palate forms a continuous passage between the nostrils and the trachea, as
                    in the Ungulates, but in a more perfect manner. The brain is large relatively to
                    the size of the animal, very round in form, and with its surface divided by
                    sulci into very numerous and complex convolutions. The kidneys are deeply
                    lobulated. The testes are abdominal. There are no vesiculae seminales, nor os
                    penis. The uterus is bicornuate, the placenta non-deciduate and diffuse. The
                    mammae are two in number, and the nipples placed in depressions on each side of
                    the vulva. The principal ducts of the gland are dilated during lactation into
                    large reservoirs, into which the milk collects, and from which it is injected by
                    the action of a compressor muscle into the mouth of the young animal, by which
                    means the process of sucking under water is greatly facilitated and
                    expedited.</p>
                <p>The animals of the order <hi rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> abound in all known seas,
                    and some species are inhabitants of the larger rivers of South America and Asia.
                    Their organization necessitates their passing their life entirely in the water,
                    as on land they are absolutely helpless. They have, however, to rise very
                    frequently to the surface for the purpose of respiration; and, in relation to
                    the constant upward and downward movement in the water thus necessitated, their
                    principal instrument of motion, the tail, is expanded horizontally, quite unlike
                    that of a Fish, whose movements are mainly in straightforward or lateral
                    directions. The position of the respiratory orifice or nostril on the highest
                    part of the head is very important for this mode of life, as it is the only part
                    of the body the exposure of which above the surface is absolutely necessary. Of
                    the numerous erroneous ideas connected with natural history, few are so
                    widespread and still so firmly believed, notwithstanding repeated expositions of
                    its falsity, as that the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> spout out through their
                    blowholes water taken in at the mouth. The fact is, the “spouting,” or more
                    properly “blowing,” of the Whale is nothing more than the ordinary act of
                    expiration, which, taking place at longer intervals than inland animals, is
                    performed with a greater amount of emphasis. The moment the animal rises to the
                    surface it forcibly expels from its lungs the air taken in at the last
                    inspiration, which of course is highly charged with watery vapour in consequence
                    of the natural respiratory changes. This, rapidly condensing in the cold
                    atmosphere in which the phenomenon is generally observed, forms a column of
                    steam or spray, which has been erroneously taken for <pb
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n414/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0414-0393"/> water. It also often happens, especially when the
                    surface Of the ocean is agitated into waves, that the animal commences its
                    expiratory puff before the orifice has quite cleared the top of the water, some
                    of which may thus be driven upwards with the blast, tending to complete the
                    illusion. In hunting Whales the harpoon often pierces the lungs or air passages
                    of the unfortunate victim, and then fountains of blood may be forced high in the
                    air through the blowholes, as commonly depicted in scenes of Arctic adventure;
                    but this is nothing more (allowance being made for the Whale’s peculiar mode of
                    breathing) than what always follows severe wounds of the respiratory organs of
                    other mammals.</p>
                <p>All the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> are predaceous, subsisting on living
                    animal food of some kind. One genus alone <hi rend="italic">(Orca)</hi> eats
                    other warm-blooded animals, as seals, and even members of its own order, both
                    large and small. Many feed on fish, others on small floating crustaceans,
                    pteropods, and medusae, while the principal staple of the food of many is
                    constituted by the various species of cephalopods, <hi rend="italic">Loligo</hi>
                    and other <hi rend="italic">Teuthidae,</hi> which must abound in some seas in
                    vast numbers, as they form almost the entire support of some of the largest
                    members of the order. In size the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> vary much, some
                    of the smaller Dolphins scarcely exceeding <hi rend="italic">4 feet</hi> in
                    length, while others are the most colossal of all animals. It is true that most
                    statements of their bulk found in general and even zoological literature are
                    greatly exaggerated, but even when reduced to their actual dimensions (which
                    will be mentioned under the respective genera) some of the existing Whales
                    exceed in size that of any animal living either at present or in former times of
                    which we have any certain evidence. With some exceptions, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cetacea</hi> generally are timid inoffensive animals, active in their
                    movements, and very affectionate in their disposition towards one another,
                    especially the mother towards the young, of which there is usually but one, or
                    at most two, at a time. They are generally gregarious, swimming in herds or
                    “schools” (so termed by the whalers) sometimes amounting to many thousands in
                    number; though some species have hitherto only been met with either singly or in
                    pairs.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Relations of the different Cetacea to each other and to other
                    Mammals.—</hi> As before said, the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> form a
                    perfectly well-defined group, sharply separated from all other mammals, and with
                    no outlying or doubtful forms at present known. Among the existing members of
                    the order, there are two very distinct types, the Toothed Whales or <hi
                    rend="italic">Odontoceti</hi> and the Baleen Whales or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mystacoceti,</hi> which present as many marked distinguishing structural

                    >Mammalia</hi> which are reckoned as orders. The extinct <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zeuglodon,</hi> so far as its characters are known, does not fall into either
                    of these groups, but is in some respects an annectant form, and therefore must
                    be placed, provisionally at least, in a third group by itself.</p>
                <p>The Mystacocetes appear at first sight to be the most specialized and aberrant of
                    the existing <hi rend="italic">Cetacea,</hi> as indicated by the absence of
                    teeth, the presence of baleen, and the form and size of the mouth; but, as we
                    see in other groups, dental characters, and all such as relate to the prehension
                    of food generally, are essentially adaptive and consequently plastic or prone to
                    variation, and hence cannot well be relied upon as tests of affinity. In another
                    character, also adaptive, the laxity of the connexion of the ribs with the
                    vertebral column and with the sternum, and the reduction of that bone in size,
                    allowing great freedom of expansion of the thoracic cavity for prolonged
                    immersion beneath the water, the Mystacocetes have passed beyond the Odontocetes
                    in specialization. On the other hand, the greater symmetry of the skull, the
                    more anterior position of the external nostrils and their double external
                    orifice, the form of the nasal bones, the presence of a distinctly developed
                    olfactory organ, the mode of attachment of the periotic bone to the cranium, the
                    presence of a caecum and the regular arrangement of the alimentary canal, the
                    more normal characters of the manus and the better development of the muscles
                    attached to it, and the presence, in many species at least, of parts
                    representing not only the bones but the muscles and ligaments of a hind
                    limb,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These have
                    recently been described in detail by Professor Struthers in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal of Anatomy and Physiology,</hi> 1881.</p></note> all show
                    less deviation from the ordinary mammalian type than is presented by the
                    Odontocetes. Taking all these characters into consideration, it does not appear
                    reasonable to suppose that either type has been derived from the other, at all
                    events in the form in which we see it now, but rather that they are parallel
                    groups, both modified in different fashions from common ancestors.</p>
                <p>Among the Mystacocetes, in the especially distinguishing characters of the
                    division, the <hi rend="italic">Balaenopterae</hi> are less specialized than the
                    <hi rend="italic">Balaenae,</hi> which in the greater size of the head, the
                    length and compression of the rostrum, the development of the baleen, and
                    shortness of the cervical region are exaggerated forms of the type, and yet they
                    retain more fully some primitive characters, as the better development of the
                    hind limb, the pentadactylous manus, and the absence ofc a dorsal fin. Both
                    forms are found distinct in a fossil state as far back as the early Pliocene
                    age, but generally represented by smaller species than those now existing. The
                    Mystacocetes of the Miocene seas were, so far as we know at present, only <hi
                    rend="italic">Balaenopterae,</hi> some of which <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cetotherium)</hi> were, in the elongated flattened form of the nasal bones,
                    the greater distance between the occipital and frontal bone at the top of the
                    head, and the greater length of the cervical vertebrae, more generalized than
                    those now existing. In the shape of the mandible also, Van Beneden, to whose
                    researches we are chiefly indebted for a knowledge of these forms, discerns some
                    approximation to the Odontocetes.</p>
                <p>Among the last-named group there are several distinct types, of which that
                    represented by <hi rend="italic">Platanista,</hi> although in some respects
                    singularly modified, has been considered to present on the whole approximations
                    towards the more normal and general type of mammalian structure. It is therefore
                    interesting to find a similar form well represented among the earliest fossil
                    remains of Cetaceans in Europe. Almost all the other members of the suborder
                    range themselves under the two principal heads of Ziphioids (or Physeteroids)
                    and Delphinoids. The former is an ancient and once abounding type, of which the
                    Sperm Whale <hi rend="italic">(Physeter)</hi> is a highly specialized form.
                    Among the latter, <hi rend="italic">Globicep&gt;halus</hi> is a modified form as
                    regards the structure of its anterior extremity, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monodon</hi> as regards its dentition, while <hi rend="italic">I)elphinus</hi>
                    with its various minor subdivisions may be regarded as the dominating type of
                    Cetaceans at the present day, abundant in slightly differentiated species and
                    abundant in individuals. They are in this respect to the rest of the order much
                    as the hollow-horned Ruminants are to the Ungulates.</p>
                <p>The earliest Cetaceans of whose organization we have anything like complete
                    evidence are the Zeuglodons of the Eocene period,<note anchored="true"

                    and flatness of the nasal bones, which distinguish them from all existing forms,
                    we must also suppose to be a character at one time common to all Cetaceans,
                    though now retained (but to a less degree) only by the Mystacocetes. Even <hi
                    rend="italic">Squalodon</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> which in its
                    heterodont dentition so much resembles <hi rend="italic">Zeuglodon</hi> as to

                    and conforms with the ordinary Dolphins in its essential cranial characters.</p>
                <p>The origin of the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> is at present involved in much
                    obscurity. They present no signs of closer affinity to any of the lower classes
                    of vertebrates than do many other members of their own class. Indeed in all that
                    essentially distinguishes a mammal from the oviparous vertebrates, whether in
                    the osseous, nervous, reproductive, or any other system, they are as truly
                    mammalian as any other group. Any supposed marks of inferiority, as absence of
                    limb structure, of hairy covering, of lacrymal apparatus, &amp;c., are obviously
                    modifications (or degradations, as they may be termed) in adaptation to their
                    special mode of life. The characters of the teeth of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zeuglodon</hi> and other extinct forms, and also, of the foetal Mystacocetes,
                    clearly indicate that they have been derived from mammals in which the
                    heterodont type of dentition was fully established. The steps by which a land
                    mammal may have been modified into a purely aquatic one are clearly indicated by
                    the stages which still survive among the <hi rend="italic">Carnivora,</hi> in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Otariεe,</hi> and in the true Seals. A further change in
                    the same direction would produce an animal somewhat resembling a Dolphin, and it
                    has been thought that this may have been the route by which the Cetacean form
                    has been developed. There are, however, great difficulties in the way of this
                    view. If the hind limbs had ever been developed into the very efficient aquatic
                    propelling organs they present in the Seals, it is not easy to imagine how they
                    could have become completely atrophied and their function transferred to the
                    tail. It is more likely that the Whales were derived from animals with long
                    tails, which were used in swimming, eventually with such effect that the hind
                    limbs became no longer necessary. The powerful tail, with its lateral cutaneous
                    flanges, of an American species of Otter <hi rend="italic">(Pteronura
                    sandbaclιiι)</hi> may give an idea of this member in the primitive Cetaceans.
                    But the structure of the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> is, in so many essential
                    characters, so unlike that of the <hi rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> that the
                    probabilities are against these orders being nearly related. Even in the skull
                    of the Zeuglodon, which has been cited as presenting a great resemblance to that
                    of a Seal, quite as many likenesses may be traced to one of the primitive
                    Pig-like Ungulates (except in the purely adaptive character of the form of the
                    teeth), while the elongated larynx,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    after birth. It consists of a series of flattened horny plates, between three
                    and four hundred in number, on each side of the palate, with a bare interval
                    along the middle line. They are placed transversely to the long axis of the
                    palate, with very short intervals between them. Each plate or blade is somewhat
                    triangular in form, with the base attached to the palate and the apex hanging
                    downwards. The outer edge of the blade is hard and smooth, but the inner edge
                    and apex fray out into long bristly fibres, so that the roof of the whale’s
                    mouth looks as if covered with hair, as described by Aristotle. At the inner
                    edge of each principal blade are two or three much smaller or subsidiary blades.
                    The principal blades are longest near the middle of the series, and gradually
                    diminish towards the front and back of the mouth. The horny plates grow from a
                    dense fibrous and highly vascular matrix, which covers the palatal surface of
                    the maxillae, and which sends out lamellar processes, one of which penetrates
                    the base of each blade. Moreover, the free edge of these processes is covered
                    with very long vascular thread-like papillae, one of which forms the central
                    axis of each of the hair-like epidermic fibres of which the blade is mainly
                    composed. A tranverse section of fresh whalebone shows that it is made up of
                    numbers of these soft vascular papillae, circular in outline, each surrounded by
                    concentrically arranged epidermic cells, the whole bound together by other
                    epidermic cells, that constitute the smooth cortical (so-called “enamel")
                    surface of the blade, which, disintegrating at the free edge, allows the
                    individual fibres to become loose and assume the hair-like appearance before
                    spoken of. These fibres differ from hairs in not being formed in depressed
                    follicles in the enderon, but rather resemble the fibres composing the horn of
                    the Rhinoceros. The whalebone in fact consists of nothing more than modified
                    papillae of the buccal mucous membrane, with an excessive and cornified
                    epithelial development. The blades are supported, and bound together for a
                    certain distance from their base, by a mass of less hardened epithelium,
                    secreted by the surface of the palatal membrane or matrix of the whalebone in
                    the intervals of the lamellar processes. This is the “intermediate substance” of
                    Hunter, the “gum” of the whalers. Baleen varies much in colour in different
                    species. In some it is almost jet black, in others slate colour, horn colour,
                    yellow, or even creamy-white. In some the blades are variegated with
                    longitudinal stripes of different hues. It differs also greatly in other
                    respects, being short, thick, coarse, and stiff in some, and greatly elongated
                    and highly elastic in those species in which it has attained its fullest
                    development. Its function is to strain the water from the small marine molluscs,
                    crustaceans, or fish upon which the whales subsist. In feeding they fill the
                    immense mouth with water containing shoals of these small creatures, and then,
                    on their closing the jaws and raising the tongue, so as to diminish the cavity
                    of the mouth, the water streams out through the narrow intervals between the
                    hairy fringe of the whalebone blades, and escapes through the lips, leaving the
                    living prey to be swallowed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    somewhat intermediate position, and presenting combinations of characters not
                    found in either of the larger known sections. According to our present knowledge
                    the group is naturally divided into five very distinct genera. As these will be
                    more fully described in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Whale,</hi> it will be
                    sufficient at present to indicate their principal characteristics.</p>

                    not furrowed. No dorsal fin. Cervical vertebrae united into a single mass.
                    Pectoral limb short, broad, and pentadactylous. Head very large. Baleen very
                    long and narrow, highly elastic and black. Scapula high, with a distinct
                    coracoid and coronoid process. This genus contains the well-known Greenland
                    Right Whale <hi rend="italic">{B. mysticetus)</hi> of the Arctic seas, the
                    whalebone and oil of which are so much valued in commerce, and also other
                    whales, distinguished from this by having heads somewhat smaller in proportion
                    to the body, with shorter baleen, and a larger number of vertebrae. These
                    inhabit the temperate seas of both northern and southern hemispheres, and have
                    been divided by zoologists into several species in accordance with their
                    geographical distribution,— <hi rend="italic">B. biscayensis</hi> of the North

                    individual variation that it is not improbable that when they are better known
                    they will all come to be regarded as forming but a single species.</p>

                <p>This group is formed to include certain extinct Cetaceans, which are at present
                    only known by more or less fragmentary portions of their skeleton and teeth, and
                    whose position and affinities are therefore still subject to doubt.</p>
                <p>In the anterior part of both jaws the teeth are simple, conical, or slightly
                    compressed, and sharp-pointed. The first three in the upper jaw are distinctly

                    tooth which succeeds, or the canine, is also simple and conical, but it does not
                    exceed the others in size. This is followed by five teeth with two distinct

                    looked like two single teeth “linked or yoked together.” This name was

                    very limited number (in a few cases none) are functionally developed. No baleen.
                    Upper surface of the skull more or less asymmetrical. Nasal bones in the form of
                    nodules or flattened plates, applied closely to the frontale, and not forming
                    any part of the roof to the narial passage, which is directed upwards and
                    backwards. Olfactory organ rudimentary or absent. Hinder end of the maxilla
                    expanded and covering the greater part of the orbital plate of the frontal bone.
                    Lacrymal bone either inseparable from the jugal, or, when distinct, very large,
                    and forming part of the roof of the orbit. Tympanic bone not ankylosed with the
                    periotic, which is usually only attached to the rest of the skull by ligament.
                    Rami of mandible nearly straight, much expanded in height posteriorly, with a
                    wide funnel-shaped aperture to the dental canal, and coming in contact in front
                    by a flat surface of variable length, but always constituting a true symphysis.
                    Several of the anterior ribs with well-developed capitular processes, which
                    articulate with the bodies of the vertebrae. Sternum almost always composed of
                    several pieces, placed one behind the other, with which several pairs of ribs
                    are always connected by the intervention of well-developed cartilaginous or
                    ossified sternal ribs. External respiratory aperture single, the two nostrils
                    uniting before they reach the surface, usually in the form of a transverse
                    subcrescentic valvular aperture, situated on the top of the head. Manus always
                    pentadactylous, though the first and fifth digits are usually very little

                <p>No functional teeth in the upper jaw. Mandibular teeth various, often much
                    reduced in number. Bones of the cranium raised so as to form an elevated
                    prominence or crest behind the nares. Pterygoid bones thick, produced backwards,
                    meeting in the middle line, and not involuted to form the outer wall of the
                    post-palatine air-sinuses, but simply hollowed on their outer side. Transverse
                    processes of the arches of the dorsal vertebrae, to which the tubercles of the
                    ribs are attached, ceasing abruptly near the end of the series, and replaced by
                    processes on the body at a much lower level, and not on a line, or serially
                    homologous with them, but serially homologous anteriorly with the heads of the

                    about one-third the length of the body; very massive, high and truncated, and
                    rather compressed in front; owing its huge size and remarkable form mainly to
                    the great accumulation of a peculiarly modified form of adipose tissue filling
                    the large hollow on the upper surface of the cranium and overlying the rostrum.
                    The single blowhole is longitudinal, slightly sigmoid, and placed at the upper
                    and anterior extremity of the head to the left side of the middle line. The
                    opening of the mouth is on the under side of the head, considerably behind the

                    This is the Cachalot or Sperm Whale, <hi rend="italic">P. macro- •cephalus,</hi>
                    one of the most colossal of animals, quite equalling, if not exceeding, the
                    Greenland Whale in bulk. The length of the full-grown male is from 55 to 60
                    feet, but the female is stated not to reach more than half that size. It feeds
                    chiefly on cephalopods and fish, and is one of the most extensively distributed
                    of Cetaceans, being met with, usually in herds or “schools,” in almost all
                    tropical or subtropical seas, but not occurring, except accidentally, in the
                    polar regions. Those that appear occasionally on the British coasts are solitary
                    stragglers, usually, if not always, old males. The oil contained in the great
                    cavity above the skull' when refined, yields “spermaceti,” and the thick
                    covering of blubber which everywhere envelops the body produces the valuable
                    “sperm oil” of commerce; hence this animal has long been the subject of a
                    regular chase, by which its numbers have been greatly diminished. The substance
                    called “ambergris,” largely used in perfumery, is a concretion formed in the
                    intestine of the Sperm Whale, and is found floating on the surface of the seas
                    which they inhabit. Its genuineness is attested by the presence of the debris of
                    the horny beaks of the cephalopods on which the Whales feed.</p>

                    them, the head is about one-sixth of the length of the body, and obtusely
                    pointed in front; the mouth small and placed far below the apex of the snout;
                    the spiracle crescentic, and placed obliquely on the top of the head anteriorly
                    to the eyes, and to the left of the middle line; the pectoral fins are obtusely
                    falcate; and there is a triangular dorsal fin.</p>
                <p>The history of this genus is a good illustration of the difficulties in which the
                    study of the <hi rend="italic">Cetacea</hi> has been involved by the superficial
                    manner in which it has been investigated. The first known example, a skull from
                    the Cape of Good Hope in the Paris Museum, was described by Blainville under the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Physeter</hi><hi rend="italic">breviceps.</hi> This
                    was afterwards with good reason generically separated by Gray. Until within a
                    very few years ago only five other individuals had been met with, each of which
                    had been described under a different specific name (viz., <hi rend="italic"
                    >grayi, macleayi,</hi><hi rend="italic">simus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >floweri,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">potsii),</hi> and which are arranged by
                    Gray in two distinct genera. The most careful examination of the description
                    given of these specimens, or of the now numerous osteological remains available,
                    fails to detect any differences beyond those which may be attributed to age or
                    sex; and hence, according to our present knowledge, these six supposed species
                    must all be included under one name, <hi rend="italic">K. breviceps,</hi> an
                    animal which appears to attain the length of 10 feet when adult, and has been
                    met -with at various distant localities in the Southern Ocean, and also off the
                    coast of Madras and in the North Pacific.</p>
                <p>Subfamily Ziphiinae.—Teeth of the mandible quite rudimentary and concealed in the
                    gum, except one, or very rarely two, pairs which may be largely developed,
                    especially in the male sex. A distinct lacrymal bone. Externally the mouth is
                    produced into a slender rostrum or beak, from above which the rounded eminence
                    formed by a cushion of fat resting on the cranium in front of the blowhole rises
                    somewhat abruptly. Spiracle or blowhole single, crescentic, median, as in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Delphinidae.</hi> Pectoral fin small, ovate, the five digits
                    all moderately well developed. A small obtusely falcate dorsal fin situated
                    considerably behind the middle of the back. Longitudinal grooves on each side of
                    the skin of the throat, diverging posteriorly, and nearly meeting in front. In
                    external characters and habits the animals of this group closely resemble each
                    other. They appear to be almost exclusively feeders on various species of
                    cephalopods, and occur either singly, in pairs, or in small herds. By their
                    dental and osteological characters they are easily separated iiιto four distinct

                    of the maxilla. Very high longitudinal crests on the maxillae at the base of the

                <p>The type of this genus is <hi rend="italic">Z. cavirostris</hi> of Cuvier,
                    founded upon an imperfect skull picked up in 1804 on the Mediterranean coast of

                    referable to the same genus if not to the same species; although, as is usual in
                    such cases, they have mostly been described under different names. Teeth,

                <p>Though varying in form, the mandibular teeth of the different members of this
                    genus agree in their essential structure, having a small and pointed
                    enamel-covered crown, composed of true dentine, which, instead of surmounting a
                    root of the ordinary character, is raised upon a solid mass of osteodentine, the
                    continuous growth of which greatly alters the form and general appearance of the
                    organ as age advances, as seen most strikingly in the case of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Μ. layardi,</hi> where the long, narrow, flat, strap-like teeth, curving
                    inwards at their extremities, actually meet over the rostrum, and must greatly
                    interfere with the movements of the jaw. In one species <hi rend="italic">(Μ.
                    grayi)</hi> a row of minute, conical, pointed teeth, like those bf ordinary
                    Dolphins, 17 to 19 in number, are present even in the adults, on each side of
                    the middle part of the upper jaw, but embedded by their roots only in the gum,
                    and not in bony alveoli. This fact, with the frequent presence of rudimentary
                    teeth in other species of this and the last genus in both upper and lower jaws,
                    suggests the idea that the Ziρhioids are derived from ancestral forms having
                    teeth of normal character in both jaws, but whose dentition has become greatly
                    specialized. The existing species of this genus are widely distributed in both
                    northern and southern hemispheres, but most frequent in the latter. The best

                    to be learned with regard to their distinctive characters and geographical
                    distribution. They were abundant in the Later Miocene and Pliocene age, as
                    attested by the frequency with which the most imperishable and easily recognized
                    portion of their structure, the long, cylindrical rostrum of the skull, of more
                    than ivory denseness, is found among the rolled and waterworn fragments of
                    animal remains which compose the well-known “bone-bed” at the base of the Red
                    Crags of Suffolk. Numerous generic distinctions have been founded upon slight
                    modifications of the form of these rostra, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Choneziphius, Placoziphius, Belemnozιp7ιius,</hi> &amp;c., but these can only

                    the under surface, which is lighter. They are extremely gregarious, and, unlike
                    the Killers, are mild and inoffensive in disposition, feeding principally on
                    cephalopods. Their eminently sociable character constantly leads to their
                    destruction, as when attacked they instinctively rush together and blindly
                    follow the leaders of the herd. In this way many hundreds at a time are
                    frequently, driven ashore and killed, when a herd enters one of the bays or

                    eliminating the well-characterized genera previously described.</p>
                <p>The true Dolphins, Bottle-noses, or, as they are more commonly called by
                    seafaring people, “Porpoises,” are found in considerable abundance in all seas,
                    and some species are habitually inhabitants of large rivers, as the Amazon. They
                    are all among the smaller members of the order, none exceeding 10 feet in
                    length. Their food is chiefly fish, for the capture of which their long narrow
                    beaks, armed with numerous sharp-pointed teeth, are well adapted, but some
                    appear also to devour crustaceans and molluscs. They are mostly gregarious, and
                    the agility and grace of their movements in the water are constant themes of
                    admiration to the spectators of the scene when a ‘ ‘ school of Porpoises” is
                    observed playing round the bows of a vessel at sea. The type of the genus is the
                    Common Dolphin of the Mediterranean (Zλ <hi rend="italic">delphis,</hi> fig.
                    52), also found in the Atlantic, and of which a closely allied if not identical
                    form is met with in the Australian seas <hi rend="italic">(D.forsteri)</hi> and
                    in the North Pacific <hi rend="italic">{D. bairdii).</hi> The Tursio (2λ <hi
                    rend="italic">tursio)</hi> is another British species of larger size and heavier
                    build, with larger and less numerous teeth; this and several allied forms
                    probably constitute a natural subgroup. The White-beaked and White-sided
                    Dolphins (Z&gt;. <hi rend="italic">albirostris</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >leucopleurus)</hi> of the North Atlantic, and several others from the South and
                    Pacific Seas, with comparatively broad and short rostrum to the skull and very
                    numerous (80 to 90) vertebrae, constitute the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lagenorhynchus of</hi> Gray. Others, with long narrow rostrum, are associated
                    under the name of <hi rend="italic">Steno,</hi> one of which from the Chinese
                    seas <hi rend="italic">(D. sinensis)</hi> has but 51 vertebrae. This last is of
                    a pure milk-white colour, but most of the species are variegated with glossy
                    black, various shades of grey, and white, the latter chiefly on the under parts
                    of the body. One species (Z&gt;. <hi rend="italic">peronii)</hi> from the South
                    Seas is remarkable for the absence of <pb

                    rend="italic">Leucorhamphus</hi> of Lilljeborg, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Delphinapteτus</hi> of other authors; this last name, however, was originally
                    bestowed on the Beluga, and should be retained for it.</p>

                <p>Terrestrial, rarely arboreal or natatorial, diphyodont, heterodont, placental
                    mammals of small size, with plantigrade or semiplantigrade, generally
                    pentadactyle, unguiculate feet; with clavicles (except in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Potamogale);</hi> with more than two incisors in the mandible, and with
                    enamel-coated molars having tuberculated crowns and well-developed roots. The
                    body is clothed with fur, or protected by an armature of spines; the testes are
                    inguinal or placed near the kidneys, and are not received into a scrotum, the
                    penis is pendent or suspended from the wall of the abdomen; the uterus is
                    two-horned and with or without a distinct corpus uteri, the placenta discoidal
                    and deciduate; and the smooth cerebral hemispheres do not extend backwards over
                    the cerebellum.</p>
                <p>Representatives of this order are found throughout the temperate and tropical
                    parts of both hemispheres (except South America and Australia), and exhibit much
                    variety both in organization and in habit. The greater number are cursorial, but
                    some <hi rend="italic">(Talpa, Chrysochloris, Oryzorictes)</hi> are fossorial,
                    some <hi rend="italic">(Potamogale, Nectogale, Myogale)</hi> natatorial, and
                    some <hi rend="italic">(Tupaiidae)</hi> arboreal, while the species of one genus
                    <hi rend="italic">(Galeopithecus)</hi> glide through the air like Flying
                    Squirrels; to the great majority, however, the term insectivorous is applicable,
                    the aberrant <hi rend="italic">Galeopithecus</hi> being alone phytophagous also,
                    while <hi rend="italic">Potamogale</hi> is said to feed on fish, and the
                    different species of Moles live chiefly on worms. Notwithstanding the
                    homogeneous nature of their food, much variety prevails in the form and number
                    of their teeth, as will be seen when we come to consider the classification of
                    the species. In many the division into incisors, canines, premolars, and molars
                    may be readily traced, but in others, forming the great majority of the species,
                    such as the Shrews, this is accomplished with difficulty. The dentition of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Insectivora</hi> may, however, be considered typical, since
                    from it may be derived, by modification, that of any known species of diphyodont
                    placental <hi rend="italic">Mammalia.</hi> This typical dentition is especially
                    noticeable in the genus <hi rend="italic">Gymnura,</hi> where the dental formula
                    is— <hi rend="italic">i</hi> f, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> γ, <hi rend="italic">pm
                    ⅛, m</hi>; total 44 teeth. So also, in their general organization, these animals
                    appear to have departed so little from what must have been the original
                    mammalian type that, were it not for the apparently advanced character of their
                    placentation, they might easily be considered the scarcely modified descendants
                    of the ancestors of all other orders of diphyodont placental mammals. Their
                    study, therefore, affords the best introduction to that of this division
                    especially.</p>
                <p>In most <hi rend="italic">Insectivora</hi> the cranial cavity is of small
                    relative size, and in none is the brain case elevated to any considerable extent
                    above the face-line. The facial part of the skull is generally much produced,
                    and the premaxillary and nasal bones well developed. The zygomatic arch is
                    usually slender or deficient, the latter being the case in most of the species,
                    and post-orbital processes of the frontals are found only in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Galeopithecidae, Tupaiidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Macroscelidae.</hi> The
                    number of dorsal vertebrae varies from 13 in <hi rend="italic">Tupaia</hi> to 19
                    in <hi rend="italic">Centetes,</hi> of lumbar from 3 in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chrysochloris</hi> to 6 in <hi rend="italic">Talpa</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sorex,</hi> and of caudal from the rudimentary vertebrae of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Centetes</hi> to the 40 or more well-developed ones of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Microgale.</hi> Not less variable aro the characters of the vertebrae: the
                    spinous processes may be very long in one species and short in another, though
                    belonging to the same genus; in the <hi rend="italic">Soricidae</hi> and in <hi
                    rend="italic">Myogale</hi> the neural arches of the cervical vertebrae are very
                    slender; in <hi rend="italic">Soricidae</hi> also and in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gymnura</hi> the four anterior vertebrae develop large single hypapophyses, and
                    in <hi rend="italic">Galeopithecus</hi> the body of each supports posteriorly a
                    pair of hypapophysial tubercles. In <hi rend="italic">Erinaceus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Myogale,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Talpa</hi> small oval ossicles
                    are found on the inferior surface» of the lumbar interspaces. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Erinaceus,</hi> owing to the thickness of the cord in the cervical
                    region and its abrupt termination, the diameter of the neural canal in the
                    cervical and first two dorsal vertebrae greatly exceeds that of any of the
                    succeeding vertebrae. The sternum is variable, but generally narrow, bilobate in
                    front, and divided into segments. The shoulder-girdle presents remarkable
                    adaptive modifications, most expressed in <hi rend="italic">Talpa</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mole),</hi> having relation to the use of the fore limbs in
                    burrowing; in the Golden Moles <hi rend="italic">(Chrysochloris),</hi> however
                    <hi rend="italic">(vide infra),</hi> the forearm and manus alone become
                    specially modified. In <hi rend="italic">Galeopithecus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Macroscelides</hi> the forearm bones are distally united; in all
                    other known <hi rend="italic">Insectivora</hi> the radius and ulna are distinct.
                    The manus has generally five digits, but in <hi rend="italic">Rhynchocyon</hi>
                    and in one species of <hi rend="italic">Oryzorictes</hi> the pollex is wanting.
                    In the true Moles (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mole)</hi> it is extremely modified.
                    The femur has, in most species, a prominent ridge below the greater trochanter
                    presenting the characters of a third trochanter. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Galeopithecus, Tupaia, Centetes, Hemicentetes, Ericulus,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Solenodon</hi> the tibia and fibula are distinct, in all other
                    genera more or less united together. The pes consists usually of five digits
                    (rarely four by reduction of the hallux), and in some, as in the leaping species
                    <hi rend="italic">(Macroscelides, Rhynchocyon),</hi> the tarsal bones are
                    greatly elongated. The form of the pelvis, and especially that of the symphysis
                    pubis, varies within certain limits, which have been proposed by Leche as a
                    basis for the classification of the families. Thus in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Galeopithecidae, Tupaiidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Macroscelidae</hi> there
                    is a long symphysis, as in Rodents; in <hi rend="italic">Erinaceidae,
                    Centetidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Potamogalidae</hi> it is short; and in
                    <hi rend="italic">Soricidae, Talpidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chrysochloridae</hi> there is none.</p>
                <p>Space does not admit of even attempting a sketch of the interesting modifications
                    of the muscular system, which will be found fully described in the present
                    writer’s <hi rend="italic">Monograph,</hi> referred to in the bibliography. As
                    to the nervous system, it may be noticed that the brain throughout the species
                    presents a low type of organization: in none do the cerebral hemispheres present
                    any trace of convolutions, nor do they extend backwards so as to cover the
                    cerebellum; the olfactory lobes are large and project in front; and the corpus
                    callosum is short and thin. In the Hedgehogs <hi rend="italic">(Erinaceus)</hi>
                    the spinal column ends abruptly opposite the third or fourth dorsal vertebra in
                    a slender filament; the dorsal and lumbar nerves, given off in front of this
                    point, aie carried backwards in two compressed bundles occupying the suddenly
                    narrowed spinal canal as far as the sacrum.</p>
                <p>Owing to the similarity in the character of the food, the truly insectivorous
                    species, forming more than nine-tenths of the order, present little variety in
                    the structure of the digestive organs. Except in <hi rend="italic">Galeopithecus
                    (vide infra)</hi> the stomach is a simple, thin-walled sac; in some, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Centetes</hi> and allied genera, the pyloric and oesophageal
                    openings are very close together; the intestinal canal has much the same calibre
                    throughout, and varies from three (in the Shrews) to twelve times (in the
                    Hedgehogs) the length of the head and body. In the arboreal genera, <hi
                    rend="italic">Galeopithecus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tupaia,</hi> and in the
                    allied <hi rend="italic">Macroscelidae,</hi> all of which probably feed on
                    vegetable substances as well, most of the species possess a caecum. The liver is
                    deeply divided into <pb facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n422/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0422-0401"/> lobes, the right and left lateral being cut off
                    by deep fissures; both the caudate and Spigelian lobes are generally well
                    developed, and the gall-bladder, usually large and globular, is placed on the
                    middle of the posterior surface of the right central lobe.</p>
                <p>In most of the species <hi rend="italic">(Soricidae, Centetidae,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Chryso-</hi><hi rend="italic">chloridae)</hi> the penis is capable
                    of being more or less completely retracted within the fold of integument
                    surrounding the anus; in some <hi rend="italic">(Galeopithecidae,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Talj&gt;idx)</hi> it is pendent in front of the anus, while in
                    others <hi rend="italic">(Macroscelidse,</hi><hi rend="italic">Erinaceidae,
                    Solenodontidae)</hi> it is carried forwards anti suspended from the abdominal
                    wall. In <hi rend="italic">Centetinae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chrysochloris</hi> the testes lie immediately behind the kidneys, in others
                    more or less within the pelvis. During the rut they become greatly enlarged,
                    forming protrusions in the inguinal region. Except in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhynchocyon</hi> the uterine cornua are long and open into a short corpus
                    uteri, which in many species <hi rend="italic">(Soricidae, Talpidae, Centetidae,
                    Chrysochloridae)</hi> is not separated from the vagina by a distinct os uteri.
                    With the exception of <hi rend="italic">Galeopithecus</hi> all <hi rend="italic"
                    >Insectivore,</hi> appear to be multiparous, the number of foetuses varying from
                    two to eight in <hi rend="italic">Erinaceus,</hi> and from twelve to twenty-one
                    in <hi rend="italic">Centetes.</hi> The position of the mammary glands and the
                    number of the teats vary greatly. In <hi rend="italic">Galeopithecus</hi> there
                    are two pairs of axillary teats, in <hi rend="italic">Solenodon</hi> a single
                    pair post-inguinal, but in most species they range from the thorax to the
                    abdomen, varying from two pairs in <hi rend="italic">Gymnura</hi> to twelve in
                    <hi rend="italic">Centetes.</hi> In <hi rend="italic">Chrysochloris</hi> the
                    thoracic and inguinal teats are lodged in deep cup-shaped depressions.</p>
                <p>Odoriferous glands exist in many species. In most Shrews they occur on the sides
                    of the body at a short distance behind the axilla, and their exudation is
                    probably protective, as few carnivorous animals will eat their dead bodies. In
                    both species of <hi rend="italic">Gymnura</hi> and in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Potamogale</hi> large pouches are situated on either side of the rectum, and
                    discharge their secretions by ducts, opening in the first-named genus in front
                    of and in the latter within the margin of the anus. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Centetes</hi> racemose glands similarly situated discharge by pores opening at
                    the bottom of deep pits placed at either side of the anus.</p>

                    and <hi rend="italic">G. philip∙ pinensis.</hi> The former, the Flying Lemur of
                    Linnaeus, distinguished from the latter by the form of the upper incisors, has a
                    total length of nearly 2 feet. The long and slender limbs are connected by a
                    broad integumentary expansion extending outwards from the sides of the neck and
                    body, and forming also a web between the fingers and toes as far as the base of
                    the claws (fig. 53); the hind limbs are further connected by a similar expansion
                    passing outwards along the back of the feet to the base of the claws, and,
                    inwardly, involving the long tail to the tip, forming a true interfemoral
                    membrane, as in the Bats.</p>
                <p>The species of this family live in the forests of the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra,
                    Borneo, and the Philippine Islands, where they feed chiefly on the leaves of
                    trees, and probably also on insects. Their habits are nocturnal, and during the
                    daytime they cling to the trunks or limbs of trees head downwards in a state of
                    repose. With the approach of night their season of activity commences, when they
                    may be occasionally seen gliding from tree to tree supported on their cutaneous
                    parachute, and they have been noticed as capable of traversing in this way a
                    space of 70 yards with a descent of only about one in five.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Galeopithecus</hi> was referred by some of the older zoologists
                    and anatomists to the Bats, and by others (and even in lately published works)
                    to the Lemurs, but Professor Peters’s view (in which most subsequent writers
                    agree) that it belongs to neither of these orders, and must be considered an
                    aberrant Insectivore, appears to be undoubtedly the correct one. Besides
                    differing from the Bats altogether in the form of the anterior limbs and of the
                    double-rooted outer incisors and canines, it also contrasts strongly with them
                    in the presence of a large sacculated caecum, and in the great length of the

                <p>The animals included in this family are all arboreal, resembling Squirrels
                    closely both in habits and in external form; they are divided into two genera
                    having the same dental formula (ι ⅜, c ⅛, <hi rend="italic">pm ⅜, m</hi> ⅜), but
                    distinguished by the form of the skull. <hi rend="italic">Tupaia,</hi> •with
                    nine species, is found in India, Burmah, the Malay Peninsula, Nicobars, Sumatra,
                    Java, and P&gt;orneo. The species closely resemble one another, differing
                    chiefly in size and in the colour and length of the fur. Nearly all have long
                    bushy tails, which still further increase their resemblance to Squirrels. Their
                    food consists of insects and fruit, which they usually seek for in the trees,
                    but also occasionally on the ground. When feeding they often sit on their
                    haunches, holding the food, after the manner of Squirrels, between their fore
                    paws. <hi rend="italic">Ptilocercus</hi> includes a single very interesting
                    species, <hi rend="italic">Pt. lowii,</hi> inhabiting Borneo, remarkable for its
                    long tail, two-thirds naked, having the terminal third furnished with a double
                    fringe of long hairs. Its habits are probably similar to those of the Tupaias,
                    of which it may be further noticed that they alone among <hi rend="italic"

                <p>These leaping Insectivores are easily distinguished by the great length of their

                    the peculiarly shaped and single-rooted third incisors and first upper premolars
                    (fig. 56, A), and in its very coarse harsh fur. The dentition of the long-eared
                    North Indian form, <hi rend="italic">E. grayi</hi> (fig. 56, B), may be
                    considered characteristic of all the other species, the only important
                    differences being found in the variable size and position of the second upper
                    premolar, which is very small, external, and deciduous in the Indian species <hi

                    species, limited to South India, is further distinguished by the absence of the

                    rend="italic">E. albiventris</hi> has been made the type of a separate genus on

                <p>Terrestrial, rarely natatorial, <hi rend="italic">Insectivora,</hi> with narrow
                    elongated skulls, without post-orbital processes or zygomatic arches. The
                    tympanies are annular, not forming bullae; there is no symphysis pubis; the
                    intestine has no caecum; the tibia and fibula are united; and the molars have
                    well-developed W·shaped cusps.</p>
                <p>The dentition is very characteristic of the family; in all the upper front
                    incisors are large, with a more or less prominent posterior basal cusp, and
                    between these and the last premolar intervene a variable number of small
                    incisors and premolars, among which the small canine can be distinguished only
                    by its position immediately behind the premaxillary suture. The number of teeth
                    in the mandible is always twelve, and the single pair of incisors are much
                    extended horizontally forwards, the canine is the smallest tooth, and the single
                    premolar is not much larger (see fig. 57).</p>
                <p>The Shrews thus form a very compact family, which includes considerably more than
                    half the known species of <hi rend="italic">Insectivora,</hi> and of which the
                    geographical distribution is coextensive with that of the order. They have been
                    divided into several genera (so-called) and subgenera, depending chiefly on the
                    number of the upper incisors and premolars, and on the colour of the teeth. The
                    best arrangement appears to be that proposed by Μ. Alph. Milne-Edwards, as

                <p>Volant mammals, having their fore limbs specially modified for flight. The
                    forearm consists of a rudimentary ulna, a long curved radius, and a carpus of
                    six bones supporting a thumb and four greatly elongated fingers, between which,
                    the sides of the body, and the hinder extremities a thin expansion of the
                    integument (the wingmembrane) is spread out. The knee is directed backwards,
                    owing to the rotation of the hind limb outwards by the wing-membrane; a peculiar
                    elongated cartilaginous process (the calcaneum or calcar), rarely rudimentary or
                    absent, arising from the inner side of the ankle-joint, is directed inwards, and
                    supports part of the posterior margin of an accessory membrane of flight,
                    extending from the tail or posterior extremity of the body to the hinder limbs
                    (the inter-femoral membrane). The penis is pendent; the testes abdominal or
                    inguinal; the mammary glands thoracic and generally post-axillary; the uterus
                    simple cr with more or less long cornua; the placenta discoidal and deciduate;
                    and the smooth cerebral hemispheres do not extend backwards over the cerebellum.
                    The dental series consists of four kinds of teeth—incisors, canines, premolars,
                    and molars; and the dental formula never exceeds i ⅜, <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>The animals comprised in this order are at once distinguished by the presence of
                    true wings, and this peculiarity is accompanied by other modifications of bodily
                    structure having special relation to aerial locomotion. Thus, in direct contrast
                    to all other mιmmals, in which locomotion is chiefly effected by action from
                    behind, and the hind limbs consequently greatly preponderate in size over the
                    fore, in the <hi rend="italic">Chiropteτa</hi> the fore limbs, being the only
                    agents in propelling the body forward during flight, immensely exceed the short
                    and weak hinder extremities; the thorax, giving origin to the great muscles
                    which sustain flight, and containing the proportionately (compared with other
                    mammals) very large lungs and heart, is remarkably capacious, and the ribs are
                    flattened and close together; the shoulder-girdle is also greatly developed in
                    comparison with the weak pelvic bones.</p>
                <p>Linnaeus included the Bats among the <hi rend="italic">Primates,</hi> mainly on
                    account of the number of their upper incisors, supposed to be always four, the
                    thoracic position of the mammae, and the pendent condition of the penis. Many
                    other zoologists, taking into consideration also the placental characters and
                    the form of the uterus, have followed him; but it is evident that the situation
                    of the mammae is related to the necessarily central position of the young during
                    flight, the shortness of the uterine cornua, observable in so many species, to
                    the generally uniparous gestation requiring less room, while the discoid
                    deciduate placenta is equally present in and characteristic of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Insectivora,</hi> many species of which have also the penis
                    pendent. Then, all these reasons for maintaining the Bats in such an exalted
                    position being disposed of, we find in the low organization of their brain
                    another proof of their inferior position in the zoological scale, while
                    furthermore, although they differ <pb
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n427/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0427-0406"/> widely from all other mammals in external form,
                    it is evident that this is but the result of special adaptation to aerial
                    locomotion; and, taking into account their whole bodily structure, we are forced
                    to admit with Professor Huxley that they may be regarded as exceedingly modified
                    <hi rend="italic">Insectivora.</hi></p>
                <p>So thoroughly, however, has this adaptation been carried out that of all animals
                    the Bats are the least terrestrial, not one of them being equally well fitted,
                    as most Birds and Insects are, for progression on the earth. This is due to the
                    hind as well as the fore limbs being pressed into the service of aerial
                    locomotion. The hind limb is so rotated outwards by the wing-membrane that,
                    contrary to what obtains in all other vertebrates, the knee is directed
                    backwards, and corresponds in position to its serial homologue the elbow. When
                    placed on the ground, therefore, the animal rests on all fours, having the knees
                    directed upwards like a grasshopper’s, while, in order to bring the foot into a
                    position for forward progression, it is rotated forwards and inwards on the
                    ankle. Walking under these circumstances is at best only a species of shuffle,
                    and that this is fully recognized by the animal is evidenced by its great
                    anxiety to take to the wing, or, if this be impracticable, to ascend to some
                    point where it can hitch itself up by the claws of the hind-legs in its usual
                    position when at rest.</p>
                <p>The bones entering into the formation of the skeleton in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chiroptera</hi> are characterized by their slenderness, and by the great size
                    of the medullary canals in those of the extremities. The vertebral column is
                    short, and the vertebrae differ very slightly in number and form throughout the
                    species. The general number of the dorso-lumbar vertebrae is 17, whereof 12 are
                    dorsal; the cervical vertebrae are very broad, but short from before backwards
                    (their breadth is due to the great transverse diameter of the spinal canal
                    rendered necessary by the comparatively very large size of the spinal cord in
                    this position, which, after giving off the nervous supply to the fore limbs and
                    thorax, rapidly diminishes in size, and in the lumbo-sacral region is reduced to
                    a fine thread). Except in the great frugivorous Bats <hi rend="italic"
                    >(JPteropodidae),</hi> the vertebrae, from the third cervical backwards, are
                    devoid of spinous processes, a characteristic feature in the general osteology
                    of the order. From the first thoracic to the last lumbar vertebra the spinal
                    column forms a single curve backwards, which is most pronounced in the lumbar
                    region. The bodies of the vertebrae are very slightly movable upon each other,
                    and in old individuals appear to become partially ankylosed together. The caudal
                    vertebrae are simple cylindrical bones without processes; their number and
                    length is extremely variable even in closely allied species; and the anterior
                    vertebrae are generally united to the ischial tuberosities. The development of
                    these vertebrae, in fact, is intimately correlated to the habits of the animals,
                    the long tail in the insectivorous species supporting and controlling the
                    position of the large interfemoral membrane which appears not only to aid their
                    rapid doubling motions when in pursuit of their insect prey by acting as a
                    rudder on the air, but also to assist them in the capture and retention of the
                    larger insects; in the frugivorous species, on the other hand, this is not
                    required, and the tail is accordingly rudimentary or absent. In all Bats the
                    presternum has a prominent keel for the attachment of the great pectoral
                    muscles. In most species the ribs are much flattened, and in some partially
                    ankylosed by their contiguous margins.</p>
                <p>Great as is the variability of the shape of the skull in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Insectivora,</hi> it is still greater in <hi rend="italic">Chiroptera,</hi> and
                    evidently depends upon the much wider differences in the nature of the food of
                    different species requiring corresponding modifications of the manducatory
                    apparatus, so that extreme modifications may be found in species of the same
                    family, as in the case of the <hi rend="italic">Phyllostomidae.</hi> In some
                    genera, however, as in <hi rend="italic">Miniopterus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Furia,</hi><hi rend="italic">Mor mops (vide infra),</hi> the peculiar shape of
                    the skull cannot thus be accounted for. As in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Insectivora,</hi> post-orbital processes are developed in some species only, as
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Pteropodidae</hi> and in a few <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nycteridae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Emballonuridae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Pteropus leucopter us</hi> alone does a process
                    from the zygomatic arch meet the post-orbital so as to complete the orbital
                    ring. Zygomatic arches, though slender, are present in all except in some of the
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Phyllostomidae.</hi></p>
                <p>The milk teeth differ from those of all other mammals in that they in no respect
                    resemble in form those of the permanent series. They are very slender, with
                    acutely pointed recurved cusps, and are soon shed, but often coexist for a short
                    time with the permanent teeth when the latter are considerably elevated above
                    the gum. In the family <hi rend="italic">Rhinolophidae</hi> the milk teeth are
                    absorbed before birth. The permanent teeth exhibit great variety in form,
                    sometimes even in the same family, as in <hi rend="italic">Phyllostomidae,</hi>
                    whilst in other families, as in <hi rend="italic">Rhinolophidae,</hi> the
                    resemblance between the dentition of species otherwise differing in many
                    important respects is most remarkable. In all, however, they are provided with
                    well-developed roots, and their crowns are acutely tuberculate, with more or
                    less well-defined W-shaped cusps, in the insectivorous species, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Insectivora,</hi> or variously hollowed out or longitudinally
                    grooved in the frugivorous, as in some species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phyllostomidae</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">Pteropodidae.</hi></p>
                <p>As might be expected, the shoulder-girdle varies very slightly, having the same
                    office to fulfil in all species. The clavicle is very long, strong, and curved;
                    the scapulae large, oval, triangular, with a long curved coracoid process. The
                    humerus, though long, is scarcely two-thirds the length of the radius; the ulna
                    is rudimentary its proximal extremity, <pb
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n428/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0428-0407"/> which articulates with but a small part of the
                    humerus, is ankylosed with the radius; immediately beyond the joint it is
                    reduced to a very slender splint-like bone, which extends about as far as the
                    middle of the radius. In all species a detached sesamoid bone exists in the
                    tendon of the triceps muscle, and is generally found in skeletons. The radius is
                    very long, in some species as long as the head and body. The proximal row of the
                    carpus consists of a single bone (the united scaphoid, lunar, and cuneiform
                    bones), which, with the extremity of the radius, forms the radio-carpal joint;
                    in the distal row the trapezium, trapezoid, and os magnum vary much in size in
                    the different families; the unciform appears to be the most constant, and the
                    pisiform is generally very small. It will be necessary to again refer to this
                    subject when dealing with the diagnostic characters of the suborders.</p>
                <p>The manus is, in all the species, composed of five digits. The first, fourth, and
                    fifth consist each of a metacarpal bone and two osseous phalanges; in the second
                    and third the number of phalanges is different in certain families. The first
                    digit—the pollex—always terminates in a claw, which, with the proximal phalanx,
                    is most developed in the frugivorous species. In most of the species of the
                    frugivorous <hi rend="italic">Pteropodidae</hi> the second digit is also
                    provided with a claw, but in all other Bats this and the remaining digits are
                    unarmed. In the genus <hi rend="italic">Triaenops</hi> alone a very peculiar
                    short bony process projects from the outer side of the proximal extremity of the
                    terminal phalanx of the fourth digit. The relative development of the digits and
                    their phalanges will be specially treated of under each family.</p>
                <p>As might be expected from the small size of the posterior limbs, the pelvic
                    girdle is very weak. The iliac bones are long and narrow. In most species the
                    pubic bones of opposite sides are very loosely united in front in males; in
                    females they are widely separated; in the family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhinolophidae</hi> alone do these bones form a symphysis. The eminentia
                    ileo-pectinea develops in all species a long pectineal process, which in the
                    subfamily <hi rend="italic">Phyllorhininae</hi> alone is continued forwards to
                    the anterior extremity of the ilium <hi rend="italic">(vide infra,,</hi> p.
                    412), forming a preacetabular foramen which is unique among mammals. The
                    acetabulum is small and directed outwards, and slightly upwards, and with this
                    is related the peculiar position of the hind limb described above as one of the
                    chief characteristics of the order. The femur is slender and cylindrical, with a
                    small head and very short neck, and scarcely differs in form throughout the
                    species. The bones of the leg and foot are more variable; in the subfamily <hi
                    rend="italic">Molossinae</hi> alone is there a well-developed fibula; in all
                    other species this bone is either very slender or cartilaginous and ligamentous
                    in its upper third, or reduced to a small bony process above the heel, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Megaderma,</hi> or altogether absent, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nycteris.</hi></p>
                <p>The foot consists of a very short tarsus, and of slender, laterally compressed
                    toes, with much curved claws. The first digit is composed of a metacarpal bone,
                    a proximal and an ungual phalanx, and is slightly shorter than the other four
                    toes, which have each an additional phalanx, except in the subfamily <hi

                    >Thyrσptera</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Myxopoda,</hi> where all the toes have
                    the same number of phalanges as the first digit, and are equal to it in length.
                    In the very remarkable genus <hi rend="italic">Cheiromeles</hi> the first digit
                    is thumb-like and separated from the others; and in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Molossi</hi> the first and fifth digits are much thicker than the intermediate
                    toes.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">muscular system,</hi> as might be expected, exhibits few
                    striking differences throughout the species. The most noticeable peculiarities
                    in the myology of the order consist in the separated bands or slips into which
                    the platysma is divided, and in the remarkable muscle termed
                    occipito-pollicalis, which extends from the occipital bone to the base of the
                    terminal phalanx of the pollex (see Macalister, “Myology of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chiroptera,” Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc.,</hi> 1872).</p>
                <p>Although, as above mentioned, the brain presents a low type of organization, yet
                    probably no animals possess so delicate sense of touch as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chiroptera.</hi> It is undoubtedly this perceptive power which enabled the
                    individuals deprived of sight, hearing, and smell, in Spallanzani’s well-known
                    experiments, to avoid the numerous threads hung across the rooms in which they
                    were permitted to fly about. In the common Bats the tactile organs evidently
                    exist, not only in the delicate vibrissae which spring from the sides of the
                    muzzle, but also in the highly sensitive and widely extended integumentary
                    structures entering into the formation of the wing-membranes and ear·conchs,
                    while in many other species, notably in the tropical Rhinolophine and
                    Phyllostomine Bats, peculiar foliaceous cutaneous expansions surrounding the
                    nasal apertures or extending backwards behind them are superadded <hi
                    rend="italic">(vide infra).</hi> These structures, collectively known as the
                    “nose-leaf” (whence the term <hi rend="superscript"> il</hi> leaf-nosed Bats ”),
                    have been shown by the present writer (who has traced their gradual development
                    in different species) to be' made up partly of the extended and thickened
                    marginal integument of the nostrils, and partly of the highly differentiated
                    glandular eminences occupying the sides of the muzzle, in which, in all the
                    common Bats, the vibrissae are implanted.</p>
                <p>In all species of leaf-nosed Bats, and especially in th? <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhinolophidae,</hi> in which the nasal appendages reach their highest
                    development, the superior maxillary division of the fifth nerve is of.
                    remarkably large calibre. The nasal branch of this nerve, which is given off
                    immediately beyond the infra-orbital foramen, is by far the largest portion, the
                    palpebral and labial branches consisting of a few slender nerve fibres only.
                    This branch passes forwards and upwards on the sides of the superior maxillary
                    bone, but soon spreads out into numerous filaments which pass into the muscles
                    and integument above, and into the base of the nose-leaf. The nerve supply of
                    the nose-leaf is further considerably augmented by the large nasal branch of the
                    ophthalmic division of the fifth nerve.</p>
                <p>While the many foliations, elevations, and depressions which vary the form of the
                    nose-leaf also greatly increase the sensory surface so abundantly supplied by
                    the fifth nerve, and in rapid flight intensify the vibrations conveyed to it,
                    the great number of sweat and oil glands which enter into its structure perform
                    an important function, analogous to that of the glands of the auditory canal in
                    relation to the membrana tympani, in maintaining its surface in a highly
                    sensitive condition.</p>
                <p>The nasal appendages of <hi rend="italic">Chiroptera,</hi> then, may be regarded
                    as performing the office of an organ of a very-exalted sense of touch standing
                    in the same relation to the nasal branches of the sensory divisions of the fifth
                    nerve as the aural apparatus to the auditory nerve; for, as the latter organ
                    collects and transmits the waves of sound, so the former receives impressions
                    arising from vibrations communicated to the air by approaching objects.</p>
                <p>In no order of mammals is the ear-conch so greatly-developed or so variable in
                    form; in most of the insectivorous species the ears are longer than the head,
                    while in some, as in the common Long-eared Bat <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Plecotus</hi><hi rend="italic">auritus),</hi> their length nearly equals that
                    of the head and body. The form of the conch is very characteristic in each of
                    the families; in most the tragus is remarkably large, in some extending nearly
                    to the outer margin of the conch; its office appears to be to cause undulations
                    in the waves of sound, and so intensify and prolong them. It is worthy of <pb

                    Bats wanting the tragus, the <hi rend="italic">Rhinolophidae,</hi> the auditory
                    bullae osseae reach their greatest size, and the highly sensitive nasal
                    appendages their highest development; also in the group <hi rend="italic"
                    >Molossi</hi> the ear-conch is divided by a prominent keel; and the antitragus
                    is remarkably large in those species in which the tragus is minute (see fig. 66,
                    <hi rend="italic">a).</hi> In the frugivorous Bats, as might be expected, the
                    form of the car-conch is very simple, and but slightly variable throughout the
                    species.</p>
                <p>In all Bats the ears are extremely mobile, each moving independently at the will
                    of the animal. This has been observed by the writer even in the frugivorous <hi
                    rend="italic">Pteropodidεe,</hi> in which the peculiar vibratory movements
                    noticed by Mr Osburn in <hi rend="italic">Artibeus perspicillatus</hi> may also
                    be seen when the animals are alarmed.</p>
                <p>The opening of the mouth is anterior in most species, but in many it is inferior,
                    the extremity of the nose being more or less produced beyond the lower lip, so
                    much so indeed in the small South-American species <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rynchonycteris naso</hi> as to resemble that of the Shrews. The lips exhibit
                    the greatest variety in form, which will be specially referred to under each
                    family. The absence of a fringe of hairs is very characteristic of all
                    fruit-eating Bats, and probably always distinguishes them from the insectivorous
                    species, which they may resemble in the form of their teeth and in other
                    respects.</p>
                <p>The oesophagus is narrow in all species, and especially so in the sanguivorous
                    <hi rend="italic">Desmodontes.</hi> The stomach presents two principal types of
                    structure, which correspond respectively to the two great divisions of the
                    order, the <hi rend="italic">Megaclιiroptera</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Microchiroptera</hi>; in the former (with the exception of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Harpyia)</hi> the pyloric extremity is more or less elongated and folded upon
                    itself, in the latter it is simple, as in <hi rend="italic">Insectivora
                    vera;</hi> a third exceptional type is met with in the sanguivorous <hi
                    rend="italic">Desmodontes,</hi> where the left or cardiac extremity is greatly
                    elongated, forming a 1 )ng narrow caecum-like appendage. The intestine is
                    comparatively short, varying from one and a half to four times the length of the
                    head and body, being longest in the frugivorous, shortest in the insectivorous
                    species. In <hi rend="italic">Rhinopoma microphyllum</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Megaderma</hi><hi rend="italic">spasma</hi> only has a very small caecum been
                    found. .</p>
                <p>The liver is characterized by the great size of the left 1 itérai lobe", which
                    occasionally equals half the size of the whole organ; the right and left lateral
                    fissures are usually very deep; in <hi rend="italic">Megachiroptera</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(Harpyia</hi> excepted) the Spigelian lobe is ill-defined or
                    absent, and the caudate is generally very large, but in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Microchiroptera,</hi> on the other hand, the Spigelian lobe is very large,
                    while the caudate is small, in most species forming a ridge only. The
                    gallbladder is generally well developed and attached to the right central lobe,
                    except in <hi rend="italic">Rhinolophidae,</hi> where it is connected with the
                    left central.</p>
                <p>In most species the hyoid bones are simple, consisting of a chain of slender,
                    elongated, cylindrical bones connecting the small basi-hyoid with the cranium,
                    while the pharynx is short, the larynx shallow with feebly developed vocal
                    cords, and guarded by a short acutely-pointed epiglottis, which in some genera
                    <hi rend="italic">(Harpyia,</hi><hi rend="italic">Vampyrus, e.g.)</hi> is almost
                    obsolete. In the <hi rend="italic">Epomophori,</hi> however, we find a
                    remarkable departure from the general type: the pharynx is long and very
                    capacious, the aperture of the larynx far removed from the fauces, and, opposite
                    to it, a canal, leading from the narial chambers, and extending along the back
                    of the pharynx, opens; the laryngeal cavity is spacious and its walls are
                    ossified: the hyoid bone is quite unconnected, except by muscle, with the
                    cranium; the cerato-hyals and epi-hyals are cartilaginous and greatly expanded,
                    entering into the formation of the walls of the pharynx, and, in the males of
                    three species at least, supporting the orifices of a large pair of air-sacs
                    communicating with the pharynx (see fig. 67).</p>
                <p>In extent, peculiar modifications, and sensitiveness, the cutaneous system
                    reaches its highest development in this order. As a sensory organ its chief
                    modifications in connexion with the external ear, and with the nasal and labial
                    appendages, have been described when referring to the nervous system. It remains
                    therefore to consider its relative development as part cf the organs of
                    flight.</p>
                <p>The extent and shape of the volar membranes depend mainly on the form of the
                    bones of the anterior extremities, and on the presence or absence of the tail.
                    Certain modifications of these membranes, however, are met with, which evidently
                    do not depend on the skeleton, but are related to the habits of the animals, and
                    to the manner in which the wing is folded in repose.</p>
                <p>The volar membranes consist of—(1) the “antebrachial membrane,” which extends
                    from the point of the shoulder along the humerus and more or less of the forearm
                    to the base of the thumb, the metacarpal bone of wflιich is partially or wholly
                    included in it; (2) the “wing-membrane,”which is spread out between the greatly
                    elongat¾β fingers, and extends along the sides of the body to the posterior
                    extremities, generally reaching to the feet; and (3) the “interfemoral
                    membrane,” the most variable of all, which is supported between the extremity of
                    the body, the legs, and the calcanea (see fig. 65).</p>
                <p>The antebrachial and wing membranes are most developed in those species which are
                    fitted only for aerial locomotion, and which when at rest hang with the body
                    enveloped in the wings; but in the family <hi rend="italic">Embcdlomiridae,</hi>
                    especially in the subfamily <hi rend="italic">Molossinae</hi> (the species of
                    which are, of all Bats, the best fitted for terrestrial progression), the
                    antebrachial membrane is reduced to the smallest size, and is not developed
                    along the forearm, leaving also the <pb
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n430/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0430-0409"/> thumb quite free, and the wing-membrane is very
                    narrow and folded in repose completely under the forearm. The relative
                    development of the interfeιnoral membrane has been referred to above in
                    describing the caudal vertebrae. Its small size in the frugivorous and
                    sanguivorous species, which do not require it, to which, indeed, its presence
                    would be actually injurious as impeding their motions when searching for food as
                    they hang suspended by their feet, is easily understood. Odoriferous glands and
                    pouches opening on the surface of the outer skin are developed in many species,
                    but in most cases more so in males than in females, and so constitute very
                    remarkable secondary sexual characters. They will be referred to when treating
                    of the peculiarities of certain species. (See also the writer’s paper “On
                    Secondary Sexual Characters in <hi rend="italic">Chiroptera” Proc. Zool. Soc.

                <p>Space does not admit of entering here upon a special description of the
                    respiratory, circulatory, digestive, urinary, and generative organs, which will
                    be found fully treated of in the works noted in the bibliography of the order
                    below, and therefore with the above short account of the general structure of
                    the species we proceed to consider their classification and geographical
                    distribution.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Chiroptera</hi> fall naturally into two subdivisions, which

                    smooth, marked with a longitudinal groove; with the bony palate continued behind
                    the last molar narrowing slowly backwards; with three phalanges in the index
                    finger, the third phalanx terminated generally by a claw; with the sides of the

                    inferior to (not contained in) the interfemoral membrane; with the pyloric
                    extremity of the stomach generally much elongated; and with the Spigelian lobe
                    of the liver ill-defined or absent, while the caudate is well developed.</p>

                    membrane; second finger with a claw; premaxillary bones united in front. The six
                    species include some of the most remarkable forms of fruiteating Bats. They are
                    strictly limited to the African continent sou⅛, of the Sahara, and are readily
                    distinguished by their remarkably large and long head and very expansible, often
                    peculiarly folded, lips, and by the invariable white tuft of hair which adorns
                    the margins of the ears; most of the species also are provided with peculiar
                    glandular pouches, situated in the integument of the side of the neck near the
                    point of the shoulder. These pouches are rudimentary or quite absent in females,
                    thus presenting an interesting secondary sexual character. In the males they are
                    lined with a glandular membrane, from which long coarse yellowish hairs arise,
                    and, projecting from the mouth of the pouches, form conspicuous epaulet-like
                    tufts on the shoulders, hence the generic name. Another and even still more
                    remarkable secondary sexual character has been recently discovered by the writer
                    in the males of <hi rend="italic">E. franqueti, comphιs,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pusillus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">monstrosus.</hi> This consists in the
                    presence of a pair of large air-sacs extending outwards on each side from the
                    pharynx beneath the integument of the neck, in the position shown in fig. 67.
                    These sacs are evidently capable of being greatly distended at the will of the
                    animal, and their inflation probably occurs under the same circumstances that
                    the wattles of male gallinaceous birds swell up, namely, when engaged in
                    courting the females. Other remarkable conditions in which these Bats appear to
                    differ from all other species, as in the peculiar structure of the hyoid bones
                    and larynx, may be found described in detail in the writer’s paper in the <hi

                    Bats appear to live principally on figs, the juicy contents of which their

                    easy. They are the “Flying Foxes” of Europeans in India, and one of the species,

                    measures 5 feet across the fully extended wings, and is the largest known
                    species of the order. The species resemble one another closely in dentition, and
                    are mainly distinguished by the form of the ears and quality of the fur. <hi

                <p>The geographical range of the genus is very peculiar, extending from Madagascar
                    and its islands through the Seychelles to India, Ceylon, Burmah, the Malay
                    Archipelago, southern Japan, New Guinea, Australia, and* Polynesia (except the
                    Sandwich Islands, Ellice's Group, Gilbert’s Group, Tokelau, and the Low
                    Archipelago). Of the islands inhabited some are very small and remote from any
                    continent, such as Savage Island in the South Pacific, and Kodriguez in the
                    Indian Ocean. Although two species inhabit the Comoro Islands, which are
                    scarcely 200 miles from the African coast, not a single species is found in
                    Africa; yet in India, separated by thousands of miles of almost unbroken ocean,
                    a species exceedingly closely allied to the common Madagascar“Flying Fox”
                    isabundant. The Malay Archipelago and Australia are their headquarters, and in
                    some places they occur in countless multitudes. Mr Macgillivray remarks of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pt. conspicillatus :—</hi> “On the wooded slope of a hill oh
                    Fitzroy Island I one day fell in with this Bat in prodigious numbers, looking
                    while flying in the bright sunshine (so unusual for a nocturnal animal) like a
                    large flock of rooks. On close approach a strong musky odour became apparent,
                    and a loud incessant chattering was heard. Many of the branches were bending
                    under their load of Bats, some in a state of inactivity, suspended by their hind
                    claws, others scrambling along among the boughs, and taking to wing when
                    disturbed.” <hi rend="italic">Cynonycteris,</hi> dentition as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Pteropus,</hi> but with a short tail, and the fur of the back of

                    Africa, but has not been recorded from Australia or Polynesia; otherwise its

                    figured in Egyptian frescos. <hi rend="italic">Boneia,</hi> with one species,

                    rend="italic">marginatus</hi> is very common in India, and extremely destructive
                    to ripe fruit of every description. To a specimen of this Bat obtained by the
                    writer at Calcutta uninjured was given a ripe banana, which, with the skin
                    removed, weighed exactly 2 ounces. The animal immediately, as if famished with
                    hunger, fell upon the fruit, seizing it between the thumbs and the index
                    fingers, and took large mouthfuls out of it, opening the mouth to the fullest
                    extent with extreme voracity. In the space of three hours the whole fruit was
                    consumed. Next morning the Bat was killed, and found to weigh one ounce, half
                    the weight of the food eaten in three hours. Indeed the animal when eating
                    seemed to be a kind of living mill, the food passing from it almost as fast as
                    devoured, and apparently unaltered,eating being, as it were, performed only for
                    the pleasure of eating.</p>

                <p>In the above synopsis of the families of <hi rend="italic">Microchiroptera</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">Vespertilionidae</hi> take the centraj position; and this
                    is, indeed, the place really occupied by them in the suborder. This family
                    includes the common simple-faced Bats of all countries, of which the well-known
                    Pipistrelle and the Whiskered Bat (<hi rend="italic">Vespertilio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mystacinus)</hi> may be taken as familiar types, and its species
                    number about 150, considerably more than one-third the total number of the known
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Chiroptera,</hi> estimated at slightly over 400
                    (see Introd, to Dobson’s <hi rend="italic">Gated. Chiropt. Brit.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mus.,</hi> 1878). Besides the characters of the family given in
                    the synopsis, it may be added that the skull is of moderate size, the nasal and
                    frontal bones not much extended laterally or vertically, nor furrowed by deep
                    depressions; the number of incisors varies from ∣ to ⅜, rarely (in <hi
                    rend="italic">Antrozous</hi> only) ⅜, premolars ⅜ or ⅜ or ⅜, rarely (in <hi
                    rend="italic">Vesperugo</hi><hi rend="italic">noctiυagans</hi> of North America)
                    the upper incisors are small, separated by a wide space in the centre, and
                    placed in pairs or singly near the canines; the molars are well-developed, with
                    acute W-shaped cusps. The family is distributed over the temperate and tropical
                    regions of both hemispheres. The genera may be conveniently divided into four
                    groups :— <hi rend="italic">Plccoti,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Vespertiliones,</hi><hi rend="italic">Miniopteri,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thyropteri.</hi></p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Plecoti,</hi> of which the common Long-eared Bat <hi
                    rend="italic">(Plecotus</hi><hi rend="italic">auritus')</hi> is the type, the
                    crown of the head is but slightly raised above the face-line, the upper incisors
                    are close to the canines, and the nostrils are margined behind by grooves on the
                    upper surface of the muzzle, or by rudimentary nose-leaves; the ears also are
                    generally very large and united. Of the five genera, <hi rend="italic">Plccotus,
                    i ⅜, pm</hi> ⅜, has two species :—one the common Long-eared European Bat
                    referred to above; the other, <hi rend="italic">P. macrotis,</hi> restricted to
                    North America, is distinguished by the great size of the glandular, prominences
                    of the sides of the muzzle, which meet in the centre above and behind the
                    nostrils. <hi rend="italic">Synotus, i ⅜, pm</hi> ⅜, distinguished by dentition
                    and by the outer margin of the ear being carried forwards above the mouth and in
                    front of the eye, includes the European Barbastelle Bat, <hi rend="italic">S.
                    barbastellus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">S. darjel ingensis</hi> from the
                    Himalaya. <hi rend="italic">Otonycteris, i ⅜, pm</hi> ⅜, connecting this group
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Vespertiliones</hi> through the tropical <hi
                    rend="italic">Scotophili,</hi> is represented by a single species, <hi
                    rend="italic">0. hemprichii,</hi> from North Africa and the Himalaya. The next
                    two genera are distinguished by the presence of a rudimentary nose-leaf:— <hi
                    rend="italic">Nyctophihιs, i ⅜, pm ⅛,</hi> with one species, <hi rend="italic"
                    >N. timoriensis,</hi> from the Australian region; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antrozous, i ⅜, pm</hi> ⅜, distinguished from all the family besides by having
                    but two lower incisors, and from other <hi rend="italic">Plecoti</hi> by the
                    separate ears; the single species, <hi rend="italic">A. pallidus,</hi> inhabits
                    California.</p>
                <p>The group <hi rend="italic">Vespertiliones,</hi> with eight genera, includes
                    nine-tenths of the species. Of these one-third are contained in the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Vesperugo,</hi> which is divisible into six subgenera according to
                    the number of premolars and incisors; the latter vary from ⅜ to ⅜ in the
                    subgenera <hi rend="italic">Scotozous</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rhogeëssa,</hi>
                    and the premolars from ∣ to ⅜ (in the subgenus <hi rend="italic">Lasionyctcris
                    ⅜).</hi> The Bats of this genus are generally easily distinguished by their
                    comparatively thickly formed bodies, by their flat broad heads and obtuse
                    muzzles, by their short, broad, and triangular, obtusely-pointed ears, by their
                    obtuse and usually slightly incurved tragus, by their short legs, and by the
                    presence in most species of a well-developed post-calcaneal lobule. This lobule
                    (which is supported by a cartilaginous process derived from the calcaneum) may
                    act as a kind of adhesive disk in securing the animal’s grasp when climbing over
                    smooth surfaces. <hi rend="italic">Vesperugo</hi> probably contains the greatest
                    number of individuals among the genera of <hi rend="italic">Chiroptera,</hi>
                    and, with the exception of <hi rend="italic">Vespertilio,</hi> its species have
                    also the widest geographical range, being in fact cosmopolitan; and one of the
                    species, the well-known Serotine, <hi rend="italic">V. (</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Vesperus)</hi><hi rend="italic">serotinus,</hi> is remarkable as the only
                    species of Bat known to inhabit both the Old and the New World; one, <hi
                    rend="italic">V. borealis,</hi> has been found close to the limits of the Arctic
                    Circle, and another, <hi rend="italic">V. magellanicus,</hi> inhabits the cold
                    and desolate shores of the Straits of Magellan, doubtless the Bat referred to by
                    Mr Darwin in the <hi rend="italic">Naturalist's Voyage. Chalinolobus</hi> agrees
                    with <hi rend="italic">Vesperugo</hi> in the dental formula, but is readily
                    distinguished by the presence of a <pb
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n432/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0432-0411"/> well-defined lobe projecting near the angle of
                    the mouth from the lower-lip, and by the unicuspidate upper inner incisors. The
                    species fall into two subgenera:— <hi rend="italic">Chalinolobus, pm</hi> ⅜,
                    with <hi rend="italic">C. tuberculatus</hi> from New Zealand, Tasmania, and
                    Australia, and three other species from Australia; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Glauconycteris, pm</hi> ⅜, limited to southern and equatorial Africa, with <hi
                    rend="italic">G.</hi><hi rend="italic">argentatus</hi> and two other species,
                    the Bats of this subgenus being especially remarkable for their peculiarly thin
                    membranes traversed by very distinct reticulations and parallel lines. <hi
                    rend="italic">Scotophilus, i ⅜, pm</hi> ⅜, includes eight species, restricted to
                    the tropical and subtropical regions of the eastern hemisphere, though widely
                    distributed within these limits. The Bats of this genus, though difficult to
                    define, and approaching certain of those of <hi rend="italic">Vesperugo</hi> in.
                    many points, are distinguished especially by the single pair of unicuspidate
                    upper incisors separated by a wide space and placed close to the canines, by the
                    small transverse first lower premolar crushed in between the canine and second
                    premolar, and, generally, by their conical nearly naked muzzles and remarkably
                    thick leathery membranes. <hi rend="italic">Sc. t&amp;m-minckii</hi> is probably
                    the commonest species of Bat in India, and appears often on the wing even before
                    the sun has touched the horizon, especially when the white ants are swarming,
                    feeding eagerly upon them as they rise in the air. <hi rend="italic">Sc.
                    gigas,</hi> from equatorial Africa, with the forearm 3 ’ 4 inches, is by far th⅛
                    largest species. <hi rend="italic">Nycticejus,</hi> with the same dental formula
                    as <hi rend="italic">Scotophilus,</hi> is distinguished by the first lower
                    premolar not being crushed in between the adjoining teeth, and by the
                    comparatively much greater size of the last upper molar. It includes only the
                    common North American species <hi rend="italic">N. crepuscularis,</hi> a small
                    Bat scarcely larger than the Pipistrelle. <hi rend="italic">Atalapha, i ⅜,
                    pm</hi> ⅜ or ⅜, with five species, is also limited to the New World. The Bats of
                    this genus are generally characterized by the interfemoral membrane being more
                    or less covered with hair (in the two commonest species, <hi rend="italic">A.
                    noveboracensis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A.</hi><hi rend="italic">cinerea,</hi>
                    wholly thickly covered), and by the peculiar form of the tragus, which is
                    expanded above and abruptly curved inwards. In these species, which have two
                    upper premolars, the first is extremely small and quite internal to the
                    tooth-row. The genus <hi rend="italic">Harpyiocephalus, i ⅞, pm</hi> ⅞, includes
                    eight very remarkable small species, distinguished at once by their prominent
                    tube-like nostrils and hairy interfemoral membrane. <hi rend="italic">H.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">suillus</hi> from Java and neighbouring islands is the best-known
                    species, and another closely allied, <hi rend="italic">II. hilgendorfi,</hi> has
                    been described by Professor Peters from Japan. The remaining six species are
                    known only from the Himalaya and Tibet. All appear to be restricted to the hill
                    tracts of the countries in which they are found. Next to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vesperugo,</hi> the genus <hi rend="italic">Vespertilio,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >i ⅜, pm</hi> f, includes by far the largest number of species, amounting to
                    forty-three; it has, however, rather a wider geographical distribution in both
                    hemispheres, one species at least being recorded from the Navigators’ Islands.
                    The species are easily recognized by the peculiar character of the pairs of
                    upper incisors on each side, the cusps of which diverge from each other, by the
                    large number of premolars, of which the second upper is always very small, and
                    by the oval elongated ear and narrow attenuated tragus. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Keriυoula,</hi> with the same dental formula as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vespertilio,</hi> is easily distinguished by the parallel upper incisors, and
                    by the comparatively large size of the second upper premolar. Ten species have
                    been described from the</p>
                <p>Ethiopian and Oriental regions, of which <hi rend="italic">K.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">picta,</hi> from India and the Indo-Malayan subregion, is the
                    best-known, being well characterized by its brilliantly coloured orange fur and
                    conspicuously marked membrane, which are variegated with orange and black. The
                    genus includes the most delicately formed and most truly insectivorous,
                    tropical, forest-haunting Bats, which appear to stand as regards the species of
                    <hi rend="italic">Vespertilio</hi> ina position similar to that occupied by <hi
                    rend="italic">Chalinolobus</hi> with respect to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vesperugo.</hi></p>
                <p>The next group, <hi rend="italic">Miniopteri,</hi> includes two genera, <hi
                    rend="italic">Natalus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Miniopterus,</hi> characterized
                    by the great elevation of the crown of the head above the face-line, and by the
                    upper incisors being separated from the canines and also in front. <hi
                    rend="italic">Natalus,</hi> with the same dental formula and general external
                    form as <hi rend="italic">Kerivoula,</hi> is distinguished by the short
                    triangular tragus, and by the characters of the group enumerated above. It
                    includes three species, all restricted to South and Central America and the West
                    Indies; the head of one, <hi rend="italic">N. micropus,</hi> lately described by
                    the present writer, is shown in fig. 73. <hi rend="italic">Miniopterus, i ⅜,

                    are deeply hollowed out and expanded laterally, the muzzle presents a similar
                    cylindrical form, and the lower jaw also projects, but the single elevated nose·

                    small horizontal cutaneous appendages. All the species resemble one another
                    closely, and are mainly distinguished by the form of the tragus, and the size
                    and relative position of the second lower premolar. With the exception of <hi

                <p>In all the species of this family the nasal appendages are highly developed, and
                    surround on all sides the nasal apertures, which are situated in a depression on
                    the upper surface of the muzzle; the ears are large and generally separate,
                    without trace of a tragus; the premaxillary bones are rudimentary, are suspended
                    from the nasal cartilages, and support a pair of very small incisors; the molars
                    have acute W-shaped cusps; the skull is large, and the nasal bones which support
                    the large nasal cutaneous appendages are much expanded vertically and laterally;
                    in females a pair of teatlike appendages are found in front of the pubis; and
                    the tail is long and produced to the posterior margin of the interfemoral
                    membrane. The family is found in the temperate and tropical parts of the eastern

                <p>From whatever point of view the <hi rend="italic">Ehinolophidae</hi> may be
                    considered, 1hey are evidently the most highly organized of insectivorous Bats.

                    other Bats appear coarsely formed, and even their teeth seem less perfectly
                    fitted to crush the hard bodies of insects. The very complicated nasal

                    It is developed only in the male; in the female it is quite rudimentary. In the

                    >Phyllostomidae,</hi> possessing character's common to both, but also so many
                    remarkable special peculiarities as almost to warrant the formation of a
                    separate family for its reception. The type, <hi rend="italic">N. leporimιs</hi>
                    of Linnaeus, is a Bat of very curious aspect, with strangely folded lips, erect
                    cutaneous processes on the chin, and enormous feet and claws. The two middle
                    incisors are close together, and so large as to conceal the small outer ones,
                    while in the lower jaw there are but two small incisors. This apparent
                    resemblance to a Rodent actually led the great naturalist to remove this species
                    from the Bats and place it in his order <hi rend="italic">Glires</hi> or</p>
                <p>Rodents. Similarly the next group <hi rend="italic">Rhinopomata,</hi> represented
                    by a single species, <hi rend="italic">R. microphyllum,</hi> might also be
                    elevated into the rank of a family, for it is very difficult to determine its
                    exact affinities, a kind of cross relationship attaching it to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nycteridae</hi> on the one hand and to this family, in which it is
                    here placed provisionally, on the other. This curious species, distinguished
                    from all other <hi rend="italic">Microchiroptera</hi> as well by the presence of
                    two phalanges in the index finger as by its remarkably long and slender tail
                    projecting far beyond the narrow interfemoral membrane, inhabits the
                    subterranean tombs in Egypt and deserted buildings generally from north-east
                    Africa to Burmah.</p>
                <p>Subfamily II. Molossiuae. —Tail thick, produced far beyond the posterior margin
                    of the interfemoral membrane (except in <hi rend="italic">Mystacina)</hi>; legs
                    short and strong, with well-developed fibulae; upper incisors strong. This
                    subfamily includes all the species of <hi rend="italic">Emballonuridae</hi> with
                    short and strong legs and broad feet—whereof the first toe (and in most species
                    the fifth also) is much thicker than the others, and furnished with long curved
                    hairs,—with well-developed callosities at the base of the thumbs, and with a
                    single pair of large upper incisors occupying the centre of the space between
                    the canines. In all the species the feet are free from the wingmembrane, which
                    folds up very perfectly under the forearm and legs; the interfemoral membrane is
                    retractile, being movable backwards and forwards along the tail, and this power
                    of varying its superficial extent must confer upon these Bats great dexterity in
                    quickly changing the direction of their flight, as when obliged to double in
                    pursuing their swiftly-flying insect prey, which their extremely expansible lips
                    evidently enable them to secure with ease.</p>

                    and is further remarkable for its enormous throat sac and curious nursing

                    The nursing pouch is formed on each side by an extension of a fold of skin from
                    the side of the body to the inferior surfaces of the humerus and femur. In the

                    indigenous mammalian fauna of the islands. There are three distinct phalanges in

                    but a narrow portion along the forearm, the sides of the body, and the legs is
                    remarkably thick and leathery; beneath this thickened portion the wings are

                <p>The Bats included in this family are readily distinguished by the presence of a
                    well-developed third phalanx in the middle finger, associated either with
                    distinct cutaneous nasal appendages, or with well-developed central upper
                    incisors, or with both. Unlike the <hi rend="italic">Rhinolophidae,</hi> their
                    eyes are generally large, and the tragus well developed, maintaining almost the
                    same form throughout the species, however much the outer parts of the body may
                    vary. Their fur is. of a dull colour, and the face and back (in the <hi

                    as in the <hi rend="italic">Pteropodidae,</hi> of which they take the place in
                    the western hemisphere. À few species, probably all those with the tail and
                    interfemoral membrane well-developed, feed principally on insects, while the

                    the nasal apertures more or less surrounded or margined by well-developed

                    that the peculiarly shaped tongue is used by the animal, as in the case of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Macroglossi</hi> among the frugivorous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pteropodidae,</hi> to lick out the pulpy contents of fruits having hard rinds.
                    The food of the species of this group appears to consist of both fruit and
                    insects, and the long tongue may also be used for extracting the latter from the
                    deep corollae of certain flowers.</p>

                <p>Although the <hi rend="italic">Stenodermata</hi> are generally easily
                    distinguished from the <hi rend="italic">Vampyτi</hi> by the peculiar shortness
                    and breadth of the muzzle, and by the form of the molar teeth, certain species
                    of the latter group closely resemble those of the former in external appearance,
                    agreeing almost absolutely in the form of the nose-lea f, of the ears and
                    tragus, and of the warts on the chin. These resemblances show that, while the
                    form of the teeth and jaws has become modified to suit the food of the animals,
                    the external characters, being but slightly affected by this cause, have
                    remained much the same, and now indicate their common origin. The food of these
                    Bats appears to be wholly or in great part tree fruit. The twenty species nave
                    been divided into nine genera, distinguished by the form of the skull and teeth.

                    externally except by its very much smaller size, differs altogether in the
                    absence of the horizontal plate of the palate bones. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sturnira</hi><hi rend="italic">lilium,</hi> while agreeing with the above in
                    the form of the nose-leaf and ears, differs from all the species of the family
                    in its longitudinally-grooved molars, which resemble those of the frugivorous
                    <hi rend="italic">Pteropodidae</hi> more closely than those of any other Bats;
                    and the presence of tufts of long differently-coloured hairs over glands in the
                    sides of the neck shows yet another character in common still more remarkable,
                    which can scarcely be considered, like the teeth, the result of adaptive change.
                    <hi rend="italic">Centurio senex</hi> is the type of a genus distinguished from
                    <hi rend="italic">Stenoderma</hi> and other genera of this group by the absence

                <p>Terrestrial, rarely arboreal or natatorial, diphyodont placental mammals of small
                    size; with plantigrade or semiplantigrade, generally pentadactyle, unguiculate,
                    rarely subungulate, feet; with clavicles (sometimes imperfect or rudimentary);
                    with never more than two incisors in the mandible, and without canines.</p>
                <p>The upper incisors resemble the lower in growing uninterruptedly from persistent
                    pulps, and (except in <hi rend="italic">Lagomorphd)</hi> agree with them in
                    number; the premolars and molars are rooted or rootless, with tuberculated or
                    laminated crowns, and arranged in an unbroken series; the orbits are not
                    circumscribed by bone; the mandibular condyle is antero-posteriorly elongated;
                    the intestine (except in <hi rend="italic">Myoxidae)</hi> has a large caecum;
                    the testes are inguinal or abdominal; the uterus is tw∙o-horned, the cornua
                    opening separately into the vagina or uniting to form a corpus uteri; the
                    placenta is discoidal · and deciduate; and the smooth cerebral hemispheres do
                    not extend backwards so as to cover any part of the cerebellum.</p>
                <p>The Rodents form a very compact order, τeadily distinguished by their large
                    chisel-shaped incisors, and by the absence of canines. They include by far the
                    greatest number of species (over 900), and have the widest distribution, of any
                    of the orders of terrestrial mammals, being in fact cosmopolitan, although more
                    abundant in some parts, as in South America, which may be considered their
                    headquarters, than in others, as in Australasia and Madagascar, where
                    representatives of a few genera of one family <hi rend="italic">(Mvridae)</hi>
                    only are found, thus contrasting remarkably with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Insectivore,</hi> which constitute at least half the mammalian fauna of
                    Madagascar, but are without living representatives in South Anlerica.</p>
                <p>If, as we have seen, the term entomophagous is applicable to most <hi
                    rend="italic">Insectivore,</hi> much more so, on the other hand, may the species
                    of this great order be defined as phytophagous, and this uniformity in their
                    food and in the mode of obtaining it, namely, by gnawing, has evidently led to
                    such corresponding general uniformity in structure, which is observable
                    throughout the species, that with difficulty we obtain characters sufficiently
                    salient for dividing them into genera and families. Although, like the <hi
                    rend="italic">Insectivore,</hi> they present much diversity of habit,— some
                    being arboreal, as the Squirrels, many species of which are provided with
                    cutaneous parachutes on which they glide from tree to tree; some cursorial, as
                    the Hares; some agile jumpers, as the Jerboas; some fossorial, as the great
                    Mole-Rats; and some natatorial, as the Beavers and Water-Rats, —yet we do not
                    find corresponding structural modifications comparable with those noticed in
                    that order.</p>
                <p>The Rodent skull is characterized by the great size of the premaxillary bones,
                    which completely separate the nasals <pb
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n437/mode/1up"

                    of zygomatic arches, and by the wide unoccupied space existing between the
                    alveoli of the incisors and the molar teeth, and (except in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lagomorpha)</hi> by the antero posteriorly elongated glenoid cavity.
                    Post-orbital processes of the frontale exist only in the Squirrels, Marmots, and
                    Hares; in all other genera they are rudimentary or altogether absent; the zygoma
                    never sends upwards a corresponding process, and the orbit in all is freely
                    continuous with the temporal fossa; the lachrymal foramen is always within the
                    orbital margin; in many species the infra-orbital foramen is very large (in some
                    as large as the orbit), and transmits part of the masseter muscle; the zygomatic
                    arch is variously developed, and the position of the malar in it is used as a
                    distinguishing character for grouping the families; the nasals are, with few
                    exceptions, large, and extend far forwards; the parietals are moderate, and
                    there is generally a distinct interparietal; the palate is narrow from before
                    backwards,—this is especially pronounced in the Hares, where it is reduced to a
                    mere bridge between the premolars,—in others, as in the great Rodent Moles <hi
                    rend="italic">(Bathyerginae),</hi> it is extremely narrow transversely, its
                    width being less than that of one of the molar teeth; tympanic bullae osseae are
                    always present and generally large; in some genera, as in the Gerbilles <hi
                    rend="italic">(Gerbillinae)</hi> and Jerboas <hi rend="italic">(Dipodinae),</hi>
                    there are supplemental mastoid bullae which form great hemispherical bony
                    swellings at the back of the skull (see fig. 89, <hi rend="italic">Per);</hi> in
                    these genera, and in the true Hares, the meatus auditorius is tubular and
                    directed upwards and backwards. The mandible is characterized by its abruptly
                    narrowed and rounded symphysial part supporting the pair of large incisors, as
                    well as by the small size of the coronoid process and great development of the

                    the Rabbit have long been known. But I have recently found that unborn Rabbits
                    possess, in addition, two anterior upper and two lower deciduous incisors. Both
                    are simple conical teeth, the sacs of which are merely embedded in the gum. The
                    upper is not more than one-hundredth of an inch long, the lower rather
                    larger.”</p></note> and in this group alone does the enamel extend even
                    partially to the back of the tooth; in all others it is restricted to its front
                    surface, and so, by the faster wearing away of the softer structures behind, a
                    chisel-shaped edge is always maintained. Both the upper and lower incisors are
                    regularly curved, the upper slightly more so than the lower, and, their growth
                    being continuous, should anything prevent the normal attrition by which their
                    length is regulated, as by the loss of one of them, or by displacement owing to
                    a broken jaw or other cause, the unopposed unused incisor may gradually curve
                    upon itself until a complete circle or more has been formed, the tooth, perhaps,
                    passing during its growth through some part of the animal’s head. The molar
                    teeth may be rooted or rootless, tuberculated or laminated; and this diversity
                    of structure may be noticed even in the same family. When there are more than
                    three back teeth those which precede the last three have succeeded milk teeth,
                    and must therefore be considered premolars. In some species, as in the Agoutis
                    <hi rend="italic">(Dasyproctidae),</hi> the milk teeth are long retained, while
                    in the allied Cavies <hi rend="italic">(Caviidae)</hi> they are shed before
                    birth.</p>
                <p>There are generally nineteen dorso-lumbar vertebrae (13 thoracic and 6 lumbar),
                    and their forms vary in the different genera; in the cursorial and leaping
                    species the lumbar transverse processes are generally very long, and in the
                    Hares there are large compressed hypapophyses. The caudal vertebrae exhibit as
                    much variety as in <hi rend="italic">Insectivora,</hi> from their rudimentary
                    condition in the Guinea-Pig to their great size in the Jumping Hares and
                    prehensile - tailed Porcupines. The scapula is usually narrow, with a long
                    acromion; the clavicles may be altogether absent or imperfect, as in the
                    Porcupines, Cavies, and Hares, but in most species they are well developed; the
                    humerus has no supra-condylar foramen, and the forearm bones are distinct; in
                    most species the manus has five digits with phalanges normally developed, the
                    pollex rarely rudimentary or absent. In contrast to the normal condition of the
                    pelvis in <hi rend="italic">Insectivora,</hi> we find here largely developed
                    ischiatic and pubic bones, with a long usually osseous symphysis; the femur
                    varies considerably in form, and there is generally a well-defined third
                    trochanter; in the Sciurine and Hystricine Rodents the tibia and fibula are
                    distinct, but in the Rats and other Murines, and in the Hares, these bones are
                    united, often high up; the pes is much more variable than the manus, the digits
                    varying in number from five, as in the Squirrels and Rats, to four, as in the
                    Hares, or even three, as in the Capybara, Viscacha, and Agouti; in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dipodidse</hi> the metatarsals are greatly elongated, and in some
                    of the species, as in the Jerboas, they are ankylosed together.</p>
                <p>The mouth is divided into two cavities communicating by a constricted orifice, an
                    anterior containing the large incisors and a posterior in which the molars are
                    placed, the hairy integument of the face being continued inwards behind the
                    incisors. This evidently prevents substances not intended for food getting into
                    the mouth, as when the animal is engaged in gnawing through an obstacle.. In the
                    Hares and Pacas the inside of the cheeks is hairy, and in some species, as in
                    the Pouched Rats and Hamsters, there are large internal cheek pouches lined with
                    the hairy integument, which open near the angles of the mouth and extend
                    backwards behind the ears; in the New-World Pouched Rats <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Geomyidae)</hi> the pouches open externally on the cheeks.</p>

                <p>The tongue presents little of that variability in length observable in the
                    preceding orders; it is characteristically short and compressed, with an obtuse
                    apex never protruded beyond the incisors; in most species there are, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Insectivora,</hi> three papillae circumvallatae at the base; and
                    the apical portion is generally covered with small filiform papillae, some of
                    which in the Porcupines <hi rend="italic">(Hystrix)</hi> become greatly
                    enlarged, forming toothed spines. The stomach varies in form from the simple
                    oval sac of the Squirrel to the complex ruminant-like organ of the Lemming. In
                    the Water-Vole <hi rend="italic">(Arvicola amphibius)</hi> and in the Agouti <hi
                    rend="italic">(Dasyprocta agouti)</hi> it is strongly constricted between the
                    oesophagus and pylorus; in the common Dormouse the oesophagus immediately before
                    entering the stomach is much dilated, forming a large egg-shaped sac with
                    thickened glandular walls, and in some other species, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lophionιys imhausi</hi> and in the Beaver, glandular masses are attached to and
                    open into the cardiac or pyloric pouches. All Rodents, with the exception only
                    of the species of Dormice <hi rend="italic">(Myoxidae),</hi> have a caecum,
                    often of great length and sacculated, as in the Hares, Water-Voles, and
                    Porcupines, and the long colon is in some, as in the Hamster and Water-Vole,
                    spirally twisted upon itself near its commencement. The liver is typically
                    divided in all, but the lobes are variously subdivided in the different species
                    (in <hi rend="italic">Capromys</hi> they are divided into minute lobules); and
                    the gall-bladder, though present in most, is absent in a few. In most species,
                    as in many <hi rend="italic">Insectivora,</hi> the penis (which is generally
                    provided with a bone) may be more or less completely retracted within the fold
                    of integument surrounding the anus, and lie curved backwards upon itself under
                    cover of the integument, or it may be carried forward some distance in front of
                    the anal orifice, from which in the breeding season, as in the Voles and
                    Marmots, the prominent testicular mass separates it. The testes in the rut form
                    projections in the groins, but (except in <hi rend="italic">Lagom,orpha)</hi> do
                    not completely leave the cavity of the abdomen. Prostatic glands and, except in
                    <hi rend="italic">Lagomorpha,</hi> vesiculae seminales are present in all. The
                    uterus may be double, each division opening by a separate os uteri into a common
                    vagina, as in <hi rend="italic">Leporidae, Sciuridae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydrochoerus,</hi> or two-horned, as in most species. The mammary teats vary in
                    number from the single.abdominal pair of the Guinea-Pig to the six
                    thoracico-abdominal pairs in the Rats. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Octodontidae</hi> the teats are placed high up on the sides of the body.</p>
                <p>The peculiar odour evolved by many Rodents is due, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Insectivora,</hi> to the secretions of special glands, which may open into the
                    prepuce, as in <hi rend="italic">Mus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Arvicola,
                    Cricetus,</hi> &amp;c., or into the rectum, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arctomys</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aulacodus,</hi> or into the passage common
                    to both, as in the Beaver, or into pouches opening near the anus, as in the
                    Hare, Agouti, and Jerboa.</p>
                <p>The integument is generally thin, and the panniculus carnosus rarely much
                    developed. The fur varies exceedingly in character,—in some very fine and soft,
                    as in the Chinchillas and Hares, in others more or less replaced by spines on
                    'the upper surface, as in the Spiny Rats and Porcupines; in several genera, as
                    in <hi rend="italic">Xerus, Acomys, Platacanthomys, Echiothrix, Loncheres,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Echinomys,</hi> the spines are flattened. In the muscular
                    structures the chief peculiarities are noticeable in the comparatively small
                    size of the temporal muscles, generally so largely developed in <hi
                    rend="italic">Insectivora,</hi> and in the great double masseters, which are the
                    principal agents in gnawing; the digastrics also are remarkable for their
                    well-defined central tendon, and in many speci⅞s their anterior bellies are
                    united between the mandibular rami; the cleidomastoid generally arises from the
                    basi-occipital, and the pectoralis major is connected with the latissimus dorsi;
                    in the Porcupines and Hares the tendons of the flexor digitorum longus and
                    flexor hallucis longus are connected in the foot, while in the Rats and
                    Squirrels they are separate, and the flexor digitorum longus is generally
                    inserted into the halluceal metatarsal. (See Dobson, <hi rend="italic">Journ.

                    which these remains were found has been correctly determined) that, as in the
                    case of these orders also, the first appearance of true Rodents must be sought
                    for much farther back in time, and the question of their descent must be
                    deferred till the discovery of sufficient material admits of reliable
                    generalizations.</p>

                <p>Under this term may be included provisionally a large and rather heterogeneous
                    group of mammals, the existing members of which form the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pecora</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Belluae</hi> of Linnaeus, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ruminantia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pachydermata</hi> of Cuvier.
                    A few years ago it was found convenient to restrict the order to a well-marked
                    and distinctly circumscribed group, comprising the two sections known as <hi
                    rend="italic">Perissodactyla</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aτtiodactyla,</hi> and
                    to leave out such isolated forms as the Elephant and Hyrax; but the discovery of
                    a vast πumb∈τ of extinct species, which could not be brought under the
                    definition of either Perissodactyle or Artiodactyle Ungulates, <pb

                    to a certain extent bridge over the interval between these and the isolated
                    groups just mentioned, makes it necessary either to introduce a number of new
                    and ill-defined ordinal divisions, or to widen the scope of the original order
                    so as to embrace them all.</p>
                <p>They are all animals eminently adapted for a terrestrial life, and in the main
                    for a vegetable diet. Though a few are more or less omnivorous, and may under
                    some circumstances kill living creatures smaller and weaker than themselves for
                    food, none are distinctly and habitually predaceous. Their teeth are markedly
                    heterodont and diphyodont,—the milk set being well developed and not completely
                    changed until the animal attains its full stature. The molars have broad crowns
                    with tuberculated or ridged surfaces. They have no clavicles. Their toes are
                    provided with blunt, broad nails, or in the majority of cases with hoofs, more
                    or less enclosing the ungual phalanges. The scaphoid and lunar bones of the
                    carpus are always distinct.</p>
                <p>The whole group may be divided into the <hi rend="italic">Ungulata Vera,</hi>
                    containing the suborders <hi rend="italic">Perissodactyla</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Artiodactyla,</hi> and a less well-known assemblage of animals
                    which may be called <hi rend="italic">Subungulata</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ungulata Polydactyla.</hi> Cope has pointed out a character in the structure of
                    the carpus by which the latter are differentiated from the former. In all the
                    <hi rend="italic">Subungulata</hi> the bones of the proximal and distal row
                    retain the primitive or more typical relation to each other· (see fig. 100). The
                    os magnum of the second row articulates mainly with the lunar of the first, or
                    with the cuneiform, but not with the scaphoid, while in the group to which the
                    vast majority of modern Ungulates belong the second or distal row has been
                    shifted altogether towards the inner side of the limb (see figs. 107 and 109),
                    so that the magnum is brought considerably in relation with the scaphoid, and is
                    entirely removed from the cuneiform, as in the great majority of existing
                    mammals.</p>
                <p>SUBUNGULATA.</p>
                <p>By far the greater number of the <hi rend="italic">Subungulata</hi> are extinct,
                    and of many of those whose former existence has been revealed, chiefly by the
                    labours of the American palaeontologists, our knowledge is at present
                    necessarily imperfect, though daily extending. It will only be possible here to
                    give any details of some of the more interesting or best-known forms.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Suborder</hi><hi rend="italic">HYRAC01DEA.</hi></p>
                <p>This division is constituted to receive a single family of mammals, the
                    affinities of which have long constituted a puzzle to zoologists. They were
                    first placed among the Rodents, to which animals their small size and general
                    appearance and habits give them much superficial resemblance. Cuvier’s
                    investigations into their anatomical structure, and especially their dental
                    characters, led him to place them among the Ungulates, near the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhinoceros,</hi> a position still accepted by many zoologists.
                    Further knowledge of their organization and mode of development has caused
                    Milne-Edwards, Huxley, and others to disassociate them from this connexion, and,
                    failing to find any agreement with any other known forms, to place them in a
                    group entirely apart. Palaeontology has thrown no light upon the affinities of
                    this anomalous and isolated group, as no extinct animals possessing their
                    distinctive characters have as yet been discovered.</p>
                <p>The dentition consists only of incisors and molars, the formula in all known
                    species being <hi rend="italic">i</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >, c ⅞, p</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">, m ⅜.</hi> The upper
                    incisors have persistent pulps, and are curved longitudinally, forming a
                    semicircle as in Rodents. They are, however, not flattened from before backwards
                    as in that order, but prismatic, with an antero-external, an antero-internal,
                    and a posterior surface, the first two only being covered with enamel; their
                    apices are consequently not chisel-shaped, but sharp pointed. They are preceded
                    by functional, rooted milk teeth. The lower incisors have long tapering roots,
                    but not of persistent growth. They are straight, procumbent, with awl-shaped,
                    trilobed crowns. Behind the incisors is a considerable diastema or interval. The
                    molars and premolars are all contiguous, and formed almost exactly on the
                    pattern of some of the Perissodactyle Ungulates. The hyoid arch is unlike that
                    of any known mammal. The dorsal and lumbar vertebrae are very numerous, 28 to
                    30, of which 21 or 22 bear ribs. The tail is extremely short. There are no
                    clavicles. In the fore foot, the three middle toes are subequally developed, the
                    fifth is present, but smaller, and the hallux is rudimentary, although, in one
                    species at least, all its normal bones are present. The ungual phalanges of the
                    four outer digits are small, somewhat conical, and flattened in form. The carpus
                    has a distinct os centrale. There is a slight ridge on the femur in the place of
                    a third trochanter. The fibula is complete, thickest at its upper end, where it
                    generally ankyloses with the tibia. The articulation between the tibia and
                    astragalus is more complex than in other mammals, the end of the malleolus
                    entering into it. The hind foot is very like that of Rhinoceros, having three
                    well-developed toes. There is no trace of a hallux, and the fifth metatarsal is
                    represented by a small nodule only. The ungual phalanx of the inner (or second)
                    digit is deeply cleft, and has a peculiar long curved claw, the others having
                    short broad nails. The stomach is formed upon much the same principle as that of
                    the Horse or Rhinoceros, but is more elongated transversely and divided by a
                    constriction into two cavities—a large left <hi rend="italic">cul de sac,</hi>
                    lined by a very dense white epithelium, and a right pylorio cavity, with a very
                    thick, soft, vascular lining. The intestinal canal is long, and has an
                    arrangement perfectly unique among mammals, indeed among vertebrated animals,
                    for, in addition to the ordinary short, but capacious and sacculated caecum at
                    the commencement of the colon, there is, lower down, an additional pair of
                    large, conical, pointed caeca. The liver is much subdivided, and there is <pb
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n444/mode/1up"

                    typical Ungulates far more than the Rodents. The testes are permanently
                    abdominal. The ureters open into the fundus of the bladder as in some Rodents.
                    The female has six teats, of which four are inguinal and two axillary, and the
                    placenta is zonary, as in the Elephant and <hi rend="italic">Carnivora.</hi></p>
                <p>There are two distinct forms of Hyrax, differing both in structure .and habits,
                    and which may well be accorded generic rank.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Hyrax.—</hi> Molar teeth having the same pattern as those of
                    <hi rend="italic">Rhinoceros.</hi> Interval between upper incisors less than the
                    width of the teeth. Lower incisors slightly notched at the cutting edge.
                    Vertebrae: C 7, D 22, I. 8, S 6, C 6. Of this form the earliest known species,
                    <hi rend="italic">H. capensis,</hi> is the type. There are several other
                    species, as _ZZ. <hi rend="italic">syriacus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >habessinicus,</hi> from eastern Africa and Syria. They inhabit mountainous and
                    rocky regions, and live on the ground.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Dendrohyrax.—</hi> Molar teeth having the same pattern as
                    <hi rend="italic">Palaeo·</hi><hi rend="italic">therium</hi> (except that the
                    third lower molaι ’ has but two lobes). Interval between upper incisors
                    exceeding the width of the teeth. Lower incisors with very distinctly trilobed
                    crowns. Vertebrae: •C 7, D 21, I. 7, S 5, C 10. The members of this section
                    frequent the trunks and large branches of trees, sleeping in holes. There are
                    several species, not distinctly defined, from western and south Africa, as <hi
                    rend="italic">D. arboretis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">I). dorsalis.</hi> The
                    members of both groups appear to have a power like that possessed by the Lizards
                    called Geckos of clinging to vertical surfaces of rocks and trees by the .soles
                    of their feet. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Hyrax.</hi></p>

                <p>This name has been appropriated to a well-marked group of animals, presenting
                    some very anomalous characters, allied in many respects to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ungulata,</hi> but belonging neither to the Artiodactyle nor Perissodactyle
                    type of that order. It has been thought that they possess some, though certainly
                    not very close, affinities with the <hi rend="italic">Rodentia,</hi> and also
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Sirenia.</hi> It is certain, however, that the two
                    species of Elephant which are the sole living representatives of the group,
                    stand quite alone among existing mammals, differing widely from all others in
                    many points of their structure. In some respects, as the skull, proboscis, and
                    dentition, they are highly specialized, but in others, as in the presence of two
                    .anterior venae cavae, and in the structure of the limbs, they retain a low or
                    generalized condition. A considerable series of extinct forms, extending hack
                    through the Pliocene and Miocene epochs, show the same type under different
                    modifications, and in still more generalized outlines; and certain recently
                    discovered forms from the Eocene of North America, if their affinities are
                    rightly interpreted, appear to link the true <hi rend="italic">Proboscidea</hi>
                    to some unknown primitive type of Perissodactyle <hi rend="italic">Un-
                    'gulata.</hi></p>
                <p>The following are the principal characters common to existing, and, by inference,
                    to the extinct, <hi rend="italic">Proboscidea.</hi> The nose extended into a
                    long, muscular, very flexible and prehensile proboscis, at tho end of which the
                    nostrils are situated, and from which the namo given to the group is derived.
                    The teeth consisting of ever-growing incisors of very great size, but never
                    exceeding one pair in each jaw, and often present in one jaw only; no canines;
                    large and transversely ridged molars. No clavicles. Limbs strong, the upper
                    segment, especially in tho hind limb, tho longest. Radius and ulna distinct, the
                    latter articulating extensively with the carpus. Fibula and tibia distinct.
                    Astragalus very flat on both surfaces. Manus and pes short, broad, and massive,
                    each with five toes, though the outer pair may be more or less rudimentary, all
                    encased in a common integument, though with distinct, broad, short, hoofs. Third
                    digit the largest. Two anterior venae cavae entering the right auricle. Stomach
                    simple. A capacious caecum. Testes permanently abdominal. Uterus bicornuate.
                    Placenta non-deciduate and zonary. Mammae two. pectoral.</p>
                <p>With regard to the teeth, the incisors,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>These teeth are by some writers classed as canines, as their

                    alveoli are sunk. As growth proceeds, however, firm support for such massive and
                    weighty bodies can only be obtained by their roots gradually sinking through the
                    premaxillae into the great and specially modified alveolar processes of the
                    maxillae, but this does not vitiate their homology with the incisors of other
                    mammals.</p></note> whieh project largely out of the mouth, and are commonly
                    called “tusks,” are of an elongated conical form, and generally curved. They are
                    composed mainly of solid dentine, the fine elastic quality and large mass of
                    which renders it invaluable as “ivory” for commerce and the arts. A peculiarity
                    of the dentine of the <hi rend="italic">Proboscidea</hi> is that it shows, in
                    transverse fractures or sections, striae proceeding in the arc of a circle from
                    the centre to the circumference in opposite directions, and forming by their
                    decussations curvilinear lozenges, as in the “engine-turning” of the case of a
                    watch. The enamel covering in existing species is confined to the extreme apex,
                    and very soon wears off, but in some extinct species it forms persistent
                    longitudinal bands of limited breadth. The tusks have small milk predecessors,
                    shed at an early age.</p>
                <p>The molar teeth present a remarkable series of modifications from the
                    comparatively simple form in <hi rend="italic">Dinothérium.,</hi> with two or
                    three strongly pronounced transverse ridges and a normal mode of succession, to
                    the extremely complex structure and anomalous mode of replacement found in the
                    true Elephants. The intermediate conditions occur in the various species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Mastodon.</hi> In this genus the enamel-covered transverse ridges
                    of each tooth are generally more numerous than in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dinothérium,</hi> and often complicated by notches dividing their edge or by
                    accessory columns attached to them, but in the unworn tooth they stand out
                    freely on the surface of the crown, with deep valleys between (fig. 102, I). In
                    the Elephants the ridges are still further increased in number, and consequently
                    narrower from before backwards, and are greatly extended in vertical height, so
                    that, in order to give solidity to what would otherwise be a laminated or
                    pectinated tooth, it becomes necessary to envelop and unite the whole in a large
                    mass of cementum, <pb facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n445/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0445-0424"/> which completely fills up the valleys, and gives
                    a general smooth appearance to the organ when unworn; but as the wear consequent
                    upon the masticating process proceeds, the alternate layers of tissue of
                    different hardness—cementum, dentine, and enamel—which are disclosed upon the
                    surface form a fine and very efficient triturating instrument. The modification
                    of the tooth of a Mastodon into that of an Elephant is therefore precisely the
                    same in principle as that of the mplar of a Palaeotherium into that of a Horse
                    (see vol. xiii. p. 174), or of the corresponding tooth of one of the primitive
                    Artiodactyles into that of an Ox. The intermediate stages, moreover, even in the
                    present state of our knowledge, are so numerous that it is not possible to draw
                    a definite line between the two types of tooth structure (see fig. 102, II, III,
                    IV).</p>
                <p>As regards the mode of succession, that of modern Elephants is, as before
                    mentioned, very peculiar. During the complete lifetime of the animal there are
                    but six molar teeth on each side of each jaw, with occasionally a rudimentary
                    one in front, completing the typical number of seven. The last three represent
                    the true molars of ordinary mammals; those in front appear to be milk molars,
                    which are never replaced by permanent successors, but the whole series gradually
                    moves forwards in the jaw, and the teeth become worn away and their remnants
                    cast out in front, while development of others proceeds behind. The individual
                    teeth are so large, and the processes of growth and destruction by wear take
                    place so slowly, that not more than one, or portions of two, teeth are ever in
                    place and in use on each side of each jaw at one time, and the whole series of
                    changes coincides with the usual duration of the animal’s life. On the other
                    hand, the Dinothérium, the opposite extreme of the Proboscidean series, has the
                    whole of the molar teeth in place and use at one time, and the milk molars are
                    vertically displaced by premolars in the ordinary fashion. Among Mastodons
                    transitional forms occur in the mode of succession as well as in structure, many
                    species showing a vertical displacement of one or more of the milk molars, and
                    the same has been observed in one extinct species of Elephant (Ä <hi
                    rend="italic">planifrons)</hi> as regards the posterior of these teeth.</p>
                <p>All known Proboscideans are animals of large dimensions, and some are the most
                    colossal of land mammals. The head is of great proportionate size; and, as the
                    brain case increases but little in bulk during growth, while the exterior wall
                    of the skull is required to be of great superficial extent to support the trunk
                    and the huge and ponderous tusks, and to afford space for the attachment of
                    muscles of sufficient size and strength to wield the skull thus heavily
                    weighted, an extraordinary development of air-cells takes place in the
                    cancellous tissue of nearly all the bones of the cranium. These cells are not
                    only formed in the walls of the cranium proper, but are also largely developed
                    in the nasal bones and upper part of the premaxillae and maxillae, the bones
                    forming the palate and the basi-cranial axis, and even extend into the interior
                    of the ossified mesethmoid and vomer. Where two originally distinct bones come
                    into contact, the cells pass freely from one to the other, and almost all the
                    sutures become obliterated in old animals. The intercellular lamellae in the
                    gre⅛t mass which surrounds the brain cavity superiorly and laterally mostly
                    radiate from the inner to the outer table, but in the other bones their
                    direction is more irregular. Like the similar but less developed air-cells in
                    the skulls of many other mammals, they all communicate with the nasal passages,
                    and they are entirely secondary to the original growth of the bones, their
                    development having scarcely commenced in the new-born animal, and they gradually
                    enlarge as the growth of the creature proceeds towards maturity. The nasal bones
                    are very short, and the anterior narial aperture situated high in the face. The
                    zygomatic arch is slender and straight, the malar bones being small, and forming
                    only the middle part of the arch, the anterior part of which (unlike that of all
                    true Ungulates) is formed only by the maxilla. The maxillo-turbinals are but
                    rudimentary, the elongated proboscis supplying their place functionally in
                    warming and clearing from dust the inspired air.</p>
                <p>The neck is very short. The limbs are long and stout, and remarkable for the
                    great length of the upper segment (especially the femur) as compared with the
                    distal segment, the manus and pes. It is owing to this and the vertical position
                    of the femur that the knee-joint in the hind leg is placed much lower, and is
                    more conspicuous externally than in most quadrupedal mammals, and, this having
                    been erroneously compared with the hock-joint or ankle of Ungulates, the popular
                    fallacy that the joints of the Elephant’s leg bend in a contrary direction to
                    that of other mammals has arisen. There is no round ligament in the hip-joint,
                    or third trochanter to the femur. The radius and ulna are distinct, though fixed
                    in a crossed or prone position. The fibula also is quite distinct from the
                    tibia. The feet are short and broad, the carpal and tarsal bones being very
                    square, with flattened surfaces for articulation; the astragalus especially
                    differs from that of true Ungulates in its flatness, in the absence of a
                    distinct pulley-like articular surface at either extremity, and in having no
                    articular facet for the cuboid. The fibula articulates with the calcaneum, as in
                    Artiodactyles. Of the five toes present on each extremity (see fig. 100), the
                    middle one is somewhat the largest, and the lateral ones smallest, and generally
                    wanting (especially in the hind foot) the complete number of phalanges. The
                    ungual phalanges are all small, irregular in form, and late in ossification. The
                    whole are encased in a common integument, with a flat, subcircular, truncated
                    sole, the only external indication of the toes being the broad oval nails or
                    hoofs arranged in a semicircle around the front edge of the sole. The hind foot
                    is smaller and narrower than the front. The liver is small and simple, and there
                    is no gallbladder. In form the brain resembles that of the Rodents and other
                    lower orders of mammals, the cerebellum being entirely behind and uncovered by
                    the cerebrum, but the hemispheres of the latter are richly convoluted.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Probosddea</hi> are exclusively vegetable feeders, living
                    chiefly on leaves and young branches of forest trees and various kinds of
                    herbage, which they gather and convey to their mouth by the very mobile
                    proboscis, an organ which combines in a marvellous manner strength with
                    dexterity of application, and is a necessary compensation for the shortness and
                    inflexibility of the neck, as by it many of the <pb

                    performed. By its means the Elephant is enabled to drink without bending the
                    head or limbs; the end of the trunk being dipped into the stream or pool, a
                    forcible inspiration fills the two capacious air-passages in its interior with
                    water, which, on the tip of the trunk being turned upwards and inserted into the
                    mouth, is ejected by a blowing action, and swallowed; or if the animal wishes to
                    refresh and cool its skin, it can throw the water in a copious stream over any
                    part of its surface. Elephants can also throw dust and sand over their bodies by
                    the same means and for the same purpose, and wild animals have been frequently
                    observed fanning themselves with leafy boughs held in the trunk. The species are
                    at present limited in their geographical distribution to the Ethiopian and
                    Oriental regions, but they formerly had a far more extensive range.</p>

                    curved upwards, without enamel except on the apex before it is worn; preceded by
                    small milk incisors. The molars succeed each other by horizontal replacement
                    from before backwards, never more than one or part of two being in use on each
                    side of each jaw at the same time; each composed of numerous flattened
                    enamel-covered plates or ridges of dentine, projecting from a common many-rooted
                    base, surrounded and united together by cementum. The number of plates increases
                    from the anterior to the posterior molar in regular succession, varying in the
                    different species, but the third and fourth (or the last milk molar and the
                    first true molar), and these only, have the same number of ridges, which always
                    exceeds five. Skull of adult very high and globular. Mandible ending in front in

                <p>The well-known Asiatic Elephant, <hi rend="italic">E. indicus,</hi> inhabits in a
                    wild state the forestlands of India, Burmah, the Malay Peninsula, Cochin China,
                    Ceylon, and Sumatra. Those from the last-named islands, presenting some
                    variations from those of the mainland, have been separated under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">E. sumatranus,</hi> but the distinction has not been
                    satisfactorily established. The appearance of the Asiatic Elephant is familiar
                    to all. Though rarely breeding in captivity, it has been domesticated from the
                    most remote antiquity, and is still extensively used in the East as a beast of
                    burden. In the wild state it is gregarious, associating in herds of ten, twenty,
                    or more individuals, and, though itmay under certain circumstances become
                    dangerous, it is generally inoffensive and even timid, fond of shade and
                    solitude and the neighbourhood of water. The height of the male at the shoulder
                    when full grown is usually from 8 to 10 feet, occasionally as much as 11. The

                    of the Sahara, except where it has been driven away by human settlements. Fossil
                    remains of Pleistocene age, undistinguishable specifically, have been found in
                    Algeria, Spain, and Sicily. It was trained for war and show by the ancient
                    Carthaginians and Romans, and recent experience of the species in captivity in
                    England shows that it is as intelligent as its Asiatic relative, if not more so,
                    while surpassing it in courage, activity, and obstinacy. Nevertheless, in modern
                    times, no people in Africa have been sufficiently civilized or enterprising to
                    care to train it for domestic purposes. It is hunted chiefly for the sake of the
                    ivory of its immense tusks, of which it yields the principal source of supply to
                    the European market, and the desire to obtain which is rapidly leading to the
                    extermination of the species. In size the male African elephant often surpasses
                    that of Asia, but the female is usually smaller. The circumference of the
                    forefoot is half the height at the shoulder, a circumstance which enables the
                    hunters to judge from the footprints the exact size of the animals of which they
                    are in pursuit.</p>

                    Such remains belonging to the Pleistocene and Pliocene periods have been found

                <p>Among the most remarkable of the recent discoveries in the Eocene formations of
                    the western States of North America has been that of a group of animals of huge
                    size, approaching if not equalling that of the largest existing Elephants,
                    presenting a combination of characters quite unlike those known among either
                    recent or extinct creatures, and of which there were evidently many species
                    living contemporaneously, but all of which became extinct before the close of
                    the Eocene period. To form some idea of their appearance, we must imagine
                    animals very elephantine in general proportions and in the structure of their
                    limbs. The fore foot had five, and the hind foot four toes. The tail, as in the
                    Elephants, was long and slender, but the neck, though still short, was not so
                    much abbreviated as in modern Proboscideans, and there is no evidence that they
                    possessed a trunk. The head differed greatly from that of the Elephants, being
                    long and narrow, more like that of a Rhinoceros, and, as in that animal, was
                    elevated behind into a great occipital crest, and it had developed upon its
                    upper surface three pairs of conspicuous, laterally diverging protuberances, one
                    pair in the parietal region, one on the maxillaries in front of the orbits, and
                    one (much smaller) near the fore part of the elongated nasal bones. Whether
                    these were merely covered by bosses of callous skin, as the rounded form and
                    ruggedness of their extremities would indicate, or whether they formed the bases
                    of attachment for horns of still greater extent, like those of the Rhinoceros or
                    of the Cavicorn Ruminants, can only be a matter of conjecture. There were no
                    upper incisors, but three on each side below, of comparatively small size, as
                    was also the lower canine. A huge, compressed, curved, sharp-pointed canine
                    tusk, very similar in form and position to that of the Musk-Deer, descended from
                    each side of the upper jaw. These were present in both sexes, but very much
                    smaller in the female, as was also the flange-like process of the lower jaw by
                    which they were guarded. Behind these, and at some distance from them, were on
                    each side above and below six molar teeth, of comparatively small size, placed
                    in continuous series, each with a pair of oblique ridges conjoined internally
                    and diverging externally in a V-like manner, and provided with a stout basal
                    cingulum. The dental formula was therefore <hi rend="italic">i ⅞, c</hi> k, <hi
                    rend="italic">p ⅜, m</hi> | = 34; and the dentition had thus already attained a
                    remarkable degree of specialization, although the brain was smaller and more
                    rudimentary in characters than in almost any other known mammal.</p>
                <p>The first-discovered evidences of the existence of animals of this group were
                    described by Leidy in 1872, under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Uinta-therium</hi> (from the Uintah mountains, near which they were found).
                    Other nearly allied forms have been named <hi rend="italic">Dinoceras</hi>
                    (restoration of which is shown in fig. 105), <hi rend="italic">Tinoceras,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Loxolophodon.</hi> They constitute the order <hi
                    rend="italic">Dinoccrata</hi> of Marsh, but are included by Cope in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Amblypoda.</hi></p>
                <p>Another interesting form referred to this suborder is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coryphodon,</hi> which appears to connect the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proboscidca</hi> with the most primitive <hi rend="italic">Perissodactyla,</hi>
                    especially <hi rend="italic">Lophiodon.</hi> It was first described by Owen in
                    1846 from a fragment of a jaw from the London Clay. More perfect remains were
                    afterwards discovered in France, and lately in great abundance, indicating many
                    species from the size of a Tapir to that of a Rhinoceros, in the lowest Eocenes
                    of New Mexico and Wyoming, in the United States. It had forty-four teeth; the
                    canines of both jaws were large and sharp-pointed, and the molars had strongly
                    pronounced oblique ridges. The general proportions were those of a Bear, but the
                    tail was of moderate length, and the feet short and wide, with five toes on
                    each.</p>
                <p>The Tertiaries of South America have yielded some very remarkable forms of

                    attempted to unravel them. <hi rend="italic">Macrauchenia,</hi> an animal with a
                    Camel-like neck, is now known to be a Perissodactyle, though in some characters
                    somewhat aberrant. The articulation of the fibula with the calcaneum is an
                    Artiodactyle or perhaps generalized character. The teeth ally it to <hi
                    rend="italic">Palaeotherium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rhinoceros.
                    Homalodontotherium,</hi> from the banks of the river Gallegos, south-east
                    Patagonia, is known by the teeth alone, which, though very generalized, are on
                    the whole rhinocerotic. <hi rend="italic">Nesodon,</hi> from the same locality,
                    also only known by the dentition and some parts of the skull, connects the last
                    and <hi rend="italic">Macrauchenia</hi> with <hi rend="italic">Toxodon.</hi>
                    These three genera have the typical dental formula of <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                    ⅜, c⅛, <hi rend="italic">p ⅜, m</hi> ⅜ = 44. <hi rend="italic">Toxodon</hi> is
                    an animal about the size of a Hippopotamus; it was first discovered by Darwin,
                    and many specimens have since been found in Pleistocene deposits near Buenos
                    Ayres, and described by Owen, Gervais, and Burmeister. The teeth consist of
                    large incisors, very small lower canines, and strongly curved molars, all with
                    persistent roots, the formula being apparently <hi rend="italic">i</hi> ∣, c ⅜,
                    <hi rend="italic">p ⅜, in</hi> f = 38. The cranial characters exhibit a
                    combination of those found in both Perissodactyles and Artiodactyles, but the
                    form of the hinder part of the palate and the absence of an alisphenoid canal
                    belong to the latter; and the tympanic, firmly fixed in between the squamosal
                    and the exoccipital, ankylosed to both, and forming the floor of a long
                    upward-directed meatus auditorius, is so exactly like that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Suina</hi> that it is difficult to believe it does not indicate
                    some real affinity to that group. These characters seem to outweigh in
                    importance those by which some zoologists have linked <hi rend="italic"
                    >Toxodon</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Perissodactyla,</hi> and the absence of
                    the third trochanter and the articulation of the fibula with the calcaneum tell
                    in the same direction. The structure of the feet is not completely known, but
                    Cope has shown that the tarsal bones differ altogether from those of either
                    Artiodactyles or Perissodactyles, and more nearly resemble those of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Proboscidea</hi> than any other known Ungulates.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mesothorium,</hi> also called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Typotherium,</hi> from the same locality, was an animal rather larger than a
                    Capybar·a, and of much the same general appearance. Its skeleton is completely
                    known, and shows a singular combination of characters, resembling <hi
                    rend="italic">Toxodon</hi> or a generalized Ungulate on the one hand, and the
                    Rodents, especially the <hi rend="italic">Leporidae,</hi> on the other. In the
                    presence of clavicles it differs from all known Ungulates, and in having four
                    lower incisors from all Rodents. The teeth are <hi rend="italic">i ⅜, c ⅜,
                    p</hi> f, <hi rend="italic">in</hi> ¾ = 24.</p>
                <p>It will thus be seen that, although our knowledge of many of these forms is still
                    very limited, we may trace among them a curious chain of affinities, which would
                    seem to unite the Ungulates on the one hand with the Rodents on the other; but
                    further materials are required before we can establish with certainty so
                    important a relationship, one which, if true, would alter materially some of the
                    prevailing views upon the classification of mammals.</p>
                <p>UNGULATA VERA.</p>
                <p>In the typical <hi rend="italic">Ungulata</hi> the feet are never plantigrade,
                    and the functional toes do not exceed four,—the inner digit being suppressed, at
                    all events in all forms which have existed since the Early Eocene period. The os
                    magnum of the carpus articulates freely with the scaphoid. The allantois is
                    largely developed, and the placenta, so far as is known, is uon-deciduate, the
                    chorionic villi being either evenly diffused or collected in groups or
                    cotyledons (in <hi rend="italic">Pecora)</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> The testes
                    descend into a scrotum. There is never an os penis. The uterus is bicornuate.
                    The mammae are usually few and inguinal, or may be numerous and abdominal (as
                    in*i⅛⅛α), but are never solely pectoral. The cerebral hemispheres in existing
                    Ungulates are well convoluted.</p>
                <p>The group is now, and has been throughout the whole of the Tertiary period,
                    composed of two perfectly distinct sections, differing from each other, not only
                    in the obvious characters of the structure of the limbs, but in so many other
                    parts of their organization that they must be considered as of the rank at least
                    of suborders. The characters of these divisions, first indicated by Cuvier, were
                    thoroughly established by Owen, by whom the names whereby they are now generally
                    known were proposed.</p>

                <p>This is a perfectly well-defined group of Ungulate mammals, represented in the
                    actual fauna of the world by only three distinct types or families—the Tapirs,
                    the Rhinoceroses, and tlιe Horses—poor in genera and species, and (except in the
                    case of the two domesticated species of <hi rend="italic">Equus,</hi> which have
                    been largely multiplied and diffused by man’s agency) not generally numerous in
                    individuals, though widely scattered over the earth’s surface. Palaeontological
                    records show very clearly that these are but the surviving fragments of a very
                    extensive and much varied assemblage of animals which flourished upon the earth
                    throughout the whole of the Tertiary geological period, and which, if it could
                    be reconstructed in its entirety, would not only show members filling up
                    structurally the intervals between the existing apparently isolated forms, but
                    would show several marked lines of specialization which have become extinct
                    without leaving any direct successors.</p>

                    vertebrae never fewer than twenty-two, usually twenty-three in the existing
                    species. Nasal bones expanded posteriorly. An alisphenoid canal. Femur with a
                    third trochanter. The middle or third digit on both fore and hind feet larger
                    than any of the others, and symmetrical in itself, the free border of the ungual
                    phalanx being evenly rounded (see fig. 107). This may be the only functional
                    toe, or the second and fourth may be subequally developed on each side of it. In
                    the Tapirs and many extinct forms, the fifth toe also remains on the fore limb,
                    but its presence does not interfere with the symmetrical arrangement of the
                    remainder of the foot around the median line of the third or middle digit.
                    Traces of a hallux have only been found in some extremely ancient and primitive
                    forms. The astragalus, has a pulleylike surface above for articulation into
                    the*tibia, but its distal surface is flattened and unites to a much greater
                    extent with the navicular than with the cuboid, which bone is of comparatively
                    less importance than in the Artiodactyles. The calcaneum does not articulate
                    with the lower end of the fibula. The stomach is simple, the caecum large and
                    capacious, the placenta diffused, and the mammae inguinal.</p>
                <p>The very distinct minor groups into which the Perissodactyles are divided in the
                    later periods of the earth’s history are, even by the knowledge already gained
                    of the ancient members of the suborder, so closely united by connected forms
                    that it is difficult to make any satisfactory classification of the whole. This
                    is of course what might be expected, and would probably be the case with all
                    other groups if we knew as much of their past history as we do of that of the
                    Perissodactyles. It is necessary, however, for descriptive purposes to have some
                    arrangement; and perhaps, if not the most natural, the most convenient division
                    (especially as it is chiefly or only by these organs that many are known) is one
                    founded upon the structure of the lower molar teeth. By this character we may
                    make three primary divisions, each of which has a representative at the present
                    time:— <hi rend="italic">(A)</hi> those in which the crowns of the lower molars
                    are disposed in transverse ridges, as in the Tapirs; <hi rend="italic">(B)</hi>
                    those in which the crowns of the lower molars are formed by a pair of crescents,
                    as in Rhinoceros; (C ’) those in which the crowns of the lower molars are formed
                    of a pair of crescents, with the addition of inner lobes or columns, as in the
                    Horses. As these forms are all modifications of the same essential pattern,
                    transitions in certain or all of the teeth must be expected in many cases, and,
                    as before implied, the grouping of the Perissodactyles into Tapiroid,
                    Rhinocerotic, and Equine sections according to the pattern of their molar teeth
                    may not be a true exposition of the real affinities of the genera, but must be
                    looked upon rather as a convenient provisional arrangement.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Tapiroid Section.</hi></p>
                <p>Lower molars bilophodont.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Family</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Lophiodontidae.</hi></p>
                <p>Both upper and lower true molars bilophodont. Premolars smaller and simpler than
                    the true molars. Four toes on the anterior and three on the posterior feet. This
                    family includes a large number of more or less imperfectly known forms,' all
                    extinct, ranging from the size of a Rabbit to that of an Ox. They are the
                    earliest in time and most generalized in structure of the known Perissodactyles.
                    It is possible that from some either of the known or the still undiscovered
                    members of this group most of the other types of the order have been derived.
                    Their remains have been found in Europe only in the Lower and Middle Eocene,
                    though in North America they appear to have lingered to a somewhat later date.
                    The genus <hi rend="italic">Hyracotherium</hi> was established in 1839 by Owen
                    for a small animal, no larger than a Hare, the skull of which was found in the
                    London Clay at Herne Bay. A more perfect specimen apparently of the same species
                    was afterwards (in 1857) described under the name of <hi rend="italic">Philophus
                    υulpiceps.</hi> Closely allied forms from the European continent have been named
                    <hi rend="italic">Pachynolophus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lophiotherium.</hi>
                    These have all the complete dentition, viz., <hi rend="italic">i ⅜,</hi> c 1,7?
                    f, τn f = 44. The posterior lower molar has three lobes. The genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Lophiodon</hi> (Cuvier, 1822) contains animals of much larger size
                    and later geological period (Middle or Upper Eocene), in which the dentition was
                    so far specialized as to have lost the anterior premolar of both jaws, the
                    formula being <hi rend="italic">i</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >, c ⅜, p ⅜, m</hi> f = 40. The transverse ridges of the upper molars are placed
                    obliquely, the posterior is smaller than the anterior, and they are united by
                    their external borders; those of the mandible are distinct and only connected by
                    a feeble diagonal crest, the last bearing a talon or rudiment of a third lobe.
                    On the premolars the anterior ridge only is developed. Nearly allied was the
                    American genus <hi rend="italic">Hyrachyus,</hi> the structure of which is now
                    very completely known from well-preserved remains. The skeleton closely
                    resembles that of the Tapir, though the dentition is more like that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Lophiodon,</hi> except that the last lower molar has but two
                    lobes. As many as nine species have been already described, all from the Upper
                    Eocene. Another form from the same deposits, <hi rend="italic">Colonoceras</hi>
                    of Marsh, is said to have had an attachment for a dermal horn on each nasal
                    bone. <hi rend="italic">Triplopus,</hi> otherwise closely similar to <hi
                    rend="italic">Hyrachyus,</hi> wants the fifth digit of the manus, and hence is
                    placed by Cope in a distinct family, <hi rend="italic">Triplopidae.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Family</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Tapiridae.</hi></p>
                <p>Both upper and lower true molars bilophodont. Posterior premolars above and below
                    resembling the true molars. This family is connected with the last by the Middle
                    Miocene genus <hi rend="italic">Listriodon.</hi> The genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tapir us,</hi> in which as many as three premolars resemble the true molars,
                    and in which the last lower molar has no talon, appears first in the Upper
                    Miocene of Europe, and has continued with scarcely any appreciable change until
                    the present time, being represented by several species in Central and South
                    America, and one in the Malay Peninsula and adjacent islands. It is therefore
                    probably the oldest existing genus of mammals. One of the American species
                    differs from all the others in the great anterior prolongation of the
                    ossification of the mesethmoid cartilage, and has been separated generically by
                    Gill under the name of <hi rend="italic">Elasmognathus.</hi> See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Tapir.</hi><hi rend="italic">B.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Rhinocerotic Section.</hi></p>
                <p>Lower molar teeth with the ridges, instead of being transverse, curved in a
                    crescentic manner. The outer extremity of each ridge is curved forwards so that
                    the hinder ridge abuts against the external surface of the ridge in front of it.
                    An unworn lower molar of a Rhinoceros has thus externally two convex areas
                    separated by a vertical groove, and internally two principal sinuses,
                    corresponding to the projections externally. The entrances to these sinuses are
                    bordered by three conical pillars—the first of. comparatively little importance,
                    representing the anterior talon of the Tapir’s tooth, the second, the largest,
                    representing the antero-iuternal principal cusp, and the third the
                    postero-intemal principal cusp. The upper molars of all the animals of this
                    section resemble those of <hi rend="italic">Lophiodon</hi> in principle, the
                    transverse ridges being joined by an outer wall and placed obliquely, their
                    inner ends inclining backwards and their posterior surfaces being more or less
                    concave. There are two further chief modifications of this type :—(1) that in
                    which the free edge of the outer wall acquires a strongly zigzag or
                    bi-crescentic character, being deviated inwards opposite each of the principal
                    outer cusps, and outwards at the anterior and posterior angles of the tooth and
                    in the middle between the cusps, as in <hi rend="italic">Palaeotherium</hi>; and
                    (2) that in which the outer wall is greatly developed, and in the main flat or
                    smoothly convex, though with slight elevations and depressions corresponding
                    with those so regular and well-marked in the last section; this is the character
                    of the teeth of Rhinoceros and its allies.</p>

                    >Hyracodon</hi> of Leidy, a primitive or simple Rhinoceros-like type, from the

                    digits on each foot.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Family</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Rhinocerontidae.</hi></p>
                <p>A very extensive group, of which many modifications, forming a gradual series,
                    showing increasing specialization from primitive <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lophiodon-</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">τke</hi> animals, have
                    been discovered both in North America and in the Old World. One of the most
                    remarkable of these specializations has been the development of dermal horns
                    over tne nasal bones, either in laterally placed pairs as in some of the early
                    forms, or in the median line, either single or double. In America they all
                    became extinct before the close of the Pliocene period; but in the Old World,
                    although their geographical distribution has become greatly restricted, at least
                    five well-marked species survive. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Rhinoceros.</hi><hi

                    l·oliviensis,</hi> both from South America, and apparently from Pliocene

                    of descent of any of the existing Perissodactyles, and the steps by which they
                    are connected with the rest of the group have not yet been discovered. Of the
                    larger species, <hi rend="italic">M palachonica,</hi> the skeleton is completely
                    known. It had the full number of forty-four <pb

                    cervical vertebra resemble those of the Camels in the position of the
                    vertebrarterial canal, but the ends of the centra are flat, and not
                    opisthocoelous as in the allied forms. In some of the limb characters it
                    resembles the <hi rend="italic">Equidae,</hi> but in the articulation of the
                    fibula with the calcaneum it agrees with the Artiodactyles. The structure of the
                    feet is, however, distinctly Perissodactyle, there being three toes on each.</p>

                <p>These families, with not very distinctly defined boundaries, contain a large
                    number of extinct forms from Eocene and Miocene formations of both the Old and
                    the New World. Among the latter the most remarkable is a·group of animals of
                    gigantic size, to the first-known fragment of which the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Menodus</hi> was given in 1849 by Pomel, but of which more perfect
                    remains have since been described by Leidy as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Titanotherium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">MegotMrops,</hi> by Marsh as <hi

                    >Symborodon,</hi> some of which appear to represent distinct generic
                    modifications, but the synonymy of the group is at present much confused. The
                    head was large and much elongated, as in the Rhinoceros; but they had a pair of
                    stout diverging osseous protuberances like horn-cores on the maxillaries in
                    front of the orbits. Their molar teeth were of a simple palaeotheroid type, and
                    the incisors and canines were very much reduced. Their fore feet had four and
                    their hind feet three short, stout toes. Their remains abound in the Lower
                    Miocene strata of North America.</p>

                <p>The structure of the type of this family, <hi rend="italic">Palaeotherium,</hi>
                    was made known by Cuvier, from specimens found in the Paris gypsum beds (Upper
                    Eocene). Fig. 108 gives an idea of its general appearance, not unlike that of a
                    Tapir, which also it resembled in size. It had, however, but three toes on the
                    fore feet. The dentition was <hi rend="italic">i</hi> ⅜, c ⅛, <hi rend="italic"

                    discovered both in Europe and North America. To some of these the ancestral form
                    of the modem Horses may be traced, the transition from this to the next family
                    being formed by almost imperceptible gradations.</p>

                    these alone the family <hi rend="italic">Equidae</hi> is restricted by some
                    authors, but in few groups is the artificial nature of the boundaries placed
                    between such divisions so apparent as in the Perissodactyles, for the simple
                    reason that their palaeontological history is better known than that of most
                    others, and so many of the intermediate forms have been preserved. For the
                    history, characters, and present distribution of the <hi rend="italic"

                    >ARTIODACTYLA.</hi></p>
                <p>This is an equally well-defined group, traceable from the Early Eocene period,
                    though then apparently by no means so numerous as the Perissodactyles. Some of
                    its types, as that represented in the existing Swine, have retained to the
                    present time much of the primitive character of the group; but others have been
                    gradually becoming more specialized and more perfected in structure, and its
                    latest modification, the Cavicorn Ruminants or <hi rend="italic">Bovidae</hi>
                    (Antelopes, Sheep, and Oxen), are now the dominating members of the great
                    Ungulate order, widespread in geographical range, rich in generic and specific
                    variation, and numerous in individuals, —forming in all these respects a great
                    contrast to such decadent types as those represented by the Tapirs and
                    Rhinoceroses.</p>
                <p>The principal anatomical characters by which they are distinguished from the
                    Perissodactyles are as follows. The premolar and molar teeth not alike, the
                    former being single and the latter two-lobed. The last lower molar of both first
                    and second dentition almost invariably three-lobed. Nasal bones not expanded
                    posteriorly. No alisphenoid canal. Dorsal and lumbar vertebrae together always
                    nineteen, though the former may vary from twelve to fifteen. Femur without third
                    trochanter. Third and fourth digits of both feet almost equally developed, and
                    their ungual phalanges flattened on their inner or contiguous surfaces, so that
                    each is not symmetrical in itself, but when the two are placed together they
                    form a figure symmetrically disposed to a line drawn between them. Or, in other
                    words, the axis or median line of the whole foot is a line drawn between the
                    third and fourth digits, while in the Perissodactyles it is a line drawn down
                    the centre of the third digit. Distal articular surface of the astragalus
                    divided into two nearly equal facets, one for the navicular and one for the
                    cuboid bone. The calcaneum with an articular facet for the lower end of the
                    fibula. Stomach almost always more or less complex. Colon convoluted. Caecum
                    small. Placenta diffused or cotyledonary. Mammae few and inguinal, or numerous
                    and abdominal.</p>
                <p>In treating of many sections of mammals, it is only from the existing species
                    that our characters and classification can be derived, and to these chiefly our
                    observations upon the group must be directed, the extinct forms being so little
                    known that they can only be referred to incidentally. With the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ungulata,</hi> however, it is quite otherwise. As with the last section, the
                    history of the. <hi rend="italic">Artiodactyla</hi> throughout the Tertiary
                    period is now well known, and throws great light upon the position and relations
                    of the existing groups.</p>
                <p>The principal modifications which have taken place in <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
                    tyP <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> from its earliest known and most generalized
                    manifestation have been the following :— „</p>
                <p>1. As regards the teeth. Assumption of the grinding surfaces ot the molar teeth
                    either of a distinctly tubercular <hi rend="italic">(bunodont)</hi> or of a
                    crescentic ridged <hi rend="italic">(selenodont)</hi> form. Modification of the
                    latter from <pb facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n453/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0453-0430"/> a brachyodont to a hypsodont type. Loss of upper
                    incisors. Development of canines into projecting tusks. Loss of anterior
                    premolars.</p>
                <p>2. As regards the limbs. Reduction of the ulna from a complete and distinct bone
                    to a comparatively rudimentary state in which it coalesces more or less firmly
                    with the radius. Reduction of the fibula till nothing bu,t its lower extremity
                    remains. Reduction and final loss of outer pair of digits (second and fifth),
                    with coalescence of the metapodial bones of the two middle digits. Union of the
                    navicular and cuboid, and sometimes the ectocuneiform bone, of the tarsus.</p>
                <p>3. Change of form of the odontoid process of the axis from a cone to a hollow
                    half-cylinder.</p>
                <p>4. Development of horns or antlers on the frontal bones, and gradual complication
                    of form of antlers.</p>
                <p>5. By inference only, increasing complication of stomach with ruminating function
                    superadded. Modification of placenta from simple diffused to cotyledonary
                    form.</p>
                <p>The primitive Artiodactyles, with the typical number (44) of incisor, canine, and
                    molar teeth, brachyodont molars, conical odontoid process, four distinct toes on
                    each foot, with metapodium and all carpal bones discrete, no frontal appendages,
                    and (in all probability) simple stomach and diffused placenta, λvere separated
                    even in the earliest known forms into <hi rend="italic">Bunodonta</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Selenodonta,</hi><hi rend="italic">A..</hi> Bunodonta.</p>
                <p>This, the most primitive group, with various offsets which became partially
                    specialized and then extinct, unable apparently to adapt themselves to new
                    conditions, has been continued to the present day with comparatively little
                    change in the section of the suborder called <hi rend="italic">Suina,</hi>
                    containing the families <hi rend="italic">Hippopotamidae</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Suidae.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Hippopotamus, Peccary,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Swine.</hi></p>
                <p>B. Selenodonta.</p>
                <p>Members of this group having the complete· typical dentition as regards number,
                    but with various modifications in the details of the form of the teeth, and also
                    in the structure of the feet, abounded in the Middle and Upper Eocene and Lower
                    Miocene of Europe and America. One of the earliest known, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anoplotherium,</hi> was fully described by Cuvier from remains found in the
                    Paris gypsum beds (Upper Eocene). Its teeth formed a series unbroken by a gap or
                    diastema, and were of uniform height (as in Man alone of existing mammals). Its
                    tail was long, with large chevron bones underneath, not usually found in
                    Ungulates, and there were but two toes on each foot. It was in many respects a
                    much specialized form, apparently not on the line of descent of any of the
                    existing groups. <hi rend="italic">Cheeropotaτnus, Anthracotherium, Hyopotamus,

                    >Oreodon,</hi> and numerous others were forms more or less intermediate in
                    character between the three distinct sections into which, by their extinction,
                    the Selenodont Artiodactyles can now be divided,—the <hi rend="italic"

                    but complete, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi>, extending from the carpus or tarsus
                    to the digib Navicular, cuboid, and ectocuneiform bones of tarsus united.
                    Tympanic bullae of skull filled with cancellar tissue. No frontal appendages.
                    Ruminating, but the stomach with only three distinct compartments, the maniplies
                    or third cavity of the stomach of the <hi rend="italic">Pecora</hi> being
                    rudimentary. Placenta diffused.</p>
                <p>This section contains the single family <hi rend="italic">Tragulidae,</hi>
                    containing a few animals of small size, commonly known as Chevrotains,
                    intermediate in their structure between the Deer and the Pigs. The large size of
                    the canines of the male and the absence of horns caused them to be associated
                    formerly with <hi rend="italic">Moschus,</hi> one of the true Deer; hence they
                    are often spoken of as “Pigmy Musk-Deer,” although they have no musk-secreting
                    gland, or, except in the above-named trivial external characters, no special
                    affinities with the true Musk. There has scarcely been a more troublesome and
                    obdurate error in zoology than in this association of animals so really
                    distinct. It has been troublesome, not only as preventing a just conception of
                    the relations of existing Artiodactyles, but also in causing great confusion and
                    hindrance in palaeontological researches among allied forms; and most obdurate,
                    inasmuch as all that has been recently done in advancing our knowledge of both
                    groups has not succeeded in eradicating it, not only from nearly every one of
                    our zoological text-books, whether British or Continental, but even from works
                    of the highest scientific pretensions.</p>
                <p>The family is now generally divided into two genera.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tragulus,</hi> containing the smallest of the existing
                    Ungulates, animals having more of the general aspects and habits of some
                    Rodents, as the Agoutis, than of the rest of their own order. The best-known
                    species are <hi rend="italic">T. jaυanicus, T. napu, T. kanchil, T.
                    stanleyanus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">T. memmina.</hi> The first four are from
                    the Malay Peninsula, or the islands of the Indo-Malayan Archipelago, the last
                    from Ceylon and Hindustan.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hyomoschus</hi> is distinguished chiefly by the feet being
                    stouter and shorter, the outer toes better developed, and the two middle
                    metacarpale not ankylosed together. Its dental formula (as that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Tragulus)</hi> is <hi rend="italic">i</hi> ⅜&lt; c ⅛, <hi
                    rend="italic">p⅜,</hi> τzι⅜ = 34. Vertebrae: C7, D13, L6, S5, C12-13. The only

                    rend="italic">(ftg.</hi> 111), from the west coast of Africa, is rather larger
                    than any of the</p>
                <p>Asiatic Chevrotains, which it otherwise much resembles, but it is said to
                    frequent the banks of streams, and have much the habits of Pigs. It is of a rich
                    brown colour, with back and sides spotted and striped with white. It is
                    evidently the survivor of a very ancient form, as remains of a species only
                    differing in size <hi rend="italic">{H.</hi><hi rend="italic">crassus)</hi> have
                    been found in Miocene deposits at Sansan, department of Gers, France.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Pecora</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cotylophora.</hi></p>
                <p>No premaxillary teeth or caniniform premolars. Upper canines generally absent,
                    though sometimes largely developed. Inferior incisors, three on each side with
                    an incisiform canine in contact with them. Molariform teeth consisting of <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> f, <hi rend="italic">m</hi> ⅜, in continuous series.
                    Auditory bullae simple and hollow within. Odontoid process in the form of a
                    crescent, hollow above. Distal extremity of the fibula represented by a distinct
                    malleolar bone of peculiar shape, articulating with the outer surface of the
                    lower end of the tibia. Third and fourth metacarpals and metatarsals confluent.
                    Outer toes small and rudimentary, or in some cases entirely suppressed; their
                    metapodial bones never complete. Navicular and cuboid bones of tarsus united.
                    Horns or antlers usually present, at least in the male sex. Left brachial artery
                    arising from a common innominate trunk, instead of coming off separately from
                    the aortic arch as in the preceding sections. Stomach with four complete
                    cavities. Placenta cotyledonous.</p>

                <p>The Pecora or true Ruminants form at the present time an extremely homogeneous
                    group, one of the best-defined and most closely united of any of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mammalia.</hi> But, though the original or common type has never
                    been departed from in essentials, variation has been very active among them
                    within certain limits; and the great difficulty which all zoologists have felt
                    in subdividing them into natural minor groups arises from the fact that the
                    changes in different organs (feet, skull, frontal appendages, teeth, cutaneous
                    glands, &amp;c.) have proceeded with such apparent irregularity and absence of
                    correlation that the different modifications of these parts are most variously
                    combined in different members of the group. It appears, however, extremely
                    probable that they soon branched into two main types, represented in the present
                    day by the <hi rend="italic">Cervidae</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bovidae,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> otherwise the Antlered and Horned
                    Ruminants. Intermediate smaller branches produced the existing Musk-Deer and
                    Giraffe, as well as the extinct <hi rend="italic">Helladotherium</hi> inclining
                    to the first-named group and the extinct <hi rend="italic">Sivatherium,
                    Brahmatherium, Hy-</hi><hi rend="italic">daspüherium</hi> and others more allied
                    to the latter, although upon the true relationship of these forms there is a
                    difference of opinion between the two palaeontologists who have paid most
                    attention to the group, Riitimeyer and Lydekker, but the materials forthcoming
                    at present are scarcely sufficient for forming a decided opinion.</p>
                <p>The earliest forms of true <hi rend="italic">Pecora,</hi> as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gelocus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dremotherium</hi> (Miocene), had no frontal
                    appendages, and some few forms <hi rend="italic">(Moschus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Hydropotes)</hi> continue to the present day in a similar case. In
                    the very large majority, however, either in both sexes or in the male only, a
                    pair or occasionally two pairs <hi rend="italic">(Tetraceros</hi> and the
                    extinct <hi rend="italic">Sivatherium)</hi> of processes are developed as
                    weapons of offence and defence from the frontal bones, these being almost always
                    formed on one or other of two types.</p>
                <p>1. “Antlers” are an outgrowth of true bone, covered during their growth with
                    vascular, sensitive integument coated with short hair. In this state they remain
                    permanently in the Giraffe, but in the true <hi rend="italic">Cervidse,</hi>
                    when the growth of the antler is complete, the supply of blood to it ceases, the
                    skin dies and peels off, leaving the bone bare and insensible, and after a time,
                    by a process of absorption near the base it becomes detached from the skull and
                    is “shed.” A more or less elongated portion or “pedicle” always remains on the
                    skull, from the summit of which a new antler is developed. In the greater number
                    of existing species of Deer this process is repeated with great regularity at
                    the same period of each year. The antler may be simple, straight,
                    subcylιndrical, tapering and pointed, but more often it sends off one or more
                    branches called “tynes” or “snags.” In this case the main stem is termed the
                    “beam.” Commonly all the branches of the antler are cylindrical and gradually
                    tapering. Sometimes they are more or less expanded and flattened, the antler
                    being then said to be “palmated.” In young animals the antlers are always small
                    and simple, and in those species in which they are variously branched or
                    palmated, this condition is only gradually acquired in several successive annual
                    growths. An interesting parallel has been observed here, as in so many other
                    cases, between the development of the race and that of the individual. The
                    earliest known forms of Deer, those of the Lower Miocene, have no antlers, as in
                    the young of the existing species. The Deer of the Middle Miocene have simple
                    antlers, with not more than two branches, as in existing Deer of the second
                    year. Species occur in the Upper Miocene with three branches to the antlers, but
                    it is not until the Upper Pliocene and Pleistocene times that Deer occur with
                    antlers developed with that luxuriance of growth and beauty of form
                    characteristic of some of the existing species in a perfectly adult state. Among
                    recent <hi rend="italic">Cervidae,</hi> antlers are wanting in the genera <hi
                    rend="italic">Moschus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hydropotes;</hi> they are
                    present in both sexes in <hi rend="italic">T</hi><hi rend="italic">arandus</hi>
                    (the Reindeer), and in the male sex only in all others.</p>
                <p>2. The ‘‘ horns” of the <hi rend="italic">Bovidae</hi> consist of permanent,
                    conical, usually curved, bony processes, into which air-cells continued from the
                    frontal sinuses often extend, called “horn-cores,” ensheathed in a case of true
                    horn, an epidermic development of fibrous structure, which grows continuously,
                    though slowly, from the base, and wears away at the apex, but is very rarely
                    shed entire. The only existing species in which such a process occurs regularly
                    and periodically is the American Prong-Buck <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Antilocapra),</hi> in which the horns also differ from those of all others in
                    being bifurcated. Horns are not present at birth, but begin to grow very soon
                    afterwards. The males of all existing <hi rend="italic">Bovidae</hi> possess
                    them, and they are also present (though usually not so fully developed) in the
                    females of all except the genera <hi rend="italic">Portax,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>Another character by which the different members of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pecora</hi> can be distinguished is derived from the characters of the molar
                    teeth. Although there is nothing in the general mode and arrangement of the
                    enamel folds, or in the accessory columns, absolutely distinctive between the
                    two principal families, existing species may generally be distinguished inasmuch
                    as the true molars of the <hi rend="italic">Cervidae</hi> are “brachyodont,” and
                    those of the <hi rend="italic">Bovidae</hi> “hypsodont,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> the teeth of the former have comparatively short crowns, which, as
                    in most mammals, take their place at once with the neck (or point where the
                    crown and root join) on a level with or a little above the alveolar border, and
                    remain in this <pb facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n455/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0455-0432"/> position throughout the animal’s life; whereas in
                    the other forms, the crown being lengthened and the root small, the neck does
                    not come up to the alveolar level until a considerable part of the surface has
                    worn away, and the crown of the tooth thus appears for the greater part of the
                    animal’s life partially buried in the socket. In this form of tooth (which is
                    almost always most developed in the posterior molars of the permanent series),
                    the constituent columns of the crown are necessarily nearly parallel, whereas in
                    the first-described they diverge from the neck towards the free or grinding
                    surface of.the tooth. In the more complete hypsodont form the interstices of the
                    lengthened columnar folds of enamel and dentine are filled up with cementum,
                    which gives stability to the whole organ, and which is entirely or nearly
                    wanting in the short-crowned teeth. The same modification from low to high
                    crowns without essential alteration of pattern is seen in an even still more
                    marked manner in some of the Perissodactyle Ungulates, the tooth of the Horse
                    bearing to that of <hi rend="italic">Anchitherium</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Horse,</hi> vol. xii. p. 174) the same relation as that of an Ox does to the
                    early Selenodont Artiodactyles. A parallel modification has been also shown to
                    have taken place in the molar teeth of the <hi rend="italic">Proboscidea</hi>
                    (see p. 423).</p>
                <p>As the hypsodont tooth is essentially a modification of and, as it were, an
                    improvement upon the brachyodont, it is but natural to expect that all
                    intermediate forms may be met with. Even among the Deer themselves, as pointed
                    out by Lartet, the most ancient have very short molars, and the depressions on
                    the grinding surface are so shallow that the bottom is always visible, while in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Cervidae</hi> of the more recent Tertiary periods, and
                    especially the Pleistocene and living species, these same cavities are so deep
                    that whatever be the state of the dentition the bottom cannot be seen. Some
                    existing Deer, as the <hi rend="italic">Axis,</hi> are far more hypsodont than
                    the majority of the family; and, on the other hand, many of the Antelopes (as
                    <hi rend="italic">Tragelaphus)</hi> retain much of the brachyodont character,
                    which is, however, completely lost in the more modern and highly specialized
                    Sheep and Oxen.</p>

                <p>Frontal appendages, when present, in the form of antlers. First molar at least in

                    the rim of the orbit. An anteorbital vacuity of such dimensions as to exclude
                    the lacrymal bone from articulation with the nasal. Upper canines usually
                    present in both sexes, and sometimes attaining a very great size in the male
                    (see fig. 114). Lateral digits of both fore and hind feet almost always present,
                    and frequently the distal ends of the metapodals. Placenta with few cotyledons.
                    Gall-bladder absent (except in <hi rend="italic">Moschus).</hi> This family
                    contains numerous species, having a wide geographical distribution, ranging in
                    the New World from the Arctic Circle as far south as Chili, and in the Old World
                    throughout the whole of Europe and Asia, but absent in the Ethiopian and

                <p>Frontal appendages consisting of a pair of short, erect, permanent bony
                    processes, ossified from distinct centres, and for a time suturally connected
                    with the frontals, though afterwards ankylosed to them, covered externally with
                    a hairy skin, present in both sexes, and even in the new-born animal. Anterior
                    to these is a median protuberance on the frontal and contiguous parts of the
                    nasal bones, which increases with age, and is sometimes spoken of as a third
                    horn. No upper canines. Molars brachyodont. Lateral digits entirely absent on
                    both fore and hind feet, even the hoofs not developed.</p>

                    in both sexes. The lateral toes may be completely absent, but more often they
                    are represented by the hoofs alone, supported sometimes by a very rudimentary
                    skeleton, consisting of mere irregular nodules of bone. Distal ends of the
                    lateral metapodals never present. Gall-bladder almost always present. Placenta

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Bovidae,</hi><hi rend="italic">or</hi> hollow-horned
                    Ruminants (<hi rend="italic">Cavicornia),</hi> form a most extensive family,
                    with members widely distributed throughout the Old World, with the exception of
                    the Australian region; but in America they are less numerous, and confined to
                    the Arctic and northern temperate regions, no species being indigenous either to
                    South or Central America. There is scarcely any natural and well-defined group
                    in the whole class which presents greater difficulties of subdivision than this;
                    consequently zoologists are as yet very little agreed as to the extent and
                    boundaries of the genera into which it should be divided. The principal species

                    of the Bears, but the molar teeth were of the Ungulate type, while the large
                    incisors were very similar to those of the Rodents. The skeleton resembled that
                    of the Carnivores, but the scaphoid and lunar bones were distinct, and there was
                    a third trochanter on the femur. The feet were plantigrade, and each had five
                    digits, all with long pointed claws. In the allied genus <hi rend="italic"

                    to the difficulty so often referred to in this article of establishing anything

                    and have never less than four well-developed toes on each foot, with nails more
                    or less pointed, rarely rudimentary or absent. The pollex and hallux are never
                    opposable to the other digits. They are regularly diphyodont and heterodont, and
                    their teeth are always rooted.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    consists of small pointed incisors, usually three in number, on each side of
                    each jaw, of which the first is always the smallest and the third the largest,
                    the difference being most marked in the upper jaw; strong conical, pointed,
                    recurved canines; molars variable, but generally, especially in the anterior
                    part of the series, more or less compressed, pointed, and trenchant; if the
                    crowns are flat and tuberculated they are never complex or divided into lobes by
                    deep inflexions of enamel. The condyle of the lower jaw is a transversely placed
                    half-cylinder working in a deep glenoid fossa of corresponding form. The brain
                    varies much in relative size and form, but the hemispheres are never destitute
                    of well-marked convolutions. The stomach is always simple and pyriform. The
                    caecum is either absent or short and simple, and the colon is not sacculated or
                    greatly wider than the small intestine. Vesiculae seminales are never present.
                    Cowper’s glands are present in some, absent in other groups. The uterus is
                    bicornuate. The mammae are abdominal, and very variable in number. The placenta
                    is deciduate, and almost always zonary. The clavicle is often entirely absent,
                    and when present is never complete. The radius and ulna are distinct. The
                    scaphoid and lunar bones are always united into one, and there is never a
                    distinct os centrale in the adult. The fibula is always a distinct slender
                    bone.</p>
                <p>The large majority of the species composing this order subsist chiefly upon some
                    variety of animal food, though many are omnivorous, and some few chiefly, though
                    not entirely, vegetable eaters. The more typical forms live altogether on
                    recently-killed warm-blooded animals, and their whole organization is thoroughly
                    adapted to a predaceous mode of life. In conformity with this manner of
                    obtaining their subsistence they are generally bold and savage in disposition,
                    though some species are capable of being domesticated, and when placed under
                    favourable circumstances for the development of such qualities exhibit a very
                    high degree of intelligence and fidelity. The order is naturally divided into
                    two suborders, the members of one being the more typical, and mainly terrestrial
                    in their mode of life, while those of the other are aberrant, having the whole
                    of their organization specially modified for living habitually in water. These
                    are called respectively the True or Fissiped and the Pinniped <hi rend="italic"

                    >Pinnipedia.</hi> There is always one tooth in each jaw which is specially
                    modified, and to which the name of “sectorial” or “carnassial” tooth has been
                    applied. The teeth in front of this are more or less sharp-pointed and
                    compressed; the teeth behind it are broad and tuberculated. The characters of
                    the sectorial teeth deserve special attention, as, though fundamentally the same
                    throughout the suborder, they are greatly modified in different genera. The
                    upper sectorial is the most posterior of the teeth which have predecessors, and
                    is therefore reckoned as the last premolar <hi rend="italic">(p</hi> 4 of the
                    typical dentition). It consists essentially of a more or less compressed blade
                    supported on two roots and an inner lobe supported by a distinct root (see fig.
                    116). The blade when fully developed has three cusps (1, 2, and 3), but the
                    anterior is always small, and often absent. The middle lobe is conical, high,
                    and pointed; the posterior lobe has a compressed straight knife-like edge. The
                    inner lobe (4) varies very much in extent, but it is generally placed near the
                    anterior end of the blade, though sometimes it is median in position.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">^Ursidx</hi> alone both inner lobe and root are wanting,
                    and there is often a small internal and posterior cusp (5) without root. In this
                    aberrant family also the sectorial is relatively to the other teeth much smaller
                    than in the rest of the <hi rend="italic">Carnivora.</hi> The lower sectorial
                    (see fig. 117) is the most anterior of the teeth without predecessors in the
                    milk series; it is therefore reckoned the first true molar <hi rend="italic"
                    >(m</hi> 1). It has two roots supporting a crown, consisting when fully
                    developed of a compressed bilobed blade (1 and 2), a heel (4), and an inner
                    tubercle (3). The lobes of the blade, of which the hinder <hi rend="italic"
                    >(2)</hi> is the larger, are separated by a notch, <pb
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n457/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0457-0434"/> generally prolonged into a linear fissure. In the
                    most specialized <hi rend="italic">Carnivora,</hi> as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Felidae</hi> (I.), the blade alone is developed, both heel and inner tubercle
                    being absent or rudimentary. In others, as <hi rend="italic">Meles</hi> (V.) and
                    <hi rend="italic">Ursus</hi> (VI.), the heel is greatly developed, broad, and
                    tuberculated. The blade in these cases is generally placed obliquely, its flat
                    or convex (outer) side looking forwards, so that the two lobes are almost side
                    by side, instead of anterior and posterior. The inner tubercle (3) is generally
                    a conical pointed cusp, placed to the inner side of the hinder lobe of the
                    blade. The special characters of these teeth are more disguised in the Sea Otter
                    <hi rend="italic">{Enhydra)</hi> than in any other form, but even in it they can
                    be traced.</p>
                <p>The toes are nearly always armed with large, strong, curved, and tolerably sharp
                    claws, ensheathing the ungual phalanges, and held more firmly in their places by
                    broad laminae of bone reflected over their attached ends from the bases of the
                    phalanges. In some forms, most notably the <hi rend="italic">Felidae,</hi> these
                    claws are “retractile.” The ungual phalanx, with the claw attached, folds back
                    in the fore foot into a sheath by the outer or ulnar side of the middle phalanx
                    of the digit, being retained in this position when the animal is at rest by a
                    strong elastic ligament. In the hind foot the ungual phalanx is retracted on to
                    the top, and not the side of the middle phalanx. By the action of the deep
                    flexor muscles, the ungual phalanges are straightened out, the claws protruded
                    from their sheath, and the soft “velvety” paw becomes suddenly converted into a
                    most formidable weapon of offence. The habitual retraction of the claws
                    preserves their points from wear in ordinary progression.</p>
                <p>The Fissipedal <hi rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> were divided by Cuvier into two
                    groups, according to the position of the feet in walking,— the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plantigrada,</hi> or those that place the whole of the soles to the ground, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Digitigrada,</hi> or those that walk only on the toes; and
                    the difference between these groups was considered of equal importance to that
                    which separated from them both the <hi rend="italic">Pinnigrada</hi> or Seals.
                    The distinction is, however, quite an artificial one, and every intermediate
                    condition exists between the extreme typical plantigrade gait of the Bears and
                    the truly digitigrade walk of the Cats and Dogs; in fact, the greater number of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> belong to neither one form nor the other,
                    but may be called “subplantigrade,” often when at rest applying the whole of the
                    sole to the ground, but keeping the heel raised to a greater or less extent when
                    walking.</p>
                <p>A more natural classification is into three distinct sections, of which the Cats,
                    the Dogs, and the Bears may be respectively taken as representatives, and which
                    are hence called <hi rend="italic">Aeluroidea,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cynoidea,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Arctoidea.</hi> This division is founded
                    mainly on characters exhibited by the base of the skull, but is corroborated by

                    total 30. The upper anterior premolar, always small, may sometimes be absent
                    without any other modification in the dental or other structures. Such a
                    variation should not therefore be considered as of generic importance. Incisors
                    very small. Canines large, strong, slightly recurved, with trenchant edges and
                    sharp points, and placed wide apart. Premolars compressed and sharp-pointed. The
                    most posterior in the upper jaw (the sectorial) a very large tooth, consisting
                    of a subcompressed blade, divided into three unequal cusps supported by two
                    roots, with a very small inner lobe placed near the front end of the tooth and
                    supported by a distinct root. The upper true molar a very small tubercular tooth
                    placed more or less transversely at the inner side of the hinder end of the
                    last. In the lower jaw the true molar (sectorial) reduced to the blade alone,
                    which is very large, trenchant, and much compressed, divided into two snbequal
                    lobes. Occasionally it has a rudimentary heel, but never an inner tubercle. The
                    skull generally is short and rounded, though proportionally more elongated in
                    the larger forms. The facial portion is especially short and broad, and the
                    zygomatic arches very wide and strong. The auditory bullae are large, rounded,
                    and smooth. Vertebra: C 7, D 13, I. 7, S 3, C 13-29. Clavicles better developed
                    than in other <hi rend="italic">Carnivora,</hi> but not articulating with either
                    the shoulder bones or sternum. Limbs digitigrade. Anterior feet with five toes,
                    the third and fourth nearly equal and longest, the second slightly and the fifth
                    considerably shorter; the pollex still shorter, not reaching as far as the
                    metacarpo-phalangeal articulation of the second. Hind feet with only four toes.
                    The third and fourth the longest, the second and fifth somewhat shorter and
                    nearly equal; the hallux represented only by the rudimentary metatarsal bone.
                    The claws all very large, strongly curved, compressed, very sharp, and
                    exhibiting the retractile condition in the highest degree. The tail varies
                    greatly in length, being in some a mere stump, in others nearly as long as the
                    body. Ears of moderate size, more or less triangular and pointed. Eyes rather
                    large. Iris very mobile, and with a pupillary aperture which contracts under the
                    influence of light in some species to a narrow vertical slit, in others to an
                    oval, and in some to a circular aperture. Tongue thickly covered with
                    sharp-pointed, recurved horny papillae. Caecum small and simple.</p>
                <p>As in structure so in habits, the Cats may be considered the most specialized of
                    all the <hi rend="italic">Carnivora.</hi> All the known members of the genus
                    feed, in the natural state, almost exclusively on warm-blooded animals which
                    they have themselves killed. One Indian species <hi rend="italic">(F.
                    vivcrrina}</hi> is said to prey on fish and even freshwater molluscs. Unlike the
                    Dogs, they never associate in packs, and rarely hunt their prey in open ground,
                    but from some place of concealment wait until the unsuspecting victim comes
                    within reach, or with noiseless and stealthy tread, crouching close to the
                    ground for concealment, approach near enough to make the fatal spring. In this
                    manner they frequently attack and kill animals considerably exceeding their own
                    size. They are mostly nocturnal, and the greater number, especially the smaller
                    species, more or less arboreal. None are aquatic, and all take to the water with
                    reluctance, though some may habitually haunt the banks of rivers or pools,
                    because they more easily obtain their prey in such situations. The numerous
                    species of the genus are very widely diffused over the greater part of the
                    habitable world, though most abundant in the warm latitudes of both hemispheres.
                    No species are, however, found in the Australian region, or in Madagascar.
                    Although the Old-World and New-World Cats (except perhaps the Northern Lynx) are
                    all specifically distinct, no common structural character has been pointed out
                    by which the former can be separated from the latter. On the contrary, most of
                    the minor groups into which the genus has been divided have representatives in
                    both hemispheres.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the considerable diversity in external appearance and size
                    between different members of this extensive genus, the structural differences
                    are but slight, and so variously combined in different species that the numerous
                    attempts hitherto made to subdivide it are all unsatisfactory and artificial.
                    The principal differences are to be found in the form of the cranium, especially
                    of the nasal and adjoining bones, the completeness of the bony orbit
                    posteriorly, the development of the first upper premolar and of the inner lobe
                    of the upper sectorial, the length of the tail, the form of the pupil, and the
                    condition and coloration of the fur, especially the presence or absence of tufts
                    or pencils of hair on the external ears. There is one decidedly aberrant form,
                    which enables us to divide the genus into two sections, to which the rank of
                    genera is sometimes accorded.</p>

                    given, found chiefly in wooded districts through nearly the whole of Africa and
                    the warmer parts of Asia as far as Japan, belong to one or several species. See

                    inhabits the highlands of Central Asia, from the snowy mountains of Tibet to the
                    southern parts of Siberia, at altitudes of from 9000 to 18,000 feet above the
                    sea. It is about the size of the common Leopard, but lighter in colour, with
                    longer fur and less distinct spots. Its skull differs in shape from that of all
                    the other <hi rend="italic">Felidae,</hi> the facial portion being very broad,
                    the nasal bones especially being wide and depressed, and the zygomatic arches
                    very strong and deep. <hi rend="italic">F. macrocelis,</hi> the Clouded Tiger,
                    is a beautifully marked species, with elongated head and body, long tail, and
                    rather short limbs. The canine teeth are proportionally longer than in any
                    existing member of the genus. It is thoroughly arboreal, and is found in the
                    forests of south-east Asia and the islands of Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and
                    Formosa. <hi rend="italic">F. serval,</hi> the Serval, from South Africa, is
                    yellow with black spots, and has a short tail and large ears. Numerous smaller

                    defined zoologically, are found throughout the warmer parts of Asia and Africa.

                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Cynaelurus.</hi> —Sometimes considered as a distinct genus.
                    The Cheetah or Hunting Leopard, <hi rend="italic">F.jubata,</hi> is
                    distinguished fromtheother <hi rend="italic">Felidae</hi> by the inner lobe of
                    the upper sectorial, though supported by a distinct root, having no salient cusp
                    upon it, by the tubercular molar being more in a line with the other teeth, and
                    by the claws being smaller, less curved, and less completely retractile, owing
                    to the feebler development of the elastic ligaments. The skull is short and
                    high, with the frontal region broad and elevated in consequence of the large
                    development of the frontal air-sinuses. The head is small and round, the body
                    light, the limbs and tail long. Its colour is pale yellowish-brown with small
                    black spots. The Cheetah is less savage and more easily tamed than most of the
                    Cats. In Asia it has been trained for the chase of the Antelope. It has rather
                    an extensive geographical range from the Cape of Good Hope, throughout Africa
                    and the south-western parts of Asia, as far as southern India.</p>

                    Pliocene,and even later Miocene deposits in Europe, Asia, and America. Among
                    them is the Cave Lion, <hi rend="italic">F.</hi><hi rend="italic">spelaea,</hi>
                    which can scarcely be separated specifically from <hi rend="italic">F. leo,</hi>
                    and of which abundant remains are found in caves in England and other parts of
                    Europe. <hi rend="italic">F. cristata,</hi> from the Siwalik Hills, intermediate
                    in size between a Tiger and Jaguar, is distinguished from the other <hi
                    rend="italic">Felidae</hi> by the shortness of the face as compared with the
                    cranial part of the skull. These and many others, mostly of smaller size,
                    present no greater modifications of form than the various existing members of
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Felis,</hi> and can therefore be properly included
                    within its limits; but numerous other forms are gradually becoming known,
                    especially through the researches of American palaeontologists, which, though
                    evidently animals of the same general type and therefore to be included in the
                    family <hi rend="italic">Felidae,</hi> depart so much in various details of
                    structure that they must be placed in different genera. As one of the points in
                    which <hi rend="italic">Felis</hi> manifests its specialization is the reduction
                    of the number of the molar series of teeth with concomitant shortening of the
                    jaws, it might be supposed that in the earlier and perhaps ancestral forms these
                    teeth would be more numerous and approach more nearly to the primitive or
                    typical number of the heterodont mammals, viz., seven on each side. This is
                    actually the case. One European form (also recently found in America) to which
                    Gervais has given the name of <hi rend="italic">Pseudaelurus,</hi> of Miocene
                    age, has the dentition of <hi rend="italic">Felis</hi> with an addition of one
                    premolar in the lower jaw; but others have a still larger number, as <hi
                    rend="italic">Archaelurus</hi><hi rend="italic">debilis</hi> of Cope from the
                    American Miocene, about the size of a Panther, which has four premolars and a
                    tubercular molar in the upper jaw, and three premolars and two molars in the
                    lower jaw. A tubercular molar in the lower jaw, behind the sectorial, also
                    occurs in <hi rend="italic">Aelurogale,</hi><hi rend="italic">Dinictis,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Nimravus.</hi> Another tendency to generalization is the
                    existence in some forms, as <hi rend="italic">Hoplophoneus,</hi> of a posterior
                    lobe or heel to the inferior sectorial, found in nearly all Carnivores except
                    the existing <hi rend="italic">Felidae.</hi> On the other hand some of the
                    extinct <hi rend="italic">Felidae</hi> show a most remarkable tendency towards a
                    specialization not occurring in any of the surviving members of the family,
                    viz., an enormous development of the upper canines, with which is usually
                    associated an expansion downwards and flattening of the anterior part of the
                    ramus of the lower jaw, on the outer side of which the canine lies, when the
                    mouth is closed. In <hi rend="italic">Smilodon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >naeogeus,</hi> the Sabre-toothed Tiger, from the caves of Brazil and also from
                    Pleistocene deposits near Buenos Ayres, an animal about the size of a Tiger,
                    these teeth are 7 inches in length, greatly compressed, and finely serrated on
                    the trenchant anterior edges. Similar serrations are seen on a much fainter
                    scale in the unworn teeth of modern Tigers. Manymodificationsof this
                    commonly-called “machaerodont” type have been met with both in the Old and New
                    World to which the names of <hi rend="italic">Machaerodhs,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Drepanodon, Smilodon, Hoplophoneus, Dinictis, Pogonodon,</hi> &amp;c., have
                    been given. A very remarkable form, <hi rend="italic">Eusmilus,</hi> differs
                    from all other known Felines in having only four incisors in the lower jaw, and
                    a pair of small canines separated by a very long diastema from the next teeth,
                    which consist only of one premolar and one sectorial true molar. The lower jaw
                    is enormously expanded towards the symphysis to protect the large upper canines.
                    This animal then, although of Eocene age, appears to form the culminating
                    development of the sabre-toothed or machaerodont dentition, the most specially
                    carnivorous type of structure known.</p>

                    of its habits, except that it is nocturnal, frequently attacks and carries off
                    goats, and especially kids, and shows great ferocity when wounded, on which
                    account it is much dreaded by the natives.</p>
                <p>The remaining numerous specific and generic modifications found in the existing
                    animals belonging to this family seem to group themselves mainly into two

                <p>The numerous species of this genus form a large series, the two extremes of which
                    differ considerably, but the several sections into which they may be divided
                    blend so into one another that it is difficult to differentiate them sharply.
                    (1) <hi rend="italic">Viverra</hi> proper. This includes the largest species.
                    The teeth are stouter and less compressed than in the other sections. The second

                    Fur rather long and loose, and in the middle line of the neck and back
                    especially elongated so as to ⅛orm a sort of crest or mane. Pupil circular when
                    contracted. Perineal glands greatly developed. These characters apply especially
                    to <hi rend="italic">V. civetta,</hi> the African Civet, or ‘ ‘ Civet Cat” as it
                    is commonly called, an animal rather larger than a common Fox, and an inhabitant
                    of intratropical Africa. <hi rend="italic">V. zibetta,</hi> the Indian Civet, of
                    about equal size, approaches in many respects, especially in the characters of
                    the teeth and feet and absence of the crest of elongated hair on the back, to
                    the next section. It inhabits Bengal, China, the Malay Peninsula, and adjoining

                    In some of the smallest species the second upper molar (already reduced to very
                    small dimensions in the Genettes) is absent; in other respects their dentition

                    This is a curious Otter-like modification of the Viverrine type, having
                    semi-aquatic habits, both swimming in the water and climbing trees, living upon
                    fish, Crustacea, small mammals, birds, and fruit. The number and general

                    the posterior chamber being large, rounded, and generally with its greatest

                    produced into a short inferior wall to the auditory meatus, in which is a
                    depression or vacuity just below the centre of the opening of the meatus.
                    Sometimes this vacuity is continued into the meatus, forming a narrow fissure.
                    The paroccipital process does not project beyond the bulla, but is spread out

                    Five toes on each foot, the first, especially that on the hind foot, very short.
                    Toes free, or but slightly palmated. Palms naked. Distal portion of soles naked,
                    under surface of tarsus and metatarsus clothed with hair. Tail long or moderate,
                    generally thick at the base, and sometimes covered with more or less elongated
                    hair. The longer hairs covering the body and tail almost always annulated. This
                    genus contains a very large number of animals commonly called Ichneumons, or in
                    India Mongooses, varying in size from that of a large Cat down to a Weasel. They
                    are widely distributed over the African continent and the southern parts of
                    Asia, especially India and the Indo-Malayan archipelago, one species occurring
                    also in Spain. They are mostly terrestrial in their habits, feeding on small
                    mammals and birds, reptiles, especially snakes, eggs of birds and reptiles, and
                    also insects. Some species are partially domesticated, being used to keep houses
                    clear of rats, mice, and snakes. <hi rend="italic">H. ichneumon</hi> was a
                    sacred animal to the ancient Egyptians. They vary considerably in appearance,
                    some, as <hi rend="italic">H. galera</hi> (also called <hi rend="italic"
                    >paludinosus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">robustus),</hi> are larger and heavier,
                    with stouter body, longer limbs, and stronger teeth. Others are small, with very
                    elongated bodies and short legs. The tail also varies somewhat in length, and in
                    the amount of hair with which it is covered. These trivial differences have
                    given rise to the formation by some zoologists of very numerous genera, the
                    characters of which are by no means clearly defined, but the following are the

                    Dog-like animals, which appear to hold an intermediate position between the

                    the ancient members of the order. The structure of the auditory bulla and

                    and Arctoid forms. In the number and arrangement of the teeth they more nearly

                <p>The Dogs form a very compact group, composed of numerous species which closely
                    resemble each other in essential characters, though differing considerably
                    externally. The most marked differences are a slight variation in the number of
                    the true molar teeth, which exceed the usual number in the Cape Long-eared Fox
                    <hi rend="italic">(Otocyon),</hi> and fall short of it in some other less
                    aberrant forms to which the names of <hi rend="italic">Icticyon</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyan</hi> have been given, and a diminution in the number of toes

                    of 5-4 as in the remainder of the family. After taking these away, there remain
                    a great number of animals called Dogs, Wolves, Jackals, and Foxes, varying from
                    one another only in the characters of the tail, ears, fur, form of the pupil,
                    and some trifling peculiarities of skull and teeth, upon which some authors have
                    divided them into many genera. These divisions are, however, extremely
                    difficult, if not impossible, to define, bn account of the numerous gradual
                    transitions from one form to the other.</p>

                    figured at p. 353 (fig. 3). The upper sectorial <hi rend="italic"> p</hi> 4
                    consists of a stout blade, of which the anterior cusp is almost obsolete, the
                    middle cusp large, conical, and pointed backwards, and the posterior cusp in the
                    form of a compressed ridge; the inner lobe is very small, and placed quite at
                    the fore part of the tooth. The first molar is more than half the
                    antero-posterior length of the sectorial, and considerably wider than it is
                    long; its crown consists of two prominent conical cusps, of which the anterior
                    is the larger, and a low broad inward prolongation, supporting two more or less
                    distinct cusps and a raised inner border. The second molar resembles the first
                    in general form, but is considerably smaller. The lower sectorial <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> 1 is a very large tooth, with a strong compressed bilobed
                    blade, the hinder lobe being considerably the larger and more pointed, a small
                    but distinct inner tubercle placed at the hinder margin of the posterior lobe of
                    the blade, and a broad, low, tuberculated heel, occupying about one-third of the
                    whole length of the tooth. The second molar is less than half the length of the
                    first, with a pair of cusps placed side by side anteriorly, and a less distinct
                    posterior pair. The third is an extremely small and simple tooth with a
                    subcircular tuberculated crown and single root.</p>
                <p>The cranium is more or less elongated, the facial portion tapering forwards and
                    compressed. The jaws elongated. The zygomata moderately strong. The post-orbital
                    processes of the frontal short, leaving the orbit widely open posteriorly.
                    Vertebrae: C 7, D 13, I. 7, S 3, C 17-22. Clavicles present, but very
                    rudimentary. Limbs of moderate proportions, digitigrade. Feet shoYt; five toes
                    on the fore foot, the pollex much shorter than the others, and not reaching to
                    the ground. Four toes on the hind foot, the hallux being represented by a
                    rudiment of the metatarsal.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>In Domestic Doge a hallux is frequently developed, though often in a
                    rudimentary condition, the phalanges and claw being suspended loosely in the
                    skin, without direct connexion with the other bones of the foot; it is called by
                    dog-fanciers the “dew cltw.”</p></note> All the toes are provided with exserted
                    non-retractile slightly curved and blunt claws, which, being exposed, become
                    worn at the tips. Tail moderate, or rather long, generally somewhat bushy. The
                    pupil of the eye, when contracted, is in some species round, in others
                    elliptical and vertical.</p>
                <p>This extensive genus may be considered as truly cosmopolitan. One or more species
                    are found throughout the American continent from Greenland to Patagonia and the
                    Falkland Isles; and similarly, in the Old World, Europe, Africa, and Asia, with
                    most of the large islands adjacent, and even Australia, have their wild Dogs,
                    though in the last case they probably belong to a feral race, introduced
                    originally by man. They are generally sociable animals, hunting their prey in
                    packs. Many species burrow in the ground; none habitually climb trees. Though
                    mostly carnivorous, feeding chiefly on animals they have chased and killed
                    themselves, many, especially among the smaller species, eat garbage, carrion,
                    insects, and also fruit, berries, and other vegetable substances. The species
                    are very numerous, and, as in most other large genera, very ill-defined, few
                    zoologists agreeing as to which of the many slightly different modifications may
                    be considered as local varieties and which true species. Perhaps the best
                    cranial character by which the different members of the genus can be
                    distinguished is that pointed out by Burmeister, viz., that in the animals
                    generally called Dogs, Wolves, and Jackals the post-orbital process of the
                    frontal bone is regularly smooth and convex above, with its extremity bent
                    downwards, whereas in Foxes the process is hollowed above, with its outer margin
                    (particularly of the anterior border) somewhat raised. This modification
                    coincides in the main with that upon which Professor Huxley has recently<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Proc. Zool.
                    Soc. Lond.,</hi> 1880, p. 238.</p></note> based his division of the group into
                    two parallel series, the Thooids or Lupine forms and Alopecoids or Vulpine
                    forms, which he characterizes by the presence of frontal air-sinuses in the
                    former, which not only affects the external form but to a still greater degree
                    the shape of the anterior part of the cranial cavity, and the absence of such
                    sinuses in the latter. The pupil of the eye when contracted is round in most
                    members of the first group, and vertically elliptical in the others, but more
                    observations are required before this character can be absolutely relied upon.
                    The form and length of the tail is often used for the purposes of
                    classification, but its characters do not coincide with those of the cranium, as
                    many of the South American <hi rend="italic">Canidae</hi> have the long busby
                    tails of Foxes and the skulls of Wolves. Taking into account various
                    combinations of these and other minor characters, the species may be arranged in
                    the following groups, which some authors have considered as of generic
                    importance.</p>
                <p>A. <hi rend="italic">Thooid or Lupine Series.</hi></p>
                <p>(1) <hi rend="italic">Canis</hi> proper contains the largest members of the
                    genus, the true Wolves of the northern parts of both Old and New Worlds (O'. <hi
                    rend="italic">lupus,</hi> &amp;c. ), the Jackals of southern Asia and Africa
                    (O'. <hi rend="italic">aureus, mesomelas,</hi> &amp;c.), and the various breeds
                    of the domestic Dog <hi rend="italic">(C. familiaris),</hi> the origin of which
                    is still involved in obscurity. Some naturalists believe it to be a distinct
                    species, descended from one that no longer exists in a wild state; others have
                    sought to find its progenitors in some one of the wild or feral races, either of
                    true Hogs, Wolves, or Jackals; while others again believe that it is derived
                    from the mingling of two or more wild species or races. It is probably the
                    earliest animal domesticated by man, and few if any other species have undergone
                    such an extraordinary amount of variation in size, form, and proportion of
                    limbs, ears, and tail, variations which have been perpetuated and increased by
                    careful selective breeding. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Dog.</hi> The Dingo or
                    Australian Dog is met with wild, and also as the domestic companion of the
                    aboriginal people. Dogs were also in the possession of the natives of New
                    Zealand and other islands of the Pacific, where no placental mammals exist
                    naturally, on their discovery by Europeans in the last century. (2) <hi

                    above in wanting the small last»lower tubercular molar. (3) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lycalopex</hi> is a group formed of certain South-American <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canidae,</hi> distinguished from <hi rend="italic">Canis</hi> proper by their
                    longer tails and Fox-like aspect :— <hi rend="italic">C. cancrivorus, C.

                    rend="italic">Pseudalopex)</hi> on account of slight differences in the relative
                    size of the molar teeth, and of their pupil being elliptical when contracted.
                    (4) <hi rend="italic">Nyctereutes</hi> (one species, <hi rend="italic">C.
                    procyonides,</hi> from Japan and north-east Asia) has no claims to generic
                    distinction but such as are founded upon its long loose fur, short ears, and
                    short bushy tail, which give it some superficial resemblance to a Raccoon. (5)
                    <hi rend="italic">Icticyon,</hi> with one small species, <hi rend="italic">C.
                    venaticus,</hi> the Bush Dog, from Guiana and Brazil, with close hair, and short
                    legs and tail, has more reason to be regarded as a distinct form, as it is
                    distinguished from all other Dogs by the reduction of its molar teeth to ⅜, and
                    their comparatively small size. In consequence of this, and its general external
                    characters, it was formerly placed among the <hi rend="italic">Mustelidae,</hi>
                    but its Canine affinities have now been thoroughly established.</p>

                <p>(6) <hi rend="italic">Vulpes,</hi> true Foxes. The species or varieties are
                    numerous and widely spread over North America, Eurasia, and Africa :— <hi

                    teeth are thus in excess of any other known heterodont mammal. They have the
                    same general characters as in <hi rend="italic">Canis,</hi> with very pointed
                    cusps. The lower sectorial shows little of its typical characters, having five
                    cusps on the surface; these can, however, be identified as the inner tubercle,
                    the two greatly reduced and obliquely placed lobes of the blade, and two cusps
                    on the heel. The skull generally resembles that of the smaller Foxes,
                    particularly the Fennecs. The auditory bullae are very large. The hinder edge of
                    the mandible has a very peculiar form, owing to the great development of an
                    expanded, compressed, and somewhat inverted subangular process. Vertebrae: C 7,

                <p>Professor Huxley looks upon this as the least differentiated or most primitive
                    existing form of <hi rend="italic">Canis,</hi> regarding the presence of the

                    carnivorous Marsupials. There is, however, at present no palaeontological proof
                    of this, as none of the numerous fossil forms of <hi rend="italic">Canidae</hi>
                    yet discovered have more than the normal number of molars. One of the best known

                    is said to live on molluscs and crabs as well as fish, and the massive mill-like
                    structure of the grinding teeth, so unlike that of all the kuown purely

                    which circumstance has rendered the Skunks, as they are commonly called,
                    proverbial. They are strictly nocturnal animals, terrestrial and burrowing,

                    sectorial wants the inner tubercle. External characters generally similar to
                    those of the Martens, but the body is longer and more slender, and the limbs
                    even shorter. They are all small animals, of very active, bloodthirsty and
                    courageous disposition, living chiefly on birds and small mammals, and are
                    rather terrestrial than arboreal, dwelling among rocks, stones, and
                    outbuildings. Some of the species, as the Stoat or Ermine <hi rend="italic">(P.

                    adult state. The fourth (upper sectorial) differs essentially from the
                    corresponding tooth of other Carnivores in wanting the inner lobe supported by a
                    distinct root. Its sectorial characters are very slightly marked. The crowns of
                    both the true molars are longer than broad, with flattened, tuberculated,
                    grinding surfaces. The second has a large backward prolongation or heel. The
                    lower sectorial has a small and indistinct blade and greatly developed
                    tubercular heel. The second molar is of about the same length, but with a
                    broader and more flattened tubercular crown. The third is smaller. The milk
                    teeth are comparatively small, and shed at an early age. Skull more or less
                    elongated. Orbits small and incomplete behind. Palate prolonged considerably
                    behind the last molar tooth. Vertebrae: C 7, D 14, I. 6, S 5, C 8-10. Body
                    heavy. Feet broad, completely plantigrade. The five toes on each foot all
                    well-developed, and armed with long compressed and moderately curved,
                    non-retractile claws. Palms and soles naked. Tail very short. Ears moderate,
                    erect, rounded, hairy. Fur generally long, soft, and shaggy.</p>
                <p>The Bears are all animals of considerable bulk, and include among them the
                    largest members of the order. Though the species are not numerous, they are
                    widely spread over the earth’s surface (but absent from the Ethiopian and
                    Australian regions, and only represented by one species in the Neotropical
                    region), and differ much among themselves in their food and manner of life. They
                    are mostly omnivorous or vegetable feeders, and even the Polar Bear, usually
                    purely carnivorous or piscivorous, devours grass with avidity in summer. The
                    various species may be grouped in the following sections. (1) <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The great Cave Bear, the remains of which are found, so abundantly in caves of

                    rend="italic">arvernensis</hi> and older species from the Pliocene they were all
                    retained. Still more generalized forms of Bears, presenting various degrees of
                    transition towards a common Carnivorous type, are represented by the genera <hi

                    >Hyaenarctos</hi> of Miocene strata of Europe and Asia, and others which are not
                    far removed (at least in dental characters) from such primitive Dog-like types
                    as <hi rend="italic">Amphicyon.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Extinct Carnivora of
                    Doubtful Position.</hi></p>
                <p>The discovery of fossil remains in Eocene and early Miocene formations both in
                    Europe and North America, shows that numerous species of terrestrial carnivorous
                    animals existed upon the earth during those periods, which cannot be referred to
                    either of the sections into which the order has now become broken up. By some
                    zoologists these have been supposed to be Marsupials, or at least to show
                    transitional characters between the Didelphous and Monodelphous subclasses. By
                    others they are looked upon as belonging altogether to the latter group, and as
                    the common ancestors of existing Carnivores and Insectivores, or perhaps rather
                    as descendants or relatives of such common ancestors, retaining more of the
                    generalized characters than any of the existing species. They shade off almost
                    insensibly into numerous other forms less distinctly carnivorous, to the whole
                    of which, including the modern <hi rend="italic">Insectivora,</hi> Cope (to whom
                    we are indebted for our principal knowledge of the American extinct species)
                    gives the name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Bunotheria,</hi> those more specially
                    related to the existing <hi rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> forming the suborder
                    <hi rend="italic">Creodonta,</hi> which is divided into the five families, <hi
                    rend="italic">Arctocyonidae, Miacidae, Oxyaenidae, Amblyctonidae,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Meronychidae.</hi> These are cases, however, in which the
                    application of the principles of classification adopted in the case of existing
                    species, of which the entire structure is known, and which have become divided
                    into isolated groups by the extinction of intermediate forms, is really
                    impossible. If the generally accepted view of evolution is true, and the extreme
                    modifications pass insensibly into each other by minute gradations (a view the
                    palaeontological proof of which becomes strengthened by every fresh discovery),
                    there must be many of these extinct forms which cannot be assigned to definitely
                    characterized groups. There are, however, some which stand out prominently from
                    the others as formed on distinct types, having no exact representatives at
                    present living on the earth. Of these the best-known is that named <hi
                    rend="italic">Hyaenodon,</hi> of which, with the nearly allied <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pterodon,</hi> many species have been found both in Europe and America. They
                    had the full number of forty-four teeth, grouped in the usual manner, and the
                    incisors, canines, and premolars were formed upon the ordinary Carnivorous type
                    as now seen in the <hi rend="italic">Canidεe,</hi> the fourth premolar above and
                    the first true molar below being formed upon the “sectorial” plan, but the teeth
                    behind these, instead of being tuberculated as in all existing <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carnivora,</hi> repeated the characters of the sectorial, and also increased in
                    size, especially in the lower jaw, from before backwards. They thus present some
                    resemblance to the teeth of such carnivorous Marsupials as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dasyuridae</hi>; but, as the researches of Filhol have demonstrated, their milk
                    dentition follows precisely the rule of existing placental heterodont mammals,
                    and not that characteristic of the Marsupials. They show, moreover, none of the
                    essential cranial modifications which distinguish true Marsupials. The curious
                    American genus <hi rend="italic">Oxana</hi> seems to have been a specialized
                    form of this type, and the European <hi rend="italic">Proviverra</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Cynohyaenodon</hi> of Filhol) forms a complete transition between
                    it and the <hi rend="italic">Viverridae.</hi> In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arctocyon</hi><hi rend="italic">primaevus,</hi> the oldest known Tertiary
                    mammal, from the lowest Eocene beds of La Fère, department of Aisne, France, on
                    the other hand, all the molars were tuberculated, and have been compared with
                    those of the <hi rend="italic">Procyonida</hi> and also <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gymnura,</hi> among the <hi rend="italic">Insectivora.</hi> The small size of
                    the brain of these early forms is not, as has been supposed, a special Marsupial
                    character, but is common to the primitive forms of all groups of vertebrates.
                    <hi rend="italic">Mesonyx,</hi> from the Eocene of North America, seems to have
                    been a very generalized form, with flat blunt claws, and long and slender tail.
                    Cope makes the interesting suggestion that this may have been in the ancestral
                    line of the Pinnipeds, but his statement that the scaphoid and lunar bones of
                    the carpus were distinct offers a decided difficulty to the acceptance of this
                    view.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Suborder</hi><hi rend="italic">PINNIPEDIA.</hi></p>
                <p>These differ from the' rest of the <hi rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> mainly in the
                    structure of their limbs, which are modified for aquatic progression,—the two
                    proximal segments being very short and partially enveloped in the general
                    integument of the body, while the third segment, especially in the hinder
                    extremities, is elongated, expanded, and webbed. There are always five
                    well-developed digits on each limb. In the hind limb the two marginal digits
                    (first and fifth) are stouter and generally larger than the others. The teeth
                    also differ from those of the more typical <hi rend="italic">Carnivora.</hi> The
                    incisors are always fewer than ⅜. The molar series consists generally of four
                    premolars and one molar of very uniform characters, with never more than two
                    roots, and with conical, more or less compressed, pointed crowns, which may have
                    accessory cusps, placed before or behind the principal one, but are never broad
                    and tuberculated. The milk teeth are very small and simple, and are shed or
                    absorbed at a very early age, usually either before or within a few days after
                    birth. The brain is relatively large, the cerebral hemispheres broad in
                    proportion to their length, and with numerous and complex convolutions. There is
                    a very short caecum. The kidneys are divided into numerous distinct lobules.
                    There are no Cowper’s glands. Mammae two or four, abdominal. No clavicles. Tail
                    always very short. Eyes very large and exposed, with flat cornea. The nostrils
                    close by the elasticity of their walls, and are opened at will by muscular
                    action.</p>
                <p>The animals of this group are all aquatic in their mode of life, spending the
                    greater part of their time in the water, swimming and diving with great
                    facility, feeding mainly on fish, crustaceans, and other marine animals, and
                    progressing on land with difficulty. They always come on shore, however, for the
                    purpose of bringing forth their young. They are generally marine, but they
                    occasionally ascend large rivers, and some inhabit inland seas and lakes, as the
                    Caspian and Baikal. Though not numerous in species, they are widely distributed
                    over the world, but occur most abundantly on the coasts of lands situated in
                    cold and temperate zones. The suborder is divisible into three well-marked
                    families :—the <hi rend="italic">Otariidae</hi> or Sea Bears, which form a
                    transition from the Fissiped <hi rend="italic">Carnivora</hi> to the Seals; the
                    <hi rend="italic">Trichechidae,</hi> containing the Walrus; and the <hi

                    one side and not the other); all with similar characters, generally
                    uniradicular; crown moderate, compressed, pointed, with a single principal cusp,
                    and sometimes a cingulum, and more or less developed anterior and posterior
                    accessory cusps. Vertebrae: C 7, D 15, I. 5, S 4, C</p>
                <p>9-10. Head rounded. Eyes large. Pinna of ear small, narrow, and pointed. Neck
                    long. Skin of all the feet extended far beyond the nails and ends of the digits,
                    with a deeply-lobed margin. The nails small and often quite rudimentary,
                    especially those of the first and fifth toes of both feet; the best-developed
                    and most constant are the three middle claws of the hind foot, which are
                    elongated, compressed, and curved.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Otariae,</hi> or Eared Seals, commonly called Sea Bears or
                    Sea Lions, are widely distributed, especially in the temperate regions of both
                    hemispheres, though absent from the coasts of the North Atlantic. As might be
                    inferred from their power of walking on all fours, they spend more of their time
                    on shore, and range inland to greater distances, than the true Seals, especially
                    at the breeding time, though they are obliged always to return to the water to
                    seek their food. They are gregarious and polygamous, and the males are usually
                    much larger than the females, a circumstance which has given rise to some of the
                    confusion existing in the specific determination of the various members of the
                    genus. Some of the species possess, in addition to the stiff, close, hairy
                    covering common to all the group, an exceedingly fine, dense, woolly under fur.
                    The skins of these, when dressed and deprived of the longer harsh outer hairs,
                    constitute the ‘ ‘ sealskin” of commerce, so much valued for wearing apparel,
                    which is not the product of any of the true Seals. The best-known species are

                    been grouped by some zoologists into many genera, founded upon very trivial
                    modifications of teeth and skull.</p>

                <p>In many characters the single genus comprising this family is intermediate

                <p>The true Seals are the most completely adapted for aquatic life of all the
                    Pinnipeds. When on land the hind limbs are extended behind them and take no part
                    in progression, which is effected by a series of jumping movements produced by
                    the muscles of the trunk, in some species aided by the fore limbs only. The
                    palms and soles of the feet are hairy. There is no pinna to the ear, and no
                    scrotum, the testes being abdominal. The upper incisors have simple, pointed
                    crowns, and vary in number in the different groups. All have well developed
                    canines and ⅞ teeth of the molar series. In those species of which the milk
                    dentition is known, there are three milk molars, which precede the second,

                <p>Remains of animals of this group have been found in late Miocene and Pliocene
                    strata in Europe and America, the most abundant and best preserved being those
                    of the Antwerp Crags, the subject of a recent illustrated monograph by Van
                    Beneden. Nothing has, however, yet been discovered which throws any light upon
                    the origin of the group, as all the extinct forms at present known come within
                    the definition of the existing families; and, though annectant forms between
                    these occur, there are as yet no transitions to a more generalized type of
                    mammal. Indeed, all those of which the characters are best known belong to the
                    completely developed Phocine or Trichechine, not to the Otarine, type. The
                    structure of the Pinnipeds is so clearly a modification of that of the
                    terrestrial Carnivores, especially of the Arctoid type, that it is difficult to
                    imagine that they can have had any other origin but one in common with that
                    group; but the separation must have taken place early in the Tertiary epoch, if

                <p>This order in the system of Linnaeus includes Man, all the Monkeys, the Lemurs,
                    and the Bats. By common consent of all zoologists the last-named animals have
                    been removed into a distinct order. With regard to the association of the
                    others, there has been, and still is, much difference of opinion.</p>
                <p>That all the Monkeys, from the highest Anthropoid Apes to the lowest Marmosets,
                    form a natural and tolerably homogeneous group seems never to have been
                    questioned; but whether the Lemurs on the one hand and Man on the other should
                    be united with them in the same order are points of controversy. With regard to
                    the first, the question has already been referred to in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Lemur,</hi> in which an account has been given of the
                    characters and the principal modifications of the type. If, in accordance with
                    the traditional views of zoologists, they are still considered to be members of
                    the order <hi rend="italic">Primates,</hi> they, must form a suborder apart from
                    all the others, with which they have really very little in common except the
                    opposable hallux of the hind foot, a character also met with in the Opossums,
                    and which is therefore of very secondary importance.</p>
                <p>The history of all the various forms of true Monkeys is very fully given in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Ape.</hi> The position of Man alone remains to be

                    rend="italic">Animal</hi> of Cuvier, he forms a distinct order under the name of

                    in the zoological systems of the present century, though in the classification
                    of Owen his position is still farther removed from that of the Monkeys, as in it
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi> forms one of the four primary divisions or
                    subclasses of the <hi rend="italic">Mammalia,</hi> called <hi rend="italic"

                    >Anthropologie.</hi></p></note> is to revert towards the Linnaean position.
                    Considering solely the facts of Man’s bodily structure, it can be clearly
                    demonstrated that the points in which he differs from the most nearly resembling
                    Ape are not of greater importance than those by which that Ape differs from
                    other universally acknowledged members of the group; and therefore, in any
                    natural system, if Man is to be made a subject of zoological classification upon
                    the same principles as those applied elsewhere, he must be included in the order
                    which comprises the Monkeys. We say upon the same principles as are applied
                    elsewhere, as zoological classification has never taken into consideration the
                    psychological characteristics which distinguish the subjects of its
                    investigations, but only their tangible and physical structure, otherwise
                    endless confusion would result, at all events with our very imperfect knowledge
                    of animal psychology. The essential attributes which distinguish Man, and give
                    him a perfectly isolated position among living creatures, are not to be found in
                    his bodily structure, and therefore should either be left entirely out of
                    consideration or have such weight given to them as would remove him completely
                    out of the region of zoological classification. To profess to classify Man as if
                    he were one of the animals, as in all points of the structure and functions of
                    his organs he undoubtedly is, to place him in the class <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mammalia,</hi> and then to allow other considerations to influence the judgment
                    as to the particular position he should occupy in the class, is most
                    illogical.</p>
                <p>Man, therefore, considered from a zoological point of view, must be included in
                    the order <hi rend="italic">Primates,</hi> even if the Lemurs are removed from
                    it, as his structural affinities with the Monkeys are far closer than are those
                    of the so-called “Half-Apes.” We may, without treading upon debateable ground,
                    go farther, and say that the differences between Man and the Anthropoid Apes are
                    really not so marked as those which separate the latter from the American
                    Monkeys. Perhaps the best exposition of the facts relating to the present
                    condition of the order will be a division into five sections, which may be
                    considered as families, of course without intending to imply that they are
                    exactly equivalent, or that the intervals which separate them are of precisely
                    the same importance, but that they are five distinct groups, all branches from a
                    common stem, and unconnected in the present condition of nature by any
                    intermediate forms. These are—(1) <hi rend="italic">Hominidae,</hi> containing
                    Man alone; (2) <hi rend="italic">Simiidae,</hi> containing the four genera of
                    Man-like Apes: <hi rend="italic">Troglodytes, Gorilla,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Simia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hylobates;</hi> (3) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cercopithecidae,</hi> containing all the remaining Old-World Monkeys; (4) <hi
                    rend="italic">Cebidae,</hi> containing the American Monkeys having three true
                    molar teeth on each side of each jaw; and (5) <hi rend="italic">Hapalidεe,,</hi>
                    the American Monkeys with two molar teeth, or Marmosets.</p>
                <p>The distinctions between <hi rend="italic">Hominidae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simiidae,</hi> of which alone we have to treat at present, as the characters of
                    the other families are given in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Ape,</hi> are
                    chiefly relative, being greater size of brain and of brain case as compared with
                    the facial portion of the skull, smaller development of the canine teeth of the
                    males, more complete adaptation of the structure of the vertebral column to the
                    vertical position, greater length of the lower as compared with the upper
                    extremities, and greater length of hallux or great toe, with almost complete
                    absence of the power of bringing it in opposition to the other four toes. The
                    last <pb facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n468/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0468-0445"/> and the small size of the canine teeth are
                    perhaps the most marked and easily defined distinctions that can be drawn
                    between the two groups.</p>
                <p>Man is universally admitted to form a single genus, <hi rend="italic">Homo</hi>
                    of Linnaeus, but a question of considerable importance in treating of him from a
                    zoological point of view, and one which has been a subject of much controversy,
                    is whether all men should be considered as belonging to one or to several
                    species. This question is perhaps of less importance now than formerly, when
                    those who maintained a plurality of species associated with the hypothesis
                    plurality of origin. One of the strongest arguments against the view that the
                    various races of Man represent more than one species is that none of those who
                    have maintained it have been able to agree as to how many distinct specific
                    modifications can be defined, almost -every number from three to twenty or more
                    having been advocated by different authors. If the distinguishing characters of
                    the so-called species had been so marked, there could not be such a remarkable
                    diversity of opinion upon them. Again, the two facts—(1) that, however different
                    the extremes of any two races may be in appearance (and it must be admitted
                    that, as advocated by many polygenists, the differences are greater than many
                    which are considered specific among other animals), every intermediate gradation
                    can be found through which the one passes into the other, and (2) that all races
                    are fertile <hi rend="italic">inter se—</hi> are quite conclusive in favour of
                    considering Man as representing a single species in the ordinary sense in which
                    the word is now used, and of treating of all his various modifications as
                    varieties or races.</p>
                <p>The great problem at the root of all zoology, the discovery of a natural
                    classification which shall be an expression of our knowledge of the real
                    relationship or consanguinity of different forms, is also applicable to the
                    study of the races of Man. When we can satisfactorily prove that any two of the
                    known groups of mankind are descended from the same common stock, a point is
                    gained. The more such points we have acquired the more nearly shall we be able
                    to picture to ourselves, not only the present, but the past distribution of the
                    races of Man upon the earth, and the mode and order in which they have been
                    derived from one another. But the difficulties in the way of applying zoological
                    principles to the classification of Man are vastly greater than in the case of
                    most animals. When groups of animals become so far differentiated from each
                    other as to represent separate species, they remain isolated; they may break up
                    into further subdivisions—in fact, it is only by further subdivision that new
                    species can be formed; but it is of the very essence of species, as now
                    universally understood by naturalists, that they cannot recombine, and so give
                    rise to new forms. With the varieties of Man it is otherwise. They have never so
                    far separated as to answer to the physiological definition of species. All
                    races, as said above, are fertile with one another, though perhaps in different
                    degrees. Hence new varieties have constantly been formed, not only by the
                    segmentation of portions of one of the old stocks, but also by various
                    combinations of those already established.</p>
                <p>Without entering into the difficult question of the method of Man’s first
                    appearance upon the world, we must assume for it vast antiquity,—at all events
                    as measured by any historical standard. Of this there is now ample proof. During
                    the long time he existed in a savage state—a time compared to which the dawn of
                    our historical period is as yesterday—he was influenced by the operation of
                    those natural laws which have produced the variations seen in other regions of
                    organic nature. The first Men may very probably have been all alike; but, when
                    spread over the face of the earth, and become subject to all kinds of diverse
                    external conditions,—climate, food, competition with members of his own species
                    or with wild animals,—racial differences began slowly to be developed through
                    the potency of various kinds of selection acting upon the slight variations
                    which appeared in individuals in obedience to the tendency planted in all living
                    things. These differences manifested themselves externally in the colour of the
                    skin, the colour, quality, and distribution of the hair, the form of the head
                    and features, and the proportions of the limbs, as well as in the general
                    stature.</p>
                <p>Geographical position must have been one of the main elements in determining the
                    formation and permanence of races. Groups of Men isolated from their fellows for
                    long periods, such as those living on small islands, to which their ancestors
                    may have been accidentally drifted, would naturally, in course of time, develop
                    a new type of features, of skull, of complexion, or hair. A slight set in one
                    direction, in any of these characters, would constantly tend to intensify
                    itself, and so new races would be formed. In the same way, different
                    intellectual or moral qualities would be gradually developed or transmitted in
                    different groups of Men. The longer a race thus formed remained isolated, the
                    more strongly impressed and the more permanent would its characteristics become,
                    and less liable to be changed or lost* when the surrounding circumstances were
                    altered, or under a moderate amount of intermixture from other races—the more
                    “true” in fact, would it be. On the other hand, on large continental tracts,
                    where no mountain ranges or other natural barriers form obstacles to free
                    intercourse between tribe and tribe, there would always be a tendency towards
                    uniformity, from the amalgamation of races brought into close relation by war or
                    by commerce. Smaller or feebler races would be destroyed or absorbed by others
                    impelled by superabundant population or other causes to spread beyond their
                    original limits; or sometimes the conquering race would itself disappear by
                    absorption into the conquered.</p>
                <p>Thus, for untold ages, the history of Man has presented a shifting, kaleidoscopic
                    scene: new races gradually becoming differentiated out of the old elements, and,
                    after dwelling a while upon the earth, either becoming suddenly annihilated or
                    gradually merged into new combinations; a constant destruction and
                    reconstruction; a constant tendency to separation and differentiation, and a
                    tendency to combine again into a common uniformity—the two tendencies acting
                    against and modifying each other. The history of these processes in former
                    times, except in so far as they may be inferred from the present state of
                    things, is a difficult study, owing to the scarcity of evidence. If we had any
                    approach to a complete palaeontological record, the history of Man could be
                    reconstructed; but nothing of the kind is forthcoming. Evidence of the
                    anatomical characters of Man, as he lived on the earth during the time when the
                    most striking racial characteristics were being developed, during the long
                    ante-historic period in which the Negro, the Mongolian, and the Caucasian were
                    being gradually fashioned into their respective types, is entirely wanting, or
                    if any exists it is at present safely buried in the earth, perhaps to be
                    revealed at some unexpected time and in some unforeseen manner. Even the
                    materials from which a history of the modifications of the human species as
                    known to our generation must be constructed are rapidly passing away, as the age
                    in which we live is an age in which, in a far greater degree than any previous
                    one, the destruction of races, both by annihilation and absorption, is going on.
                    Owing to the rapid extension of maritime discovery and commerce, changes such as
                    have never been witnessed before are now taking place in the ethnology of the
                    world, changes especially affecting the island populations among which, more
                    than elsewhere, the solution of <pb
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n469/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0469-0446"/> many of these problems may be looked for. The
                    subject is, however, attracting the attention of observers of all countries to a
                    greater degree than it ever has before, with the usual result of bringing
                    distrust upon, and dissatisfaction with, the old systems, without as yet
                    establishing anything in their place which meets with universal acceptance. The
                    difficulty of finding distinctive characters capable of strict definition by
                    which races or groups may be differentiated may be inferred from what has been
                    said above. It is rather by the preponderance of certain characters in a large
                    number of members of a group than by the exclusive or even constant possession
                    of these characters in each of its members that the group must be distinguished.
                    Hence, in all cases in which the characters can be expressed by the numerical
                    method, as in the dimensions and proportions of different parts of the body,
                    averages are now largely used by anthropologists. Provided the data upon which
                    these averages are based have been obtained from a sufficient number of
                    individuals, they can be absolutely relied upon to express the prevailing or
                    most characteristic development of each particular feature in any group, and
                    permit satisfactory comparisons between the conditions of that feature in
                    different groups. Great progress is now being made in perfecting the methods of
                    investigation of racial characteristics, and as we are beginning to learn what
                    lines of research are profitable and what are barren, we may hope that the time
                    is not far distant when we may get some clear insight into the knowledge of the
                    natural classification and relationships of the races of Man. fw. <hi
