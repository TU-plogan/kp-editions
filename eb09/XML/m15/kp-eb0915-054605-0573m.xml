                <p><label type="entry">MARIONETTES</label> (probably from <hi rend="italic"
                    >morio,</hi> a fool or buffoon), <hi rend="smallcaps">Fantoccini</hi> (from <hi
                    rend="italic">fantino,</hi> a child), or <hi rend="smallcaps">Puppets</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">{poupée,</hi> a baby or doll), are figures, generally below
                    lifesize, suspended by threads or wires and imitating with their limbs and heads
                    the movements of living persons.</p>
                <p>The high antiquity of puppets appears from the fact that figures with movable
                    limbs have been discovered in the tombs of Egypt and among the remains of
                    Etruria; they were also common among the Greeks, from whom they were imported to
                    Rome. Plays in which the characters are represented by puppets or by the shadows
                    of moving figures, worked by concealed performers who deliver the dialogue, are
                    not only popular in India and China at the present day, but during several
                    centuries past maintained an important position among the amusements of the
                    people in most European countries. Goethe and Lessing deemed them worthy of
                    attention; and as late as 1721 Le Sage wrote plays for puppets to perform. Every
                    one remembers in Don Quixote “the curious puppet show, which represents the play
                    of Melisandra and Don Gayferos, one of the best shows that has been acted time
                    out of mind in this kingdom.” Reference to puppet shows is frequent in English
                    literature from Chaucer onward. Thus Davenant says :—</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ And man in chimney hid to dress Puppet that acts our old Queen Bess, And man
                    that, while the puppets play, Through nose expoundeth what they say.”</p>
                <p>The earliest performances in English were drawn or founded upon Bible narratives
                    and the lives of the saints, in the same vein as the “morality” plays which they
                    succeeded. Popular subjects in the 16th century were <hi rend="italic">The
                    Prodigal Son</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Nineveh, with Jonah and the Whale.</hi>
                    And in a pamphlet of 1641, describing Bartholomew Fair, we read, “Here a knave
                    in a fool’s coat, with a trumpet sounding or a drum beating, invites you to see
                    his puppets. Here a rogue like a wild woodman, or in an antic shape like an
                    incubus, desires your company to view his motion.” In 1667 Pepys recorded how,
                    at Bartholomew Fair, he found <hi rend="italic">“my</hi> Lady Castlemaine at a
                    puppet play, Patient Grizill.” Besides <hi rend="italic">The Sorrows of
                    Griselda,</hi> other puppet plays of the period were <hi rend="italic">Pick
                    Whittington, The Vagaries of Merry</hi><hi rend="italic">Andrere,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Humours of Bartholomew Fair.</hi> Powell’s noted marionette
                    show was the subject of an article in <hi rend="italic">The Tatler,</hi> 1709,
                    and again in <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic">Spectator,</hi> 1711.
                    The latter refers also to Pinkethman, a “motionmaker,” in whose scenes the
                    divinities of Olympus ascended and descended to the strains of music. An idea of
                    the class of representation may be gathered from an advertisement of Crawley, a
                    rival of Pinkethman, which sets forth—“The Old Creation of the World, with the
                    addition of Noah’s Flood,” also several fountains playing water during the time
                    of the play. The best scene represented “Noah and his family coming out of the
                    ark, with all the animals two by two, and all the fowls of the air seen in a
                    prospect sitting upon trees; likewise over the ark is the sun rising in a
                    gorgeous manner; moreover a multitude of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n574/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0574-0547"/> angels in a double rank,” the angels ringing
                    bells. “Likewise machines descending from above, double, with Dives rising out
                    of hell and Lazarus seen in Abraham’s bosom; besides several figures dancing
                    jiggs, sarabands, and country dances, with the merry conceits of Squire Punch
                    and Sir John Spendall.” Yates showed a moving picture of a city, with an
                    artificial cascade, and a temple,—with mechanical birds in which attention was
                    called to the exact imitation of living birds, the quick motion of the bills,
                    just swelling of the throat, and fluttering of the wings. The puppets were wax
                    figures 5 feet in stature. Toward the end of the 18th century, Flockton’s show
                    presented five hundred figures at work at various trades. Brown’s Theatre of
                    Arts showed at country fairs, from 1830 to 1840, the battle of Trafalgar,
                    Napoleon’s army crossing the Alps, and the marble palace of St Petersburg; and
                    at a still later date Clapton’s similar exhibition presented Grace Darling
                    rescuing the crew of the “Forfarshire” steamer wrecked on the Fern Islands, with
                    many ingenious moving figures of quadrupeds, and, in particular, a swan which
                    dipped its head into imitation water, opened its wings, and with flexible neck
                    preened and trimmed its plumage. In these mechanical scenes the figures, painted
                    upon a flat surface and cut out, commonly of pasteboard, are slid along grooves
                    arranged transversely in front of the set scenery, the actions of legs and arms
                    being worked by wires from the hands of persons below the stage, though
                    sometimes use is made of clockwork.</p>
                <p>Marionettes proper, and the dolls exhibited in puppet shows (not including Punch
                    and his companion actors), are constructed of wood or of pasteboard, with faces
                    of composition, sometimes of wax; and each figure is suspended by a number of
                    threads to a short bar of wood which is commonly held in one hand of the hidden
                    performer while the finger of his other hand poses the figure or gives action to
                    it by means of the threads. In the mode of constructing the joints, and the
                    greater elaboration with which the several parts of the limbs are supported and
                    moved, and especially in the fine degrees of movement given to the heads,
                    marionettes have been so improved as to present very exact imitations of the
                    gestures of actors and actresses, and the postures and evolutions of acrobats;
                    and, in addition, ingenious exhibitors such as Theodon, who introduced many
                    novelties from twenty to thirty years ago, have employed mechanical arrangements
                    for accomplishing the tricks of pantomime harlequinade. Among the puppet
                    personages presented in the small street shows are generally included a sailor
                    who dances a hornpipe, a hoop-dancer, a dancer of the Highland fling, a
                    wooden-legged pensioner, a vaulter on a pole also balancing two chairs, a clown
                    playing with a butterfly, a dancing figure without head until the head rises out
                    of the body, gradually displaying an enormously long neck, a juggler tossing
                    gilt balls which, sliding up and down upon tight invisible threads, fall into
                    his hands again, a milk-woman carrying buckets out of which fly white dolls, and
                    a skeleton, seen at first in scattered parts lying about the stage, but piece
                    successively flying to piece, the body first sitting up, then standing, and
                    finally capped by the skull, when the completed figure begins to dance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ombres Chinois</hi> are the shadows of figures projected upon a
                    stretched sheet of thin calico or a gauze scene painted as a transparency. The
                    cardboard flat figures are held behind this screen, illuminated from behind,—the
                    performer’ supporting each figure by a long wire held in one hand while wires
                    from all the movable parts terminate in rings in which are inserted the fingers
                    of his other hand.</p>
