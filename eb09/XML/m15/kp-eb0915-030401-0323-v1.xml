                            de</hi></label> (1635-1719), the second wife of Louis XIV., and
                    unacknowledged queen of France for the last thirty years of his reign, was born
                    in a prison at Niort on November 27, 1635. Her father Constant d’Aubigné, was
                    the son of Agrippa d’Aubigné, the famous friend and general of Henry IV., and
                    had been imprisoned as a Huguenot malcontent, but her mother, a fervent
                    Catholic, had the child baptized in her religion, her sponsors being the Due de
                    la Rochefoucauld, father of the author of the <hi rend="italic">Maxims,</hi> and
                    the Comtesse de Neuillant. In 1639 Constant d’Aubigné was released from prison
                    and took all his family with him to Martinique, where he died in 1645, after
                    having lost what fortune remained to him at cards. Madame d’Aubigné returned to
                    France, and from sheer poverty unwillingly yielded her daughter to her
                    sister-in-law, Madame de Villette, who made the child very happy, but,
                    unfortunately for her, converted or pretended to convert her to Protestantism.
                    When this was known, an order of state was issued that she should be entrusted
                    to Madame de Neuillant, her godmother. Every means, every indignity even, was
                    now used to convert her back to Catholicism, but at the last she only yielded on
                    the condition that she need not believe that the soul of Madame de Villette was
                    lost. Once reconverted, she was neglected, and sent home to live with her
                    mother, who had only a small pension of 200 livres a year, which ceased on her
                    death in 1650. The Chevalier de Meré, a man of some literary distinction, who
                    had made her acquaintance at Madame de Neuillant’s, discovered her penniless
                    condition, and introduced his “young Indian,” as he called her, to Scarron, the
                    famous wit and comic writer, at whose house all the literary society of the day
                    assembled. The wit, who was of good legal family, and had a kind heart, took a
                    fancy to the friendless girl, and offered either to pay for her admission to a
                    convent, or, though he was deformed and an invalid, to marry her himself. She
                    accepted his offer of marriage, and became Madame Scarron in 1651. For nine
                    years she was not only his most faithful nurse, but an attraction to his house,
                    where she tried to bridle the licence of the conversation of the time. On the
                    death of Scarron in 1660, Anne of Austria continued his pension to his widow,
                    and even increased it to 2000 livres a year, which enabled her to entertain and
                    frequent the literary society her husband had made her acquainted with; but on
                    the queen-mother’s death in 1666 the king, in spite of all the efforts of her
                    friends, refused to continue her pension, and she prepared to leave Paris for
                    Lisi on as lady attendant to the queen of Portugal But before she started, she
                    met Madame de Montespan, who was already, though not avowedly, the king’s
                    mistress, at the Hôtel d’Albret, and the lady in question took such a fancy to
                    her that she obtained the continuance of her pension, which put off for ever the
                    question of going to Portugal Madame de Montespan did yet more for her, for
                    when, in 1669, her first child by the king was born Madame Scarron was
                    established with a large income and a large staff of servants at Vaugirard to
                    bring up the king’s children in secrecy as they were born. In 1674 the king
                    determined to have his children at court, and their governess, who had now made
                    sufficient fortune to buy the estate of Maintenon, accompanied them. The king
                    had now many opportunities of seeing Madame Scarron, and, though at first he was
                    prejudiced against her, her even temper showed so advantageously against the
                    storms of passion and jealousy exhibited by Madame de Montespan that she grew
                    steadily in his favour, and had in 1678 the gratification of having her estate
                    at Maintenon raised to a marquisate, and herself entitled Madame de Maintenon by
                    the king himself. Such favours brought down the fury of Madame de Montespan’s
                    jealousy, and Madame de Maintenon’s position was almost unendurable, until, in
                    1680, the king severed their connexion by making the latter second lady in
                    waiting to the dauphiness, and soon after Madame de Montespan left the court.
                    The new “amie” used her influence on the side of decency, and the queen openly
                    declared she had never been so well treated as at this time, and eventually died
                    in Madame de Maintenon’s arms in 1683. The queen’s death opened the way to yet
                    greater advancement; in 1684 she was made first lady in waiting to the
                    dauphiness, and in the winter of 1685, or, Voltaire says, in January 1686, she
                    was privately married to the king by Harlay, archbishop of Paris, in the
                    presence, it is believed, of Père la Chaise, the king’s confessor, the Marquis
                    de Montchevreuil, the Chevalier de Forbin, and Bontemps. No written proof of the
                    marriage is extant, but that it took place is nevertheless certain. Her life
                    during the thirty years of her second married life must be studied from more
                    than one side, and can be so fully from her letters, which are masterpieces even
                    of an age <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n324/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0915-0324-0305"/> when Madame de Sevigné. wrote, and of which
                    many authentic examples are extant. As a wife she is wholly admirable; she had
                    to entertain a man who would not be amused, and had to submit to that terribly
                    strict court etiquette of absolute obedience to the king’s inclinations which
                    Saint-Simon so vividly describes, and yet be always cheerful, and never complain
                    of weariness or ill-health. Her political influence has probably been
                    overstated, but it was supreme in matters of detail. The ministers of the day
                    used to discuss and arrange all the business to be done with the king beforehand
                    with her, and it was all done in her cabinet and in her presence, but the king
                    in more important matters often chose not to consult her. Such mistakes as, for
                    instance, the replacing of Catinat by Villeroi may be attributed to her, but not
                    whole policies,—notably, according to Saint-Simon, not the policy with regard to
                    the Spanish succession. Even the revocation of the edict of Nantes and the
                    Dragonnades have been laid to her charge, but there can be no doubt that, in
                    spite of ardent Catholicism, she retained a liking for her father’s religion,
                    and opposed, if not very vigorously, the cruelties of the Dragonnades. She was
                    probably afraid to say much, or peril her great reputation for devotion, which
                    had in 1692 obtained for her from Innocent XII. the right of visitation over all
                    the convents in France. Where she deserves blame is in her use of her power for
                    personal patronage, as in compassing the promotions of Chamillart and Villeroi,
                    and the frequent assistance given to her brother Comte Charles d’Aubigné. Her
                    influence was on the whole a moderating and prudent force, and the king, when he
                    wanted her advice, used to say, “Qu’en pensez votre Solidité <hi rend="italic"
                        >1” or</hi> “Consultons la Raison.” Her social influence was not as great as
                    it might have been owing to her holding no recognized position at court, but it
                    was always exercised on the side of decency and morality, and it must not be
                    forgotten that from her former life she was intimate with the literary people of
                    the day, and never deserted her old friends. Side by side with this public life,
                    which wearied her with its shadowy power, occasionally crossed by a desire to be
                    recognized as queen, she passed a nobler and sweeter private existence as the
                    foundress of St Cyr. Madame de Maintenon was a born teacher; she had so won the
                    hearts of her first pupils that they preferred her to their own mother, and was
                    similarly successful later with the young and impetuous Duchesse de Bourgogne,
                    and she had always wished to establish a home for poor girls of good family
                    placed in such straits as she herself had experienced. As soon as her fortunes
                    began to mend she started a small home for poor girls at Ruel, which she
                    afterwards moved to Noisy, and which was the nucleus of the splendid institution
                    of St Cyr, which the king had endowed in 1686 at her request out of the funds of
                    the Abbey of St Denis. She was in her element there. She herself drew up the
                    rules of the institution; she examined every minute detail; she befriended her
                    pupils in every way; an‘d her heart often turned from the weariness of
                    Versailles or of Marly to her “little girls” at St Cyr. It was for the girls at
                    St Cyr that Racine wrote his <hi rend="italic">Esther</hi> and his <hi
                        rend="italic">Athalie,</hi> and it was because he managed the affairs of St
                    Cyr well that Chamillart became controller-general of the finances. The later
                    years of her power were marked by the promotion of her old pupils, the children
                    of the king and Madame de Montespan, to high dignity between the blood royal and
                    the peers of the realm, and it was doubtless under the influence of her dislike
                    for the Duc d’Orleans that the king drew up his will, leaving the personal care
                    of his successor to the Due de Maine, and hampering the Due d’Orleans by a
                    council of regency. On or even before her husband’s death she retired to St Cyr,
                    and had the chagrin of seeing all her plans for the advancement of the Due de
                    Maine overthrown by means of the parlement of Paris. However, the regent Orleans
                    in no way molested her, but on the contrary visited her at St Cyr, and continued
                    her pension of 48,000 livres. She spent her last years at St Cyr in perfect
                    seclusion, but an object of great interest to all visitors to France, who,
                    however, with the exception of Peter the Great, found it impossible to get an
                    audience with her. On April 15, 1719, she died, and was buried in the choir at
                    St Cyr, bequeathing her estate at Maintenon to her niece, the only daughter of
                    her brother Charles, and wife of the Maréchal de Noailles, to whose family it
                    still belongs. Such was the life of the extraordinary woman who kept till the
                    last the heart of Louis XIV., marked by a virtue almost amounting to prudery, in
                    strong contrast to the generations which preceded and followed her, by a love of
                    power, and a use of it which can indeed be excused by her early life, but which
                    was not exercised for the good of France, and by a religious devotion which was
                    narrow, if not violently fanatical, but sweetened throughout by her ardent love
                    for her “little girls,” whom she had saved from the difficulties of life, and
                    whom she loved with all a mother’s love.</p>
