                <p><label type="entry">MANICHAeISM</label>. At the close of the 3d century three
                    great religious systems stood opposed to one another in western Asia and the
                    south of Europe; these were NeoPlatonism, Catholicism, and Manichaeism. All
                    three may be described as the final results reached, after a history of more
                    than a thousand years, by the religious development of the civilized nations
                    stretching from Persia to Italy. Each had put off the national and particular
                    character of the ancient religions, and had become a world-religion, with
                    universalizing tendencies, and with demands which in their effect transformed
                    the whole of human life, both public and private. The place of national worship
                    was taken by a system which not only aimed at being a philosophy of God, the
                    world, and history, but at the same time embraced a definite code of ethics and
                    a religious ritual. In point of form, then, the three religions were like each
                    other, as they also were in this, that each had appropriated elements of older
                    and widely different religions. Their mutual resemblance becomes still further
                    apparent when we observe that in all three the ideas of revelation, redemption,
                    ascetic virtue, and immortality come into the foreground. NeoPlatonism, however,
                    was the spiritualized religion of nature, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n505/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0505-0482"/> Greek polytheism transfigured and developed into
                    Pantheism through Oriental influences and philosophical speculations;
                    Catholicism was the monotheistic universal religion, based upon the Old
                    Testament and the Gospel, but built up with the resources of Hellenic
                    speculation and ethics; Manichaeism was the dualistic and universal religion,
                    founded on Chaldaism, but charged with Christian, Parsic, and perhaps Buddhistic
                    ideas. In Manichaeism the Hellenic element was wanting, in Catholicism the
                    Chaldaeo-Persian. These three universal religions were developed in the course
                    of two centuries (c. 50-250 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> Catholicism being
                    the earliest and Manichaeism the latest creation. To both of these, however,
                    Neo-Platonism was from the outset inferior, because it did not possess a
                    founder, and consequently did not develop elemental force, but retained the
                    character of an artificial creation. Attempts were made to invent a founder for
                    it, but these, of course, entirely failed. Catholicism, again, appears as
                    superior to Manichaeism, even if we do not look at the contents of the two
                    religions, because it honoured its founder, not only as a bearer of revelation,
                    but as Redeemer in His own person, and as the Son of God. The struggle of
                    Catholicism with Neo-Platonism had been already decided by about the middle of
                    the 4th century, though the latter maintained itself in the Greek empire for
                    nearly two centuries longer. In its contest with Manichaeism, the Catholic
                    Church was from the outset certain of victory, being at the time the privileged
                    church of the empire. But this rival could not be annihilated; it maintained
                    itself both in the East and in the West, though in various forms and
                    modifications, until far on in the Middle Ages.</p>
                <p>Mani (Μάη;?, Manes, Mαvιχαιos, Manichaeus<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The name has not as yet been explained, nor is it even known
                    whether it be of Persian or Semitic origin.</p></note>) is said, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi rend="italic">Archelai,</hi> to have originally been
                    called “Cubricus” (according to Kessler, a corruption of “Shura-ik <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,,</hi>). Nothing reliable about his life was ever known in
                    the Graeco-Roman empire; for the account in the <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Archelai</hi> is quite incredible, and shaped by the objects of
                    its author. If criticism may succeed in showing the sources from which this
                    account has flowed, in ascertaining the tendencies which have been at work in
                    it, and thus in extracting some solid matter, it can only do so by starting from
                    the Oriental, the Mohammedan, tradition, which is comparatively worthy of
                    credence. It is therefore to the latter alone that we must apply for
                    information. According to it, Mani was a high-born Persian of Ecbatana. The year
                    of his birth is uncertain, but Kessler accepts as reliable the statement made by
                    Birunl, that Mani was born in the year 527 of the astronomers of Babylon
                    (215-216 A.D.). He received a careful education at Ctesiphon from his father
                    Fûtâk (∏ατεκιos). As the father connected himself at a later period with the
                    confession of the <hi rend="italic">Moghtasilah,</hi> or “Baptists,” in southern
                    Babylonia, the son also was brought up in the religious doctrines and exercises
                    of this sect. These Baptists (see the <hi rend="italic">Fihrisi)</hi> were
                    apparently connected with the Elkesaites and the Hemerobaptists, and certainly
                    with the Mandaeans. It is not improbable that this Babylonian sect had absorbed
                    Christian elements. Thus the boy early became acquainted with very different
                    forms of religion. If even a small part of the stories about his father is
                    founded on fact,—and there is no doubt that most of them are mere Manichaean
                    legends,—it was he who first introduced Mani to that medley of religions out of
                    which his system arose. Manichaean tradition relates that Mani received
                    revelations while yet a boy, and assumed a critical attitude towards the
                    religious instruction that was being imparted to him. This is the more
                    incredible since the same tradition informs us that the boy was as yet
                    prohibited from making public use of his new religious views. It was only when
                    Mani had reached the age of twenty-five or thirty years that he began to
                    proclaim his new religion. This he did at the court of the Persian king, Sapor
                    I., and according to the story, on the coronation-day of that monarch (241-42).
                    A Persian tradition says that he had previously been a Christian presbyter; but
                    this is certainly incorrect. Mani did not remain long in Persia, but undertook
                    long journeys for the purpose of spreading his religion, and also sent forth
                    disciples. According to the <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Archelai,</hi> his missionary activity extended westwards into the territory of
                    the Christian church; but from Oriental sources it is certain that Mani rather
                    went into Transoxania, western China, and southwards as far as India. His
                    labours there as well as in Persia were not without result. Like Mohammed after
                    him and the founder of the Elkesaites before him, he gave himself out for the
                    last and highest prophet, who was to surpass all previous divine revelation,
                    which only possessed a relative value, and to set up the perfect religion. In
                    the closing years of the reign of Sapor I. (e. 270) Mani returned to the Persian
                    capital, and gained adherents even at court. But the dominant priestly caste of
                    the Magians, on whose support the king was dependent, were naturally hostile to
                    him, and after some successes Mani was made a prisoner, and had then to flee.
                    The successor of Sapor, Hormuz (272-273), appears to have been favourably
                    disposed towards him, but Bahrâm I. abandoned him to the fanaticism of the
                    Magians, and caused him to be crucified in the capital in the year 276-7. The
                    corpse was flayed, and Mani’s adherents were cruelly persecuted by the king.</p>
                <p>Mani himself composed a large number of works and epistles, which were in great
                    part still known to the Mohammedan historians, but are now lost. The later heads
                    of the Manichaean churches also wrote religious treatises, so that the ancient
                    Manichaean literature must have been very extensive. According to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fihrist,</hi> Mani made use of the Persian and Syriac languages;
                    but, like the Oriental Marcionites before him, he invented an alphabet of his
                    own, which the <hi rend="italic">Fihrist</hi> has handed down to us. In this
                    alphabet the sacred books of the Manichaeans were written even at a later
                    period. The <hi rend="italic">Fihrist</hi> reckons seven principal works of
                    Mani, six being in the Syriac and one in the Persian language; regarding some of
                    these we also have information in Epiphanius, Augustine, Titus of Bostra, and
                    Photius, as well as in the formula of abjuration (Cotelerius, <hi rend="italic"
                    >PP. Apost. Opp.,</hi> i. 543) and in the <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi

                    bearing on the Christian sects spread throughout the East, especially the
                    Marcionites and Bardesanites, and dealing also with their conception of the Old

                    <hi rend="italic">The Book Shdhpurakdn</hi> (Flügel was unable to explain this
                    name; according to Kessler it signifies “epistle to King Sapor”; the treatise.

                    Photius, and Augustine, and if this be correct, it also must have been in use

                    “holy gospel” of the Manichaeans (mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Acta
                    Archel.</hi> and many other authorities). It was this work which the Manichaeans
                    set up in opposition to the Gospels. Besides these principal works, Mani also
                    wrote a large number of smaller treatises and epistles. The practice of writing
                    epistles was continued by his successors. These Manichaean dissertations also
                    became known in the Graeco-Roman empire, and existed in collections.<note

                    bishops acting in conjunction with the authorities. A Manichaean epistle,
                    addressed to one Marcellus, has, however, been preserved for us in the <hi

                    But as to this difference of opinion is at least allowable.</p></note></p>
                <p>Though the leading features of Manichaean doctrine can be exhibited clearly even
                    at the present day, and though it is undoubted that Mani himself drew up a
                    complete system, many details are nevertheless uncertain, since they are
                    differently described in different sources, and it often remains doubtful which
                    of the accounts that have been transmitted to us represents the original
                    teaching of the founder.</p>
                <p>The Manichaean system is one of consistent, uncompromising dualism, in the form
                    of a fantastic philosophy of nature. The physical and the ethical are not
                    distinguished, and in this respect the character of the system is thoroughly
                    materialistic; for when Mani coordinates good with light, and evil with
                    darkness, this is no mere figure of speech, but light is actually the only good,
                    and darkness the only evil. From this it follows that religious knowledge can be
                    nothing else than the knowledge of nature and her elements, and that redemption
                    can only consist in a physical process of freeing the element of light from the
                    darkness. Under such circumstances ethics becomes a doctrine of abstinence in
                    regard to all elements which have their source within the sphere of
                    darkness.</p>
                <p>The self-contradictory character of the present world forms the point of
                    departure for Mani’s speculations. This contradiction presents itself to his
                    mind primarily as elemental, and only in the second instance as ethical,
                    jnasmuch as he considers the sensual nature of man to be the outflow of the evil
                    elements in nature. From the contradictory character of the world he concludes
                    the existence of two beings, originally quite separate from each other—light and
                    darkness. Each is to be thought of according to the analogy of a kingdom. Light
                    presents itself to us as the good primal spirit (God, radiant with the ten
                    [twelve] virtues of love, faith, fidelity, high-mindedness, wisdom, meekness,
                    knowledge, understanding, mystery, and insight), and then further as the heavens
                    of light and the earth of light, with their guardians the glorious aeons.
                    Darkness is likewise a spiritual kingdom (more correctly, it also is conceived
                    of as a spiritual and feminine personification), but it has no “God” at its
                    head. It embraces an “earth of darkness.” As the earth of light has five tokens
                    (the mild zephyr, cooling wind, bright light, quickening fire, and clear water),
                    so has the earth of darkness also five (mist, heat, the sirocco, darkness, and
                    vapour). Satan with his demons was born from the kingdom of darkness. These two
                    kingdoms stood opposed to each other from all eternity, touching each other on
                    one side, but remaining unmingled. Then Satan began to rage, and made an
                    incursion into the kingdom of light, into the earth of light. The God of light,
                    with his syzygy, “the spirit of his right hand,” now begot the primal man, and
                    sent him, equipped with the five pure elements, to fight against Satan. But the
                    latter proved himself the stronger, and the primal man was for a moment
                    vanquished. And, although the God of light himself now took to the field, and
                    with the help of new aeons (the spirit of life, &lt;fcc.), inflicted total
                    defeat upon Satan, and set the primal man free, the latter had already been
                    robbed of part of his light by the darkness, and the five dark elements had
                    already mingled themselves with the generations of light. It only remained now
                    for the primal man to descend into the abyss, and prevent the further increase
                    of the generations of darkness by cutting off their roots; but he could not
                    immediately separate again the elements that had once mingled. These mixed
                    elements are the elements of the present visible world, which was formed from
                    them at the command of the God of light. The forming of the world is in itself
                    the beginning of the deliverance of the imprisoned elements of light. The world
                    is represented as an orderly structure of various heavens and various earths,
                    which is borne and supported by the aeons, the angels of light. It possesses in
                    the sun and moon, which are in their nature almost quite pure, large reservoirs,
                    in which the portions of light that have been rescued are stored up. In the sun
                    dwells the primal man himself, as well as the glorious spirits which carry on
                    the work of redemption; in the moon the mother of life is enthroned. The twelve
                    constellations of the zodiac form an ingenious machine, a great wheel with
                    buckets, which pour into the sun and moon, those shining ships that sail
                    continually through space, the portions of light set free from the world. Here
                    they are purified anew, and attain finally to the kingdom of pure light and to
                    God Himself. The later Western Manichaeans termed those portions of light which
                    are scattered throughout the world—in its elements and organisms—awaiting their
                    deliverance, the <hi rend="italic">Jesus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >patibilis.</hi></p>
                <p>It is a significant mark of the materialistic and inhuman character of the system
                    that, while the formation of the world is considered as a work of the good
                    spirits, the creation of man is referred to the princes of darkness. The first
                    man Adam was engendered by Satan in conjunction with “sin,” “cupidity,”
                    “desire.” But the spirit of darkness drove into him all the portions of light he
                    had stolen, in order to be able to dominate them the more securely. Hence Adam
                    is a discordant being, created in the image of Satan, but carrying within him
                    the stronger spark of light. Eve is given him by Satan as his companion. She is
                    seductive sensuousness, though also having in her a small spark of light. But if
                    the first human beings thus stood entirely under the dominion of the devil, the
                    glorious spirits took them under their care from the very outset, sending aeons
                    down to them (including Jesus), who instructed them regarding their nature, and
                    in particular warned Adam against sensuality. But this first man fell under the
                    temptation of sexual desire. Cain and Abel indeed are not sons of Adam, but of
                    Satan and Eve; Seth, however, who is full of light, is the offspring of Adam by
                    Eve. Thus did mankind come into existence, its various members possessing very
                    different shares of light, but the men having uniformly a larger measure of it
                    than the women. In the course of history the demons sought to bind men to
                    themselves by means of sensuality, error, and false religions (among which is to
                    be reckoned above all <pb break="no"

                    the spirits of light carried on their process of distillation with the view of
                    gaining the pure light which exists in the world. But these good spirits can
                    only save men by imparting to them the true <hi rend="italic">gnosis</hi>
                    concerning nature and her forces, and by calling them away from the service of
                    darkness and sensuality. To this end prophets, preachers of true knowledge, have
                    been sent into the world. Mani, following the example of the gnostic Jewish
                    Christians, appears to have held Adam, Noah, Abraham (perhaps Zoroaster and
                    Buddha) to be such prophets. Probably Jesus was also accounted a prophet who had
                    descended from the world of light,—not, however, the historical Jesus, the
                    devilish Messiah of the Jews, but a contemporaneous phantom Jesus, who neither
                    suffered nor died <hi rend="italic">{Jesus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >impatibilis).</hi> According to the teaching of some Manichaeans, it was the
                    primal man who disseminated the true gnosis in the character of Christ. But at
                    all events Mani himself, on his own claim, is to be reckoned the last and
                    greatest prophet, who took up the work of Jesus impatibilis and of Paul (for he
                    too finds recognition), and first brought full knowledge. He is the “leader,”
                    the “ambassador of the light,” the “Paraclete.” It is only through his agency
                    and that of his imitators “the elect,” that the separation of the light from the
                    darkness can be completed. The system contains very fantastic descriptions of
                    the processes by which the portions of light when once set free finally ascend
                    even to the God of light. He who during his lifetime did not become one of the
                    elect, who did not completely redeem himself, has to go through a severe process
                    of purification on the other side of the grave, till he too is gathered to the
                    blessedness of the light. It is erroneous, however, to ascribe, as has been
                    done, a doctrine of transmigration to the Manichaeans. Of course men’s bodies as
                    well as the souls of the unsaved, who according to the oldest conception have in
                    them no light whatever, fall under the sway of the powers of darkness. A later
                    view, adapted to the Christian one, represents the portions of light in the
                    unsaved as actually becoming lost. When the elements of light have at last been
                    completely, or as far as possible, delivered from the world, the end of all
                    things comes. All glorious spirits assemble, the God of light himself appears,
                    accompanied by the aeons and the perfected just ones. The angels supporting the
                    world withdraw themselves from their burden, and everything falls in ruins. A
                    tremendous conflagration consumes the world; the perfect separation of the two
                    powers takes place once more; high above is the kingdom of light, again brought
                    into a condition of completeness, and deep below is the (1 now powerless)
                    darkness.</p>
                <p>On the basis of such a cosmical philosophy, ethics can only have a dualistic
                    ascetic character. Manichaean ethics is not merely negative, however, since it
                    is necessary to cherish, strengthen, and purify the elements of light, as well
                    as free oneself from the elements of darkness. The aim is not self-destruction,
                    but self-preservation; and yet the ethics of Manichaeism appears in point of
                    fact as thoroughly ascetic. The Manichaean had above all to refrain from sensual
                    enjoyment, shutting himself up against it by three seals, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >signaculum</hi><hi rend="italic">oris,</hi><hi rend="italic">manus,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">sinus.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">signaculum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">oris</hi> forbids all eating of unclean food (which included all
                    bodies of animals, wine, &lt;fcc.,—vegetable diet being allowed because plants
                    contained more light, though the killing of plants, or even plucking their fruit
                    and breaking their twigs, was not permitted), as well as all impure speech. The
                    <hi rend="italic">signaculum manus</hi> prohibits all trafiic with things
                    generally, in so far as they carry in them elements of darkness. Finally by the
                    <hi rend="italic">signaculum</hi><hi rend="italic">sinus</hi> every
                    gratification of sexual desire, and hence also marriage, is forbidden. Besides
                    all this, life was further regulated by an exceedingly rigorous system of fasts.
                    Certain astronomical conjunctions determined the selection of the fast-days,
                    which in their total number amounted to nearly a quarter of the year. Sunday was
                    regularly solemnized as one, and the practice was also generally observed on
                    Monday. Hours of prayer were determined with equal exactness. The Manichaean had
                    to pray four times a day, each prayer being preceded by ablutions. The
                    worshipper turned towards the sun, or the moon, or the north, as the seat of
                    light; but it is erroneous to conclude from this, as has been done, that in
                    Manichaeism the sun and moon were themselves objects of worship. Forms of prayer
                    used by the Manichaeans have been preserved to us in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fihrist.</hi> The prayers are addressed to the God of light, to the whole
                    kingdom of light, to the glorious angels, and to Mani himself, who is
                    apostrophized in them as “the great tree, which is all salvation.” According to
                    Kessler, these prayers are closely related to the Mandaean and the ancient
                    Babylonian hymns. An asceticism so strict and painful as that demanded by
                    Manichaeism could only be practised by few; hence the religion must have
                    abandoned all attempts at an extensive propaganda, had it not conceded the
                    principle of a twofold morality. A distinction was made in the community between
                    the <hi rend="italic">Electi {Perfecti),</hi> the perfect Manichaeans, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Catechumeni</hi><hi rend="italic">{Auditores),</hi> the
                    secular Manichaeans. Only the former submitted themselves to all the demands
                    made by their religion; for the latter the stringency of the precepts was
                    relaxed. They had to avoid idolatry, sorcery, avarice, falsehood, fornication,
                    &amp;c.; above all, they were not allowed to kill any living being (the ten
                    commandments of Mani). They had also to free themselves as much as possible from
                    the world; but in truth they lived very much as their non-Manichaean
                    fellow-citizens. We have here essentially the same condition of things as in the
                    Catholic Church, where a twofold morality was also in force, that of the
                    religious orders and that of secular Christians,—only that the position of the
                    electi in Manichaeism was a more distinguished one than that of the monks in
                    Catholicism. For, after all, the Christian monks never quite forgot that
                    salvation is given by God through Christ, whereas the Manichaean electi were
                    actually themselves redeemers. Hence it was the duty of the auditores to pay the
                    greatest respect and most assiduous attention to the electi. These “perfect
                    ones,” wasting away under their asceticism, were objects of admiration, and of
                    the most elaborate solicitude.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Analogous to this is the veneration in which the Catholic
                    monks and the Neo-Platonic “philosophers” were held, but the prestige of the
                    Manichaean electi was greater than that of the monks and the
                    philosophers.</p></note> Food was presented to them in abundance, and by their
                    eating it the electi set free the portions of light from the vegetables. They
                    prayed for the auditores, they blessed them and interceded for them, thereby
                    shortening the process of purification the latter had to pass through after
                    death. It was only the electi, too, who possessed full knowledge of religious
                    truths, a point of distinction from Catholicism.</p>
                <p>The distinction between electi and auditores, however, does not exhaust the
                    conception of the Manichaean Church; on the contrary, the latter possessed a
                    hierarchy of three ranks, so that there were altogether five gradations in the
                    community. These were regarded as a copy of the ranks of the kingdom of light.
                    At the head stood the <hi rend="italic">teachers</hi> (“the sons of meekness,”
                    Mani himself and his successors); then follow the <hi rend="italic"

                    have been small. According to Augustine the teachers were twelve, and the
                    bishops seventy-two in number. One of the teachers appears to have occupied the
                    position of superior at the head of the whole Manichaean Church. At least
                    Augustine speaks of such a personage, and the <hi rend="italic">Fihrist</hi>
                    also has knowledge of a chief of all Manichaeans. The constitution, therefore,
                    had a monarchic head.</p>
                <p>The worship of the Manichaeans must have been very simple, and must have
                    essentially consisted of prayers, hymns, and ceremonies of adoration. This
                    simple service promoted the secret dissemination of their doctrines. The
                    Manichaeans too, at least in the West, appear to have adapted themselves to the
                    church’s system of festivals. The electi celebrated special feasts; but the
                    principal festival with all classes was the “Bema” <hi rend="italic">(βημa)</hi>
                    the feast of the “teacher’s chair,” held in commemoration of the death of Mani
                    in the month of March. The faithful prostrated themselves before an adorned but
                    empty chair, which was raised upon a podium of five steps. Long fasts
                    accompanied the feasts. The Christian and Mohammedan historians could learn
                    little of the Manichaean mysteries and “sacraments,” and hence the former
                    charged them with obscene rites and abominable usages. It may be held as
                    undoubted that the later Manichaeans celebrated mysteries analogous to Christian
                    baptism and the Lord’s Supper, which may have rested upon ancient consecration
                    rites and other ceremonies, instituted by Mani himself and having their origin
                    in nature worship.</p>
                <p>From the foregoing account it will be evident, as indeed from modern
                    investigation it is certain, that Manichaeism did not originate on Christian
                    ground. It would be more proper to speak of Mohammedanism than of Manichaeism as
                    a Christian sect; for Mohammed stands in a far closer relation to the Jewish and
                    Christian religions than did Mani. It is Kessler’s merit to have shown that the
                    ancient Babylonian religion, the original source of all the gnosis of western
                    Asia, was the basis of the Manichaean system. Hence the erroneousness of the
                    assumption, which formerly prevailed, that Manichaeism was a reform movement of
                    Parsism, a modification of Zoroastrianism under the influence of Christianity.
                    Manichaeism is a system which rather belongs to the Semitic group of religions.
                    It is the Semitic religion of nature, withdrawn from national limits, modified
                    by Christian and Persian elements, elevated into a gnosis, and transforming
                    human life by the influence of stringent regulations. But the recognition of
                    this fact only supplies us with a very general explanation of the origin of
                    Manichaeism. The question still remains, through what channels and to what
                    extent Mani adopted those Persian and Christian elements, and further, in what
                    form the ancient nature religion of Babylonia was utilized by him. As far as the
                    latter point is concerned it is known that, two centuries before Mani, the
                    Semitic nature-religions had already been taken up by various enthusiastic or
                    speculative spirits, who had given them philosophic depth and moulded than into
                    “systems,” which were propagated with the aid of mysterious rites. Mani’s
                    undertaking, then, was by no means a novel one, but was rather the last in a
                    long series of similar efforts. Again, even in the earlier of these attempts,
                    from that of Simon Magus onward, Christian elements had been adopted to a
                    greater or less extent; and the sects of the Christian gnostic schools of Syria
                    and western Asia may all be traced back to the nature-religions of ancient
                    Semitism, transformed into a philosophy of the world and of life. It is the
                    Babylonian sect of the Moghtasilah that seems to have furnished Mani with the
                    matter of his religious philosophical speculations, and the religion of this
                    sect was purely Semitic (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mandaeans</hi>; the Mandaeans
                    were related to the Moghtasilah). This was the source of the thoroughgoing
                    dualism which forms the basis of Mani’s system; for the ancient Persian religion
                    was not essentially dualistic, but was at bottom monistic, since Ahriman is
                    created by Ormuzd. At the same time Mani turned the theologumena of ancient
                    Persia also to account. The fact that the two opposed elements are called
                    “light” and “darkness” can hardly be independent of Parsism, and Manichaeism
                    uses other <hi rend="italic">termini</hi><hi rend="italic">technici</hi> of the
                    Persian religion. Whether Mani’s idea of redemption is to be traced to the
                    ancient Babylonian or to the Zoroastrian religion we do not venture to decide.
                    The idea of “the prophet” and “the primal man” is at all events Semitic.</p>
                <p>It is very difficult to determine what was the extent of Mani’s knowledge of
                    Christianity, how much he himself borrowed from it, and through what channels it
                    reached him. In any case it is certain that Manichaeism, in those districts
                    where it was brought much into contact with Christianity, became additionally
                    influenced by the latter at a very early period. The Western Manichaeans of the
                    4th and 5th centuries are much more like Christians than their Eastern brethren.
                    In this respect Manichaeism experienced the same Jdnd of development as
                    Neo-Platonism. As regards Mani himself, it is safest to assume that he held both
                    Judaism and Catholic Christianity to be entirely false religions. It is indeed
                    true that he not only described himself as the promised Paraclete—for this
                    designation probably originated with himself—but also conceded a high place in
                    hissystem to “Jesus;” we can only conclude from this, however, that he
                    distinguished between Christianity and Christianity. The religion which had
                    proceeded from the historical Jesus he repudiated together with its founder, and
                    Catholicism as well as Judaism he looked upon as a religion of the devil. But he
                    distinguished between the Jesus of darkness and the Jesus of light who had lived
                    and acted contemporaneously with the former. This distinction agrees with that
                    made by the gnostic Basilides no less strikingly than the Manichaean criticism
                    of the Old Testament does with that propounded by the Marcionites (see the <hi
                    rend="italic">Acta</hi><hi rend="italic">Archelai,</hi> in which Mani is made to
                    utter the antitheses of Marcion). Finally the Manichaean doctrines exhibit
                    points of similarity to those of the Christian Elkesaites; but, as it is
                    possible, and even probable, that such resemblances are to be ascribed to a
                    common ancient Semitic source, they do not here call for further consideration.
                    The historical relation of Mani to Christianity is then as follows. From
                    Catholicism, which he very probably had no detailed knowledge of, he borrowed
                    nothing, rejecting it as devilish error. On the other hand, he looked upon what
                    he considered to be Christianity proper, that is, Christianity as it had been
                    developed among the sects of Basilidians, Marcionites, and perhaps Bardesanites,
                    as a comparatively valuable and sound religion. He took from it, however, as
                    from the Persian religion, hardly anything but names, and, perhaps we may add, a
                    criticism of the Old Testament and of Judaism so far as he required it.
                    Indications of the influence of Marcionitism are found in the high estimation in
                    which Mani held the apostle Paul, and in the fact that he explicitly rejects the
                    Book of Acts. Mani appears to have given recognition to a portion of the
                    historical matter of the Gospels, and to have interpreted it in accordance with
                    his own doctrine. In conclusion, it remains to be asked whether Buddhistic
                    elements can also be detected in Manichaeism. Most modern scholars since F. C.
                    Baur have answered this question in the affirmative. According to Kessler, Mani
                    made use of the teaching of Buddha, at least as far as ethics was concerned. It
                    cannot be doubted that Mani, who undertook long journeys as far as India, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n509/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0509-0486"/> knew oh Buddhism. The name Buddha (Buddas) which
                    occurs in the legendary account of Mani, and perhaps in the latter’s own
                    writings, indicates further that he had occupied his attention with Buddhism
                    when engaged in the work of founding his new religion. But his borrowings from
                    this source must have been quite insignificant. A detailed comparison shows the
                    difference between Buddhism and Manichaeism in all their principal doctrines to
                    be very great, while it becomes evident that the points of resemblance are
                    almost' everywhere accidental. This is also true of the ethics and the
                    asceticism of the two systems. There is not a single point in Manichaeism which
                    demands for its explanation an appeal to . Buddhism. Such being the case, the
                    relationship between the two religions remains a mere possibility, a possibility
                    which the inquiry of Gey 1er <hi rend="italic">(Das System</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >des Manichaeismus</hi><hi rend="italic">und sein Verhältniss zum
                    Buddhismus,</hi> Jena, 1875) has not been able to elevate into a
                    probability.</p>
                <p>How are we to explain the rapid spread of Manichaeism, and the fact that it
                    really became one of the great religions? One answer is that Manichaeism was the
                    most complete gnosis, the richest, most consequent, and most artistic system
                    formed on the basis of the ancient Babylonian religion (so Kessler). This
                    explanation is insufficient, for no religion operates mainly through the
                    perfection of its system of doctrine; and it is not strictly correct, for the
                    older gnostic systems were not less richly equipped than the Manichaean. What
                    gave strength to Manichaeism was rather that it united an ancient mythology and
                    a thoroughgoing materialistic dualism with an exceedingly simple spiritual
                    worship and a strict morality. On comparing it with the Semitic religions of
                    nature, we perceive that it retained their mythologies, after transforming them
                    into “doctrines,” but abolished all their sensuous cultus, substituting instead
                    a spiritual worship as well as a strict morality. Manichaeism was thus able to
                    satisfy the new wants of an old world. It offered revelation, redemption, moral
                    virtue, and immortality, spiritual benefits on the basis of the religion of
                    nature. A further source of strength lay in the simple yet firm social
                    organization which was given by Mani himself to his new institution. The wise
                    man and the ignorant, the enthusiast and the man of the world, could all find
                    acceptance here, and there was laid on no one more than he was able and willing
                    to bear. Each one, however, was attached and led onward by the prospect of a
                    higher rank to be attained, while the intellectually gifted had an additional
                    inducement in the assurance that they did not require to submit themselves to
                    any authority, but would be led to God by pure reason. Thus adapted from the
                    first to individual requirements, this religion also showed itself able to
                    appropriate from time to time foreign elements. Originally furnished from
                    fragments of various religions, it could increase or diminish this possession
                    without rupturing its own elastic framework. And, after all, great adaptability
                    is just as necessary for a universal religion as a divine founder in whom the
                    highest revelation of God Himself may be seen and reverenced. Manichaeism
                    indeed, though it applies the title “redeemer” to Mani, has really no knowledge
                    of a redeemer, but only of a physical and gnostic process of redemption; on the
                    other hand, it possesses in Mani the supreme prophet of God. If we consider in
                    conclusion that Manichaeism gave a simple, apparently profound and yet
                    convenient solution of the problem of good and evil, a problem that had become
                    peculiarly oppressive to the human race in the 2d and 3d centuries, we shall
                    have named the most important factors which account for the rapid spread of the
                    system.</p>
                <p>Manichaeism first gained a firm footing in the East, t.e., in Persia,
                    Mesopotamia, and Transoxania. The persecutions it had to endure did not hinder
                    its extension. The seat of the Manichaean pope was for centuries in Babylon, at
                    a later period in Samarkand. Even after the conquests of Islam the Manichaean
                    Church continued to maintain itself, indeed it seems to have become still more
                    widely diffused by the victorious campaigns of the Mohammedans, and it
                    frequently gained secret adherents among the latter themselves. Its doctrine and
                    discipline underwent little change in the East; in particular, it drew no nearer
                    to the Christian religion. More than once, however, Manichaeism experienced
                    attempts at reformation; <hi rend="italic">for of</hi> course the auditores very
                    easily became worldly in character, and movements of reformation led temporarily
                    to divisions and the formation of sects. Towards the close of the 10th century,
                    at the time the <hi rend="italic">Fihrist</hi> was written, the Manichaeans in
                    Mesopotamia and Persia had already been in large measure ousted from the towns,
                    and had withdrawn to the villages. But in Turkestan, and as far as the Chinese
                    frontier, there existed numerous Manichaean communities, and even whole tribes
                    that had adopted the name of Mani. Probably it was the great migrations of the
                    Mongolian race that first put an end to Manichaeism in Central Asia. But even in
                    the 15th century there were Manichaeans living beside the Thomas-Christians on
                    the coast of Malabar in India (see Germann, <hi rend="italic">Die
                    Thomas-Christen,</hi> 1875). Manichaeism first penetrated the Greek-Roman empire
                    about the year 280, in the time of the emperor Probus (see the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chronicon</hi> of Eusebius). If we may take the edict of Diocletian against the
                    Manichaeans as genuine, the system must have gained a firm footing in the West
                    by the beginning of the 4th century, but we know that as late as about the year
                    325 Eusebius had not any accurate knowledge of the sect. It was only subsequent
                    to about 330 that Manichaeism spread rapidly in the Roman empire. Its adherents
                    were recruited on the one hand from the old gnostic sects (especially from the
                    Marcionites,—Manichaeism exerted besides this a strong influence on the
                    development of the Marcionite churches of the 4th century), on the other hand
                    from the large number of the “cultured,” who were striving after a “rational”
                    and yet in some manner Christian religion. Its polemics and its criticism of the
                    Catholic Church now became the strong side of Manichaeism, especially in the
                    West. It admitted the stumbling-blocks which the Old Testament offers to every
                    intelligent reader, and gave itself out as a Christianity without the Old
                    Testament. Instead of the subtle Catholic theories concerning divine
                    predestination and human freedom, and instead of a difficult theodicaea, it
                    offered an exceedingly simple conception of sin and goodness. The doctrine of
                    the incarnation of God, which was especially objectionable to those who were
                    going over to the new universal religion from the old cults, was not proclaimed
                    by Manichaeism. In its rejection of this doctrine Manichaeism agreed with
                    Neo-Platonism; but, while the latter, notwithstanding all its attempts to
                    conform itself to Christianity, could find no formula by which to inaugurate
                    within its own limits the special veneration of Christ, the Western Manichaeans
                    succeeded in giving their teaching a Christian tinge. The only part of the
                    Manichaean mythology that became popular was the crude, physical dualism. The
                    barbaric elements were judiciously screened from view as a “mystery;” they were,
                    indeed, here and there explicitly disavowed even by the initiated. The further
                    Manichaeism advanced into the West, the more Christian and philosophic did it
                    become. In Syria it maintained itself in comparative purity. In North Africa it
                    found its most numerous adherents, gaining secret support even among the clergy.
                    The explanation of this perhaps lies in the fact that one part of the population
                    of North Africa was of Semitic origin. Augustine was an <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0510-0487"/> auditor for nine years, while Faustus was at that
                    time the most esteemed Manichaean teacher in the West. Augustine in his later
                    writings against the Manichaeans deals chiefly with the following problems :—(1)
                    the relation between knowledge and faith, and between reason and authority; (2)
                    the nature of good and evil, and the origin of the latter; (3) the existence of
                    free will, and its relation to the divine omnipotence; (4) the relation of the
                    evil in the world to the divine government.</p>
                <p>The Christian Byzantine and Roman emperors, from Valens onwards, enacted strict
                    laws against the Manichaeans. But at first these bore little fruit. The
                    auditores were difficult to trace out, and besides they really gave little
                    occasion for persecution. In Rome itself between 370 and 440 Manichaeism gained
                    a large amount of support, especially among the scholars and public teachers. It
                    also made its way into the life of the people by means of a popular literature
                    in which the apostles were made to play a prominent part <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles').</hi> Manichaeism in the West had also some
                    experience of attempts at reformation from the ascetic side, but of these we
                    know little. In Rome Leo the Great was the first who took energetic measures,
                    along with the state authorities, against the system. Valentinian III. decreed
                    banishment against its adherents, Justinian the punishment of death. In North
                    Africa Manichaeism appears to have been extinguished by the persecution of the
                    Vandals. But it still continued to exist elsewhere, both in the Byzantine empire
                    and in the West, and in the earlier part of the Middle Ages it gave an impulse
                    to the formation of new sects, which remained related to it. And, if it has not
                    been quite proved that so early as the 4th century the Priscillianists of Spain
                    were influenced by Manichaeism, it is at least undoubted that the Paulicians and
                    Bogomiles as well as the Catharists and the Albigenses are to be traced back to
                    Manichaeism (and Marcionitism). Thus the system, not indeed of Mani the Persian,
                    but of Manichaeism as modified by Christian influences, accompanied the Catholic
                    Church until the 13th century.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sources.—</hi> (a) Oriental. Among the sources for a history of
                    Manichaeism, the most important are the Oriental. Of these the Mohammedan,
                    though of comparatively late date, are distinguished by the excellent manner in
                    which they have been transmitted to us, as well as by their impartiality. They
                    must be named first, because ancient Manichaean writings have been used in their
                    construction, while, with the exception of some small and rather unimportant
                    pieces, we possess no other .original Manichaean works dating from the 3d
                    century. At the head of all stands En-Nedim, <hi rend="italic">Fihrist

                    Manichaeans in the Graeco-Roman empire is to be found in an edict of Diocletian
                    (see Hänel, <hi rend="italic">Cod. Gregor.,</hi> tit. xv.), which is held by
                    some to be spurious, while others assign it to one or other of the years 287,

                    Mesopotamia; but they nevertheless contain much that is trustworthy, especially
                    regarding the doctrine of Mani, and they also include Manichaean documents. They
                    consist of various distinct pieces, and originated in the beginning of the 4th
                    century, probably at Edessa. They were translated as early as the first half of
                    the same century from the Syriac (as is mLintained by Jerome, <hi rend="italic"
                    >De Vir.</hi><hi rend="italic">Illust.</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> 72; though
                    this is doubted by modern scholars) into Greek, and soon afterwards into Latin.
                    It is only this secondary Latin version that we possess (edited by Zacagni,
                    1698; Routh, <hi rend="italic">Reliq. Sac.,</hi> vol. v., 1848; translated in
                    Clark’s <hi rend="italic">Ante-Nicene Library,</hi> vol. XX.); small fragments
                    of the Greek version have been preserved. Regarding the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acta</hi><hi rend="italic">Archelai,</hi> see Zittwitz in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zeitschr. f. d. histor. Theol.,</hi> 1873, and Oblasinski, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acta disp. Arch,</hi><hi rend="italic">ct</hi><hi rend="italic">Manetis,</hi>
                    1874. In the form in which we now possess them, they are a compilation after the
                    pattern of the <hi rend="italic">Clementine Homilies,</hi> and have been
                    subjected to manifold redactions. These <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi> were used by
                    Cyril of Jerusalem <hi rend="italic">{Catech.,</hi> 6), Epiphanius <hi
                    rend="italic">{Haer.,</hi> 66), and a great number of other writers. All the
                    Greek and Latin heresiologists have included the Manichaeans in their
                    catalogues; but they seldom adduce any independent information regarding them
                    (see Theodoret, <hi rend="italic">Haer.</hi><hi rend="italic">fab.,</hi> i. 26).
                    Important matter is to be found in the resolutions of the councils from the 4th
                    century onwards (see Mansi, <hi rend="italic">Acta Concil.,</hi> and Hefele, <hi
                    rend="italic">Concilicngcschichte,</hi> vol. i.-iii. ), and also in the
                    controversial writings of Titus of Bostra (6th cent. ), <hi rend="italic">∏pbs
                    Mavιχaloυs</hi> (ed. Lagarde, 1859), and of Alexander of Lycopolis, Λόγον <hi

                    vol. xiv. Of the Byzantines, the most worthy of mention are John of Damascus <hi
                    rend="italic">{De Haeres.</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dialog.)</hi> and Photius
                    <hi rend="italic">{cod.</hi> 179 <hi rend="italic">Biblioth. ).</hi> The
                    struggle with the Paulicians and the Bogomiles, who were often simply identified
                    with the Manichaeans, again directed attention to the latter. In the West the
                    works of Augustine are the great repertory for information on the subject of
                    Manichaeism <hi rend="italic">{Contra</hi><hi rend="italic">epistolam</hi><hi

                    the picture, however, which may here be obtained of Manichaeism, the moιe
                    cautious must we be in making generalizations from it, for it is beyond doubt
                    that Western Manichaeism adopted Christian elements which are wanting in the
                    original and in the Oriental Manichaeism.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Literature.—</hi> The most important works on Manichaeism are

                    du Manichéisme,</hi> 2 vols., 1734 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> (the Christian
                    elements in Manichaeism are here strongly, indeed too strongly, emphasized);

                    1831 (in this work Manichaean speculation is exhibited from a speculative
                    standpoint); Flügel, <hi rend="italic">Mani,</hi> 1862 (a very careful
                    investigation on the basis of the <hi rend="italic">Fihrist)</hi>; Kessler, <hi

                    the same writer in Herzog-Plitt’s <hi rend="italic">R.E.,</hi> ix. 223-59. This
                    article is very thorough, and leads to jnost favourable expectations regarding
                    the author’s forthcoming work. The accounts of Mosheim, Lardner, Walch, and
                    Schrδckh, as well as the monograph by Trechsel, <hi rend="italic">Ueber</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Kanon, Kritik, und Exegese der Manichäer,</hi> 1832, may also be
                    mentioned as still useful. The various researches which have been made regarding
                    Parsism, the ancient Semitic religions, Gnosticism, &amp;c., are of the greatest
                    importance for the investigation of Manichaeism. (A. HA.)</p>
