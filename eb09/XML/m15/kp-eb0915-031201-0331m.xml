                    the Arabian Sea. The extreme length is 145 miles, while the breadth varies from
                    25 miles in the north to 70 miles in the south; the area is 5763 square miles.
                    Malabar is singularly diversified in its configuration; from the eastward, the
                    great range of the Western Gh⅛ts, only interrupted by the Palghât gap, looks
                    down on a country broken by long spurs, extensive ravines, dense forests, and
                    tangled jungle. To the westward, gentler slopes and downs, and gradually
                    widening valleys closely cultivated, succeed the forest uplands, till, nearer
                    the seaboard, the low laterite table-lands shelve into rice plains and
                    backwaters fringed with cocoa-nut palms. The coast runs in a south-easterly
                    direction, and forms a few headlands and small bays, with a natural harbour in
                    the south at Cochin. In the south there is considerable extent of table-land.
                    The mountains of the Western Ghâts run almost parallel to the coast, and vary
                    from 3000 to 7000 feet in height. One of the most striking features in the
                    country is the Palghât gap, a complete opening in the Western Ghâts some 25
                    miles across. The chief rivers are the Beliapatam, Kota, Mahe, Beypur,
                    Kadelundi, and Ponâni. One of the most characteristic features of Malabar is an
                    all but continuous chain of lagoons or backwaters lying parallel to the coast,
                    which have been formed by the action of the waves and shore currents in
                    obstructing the waters of the rivers. Of these backwaters the most important are
                    the Kavâi and Beliapatam in the north, the Payangadi, Quilandi, and Elatur in
                    the middle, and the Chetwâi and Kodungalûr in the south. Connected as they are
                    by artificial canals, they form a cheap and abundant means of transit; and a
                    large local trade is carried on by inland navigation. Fishing and fishcuring is
                    an important industry, the value of the exports of salt fish to Ceylon being
                    about £20,000 per annum. The forests are extensive and of great value, but they
                    are almost entirely private property. The few tracts which are conserved have
                    come into Government hands by escheat or by contract. Wild animals include the
                    elephant, tiger, panther, bison, <hi rend="italic">sambhar,</hi> spotted deer,
                    hog, Nilgiri ibex, hyaena, and bear. Small game is very abundant.</p>
                <p>The census of 1872 returned the population of the district at 2,261,250, namely,
                    Hindus, 1,637,914; Mohammedans, 581,609; Europeans, 2579; Eurasians, 5409;
                    native Christians, 32,280; Jains, 31; and “others,” 1428. The Moplas or Maρilas,
                    who form a leading section of the Mohammedans, are the descendants of Malayalam
                    converts to Islam, mainly confined to the coast tract. They are fanatical and
                    bigoted, and their outrages, partly fanatical and partly agrarian, have for long
                    been a distinct feature in Malabar history. Many of these outbreaks have
                    necessitated the use of European troops for their suppression. A few Syrian
                    Christians are found in the south of the district, where they have one church.
                    The Roman Catholics have several churches and villages, the chief occupation of
                    the people being fishing and cultivating vegetables. The existing Roman Catholic
                    mission dates from 1656, having been founded by the Carmelites. The Protestant
                    Basel mission, established in 1839, has founded churches and schools at Calicut,
                    Cannanore, Tellicherri, and Palghât, with branch establishments at Chombla and
                    Todakel. The native Christian.population is steadily increasing, mainly through
                    the conversion of low-caste Hindus, who gain in’social position by the change.
                    The five largest towns, which are all municipalities, are Calicut, the capital,
                    population 48,338; Palghât, 31,115; Tellicherri, 20,479; Cochin, 13,588; and
                    Cannanore (Kanamir) town and cantonment, 10,265.</p>
                <p>In 1880-81 926,359 acres were under cultivation, and 2,869,965 •were returned as
                    cultivable. Rice, which occupied 580,281 acres in 1881, forms the principal food
                    crop, but it is also largely imported from neighbouring districts. Other crops
                    are <hi rend="italic">cholam, ragi, chama,</hi> gingelly seed, castor-oil seed,
                    gram, coffee, pepper, ginger, arrowroot, cardamoms, chillies, onions, cocoa-nut,
                    areca nut, cinnamon, &amp;c. Cocoa-nut gardens form one of the greatest sources
                    of commercial wealth; the value of the exported produce from Madras in 1880-81
                    was £141,800, chiefly from Malabar, this being a decrease of 18 per cent, on the
                    year preceding. Pepper and spices yield over a quarter of a million. As a rule,
                    the peasantry are well off and free from debt. The district is not liable to
                    blight, flood, oι ’ drought. When, however, the neighbouring districts to the
                    east suffer from scarcity, Malabar, which ordinarily imports grain, is affected
                    by the prevalence of high prices.</p>
                <p>The district is fairly supplied with means of communication, and possesses 400
                    miles of good metalled roads, besides minor cart tracks. The water communication
                    provided by the backwaters and their canals has already been referred to. The
                    Madras railway traverses the southern part of the district for a total distance
                    of 89 miles from Walliar to Beypur. Except cloth weaving, and the making of
                    tiles, bricks, &amp;c., at the mission stations at Calicut and Cannanore, and
                    the weaving of coarse cotton cloths and mats at Palghât, there are no local
                    manufactures worthy of mention. The weaving of calico, which derived its name
                    from Calicut, seems to have altogether died out; while unsuccessful attempts
                    have been made to manufacture canvas at Beypur and silk at Palghât. The
                    principal seats of commerce are Calicut, Cannanore, Tellicherri, Cochin,
                    Palghât, and Badagara. In 1876- 77 the value of the imports (which were
                    abnormally increased by the famine demand for rice) amounted to £1,765,200, of
                    which £1,118,000 was for rice; exports £2,466,000, of which £960,000 represented
                    coffee. European banks are represented at Calicut, Cochin, and Tellicherri.</p>
                <p>The revenue has largely increased of late years. In 1880-81 the land revenue
                    amounted to £176,062, and the gross revenue to £332,628. The number of pupils
                    connected with the various schools at the same date was 20,971. The principal
                    educational institutions are the provincial school at Calicut, the mission
                    school at Tellicherri, the Palghât high school, and the “Kerala Vidya Sala,”
                    recently established by tnezamorin, for the instruction of the young noblemen of
                    his family and of other influential persons in the district. Nearly one hundred
                    schools are exclusively confined to Moplâs. There are several printing presses
                    at Calicut and Cochin, and at the latter port are published two English and two
                    Malayalam newspapers. The climate of the district is, on the whole, healthy; the
                    rainfall is heavy, averaging 120 inches a year, of which about 80 inches fall in
                    June, July, and August. The temperature varies from 60° in December to about 92°
                    in the hot weather in May. The principal diseases are small-pox, dysentery, and
                    fever.</p>
