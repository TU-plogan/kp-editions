                    (1706-1784), the most learned musician of the 18th century, was bornât Bologna
                    on April 25, 1706. His father, Antonio Maria Martini, a violinist, taught him
                    very early the elements of music, and to play the violin: at a later period he
                    learned singing and harpsichord playing from Padre Pradieri, and counterpoint
                    from Antonio Riccieri. Having received his education in classics from the
                    fathers of the oratory of San Filippo Neri, he afterwards entered upon a
                    noviciate at the Franciscan monastery at Lago, at the close of which he was
                    received into that order on September <pb break="no"

                    and practice of music with great zeal, he in 1725, though only nineteen years of
                    age, received the appointment of chapelmaster in the Franciscan church at
                    Bologna, where his compositions soon attracted much attention. At the invitation
                    of amateurs and professional friends he now opened a school of musical
                    composition at which in the course of his long life several celebrated musicians
                    were trained, including Paolucci, Sabbatini, Ruttini, Zanotti, Sarti, Ottani,
                    and Stanislas Mattei; as a teacher he consistently declared his preference for
                    the traditions of the old Roman school of musical composition (see Music). Padre
                    Martini was a zealous and indefatigable collector of musical literature, and is
                    alleged to have been the possessor of the most extensive musical library ever
                    formed. After a lingering illness he died at Bologna on August 4, 1784. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Elogio</hi> was published by Pietro della Valle at Bologna in the
                    same year.</p>
                <p>The greater number of Martini’s sacred compositions remain unprinted. The Liceo
                    of Bologna possesses the MSS. of two oratorios; and a requiem, with some other
                    pieces of church music, are now in Vienna. <hi rend="italic">Litaniae</hi><hi

                    important works are his <hi rend="italic">Storia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >della</hi><hi rend="italic">Musica</hi> (Bologna, 1757-81) and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Saggio di Contrapunto</hi> (Bologna, 1774-75). The former, of
                    which the three published volumes relate wholly to ancient music, and thus
                    represent a mere fragment of the author’s vast plan, exhibits immense reading
                    and industry, but it is written in a dry and unattractive style, and is
                    overloaded with matter which cannot be regarded as historical. At the beginning
                    and end of each chapter occur puzzle-canons, some of which are exceedingly
                    difficult; Cherubini solved the whole of them. The <hi rend="italic">Saggio</hi>
                    is a very learned and valuable work, containing an important collection of
                    examples from the best masters of the old Italian and Spanish schools, with
                    excellent explanatory notes. It treats chiefly of the tonalities of the plain
                    chant, and of counterpoints constructed upon them. Besides being the author of
                    several controversial works, Martini drew up a <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of
                    Ancient Musical Terms,</hi> which appeared in the second volume of G. B. Doni’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>; he also published a treatise on <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Theory of Numbers as applied to Music.</hi></p>
