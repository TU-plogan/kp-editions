                    57' E. long., corresponds with tolerable closeness to the old lower Saxon
                    province of the same name, and is now unequally divided into the two
                    grandduchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz; These are so
                    closely related in history, political organization, natural features, and
                    general development that it is convenient to treat them in a single article.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mecklenburg-Schwerin,</hi> the seventh state of the German
                    empire in size and the eighth in population, is bounded on the N. by the Baltic

                    Brandenburg and Hanover, and on the E. by Pomerania and Mecklenburg-Strelitz. It
                    embraces the duchies of Schwerin and Güstrow, the district of Rostock, the
                    principality of Schwerin, and the barony of Wismar, besides several small
                    “enclaves” in the adjacent territories. Its total area is about 5117 square

                    bounded by Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Pomerania, and Brandenburg, the second by
                    Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Lauenburg, and the territory of the free town of Lübeck.
                    Their joint area is 1126 square miles.</p>
                <p>Mecklenburg lies wholly within the great North-European plain, and its flat
                    surface is interrupted only by one range of low hills, intersecting the country
                    from south-east to north-west, and forming the watershed between the Baltic Sea
                    and the Elbe. Its highest point, the Helpter Berg, is 580 feet above the
                    sea-level. The coast-line runs for 65 miles along the Baltic (without including
                    indentations), for the most part in flat sandy stretches covered with dunes. The
                    chief inlets are the bays of Wismar, Grosse Wiek, Salzhaff, and Kroy, and the
                    roads of Warnemünde. The rivers are numerous though small; most of them are
                    affluents of the Elbe, which itself traverses a small portion of Mecklenburg.
                    Several of the streams are navigable, and the facilities for inland water
                    traffic are increased by a tolerably extensive system of canals. Lakes are very
                    numerous; about four hundred of fair size, covering an area of 500 square miles,
                    are reckoned in the two duchies. The largest is Lake Müritz, 52 square miles in
                    extent. The climate on the whole resembles that of Great Britain, but the
                    winters are generally more severe; the mean annual temperature is 48° F., and
                    the annual rainfall is about 28 inches. Although there are long stretches of
                    marshy moorland along the coast, the soil is on the whole productive. According
                    to the official returns of 1878, about 57 per cent, of the total area of
                    Mecklenburg-Schwerin consisted of cultivated land, 17 per cent, of forest, and
                    13 per cent, of heath and pasture. In Mecklenburg-Strelitz the corresponding
                    figures were 48, 20, and 9 per cent. Agriculture is by far the most important
                    industry in both duchies. The following table shows the areas and products of
                    the chief crops in 1880 :—</p>

                <p>Besides these, smaller areas are devoted to maize, buckwheat, pease, rape, hemp,
                    flax, hops, and tobacco. The extensive pastures support large herds of sheep and
                    cattle, including a noteworthy breed of merino sheep. The horses of Mecklenburg
                    are of a fine sturdy quality, and are highly esteemed in Germany. In 1878 the
                    two duchies contained 100,651 horses, 315,712 cattle, and 1,321,916 sheep. Red
                    deer, wild swine, and various other kinds of game are found in the forests. The
                    manufactures of Mecklenburg are of little importance. Its industrial
                    establishments include a few iron foundries, wool-spinning mills, carriage and
                    machine factories, dye-works, tanneries, brick-fields, soapworks, breweries,
                    distilleries, numerous limekilns and tarboiling works, tobacco and cigar
                    factories, and about eight hundred mills of various kinds. Mining is also
                    insignificant, though a fair variety of minerals is represented in the district.
                    Amber is found on and near the Baltic coast. Trade, mainly confined to the
                    larger duchy, is tolerably active. Rostock, Warnemünde, and Wismar are the
                    principal commercial centres. The chief exports are grain and other agricultural
                    produce, live stock, spirits, wood, and wool; the chief imports are colonial
                    produce, iron, coal, salt, wine, beer, and tobacco. The horse and wool markets
                    of Mecklenburg are largely attended by buyers from various parts of Germany.
                    Fishing is carried on extensively in the numerous inland lakes. Within the last
                    decade the mercantile fleet of Mecklenburg-Schwerin has doubled the number and
                    quadrupled the tonnage of its ships, these consisting in 1881 of 370 sailing
                    vessels and 11 steamers, with an aggregate burden of 112,388 tons.
                    Mecklenburg-Strelitz has no seaboard.</p>
                <p>Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz are both limited monarchies under
                    grand-dukes, who are hereditary in the male line. The reigning families are
                    closely related, and possess mutual rights of succession; should both families
                    become extinct, their possessions pass to Prussia. The constitution, which is
                    common to both the duchies, exhibits few traces of the liberal tendency of
                    modern politics. The temporary modifications brought about by the agitation of
                    1848 were quickly rescinded, and matters returned to the old semi-feudal
                    arrangements, which deprive the bulk of the people of all share in the
                    government. The constitution as it now exists is based upon an agreement made
                    between the duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and his estates in 1755, and adopted in
                    the same year by Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The Landes-Union, or common assembly of
                    the two duchies, consists of representatives of the Ritterschaft, or landed
                    proprietors, and of the Landschaft, which embraces forty-seven towns. The
                    peasantry is unrepresented, and the principality of Ratzeburg, in
                    Mecklenburg-Strelitz, is governed directly by the grand-duke. The Landes-Union
                    meets once annually, alternating between Sternberg and Malchin. When not sitting
                    it is represented by a committee of nine members. Distinct from the Landes-Union
                    are the convocation diet and the deputation diet, which are assemblies of the
                    estates of one or other duchy for special business. In Mecklenburg-Schwerin the
                    executive is placed in the hands of fo^ιr ministers, holding the portfolios of
                    foreign affairs, domestic affairs, finance, and justice (including education and
                    religion). In Mecklenburg-Strelitz there is one minister, who is aided by a
                    small council. In both duchies the military administration is in the hands of
                    the crown. Mecklenburg-Schwerin has two votes in the federal council of the
                    German empire, and sends six members to the imperial diet, while the smaller
                    duchy has one representative in each assembly. As no official budget is
                    published in either duchy, it is impossible to give accurate details of their
                    financial position. In Mecklenburg-Schwerin it is usual to distinguish three
                    branches of revenue, one under the control of the sovereign, one under the joint
                    control of the sovereign and estates, and the third (of small amount) under the
                    sole management of the estates. The income under the first heading is derived
                    from the royal domains, the ordinary taxes, and special votes for special
                    purposes, and ^amounts to about £600,000. With this sum are defrayed the
                    ordinary expenses of government, including the annual contribution to the
                    imperial treasury. The revenue under the second head is about £100,000. The
                    public debt in 1880 amounted to £1,100,000. The revenues of Mecklenburg-Strelitz
                    are unknown; its debt is estimated at about £300,000. The private income of the
                    duke, derived from the royal domains, makes him one of the richest princes in
                    Germany. The duchies of Mecklenburg contribute three regiments of infantry, a
                    battalion of rifles, two regiments of dragoons, and four batteries of field
                    artillery to the imperial army.</p>
                <p>The educational institutions partake of the high character common to those of the
                    German empire. The two duchies contain nine gymnasia, seven “Realschulen, ’
                    three normal schools, and an adequate number of schools of a lower grade. There
                    is a university at Rostock, which in 1882 had a teaching staff of 36 professors
                    and an attendance<pb break="no"

                    were unable to read and write their names, while all the recruits in
                    Mecklenburg-Strelitz were able to do both. The predominant confession in
                    Mecklenburg is the Lutheran, which is professed by both the grand-dukes. The
                    proportion of Roman Catholics, Jews, and members of the Reformed Church is
                    insignificant. The ultimate spiritual authority is exercised by consistories at
                    Schwerin and Strelitz. Mecklenburg also contains a fair share of learned
                    societies and benevolent institutions. The supreme court of appeal for both
                    duchies, in all criminal and civil cases, is at Rostock.</p>
                <p>The population of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in 1861 was 548,449; in 1871, 557,707; in
                    1875, 553,785; and in 1880, 577,055. The capital is Schwerin (30,146
                    inhabitants), but the most important town is Rostock (36,967 inhabitants). The
                    population of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in 1861 was 99,060; in 1871, 96,982; in 1875,
                    95,673; in 1880, 100,269. The chief town is Neu-Strelitz. About 71 per cent, of
                    the inhabitants are engaged in agricultural pursuits. The proportion of the
                    rural to the urban population is as 3 to 1, or exactly the reverse ratio to that
                    in the neighbouring Prussia. The peasantry of Mecklenburg still retain numerous
                    traces of their Slavonic origin, especially in their speech, but their
                    peculiarities have been much modified by amalgamation with the German colonists
                    who settled within this district at various times. The townspeople and nobility
                    are almost wholly of Saxon strain. The slow rate of increase in the population
                    of Mecklenburg is chiefly accounted for by the constant stream of emigration.
                    Between 1870 and 1880 the two duchies contributed in the highest proportion to
                    the emigration from Germany. Out of 595,151 German emigrants who sailed from
                    Bremen, Hamburg, Stettin, and Antwerp within that period, 24,870 came from
                    Mecklenburg-Schwerin and 2481 from Mecklenburg-Strelitz, representing
                    respectively 4 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 38 and 2 <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 52 per 1000 inhabitants as the yearly average. Probably another cause of
                    the slow growth of population is to be sought for in the difficulties thrown in
                    the way of the marriage of the peasants by the semi-feudal character of their
                    tenure. It is a significant fact that in 1880 the proportion of illegitimate
                    births in the two duchies amounted to 14 per cent, as compared with 9 per cent,
                    in the entire German empire.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The Vandals, who in the time of Tacitus occupied
                    the region now known as Mecklenburg, were succeeded in the 6th century by a
                    Slavonic race. Though partly conquered by Charlemagne in 789, this people soon
                    regained their independence, and long offered a successful resistance to all
                    attempts on the part of the German emperors to overcome and Christianize them.
                    At last, in 1160, Duke Henry of Saxony made himself master of the country. The
                    native prince was, however, permitted to retain his sovereignty, and has
                    transmitted to his descendants and successors of the present day the distinction
                    of being the only ruling princes of Slavonic origin in Germany. In 1160 he was
                    raised by the emperor Frederick I. to the dignity of a prince of the empire.
                    From 1202 till 1227 Mecklenburg was under Danish supremacy; and in 1229, two
                    years after its restoration to Germany, there occurred the first of a long
                    series of divisions of the territory, which, with subsequent reunions,
                    constitute so much of its complicated history. In 1348 Charles IV. made
                    Mecklenburg a duchy. In 1523 the trials and commotions springing from the
                    rivalry and jealousy of two joint rulers incited the prelates, nobility, and
                    burghers to form a union among themselves, the effects of which are visible to
                    the present day,—most prominently in the existence of the common Landes-Union.
                    The Reformation was welcomed by the inhabitants of Mecklenburg in 1524; and
                    about 1555 nearly all the monasteries were suppressed. In 1621, when a new
                    partition took place, the town of Rostock “with its university and high court”
                    was declared to be held in common. The diet also retained its joint character,
                    and henceforth alternated between Sternberg and Malchin.</p>
                <p>In the Thirty Years’ War both Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Güstrow—as the
                    parts were then called—incurred the suspicion of the emperor, who secretly sold
                    them to Wallenstein, and expelled the dukes in his behalf. They were reinstated,
                    however, by Gustavus Adolphus, and at the peace of Prague in 1635 they both made
                    their peace with the emperor. At the peace of Westphalia Rostock and some other
                    parts of Mecklenburg territory were given in pledge to Sweden, and they were not
                    redeemed till 1803. The sufferings of the Mecklenburg peasantry during the
                    Thirty Years’ War were exceeded in no other part of sorely-tried Germany. Most
                    were reduced to serfdom through poverty; in some cases whole villages utterly
                    vanished. In 1695 the Mecklenburg-Güstrow line became extinct; and, after some
                    contention between the brother and the nephew of the last duke of
                    Mecklenburg-Schwerin for the vacant succession, the “Hamburg Division” (March 8,
                    1701) apportioned to each shares that are represented by the present duchies.
                    The affixes Schwerin and Strelitz are derived from the capital towns of the two
                    dukes.</p>
                <p>Mecklenburg-Schwerin began its new independent existence by 3 series of
                    constitutional struggles between its nobility and its rulers. The heavy debt
                    incurred by Charles Leopold, who had joined Russia in a war against Sweden,
                    brought matters to such a pitch that in 1728 the emperor Charles VI. deposed the
                    duke <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> in favour of hi⅛ brother Christian Louis.
                    Under this prince, the “Rostock Contract,” which is still the basis of the
                    constitution, was framedin 1755. During the Seven Years’ War
                    Mecklenburg-Schwerin assumed a hostile attitude towards Frederick the Great, and
                    was in consequence occupied by Prussian troops. In 1806 it was overrun by the
                    French, and in 1808 it joined the confederation of the Rhine. The duke, however,
                    though he assisted Napoleon in 1812, was the first member of the confederation
                    to renounce it, and in the following year his troops fought against France and
                    Denmark. On joining the Germanic confederation he assumed the title of
                    grandduke, with the style of royal highness. In and after 1848 the duchy
                    witnessed a considerable agitation in favour of a new and more liberal
                    constitution, but the subsequent reaction rescinded al) the concessions that had
                    been made, and reduced matters to their former feudal condition. In 1819 and
                    1820 serfdom and personal bondage were abolished, and various slight
                    ameliorations of the state of the peasantry have since been introduced.</p>
                <p>Mecklenburg-Strelitz adopted the constitution of the sister duchy by an
                    “Agnitions-Act” in 1755. In 1806 it was spared the infliction of a French
                    occupation through the interest of the king of Bavaria; but in 1813 it was
                    mulcted in the sum of two million thalers for the French army. In 1808 it
                    entered the Rhenish confederation, but repudiated it in 1813 and joined the
                    alliance against Napoleon. In 1815 the duke assumed the title of grand-duke.</p>
