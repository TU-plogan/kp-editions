                <p><label type="entry">MANNA</label>, a concrete saccharine exudation obtained by
                    making incisions in the trunk of the flowering or manna ash tree, <hi
                    rend="italic">Fraxinus Ornus,</hi> I.. At the present day the manna of commerce
                    is collected exclusively in Sicily from cultivated trees, chiefly in the
                    districts around Capaci, Carini, Cinisi, and Favarota, small towns 20 to 25
                    miles west of Palermo, and in the townships of Geraci, Castelbuono, and other
                    places in the district of Cefalù, 50 to 70 miles east of Palermo. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">frassinetti</hi> or plantations the trees are placed about 7 feet
                    apart, and after they are eight years old, and the trunk at least 3 inches in
                    diameter, the collection of manna is begun. This operation is performed in July
                    or August during the dry weather, by making transverse incisions 1∣ to 2 inches
                    long, and about 1 inch apart, through the bark, one cut being made each day, the
                    first at the bottom of the tree, another directly above the first, and so on. In
                    succeeding years the process is repeated on the untouched sides of the trunk,
                    until the tree has been cut all round and exhausted. It is then cut down, and a
                    young plant arising from the same root takes its place. The finest or flaky
                    manna appears to have been allowed to harden on the stem. A very superior kind,
                    obtained by allowing the juice to encrust pieces of wood or straws inserted in
                    the cuts, and called <hi rend="italic">manna a cannolo,</hi> is not found in
                    commerce in England. The fragments adhering to the stem after the finest flakes
                    have been removed are scraped off, and form the small or Tolfa manna of
                    commerce. That which flows from the lower incisions is often collected on tiles
                    or on a concave piece of the prickly pear <hi rend="italic">{Opuntia},</hi> but
                    is less crystalline and more glutinous, and is less esteemed.</p>
                <p>Manna of good quality dissolves at ordinary temperatures in about G parts of
                    water, forming a clear liquid. Its chief constituent is mannite or manna sugar,
                    a hexatomic alcohol, C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">
                    8</hi> (OH) <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi>, which likewise occurs, in much
                    smaller quantity, in certain species of <hi rend="italic">Fucus</hi> and in
                    plants of several widely separated natural orders. Of this substance the best
                    manna contains 70 to 80 per cent. It crystallizes in shining rhombic prisms from
                    its solution in boiling alcohol. Manna possesses mildly laxative properties, and
                    on account of its sweet taste is employed as a mild aperient for children. It is
                    less used in England now than formerly, but is still largely consumed in South
                    America. In Italy mannite is prepared for sale in the shape of small cones
                    resembling loaf sugar in shape, and is frequently prescribed in medicine instead
                    of manna.</p>
                <p>The manna of the present day appears to have been unknown before the 15th
                    century, although a mountain in Sicily with the Arabic name Gibelman, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> “manna mountain,” appears to point to its collection
                    there during the period that the island was held by the Saracens, 827-1070. In
                    the 16th century it was collected in Calabria in Italy, and until recently was
                    produced in the Tuscan Maremma, but neither from that locality nor from the
                    States of the Church is any now brought into commerce, although the name of
                    Tolfa, a town near Civita Vecchia, is still applied to an inferior variety of
                    the drug.</p>
                <p>Various other kinds of manna are known, but none of these have been found to
                    contain mannite. Alhagi manna (Persian and Arabic <hi rend="italic"
                    >tar-angubin)</hi> is the produce of <hi rend="italic">Alhagi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">camelorum,</hi> Fisch., a small, spiny, leguminous plant, growing
                    in Persia, Afghanistan, and Baluchistan. This manna occurs in the form of small,
                    roundish, hard, dry tears, varying from the size of a mustard seed to that of a
                    coriander, of a light-brown colour, sweet taste, and senna-like odour. The
                    spines and pods of the plant are often mixed with it. It is collected near,
                    Kandahar and Herat, and imported into India from Cabul and Kandahar to the
                    extent of about 2000 lb. annually, and is valued, at about thirty shillings per
                    lb. Tamarisk manna (Persian <hi rend="italic">gaz-angubin,</hi> tamarisk honey)
                    exudes in June and July from the sleuder branches of <hi rend="italic">Tamarix
                    gallica,</hi> var. <hi rend="italic">nιannifera,</hi> Ehrenb., in the form of
                    honey-like drops, which, in the cool temperature of the early morning, are found
                    in the solid state. This secretion is caused by the puncture of an insect, <hi
                    rend="italic">Coccus manniparus,</hi> Ehrenb. In the valleys of the peninsula of
                    Sinai, especially in the Wady el-Sheikh, this manna (Arabic <hi rend="italic"
                    >man)</hi> is collected by the Arabs and sold to the monks of St Catherine, who
                    supply it to the pilgrims visiting the convent. It is found also in Persia and
                    the Punjab, but does not appear to be collected in any quantity. This kind of
                    manna seems to be alluded to by Herodotus (vii. 31). Under the same name of <hi
                    rend="italic">gaz-angubin</hi> there are sold commonly in the Persian bazaars
                    round cakes, of which a chief ingredient is a manna obtained to the south-west
                    of Ispahan, in the month of August, by shaking the branches or scraping the
                    stems of <hi rend="italic">Astragalus</hi><hi rend="italic">florulentus</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">A. adscendens,</hi> Boiss. and Hausskn.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Bombay Lit. Tr.,</hi>
                    vol. i. art. 16, for details as to the gaz-angubin. A common Persian sweetmeat
                    consists of wheat-flour kneaded with manna into a thick paste.</p></note><hi
                    rend="italic">Shirkhist,</hi> a kind of manna known to writers on materia medica
                    in the 16th century, is still found in the bazaars of north-west India, being
                    imported from Afghanistan and Turkestan to a limited extent. Haussknecht states
                    that it is the produce of <hi rend="italic">Cotoneaster</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nummularia,</hi> Fisch, and Mey. <hi rend="italic">(Rosaceae),</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Atraphaxis</hi><hi rend="italic">spinosa,</hi> I.. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Polygonaceae),</hi> and that it is brought chiefly from
                    Herat.</p>
                <p>Oak manna, according to Haussknecht, is collected from the twigs of <hi
                    rend="italic">Quercus</hi><hi rend="italic">Vallonea,</hi> Kotschy, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Q. persica,</hi> Jaub. and Spach, on which it is produced by the
                    puncture of an insect during the month of August. This manna occurs in the state
                    of agglutinated tears, and forms an object of some industry among the wandering
                    tribes of Kurdistan at the present day. It is collected before sunrise, by
                    shaking the grains of manna on to linen cloths spread out beneath the trees, or
                    by dipping the small branches in hot water and evaporating the solution thus
                    obtained. A substance collected by the inhabitants of Laristan from <hi
                    rend="italic">Pyrus glabra,</hi> Boiss., strongly resembles oak manna in
                    appearance.</p>
                <p>Australian manna is found on the leaves of <hi rend="italic">Eucalyptus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">viminalis,</hi> Lab.; the Lerp manna of Australia is of animal
                    origin.</p>
                <p>Briançon manna is met with on the leaves of the common <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Larch</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.v.</hi>), and a kind of manna was at one time
                    obtained from the cedar, but none of these are now collected for commercial
                    purposes.</p>
                <p>The manna of Scripture, notwithstanding the miraculous circumstances which
                    distinguish it in the Biblical narrative from anything now known, answers in its
                    description very closely to the tamarisk manna.</p>
