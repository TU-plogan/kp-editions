                    vessel, obtained a medical post in his native town. He claims recognition as an
                    independent <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> propounder of the “First Law of
                    Thermodynamics,” but more especially as having early and ably applied that law
                    to the explanation of many remarkable phenomena, both cosmical and terrestrial.
                    His first little paper on the subject, “Bemerkungen über die Kräfte der
                    unbelebten Natur,” appeared in 1842 in Liebig’s <hi rend="italic">Annalen,</hi>
                    five years subsequent to the republication, in the same journal, of an extract
                    from the great memoir of <hi rend="smallcaps">Mohr</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.).</hi> Mayer’s statements as to the “indestructibility of force” (as he
                    calls it) were based almost entirely upon scholastic dicta, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">causa</hi><hi rend="italic">sequat effectum,</hi> &amp;c. The main
                    experimental fact which he adduces in support of his reasoning as to the
                    convertibility of work and heat is a mere repetition, in a very inadequate form,
                    of a curious experiment made by Dr Reade of Cork, who found <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Nicholson's Journal,</hi> xx., 1808, p. 113) that water was sensibly heated
                    after being violently shaken in a phial. But Dr Reade states explicitly the
                    precautions he had taken to protect the phial and its contents from heating by
                    the hand of the operator,— an important detail which is unnoticed by Mayer.</p>
                <p>It has been repeatedly claimed for Mayer that he calculated the value of the
                    dynamical equivalent of heat, indirectly no doubt, but in a manner altogether
                    free from error, and with a result according almost exactly with that obtained
                    by Joule after years of patient labour in direct experimenting. Mayer assumed
                    that the heat developed by compression of air is the equivalent of the work
                    spent in the compression. If we had independent proof of this the result would
                    undoubtedly follow.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Séguin, three years before, had assumed that the work done by steam or any
                    other expanding substance is the equivalent of the heat which disappears during
                    the expansion. A similar idea, but more accurately expressed, is to be found in
                    Mohr s paper, above referred to.</p></note> And it has been urged that the man
                    who, by a single burst of genius, reached at once the goal which others had been
                    painfully seeking, merits an amount of fame commensurate with that due to
                    discoverers like Newton or Galileo. This claim on Mayer’s behalf was first shown
                    to be baseless by Thomson and Tait (“Energy,” <hi rend="italic">Good Wards,</hi>
                    1862). This article gave rise to a long but lively discussion. A calm and
                    judicial annihilation of the claim is to be found in a brief article by Stokes,
                    <hi rend="italic">Proc. Hoy. Soc.,</hi> 1871, p. 54. See also Maxwell’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Theory of Heat,</hi> chap, xiii. Mayer entirely ignored the grand
                    fundamental principle laid down by Sadi Carnot, a principle which has done even
                    more for physics than has the conservation of energy itself, viz., that nothing
                    can be concluded as to the relation between heat and work from an experiment in
                    which the working substance is left at the end of an operation in a different
                    physical state from that in which it was at the commencement. Mayer has also
                    becu styled the discoverer of the fact that heat consists in (the energy of)
                    motion, a matter settled at the very end of the 18th century by Rumford and
                    Davy. In the teeth of this statement we have Mayer’s own words, “We might much
                    rather assume the contrary, —that in order to become heat, motion must cease to
                    be motion.”</p>
                <p>Mayer’s real merit consists in the fact that, having for himself made out, on
                    inadequate and even questionable grounds, the conservation of energy, and having
                    obtained (though by inaccurate reasoning) a numerical result correct so far as
                    his data permitted, he applied the principle with great power and insight to the
                    explanation of numerous physical phenomena. His papers, which have been
                    republished in a single volume with the title <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mechanik der Wärme</hi> (2d ed., Stuttgart, 1874), are of
                    extremely unequal mtrit. But some, especially those on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Celestial Dynamics</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Organic Motion,</hi> are
                    admirable examples of what really valuable work may be effected by a man of high
                    intellectual powers, in spite of imperfect information and defective logic.</p>
                <p>Different, and, it would appear, exaggerated, estimates of Mayer are given in Dr
                    Tyndall’s papers in the <hi rend="italic">Phil. Mag.,</hi> 1863-64 (whose avowed
                    object was “to raise a noble and a suffering man to the position which his
                    labours entitled him to occupy”), and in the extraordinary treatise by Dühring,
                    <hi rend="italic">Robert Mayer,</hi><hi rend="italic">der</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    1880. Some of the simpler facts of the case are summarized by Tait in the <hi
