                    it existed in the times of Pindar and the tragic poets) this hero was called the
                    son of Tithonus (the half-brother of Priam) and Eos (Aurora). Tradition
                    represented him as an Ethiopian prince who came to assist the Trojans against
                    the Greeks, and performed prodigies of valour, but was at length killed by
                    Achilles, after having himself slain Antilochus, the son of Nestor, an event
                    alluded to in Pindar, <hi rend="italic">Pyth.,</hi> vi. 32-39. His story must
                    have been very famous, for more than one Greek play was composed bearing the
                    title.</p>
                <p>The chief source from which our knowledge about Memnon as a chief is derived is
                    the second book of the <hi rend="italic">PostHomerica,</hi> by Quintus
                    Smyrnaeus, where his exploits and death are described at length. That Memnon was
                    slain by Achilles is more than once affirmed by Pindar (A <hi rend="superscript"
                    > 7</hi> ⅛ι., vi. 52; <hi rend="italic">Isthm.,</hi> iv. 41, vii. 54). He is
                    mentioned also in the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> (xi. 522), with especial
                    praise for personal beauty; but the allusion to him is quite casual, and is one
                    of many proofs that the compilation of that and the sister epic presupposes in
                    the reader or hearer a full knowledge of the whole tale of Troy. Modern
                    philology associates Memnon—like Achilles, whom he so closely resembles in many
                    particulars, and like Sarpedon, who seems the representative of Memnon in the
                    Iliad—with solar phenomena. He was the son of the dawn, and, though he might
                    vanish from sight for a time, he could not be destroyed, and therefore it was
                    said that Zeus, moved by the tears of his mother, granted him immortality. In
                    this respect, as also in wearing bright armour made by Hephaestus, he is the
                    counterpart of Achilles, who symbolizes the mid-day sun in his glory; and that
                    Memnon is said to have come from the far east, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> from
                    the region of sunrise, is in itself significant. Ovid, in a beautiful elegy on
                    the death of Tibullus, <hi rend="italic">Amor.,</hi> lib. iii. 9, 3, thus
                    associates the fates of Memnon and Achilles :—</p>
                <p>Memnona si mater, mater ploravit Achillem, Et tangunt magnas tristia fata
                    deas,</p>
                <p>Flebilis indignos, Elegeia, solve capillos; Ah nimis ex vero nunc tibi nomen
                    erit.</p>
                <p>Like the body of the dead hero Sarpedon <hi rend="italic">(H.,</hi> xvi. 681), so
                    that of Memnon was borne through the air, a legend represented on Greek vases of
                    a rather early date. This appears to mean that the sun, the offspring of the
                    dawn, careers through the sky to the place of his departure in the west. Another
                    account represents Zeus as navιng sent forth birds from the funeral-pile of
                    Memnon, which straightway fought with each other, and many fell back as victims
                    to the soul of the hero.</p>
                <p>The mere fact that a <hi rend="italic">Afemnonium,,</hi> or temple in honour of
                    the hero, was erected both at Susa and at Egyptian Thebes, both of which places
                    were centres of sun-worship, is a strong confirmation of the probability,
                    derived from his mythical pedigree, that he was really a sun-god. Sir G. W. Cox
                    remarks,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Mythology and Folklore,</hi> p. 134.</p></note> “of Memnon’s head
                    the story was told that it retained the prophetic power of the living Helios or
                    of Surya. The story is found in the myth of the Teutonic Wismir, and it might
                    have been related of Kephalos, the head of the sun;” and again (p. 267), “Eos,
                    the mother of Memnon, is so transparently the morning th it her child must rise
                    again as surely as the sun reappears to run his daily course across the
                    heaven.”</p>
                <p>With respect to the meaning of the name, it may possibly be the same as
                    Agamemnon, which has a prefix meaning <hi rend="italic">brave.</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sir G. W. Cox, <hi
                    rend="italic">Mythology of the Aryans,</hi> p. 268, ed. 2.</p></note> It has
                    been thought that Mqu,vωv and <hi rend="italic">μvrjy-wv,</hi> “mindful,” are
                    but forms of the same word, and that the prophetic power attributed to the head
                    of the Egyptian Memnon, which was said to utter sounds at sunrise, is connected
                    with this idea. It was said that the sound resembled the moaning noise or the
                    sharp twang of a harp-string, and it may even be surmised that the syllables <hi
                    rend="italic">mem-non</hi> imitated the resouauce. The Egyptian head is said to
                    be a bust of King Amenophis;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Φau,evo&gt;Φ,</hi> as the Thebans
                    themselves said, according to Pausanias, cited below.</p></note> but if the
                    Greeks fancied it uttered the word <hi rend="italic">memnon,</hi> they would
                    have called it by that name. Tbe tendency, however, to give a Greek shape and
                    inflexion to words which sounded barbarous will sufficiently account for tbe
                    misnaming of the statue.</p>
                <p>Strabo, lib. xvii. p. 816, declares that he himself heard it in company with
                    Aelius Gallus and several of his friends, and Pausanias (i. 42, 2) says “one
                    would compare tbe sound most nearly to the broken chord of a harp or a lute.”
                    See also Juv., <hi rend="italic">Sat.,</hi> xv. 5; Tac., <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Memnon, as an Ethiopian, was of course represented as a black; hence Virgil (J⅛.,
                    i. 493) speaks of “nigri Memnonis arma.” The figure itself was cut out*of black
                    basalt, but that is a material not uncommon in Egypt Speaking quite generally,
                    it seems reasonable to conclude that the Memrton from Ethiopia (which the early
                    Greeks placed in the far east rather than in the south) typifies the eastern sun
                    summoned to oppose the enemies of darkness from the west.</p>
