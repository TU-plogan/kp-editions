                    Surrey. His father was a gentleman oi good family and independent fortune,—a man
                    of consider able culture both in literature and philosophy, the friend and
                    correspondent of Rousseau, and one of his executors, one. too, who showed no
                    little interest in those social problems in which his son was to be an original
                    inquirer. Young Malthus was never sent to a public school, but received his
                    education from private tutors, who were themselves mer of some distinction. In
                    1784 he was sent to Cambridge, where he was ninth wrangler, and became fellow of
                    his own college (Jesus) in 1797. The same year he received orders, and undertook
                    the charge of a small parish ir Surrey, still, however, retaining his
                    fellowship. In the following year he published the first edition of his great
                    work, <hi rend="italic">An Essay on the Principle of Population as it</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">affecti</hi><hi rend="italic">the Future Improvement of Society,
                    with remarks on tht speculations of Mr Godwin, Μ. Condorcet, and other
                    writers.</hi> The work excited a good deal of surprise as well as attention; and
                    with characteristic thoroughness and love of truth the author went abroad to
                    collect materials <hi rend="italic">for</hi> the verification and more
                    exhaustive treatment of his views. As Britain was then at war with France, only
                    the northern countries of Europe were quite open to his research at that time:
                    but during the brief peace of Amiens Malthus <pb break="no"

                    Switzerland. The result of these praiseworthy labours appeared in the greatly
                    enlarged and more mature edition of his work, which was published in 1803. In
                    1805 Malthus married happily, and not long after was appointed professor of
                    modern history and political economy in the East India Company’s College at
                    Haileybury. This situation he retained till his death in 1834. Malthus was one
                    of the most amiable; candid, and cultured of men. In all his private relations
                    he was not only without reproach, but distinguished for the beauty of his
                    character. He bore the popular abuse and misrepresentation without the slightest
                    murmur or sourness of temper. The aim of his inquiries was to promote the
                    happiness of mankind, which could be better accomplished by pointing out the
                    real possibilities of progress than by indulging in vague dreams of
                    perfectibility apart from the actual facts which condition human life.</p>
                <p>Malthus’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on Population grew</hi> out of some discussions
                    which he had with his father respecting the perfectibility of society. His
                    father shared the theories on that subject of Condorcet and Godwin; and his son
                    combated them on the ground that the realization of a happy society will always
                    be hindered by the miseries consequent on the tendency of population to increase
                    faster than the means of subsistence. His father was struck by the weight and
                    originality of his views, asked him to put them in writing, and then recommended
                    the publication of the manuscript. It was in this way the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay</hi> saw the light. Thus it will be seen that both historically and
                    philosophically the doctrine of Malthus was a corrective reaction against the
                    superficial optimism diffused by the school of Rousseau. It was the same
                    optimism, with its easy methods of regenerating society and its fatal blindness
                    to the real conditions that circumscribe human life, that was responsible for
                    the wild theories of the French Revolution and many of its consequent
                    excesses.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Principle of Population</hi> will best be
                    considered under two heads :—(1) the principle itself, with the arguments and
                    illustrations by which it is supported; and (2) remarks on its origin and its
                    applications.</p>
                <p>I. The principle itself. The idea with which Malthus starts is the improvement of
                    society. In an inquiry concerning the improvement of society there are two
                    things to be done,—(1) to investigate the causes that have hitherto impeded the
                    progress of mankind to happiness, and (2) to examine the probability of the
                    total or partial removal of these causes in future. Waiving the consideration of
                    such an immense field of thought, Malthus restricts himself to the examination
                    of one great cause intimately connected with human nature and its effects on
                    society, which, though operating since the commencement of society, has been
                    little noticed by writers. This cause is the constant tendency in all animated
                    life to increase beyond the nourishment prepared for it. Throughout both the
                    animal and vegetable kingdoms, nature has scattered the seeds of life abroad
                    with the most profuse and liberal hand. Life on this planet is so prolific that,
                    if allowed free room to develop itself, it would fill millions of worlds in the
                    course of a few thousand years. There is only one limit to the indefinite
                    increase, and that is necessity. In plants and irrational animals, which are
                    impelled by blind instinct untroubled by doubts about providing for their
                    offspring, the problem is simple; in their case increase is checked only by want
                    of room and nourishment. As regards man, whose equally powerful instinct is
                    controlled by reason, the question is more complicated. In his case, increase
                    must either be checked by preventive restraint, which too frequently produces
                    vice; or a constant check, from the difficulty of acquiring food, must be in
                    operation.</p>
                <p>That population tends to increase beyond the means of subsistence is obvious in
                    two ways,—(1) from a comparison of the natural increase of population, if left
                    to exert itself with perfect freedom, with the available increase of subsistence
                    under the most favourable conditions, and (2) from a review of the different
                    states of society in which man has existed. Under the first head, Malthus
                    considers it a safe calculation that population, when unchecked, goes on
                    doubling itself every twenty-five years. It has even been calculated that it may
                    double itself in about thirteen years; that proportion has actually occurred for
                    short periods in more countries than one. Malthus, however, contents himself
                    with the more moderate rate, namely, that population, when unchecked, doubles
                    itself every twenty-five years, or increases in a geometrical ratio. If so, how
                    is the rate of increase of the means of subsistence to be estimated? If we take
                    a limited area, no improvement in developing the resources of the soil will keep
                    pace with the unchecked increase of population. We may allow that, through the
                    great improvements of agriculture in Great Britain, the average produce of the
                    island could be doubled in the first twenty-five years; but in the next
                    twenty-five it is impossible to suppose that the produce could be quadrupled.
                    The utmost we can allow is that the produce might be increased every twenty-five
                    years by a quantity equal to what it at present yields. If we apply this
                    supposition to the whole earth, we shall assume an increase much greater than
                    any possible exertions of mankind could effect. On the whole, then, in the
                    present average state of the earth, the means of subsistence could not be made
                    to increase faster than in an arithmetical ratio. With such a disproportion
                    between the ratio of increase of population and of the means of subsistence,
                    population can be kept down to the level of the means of subsistence only by the
                    strong law of necessity operating as a check on the greater power. In fact, the
                    ultimate check to population is the want of food; but this ultimate check is
                    never the immediate check, except in cases of actual famine. The immediate check
                    consists of all those customs and all those diseases which are generated by a
                    scarcity of food, and all the causes independent of the scarcity which tend to
                    weaken and destroy the human frame. These checks are either preventive or
                    positive; and the former consist either of moral restraint or of vice, always so
                    pernicious to society. The positive checks are extremely various, including
                    everything that contributes to shorten the natural duration of human life.
                    “Under this head may be enumerated all unwholesome occupations, severe labour
                    and exposure to the seasons, extreme poverty, bad nursing of children, large
                    towns, excesses of all kinds, the whole train of common diseases and epidemics,
                    wars, plague, and famine.” The checks of all kinds may be reduced to three
                    heads—moral restraint, vice, and misery. This theoretical exposition of the
                    checks to population Malthus supports and illustrates by an exhaustive
                    examination of the checks which have operated or still operate in the various
                    countries and states of society from the brutal and revolting practices
                    prevalent among the savages of Tierra del Fuego and Australia to the moral
                    self-control of the highest nations. It is not a pleasant picture, but it is
                    merely a presentation of historical and statistical facts for which Malthus is
                    in no way responsible. Throughout his entire exposition he does not theorize,
                    but seeks only to systematize and elucidate facts which cannot be controverted,
                    belonging as they do to the history of the world. The only notable exception is
                    his attempt to express in mathematical language the possible increase of the
                    means of subsistence. The conditions determining such increase are too vague and
                    various to be calculated in such a way. On this point Malthus is not followed by
                    subsequent economists, and it is not essential to his principle. At the same
                    time, in spite of its unsoundness, it does help us to realize the disproportion
                    between the possible increase of population and the means of subsistence.</p>
                <p>II. What remains to be said of the <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Principle of
                    Population</hi> may be embraced in the following notes. (1) Origin of the
                    principle. The population question has always had a great influence on the
                    development of mankind. In the most barbarous nations the problem of preserving
                    the balance between food and population must always have been a pressing one,
                    and has led to some of their cruellest and most immoral customs. The more
                    theoretic consideration of the question has a large place in the political
                    treatises of Plato and Aristotle. Just before Malthus’s time it had been touched
                    by such writers as Benjamin Franklin <hi rend="italic">{Olser-rations concerning
                    the Increase of Mankind),</hi> Hume <hi rend="italic">{Populousness of the
                    Ancient Nations'),</hi> Wallace <hi rend="italic">{On the Numbers of Mankind in
                    Ancient and Modern Times),</hi> Townshend (<hi rend="italic">Travels in
                    Spain),</hi> not to mention many other modern writers of less recent date. (2)
                    The remedy for over-population usually proposed is emigration. No doubt there
                    are immense fertile areas yet unpeopled. But the difficulty of transferring the
                    surplus population, and especially of conveying surplus capital to these
                    regions, and of co-ordinating the two, is a point that must not be overlooked.
                    In spite of the great development of steam as a means of emigration, it remains
                    a fact that population tends to excess in many of the most important centres of
                    the world. Besides, emigration is only a postponing of the difficulty. In
                    another century even the Mississippi valley will be well stocked. (3) Relation
                    of Malthus to Darwin. In his book <hi rend="italic">Animals and Plants Under
                    Domestication,</hi> vol. i. p. 10, Darwin expressly acknowledges his
                    indebtedness to Malthus in thinking out his cardinal principle of natural
                    selection. After the study of domestic productions had given him a just idea of
                    the power of selection, he saw, ‘ ‘ on reading Malthus <hi rend="italic">On
                    Population,</hi> that natural selection was the inevitable result of the rapid
                    increase of all organic beings.” (4) Poor-law reform. The reformed poor law of
                    1834 was a real triumph of Malthus’s teaching. The effect of the old poor law
                    was to encourage population by relieving the labouring classes of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n366/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0366-0345"/> the due responsibility of supporting themselves
                    and their families. By discouraging foresight, self-control, and the spirit of
                    self-reliant independence, it demoralized the working man. The great aim of the
                    new poor law was to emphasize the duty of self-support and the responsibilities
                    of parentage. (5) Relation to modern politics. Some of the greatest difficulties
                    in contemporary politics can be correctly understood onlyin the light of the
                    principle of population. The most striking example of this is India, where,
                    under the good government of England, the old and unhappy checks to population,
                    such as war, famine, pestilence, and religious self-immolation, have been
                    removed. As there has been no proportionate improvement in agriculture, and in
                    the ethical development of the people, population has increased beyond the means
                    of subsistence, and there prevails a tendency to chronic poverty, a very low
                    standard of living, a general misery, and an unsatisfactory social <hi
                    rend="italic">morale,</hi> which correspond badly with the high European
                    civilization under which such a state of things is maintained. (6) It is only
                    due to the memory of a good man, who was a sincere lover of truth and of the
                    progress of humanity, that we should emphasize the fact that Malthus is in no
                    way responsible for the immoral theories popularly connected with his name.
                    Apart from such increase in the means of subsistence as may be attained by
                    emigration and improved agriculture, Malthus approved of only one method of
                    solving the population question, namely, moral selfrestraint. His single precept
                    is “Do not marry till you have a fair prospect of supporting a family.” The
                    greatest and highest moral result of his principle is that it clearly and
                    emphatically teaches the responsibility of parentage, and declares the sin of
                    those who bring human beings into the world for whose physical, intellectual,
                    and moral wellbeing no satisfactory provision is made.</p>
                <p>Besides his great work, Malthus wrote <hi rend="italic">Observations on the
                    Effect of the Corn Laws; An Inquiry into the Nature and Progress of Rent;
                    Principles of Political Economy</hi>; and <hi rend="italic">Definitions in

                <p>.MALTON, a parliamentary borough of Yorkshire, England, which includes Old Malton
                    and New Malton in the North Riding, and the parish of Norton in the East Riding.
                    New Malton is situated on an eminence on the right bank of the Derwent, 22 miles
                    north-east of York and 213 north of London. Old Malton lies about a mile to the
                    north-east, and a bridge across the river connects New Malton with Norton. New
                    Malton, which is a market-town, consists of several well-built streets radiating
                    from the market-place. The church of St Michael is a fine building in the Late
                    Norman style; the church of St Leonard, of mixed architecture, with square tower
                    and spire, has three Norman arches and a Norman font; the west doorway of the
                    church of St Mary at Old Malton is one of the finest specimens of Norman in
                    England. In Old Malton there is a grammar school founded in 1547, and also the
                    remains of a priory of Gilbertine canons, founded in 1150. New Malton possesses
                    a town-hall and a corn exchange. The town has some shipping trade, and also iron
                    and brass foundries, agricultural implement works, corn mills, tanneries, and
                    breweries. In the neighbourhood there are lime and whinstone quarries. The
                    population of the parliamentary borough (area 6855 acres) in 1871 was 8168, and
                    in 1881 it was 8750.</p>
                <p>Malton was a Roman station, and various Roman remains have been found in the
                    neighbourhood. The old castle, built by the De Vescis in the time of the
                    Normans, was demolished by Henry II. In the reign of Stephen the town, while
                    occupied by the Scots, was burned down by Thurston, archbishop of York, and on
                    being rebuilt it was named New Malton. The borough sent members to parliament as
                    early as the reign of Edward I., but for some years previous to 1640 the
                    privilege was in abeyance. Since 1868 only one member has been returned.</p>
