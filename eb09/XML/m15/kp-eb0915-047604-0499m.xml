                    to have been first introduced into our literature in a w ork published in 1744
                    called <hi rend="italic">A New Voyage to Guinea,</hi> by William Smith, who in
                    an account of the animals of Sierra Leone describes one “called by the white men
                    in this country Mandrill,” but adds, “why it is so called I know not.”<note

                    signify a ‘man-like ape,’ the word ‘ Drill ’ or ‘ Dril ’ having been anciently
                    employed in England to denote an Ape or Baboon. Thus in the fifth edition of
                    Blount’s ‘ <hi rend="italic">Glossographia,</hi> or a dictionary interpreting
                    the hard words of whatsoever language now used in our refined English tongue . .

                    etymology of the word given by Buffon seems hardly a probable one.”—Huxley’s <hi

                    sufficiently accurate details to show that his animal is not <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0500-0477"/> that now called Mandrill, but the Chimpanzee.
                    Buffon, however, while quoting Smith’s description, transferred the name to the
                    very different species now under consideration, and to that it has been attached
                    ever since.</p>
                <p>The Baboons generally are distinguished from other Monkeys by the comparative
                    equality of the length of their limbs, which with the structure of the vertebral
                    column adapts them rather for quadrupedal progression on the ground than for
                    climbing among the branches of trees. They are also remarkable for the great
                    size of their face and jaws as compared with the part of the skull which
                    encloses the brain. The Mandrill, in addition to these characters, is
                    distinguished by the heaviness of its body, stoutness and strength of its limbs,
                    and exceeding shortness of its tail, which is a mere stump, not 2 inches long,
                    and usually carried erect. It is, moreover, remarkable for the prominence of its
                    brow ridges, beneath which the small and closely approximated eyes are deeply
                    sunk; the immense size of the canine teeth; the great development of a pair of
                    oval bony prominences on the maxillary bones in front of the orbits, rising on
                    each side of the median line of the face, and covered by a longitudinally-ribbed
                    naked skin; and more especially for the extraordinarily vivid colouring of some
                    parts of the skin.</p>
                <p>The body generally is covered with a full soft coating of hair of a light
                    olive-brown above and silvery-grey beneath, and the chin is furnished underneath
                    with a small pointed yellow beard. The hair of the forehead and temples is
                    directed upwards so as to meet in a point on the crown, which gives the head a
                    triangular appearance. The ears are naked and of a bluish-black colour. The
                    hands and feet are naked and black. A large space around the greatly developed
                    ischial callosities, as well as the upper part of the insides of the thighs, is
                    naked and of a crimson colour, shading off on the sides to lilac or blue, which,
                    depending not upon pigment but upon injection of the superficial blood-vessels,
                    varies in intensity according to the condition of the animal—increasing under
                    excitement, fading during sickness, and disappearing after death. But it is in
                    the face that the most remarkable disposition of vivid hues occur, more
                    resembling those of a brilliantly coloured flower than what might be expected in
                    the cutaneous covering of a mammal. The cheek prominences are of an intense
                    blue, the effect of which is heightened by deeply sunk longitudinal furrows of a
                    darker tint, while the central line and termination of the nose are a bright
                    scarlet. Notwithstanding the beauty of these colours in themselves, the whole
                    combination, with the form and expression of features, quite justifies Cuvier’s
                    assertion that “il serait difficile de se figurer un être plus hideux que le
                    Mandrill.”</p>
                <p>It is only to fully adult males that this description applies. The female is of
                    much smaller size, and of more slender make; and, though the general tone of the
                    hairy parts of the body is the same, the prominences, furrows, and colouring of
                    the face are very much less marked. The young males have black faces. At the age
                    of three the blue of the cheeks begins to appear, and it is not until they are
                    about five, when they cut their great canine teeth, that they acquire the
                    characteristic red of the end of the nose.</p>
                <p>The Mandrills, especially the old males, are remarkable for the ferocity of their
                    disposition, as well as for other disagreeable qualities, which are fully
                    described in Cuvier’s account of the animal in <hi rend="italic">La
                    Ménagerie</hi><hi rend="italic">du Museum d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">IIistoire
                    Naturelle</hi> (1801), but when young they can easily be tamed. Like the rest of
                    the Baboons, they appear to be rather indiscriminate eaters, feeding upon fruit,
                    roots, reptiles, insects, scorpions, &amp;c., and inhabit open rocky ground
                    rather than forests. Not much is known of the Mandrill’s habits in the wild
                    state, nor of the exact limits of its geographical distribution. The specimens
                    brought to Europe all come from the west coast of tropical Africa, from Guinea
                    to the Gaboon.</p>
                <p>An allied species, the Drill <hi rend="italic">(Cynocephalus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">leucophseus')</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> which
                    resembles the Mandrill in size, general proportions, and shortness of tail, but
                    wants the bright colouring of the face which makes that animal so remarkable,
                    inhabits the same district. (w. <hi rend="smallcaps">h. f.)</hi></p>
