                    the province of Hesse-Nassau and district of Cassel, is very picturesquely
                    situated on the slope of a hill on the right bank of the Lahn, 50 miles to the
                    north of Frankfort-onthe-Main, and about the same distance to the south-west of
                    Cassel. On the opposite bank of the river, which is here spanned by two bridges,
                    lie the suburb of Weidenhausen and the station of the Main-Weser Railway. The
                    streets of the town proper are steep and narrow, and the general character of
                    the architecture is quaint and mediaeval. The hill on which the town lies is
                    crowned by the extensive old schloss, a fine Gothic building, the most
                    noteworthy parts of which are the rittersaal (see below), dating from 1277-1320,
                    and the beautiful little chapel. This chateau was formerly the residence of the'
                    landgraves of Hesse, afterwards served as a prison, and is now the repository of
                    the historically interesting and valuable archives of Hesse. The chief
                    architectural ornament of Marburg is, however, the Elisabethenkirche, a '
                    veritable gem of the purest Early Gothic style, erected by the grand master of
                    the Teutonic Order in 1235-83, to contain the tomb of St Elizabeth of Hungary.
                    The remains of the saint were deposited in a rich silver-gilt sarcophagus, which
                    is still extant, and were afterwards visited by myriads of pilgrims, until the
                    Protestant zeal of Landgrave Philip the Generous caused him to remove the body
                    to some unknown spot in the church. The church also contains the tombs of
                    numerous Hessian landgraves and knights of the Teutonic Order. The Lutheran
                    church is another good Gothic edifice, dating mainly from the 15th century. The
                    townhouse, built in 1512, and several fine houses in the Renaissance style, also
                    deserve mention. The university of Marburg, founded by Philip the Generous in
                    1527, was the first university established without papal privileges, and
                    speedily acquired a great reputation throughout Protestant Europe. It has a
                    library of 140.000 volumes, and is admirably equipped with medical and other
                    institutes, which form some of the finest modern buildings in the town. The
                    number of students is now about seven hundred. Marburg also possesses a
                    gymnasium, a “realschule,” an agricultural school, a society of naturalists, a
                    hospital, a poorhouse, and an extensive lunatic asylum. It is the seat of a
                    district court, and of superintendents of the Lutheran and Reformed churches.
                    Marburg pottery is renowned; and leather, iron wares, and surgical instruments
                    are also manufactured there. The population in 1880 amounted to 11,225. The
                    environs are very picturesque.</p>
                <p>Marburg is first historically mentioned in a document of the beginning of the
                    13th century, and received its municipal charter from Landgrave Louis of
                    Thuringia in 1227. On his death it became the residence of his wife, Elizabeth
                    of Hungary, who built a hospital there and died in 1231, at the age of
                    twenty-four, worn out with works of religion and charity. She was canonized soon
                    after her death. By 1247 Marburg had already become the second town of Hesse,
                    and in the 15th and 16th centuries it alternated with Cassel as the seat of the
                    landgraves. In 1529 the famous conference between Luther and Zwingli on the
                    subject of transubstantiation took place there in the rittersaal of the schloss.
                    During the Thirty Years' and Seven Years’ Wars Marburg suffered considerably
                    from sieges and famine. In 1806, and again in 1810, it was the centre of an
                    abortive rising against the French, in consequence of which the fortifications
                    of tlιe castle were destroyed.</p>
                <p>Several monographs have been published on the conference and university of
                    Marburg. A general account of the town, with references to the most important of
                    these, is given in Bücking's Wegweiser durch Marburg, 1875.</p>
