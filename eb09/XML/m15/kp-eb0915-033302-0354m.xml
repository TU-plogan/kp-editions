                    rend="smallcaps">de</hi> (1555-1628), poet, critic, and translator, was born at
                    Caen in 1555. His family was of some position, though it seems not to have been
                    able to establish to the satisfaction of heralds the claims which it made to
                    nobility older than the 16th century. The poet was the eldest son of another
                    François de Malherbe, <hi rend="italic">conseiller</hi><hi rend="italic">du
                    roi</hi> in the magistracy of Caen. He himself was elaborately educated at Caen,
                    at Paris, at Heidelberg, and at Basel. At the age of twenty-one he entered the
                    household of Henri d’Angoulême, grand prior of France, the natural son of Henry
                    II. He served this prince as secretary in Provence, and married there in 1581.
                    It seems that he wrote verses at this period, but, to judge from a quotation of
                    Tallemant des Réaux, they must have been very bad ones. His patron died when
                    Malherbe was on a visit in his native province, and for a time he had no
                    particular employment, though by some servile verses he obtained a considerable
                    gift of money from Henry III., whom he afterwards libelled. He lived partly in
                    Provence and partly in Normandy for many years after this event; but very little
                    is known of his life during this period. It was in the year parting the two
                    centuries (1600) that he presented to Marie de’ Medici the first of his
                    remarkable poems. But four or five years more passed before his fortune, which
                    had hitherto been indifferent, turned. He was presented by his countryman, the
                    cardinal Du Perron, to Henry IV.; and, though that economical prince did not at
                    first show any great eagerness to entertain the poet, he was at last summoned to
                    court and endowed after one fashion or another. His father died in 1606, and he
                    came into his inheritance. From this time forward he lived at court,
                    corresponding affectionately with bis wife, but seeing her only twice in some
                    twenty years. His old age was saddened by a great misfortune. His son, Marc
                    Antoine, a young man of promise, perished in one of the frivolous but desperate
                    duels which, common at all periods of French history, were never more frivolous
                    or more desperate than in the 16th and the early 17th centuries. Marc Antoine de
                    Malherbe fell in 1626. His father used his utmost influence to have the guilty
                    parties (for more than one were <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n355/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0355-0334"/> concerned, and there are grounds for thinking
                    that it was not a fair duel) brought to justice. But he died before the suit was
                    decided (it is said in consequence of disease caught at the camp of La Rochelle,
                    whither he had gone to petition the king), at Paris, on the 16th of October
                    1628, at the age of seventy-three.</p>
                <p>The personal character of Malherbe was far from amiable. He was an obstinate
                    solicitor of favours from the great, a morose and-bearish companion to his
                    equals, a loose liver at a time of life when loose living is especially
                    unbecoming if not especially blameable, a jealous and unfair critic; but he
                    exercised a great and enduring effect upon French literature, though by no means
                    a wholly beneficial one. The lines of Boileau beginning <hi rend="italic"
                    >Enfin</hi><hi rend="italic">Malherbe</hi><hi rend="italic">vint</hi> are
                    rendered only partially applicable by the extraordinary ignorance of older
                    French poetry which distinguished that peremptory critic. But the good as well
                    as bad side of Malherbe’s theory and practice is excellently described by his
                    cj∏temporary and superior Regnier, who was animated against him, not merely by
                    reason of his own devotion to Ronsard, but because of a brutal act of
                    discourtesy of which Malherbe had been guilty towards Regnier’s uncle Desportes.
                    These are the lines :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> ,f</hi> Cependant leur savoir ne s’étend nullement</p>
                <p>Qu’a régratter un mot douteuse au jugement,</p>
                <p>Prendre garde qu’un <hi rend="italic">qui</hi> ne heurte une diphthongue,</p>
                <p>Épier si des vers la rime est brève ou longue,</p>
                <p>Ou bien si la voyelle à l’autre s’unissant</p>
                <p>Ne rend point à l’oreille un vers trop languissant.</p>
                <p>C’est proser de la rime et rimer de la prose.”</p>
                <p>This is perfectly true, and from the time of Malherbe dates that great and
                    deplorable falling off of French poetry in its more poetic qualities, which was
                    not made good till 1830. Nevertheless the critical and restraining tendency of
                    Malherbe was not ill in place after the luxuriant importation and innovation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Pléiade</hi>; and if he had confined himself to preaching
                    greater technical perfection, instead of superciliously striking' his pen
                    through the great works of his predecessors, he would have deserved wholly well.
                    As it was his reforms helped to elaborate the kind of verse necessary for the
                    classical tragedy, and that is the most that can be said for him. His own
                    poetical work is scanty in amount, and for the most part frigid and devoid of
                    inspiration. The beautiful <hi rend="italic">Consolation</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >à</hi><hi rend="italic">Du Perrier,</hi> in which occurs the famous line—</p>
                <p>Et, rose, elle a vécu ce que vivent les roses—</p>
                <p>the odes to Marie de’ Medici and to Louis XIII., and a few other pieces comprise
                    all that is really worth remembering of him. His prose work is much more
                    abundant, not less remarkable for care as to style and expression, and of
                    greater positive value. It consists of some translations of Livy and Seneca, and
                    of a very large number of interesting and admirably written letters, many of
                    which are addressed to Peiresc, the man of science of whom Gassendi has left a
                    delightful Latin life. It contains also a most curious commentary on Desportes,
                    in which Malherbe’s minute and carping style of verbal criticism is displayed on
                    the great scale.</p>
                <p>The chief authorities for t.he biography of Malherbe are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vie de Malherbe</hi> of his friend and pupil E,acan, and the long <hi
                    rend="italic">Historiette</hi> which Tallemant des Riaux has devoted to him. The
                    standard edition is the admirable one of Μ. Ludovic Lalanne, 5 vols., Paris,
                    1862-69. Of the poems only, there is an excellent and handsome little issue in
