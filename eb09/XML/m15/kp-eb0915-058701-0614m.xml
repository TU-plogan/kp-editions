                    who had “witnessed the good confession” ip perilous times established itself
                    very early in the Christian church, and one particular manner of commemoration
                    was formally recognized by at least one ecclesiastical synod before the end of
                    the 4th century; in the 47th canon of the third synod of Carthage (397 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> it is decreed “liceat legi Passiones Martyrum quum
                    anniversarii eorum dies celebrantur.” Apart from the still extant <hi
                    rend="italic">Depositio Martyrum,</hi> contained in the work of the
                    chronographer of 354, edited in 1850 by Mommsen, the oldest “martyrologies” of
                    which anything is known are the αρχαίων μαρτυρίων συναγωγή, or collection of
                    records of past persecutions, to which Eusebius more than once alludes as having
                    been made by himself, and the treatise <hi rend="italic">On the Martyrs of
                    Palestine,</hi> by the same author, the full text of which has been preserved in
                    an ancient Syriac version edited by Cureton. Next to the general martyrology of
                    Eusebius, in chronological order, it has been usual to place the calendar of
                    saints’ days referred to in a letter, attributed to Jerome, which purports to be
                    written in answer to bishops Chromatins and Heliodorus, who had asked him to
                    search the archives of Eusebius with the view of enabling them to observe the
                    saints’ days with more regularity. This epistle is now admitted to be spurious;
                    ultimately, however, a so-called <hi rend="italic">Martyrologium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Hieronymianum</hi> came into existence, but it is not so much a
                    single martyrology as a rude patchwork derived from many ancient church
                    calendars. In its present form it is a meagre list of names and places, but may
                    be said to lie at the foundation of all subsequent Western calendars. Almost
                    contemporary with its last recension is what is known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parvum</hi><hi rend="italic">Martyrologvum</hi><hi rend="italic">Romanum,</hi>
                    found by Ado of Vienne about 850; in it many of the dates are changed, and for
                    the first time days are assigned to the chief characters of Scripture. To nearly
                    the same date must be assigned the independent compilation of Bede, which has
                    reached us, however, only as enlarged by subsequent editors. The 9th century was
                    very fertile in martyrologies, among which may be mentioned that of Florus,
                    subdeacon of Lyons (c. 830), who was the first editor of Bede, that of Hrabanus
                    Maurus, an attempted further improvement on Bede and Florus, that of Ado, an
                    enlargement of Florus, but based on the <hi rend="italic">Parvum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Martyrologium</hi><hi rend="italic">Romanum,</hi> that of Usuard
                    of Paris, the epitomizer of Ado, and that of Notker of St Gall, based on Ado and
                    Hrabanus. The <hi rend="italic">Martyrologium</hi><hi rend="italic">Romanum</hi>
                    was published by Baronius at the command of Pope Gregory XIII. in 1586; the
                    enlarged edition by Rosweyd appeared at Antwerp in 1613. The Cistercian <hi
                    rend="italic">Martyrology</hi> appeared at Rome in 1733 and 1748. The best-known
                    Greek <hi rend="italic">Menologion</hi> is that prepared in the 9th century by
                    command of the emperor Basilius Macedo; it was edited in 1727 by Cardinal
                    Hannibal Urbini. An ancient Syriac martyrology, entitled “the names of our lords
                    the martyrs and victors, with their days on which they won crowns,” written in
                    412, has been edited, with an English translation, by Professor W. Wright, in
