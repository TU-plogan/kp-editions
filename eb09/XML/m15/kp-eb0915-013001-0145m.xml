                    Willughby, <hi rend="italic">Ornithologia,</hi> p. 73 (1676); but an earlier
                    form of the word is found in the “great blew and yellow Parrat called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Macha/),</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Cockatoon</hi>” of Chari eton,
                    <hi rend="italic">Onornasticon,</hi> p. 66 (1668). Its derivation is shown by De
                    Laet, who, in his description of certain Brazilian birds <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Nows</hi><hi rend="italic">Orbis,</hi> ed. 1633, p. 556), has “inter alios

                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi> Webster, in his dictionary, says that Macaw,
                    “written also Macâo,” is “the native name in the Antilles,” but gives no
                    authority for his statement, which, considering that one West Indian island only
                    is known to possess a Macaw (and that in that island the bird is known as <hi
                    rend="italic">Guacamayo),</hi> is very unlikely. Some of the older writers,
                    Buffon <hi rend="italic">{Oiseaux,</hi> vi. p. 278) for instance, say that <hi
                    rend="italic">Makaνouanne</hi> was the name given by natives of Guiana to one
                    species of Macaw found in that country; but the Antillean origin of the name
                    cannot at present be accepted.</p></note> the name given to some fifteen or more
                    species of large, long-tailed birds of the Parrot Family, natives of the
                    Neotropical Region, and forming a very well-known and easily-recognized group to
                    which the generic designation <hi rend="italic">Ara</hi> is usually applied by
                    ornithologists, though some prefer for it <hi rend="italic">Hacrocercus</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Sittace.</hi> Most of the Macaws are remarkable for their
                    gaudy plumage, which exhibits the brightest scarlet, yellow, blue, and green in
                    varying proportion and often in violent contrast, while a white visage often
                    adds a very .peculiar and expressive character.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This serves to separate the Macaws from the
                    long-tailed Parrakeets of the New World <hi rend="italic">{Conurus),</hi> to
                    which they are very nearly alliéd.</p></note> With one exception the known
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Ara</hi> inhabit the mainland of America from
                    Paraguay to Mexico, being especially abundant in Bolivia, where no fewer than
                    seven of them (or nearly one half) have been found <hi rend="italic">(Proc.
                    Zool. Soc.,</hi> 1879, p. 634). The single extra-continental species, <hi
                    rend="italic">A. tricolor,</hi> is one of the most brilliantly coloured, and is
                    peculiar to Cuba, where, according to Dr Gundlach <hi rend="italic">{Ornitologia
                    Gubana,</hi> p. 126), its numbers are rapidly decreasing, so that there is every
                    chance of its becoming extinct.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>There is some reason to think that Jamaica may have formerly
                    possessed a Macaw (though no example is known to exist), and if so it was most
                    likely a peculiar species. Sloane <hi rend="italic">{Voyage,</hi> ii. p. 297),
                    after describing what he calls the “Great Maccaw” <hi rend="italic">{A.
                    ararauna,</hi> to be spoken of above), which he had seen in captivity in that
                    island, mentions the “Small Maccaw” as being very common in the woods there, and
                    Mr Gosse <hi rend="italic">{Birds of Jamaica,</hi> p. 260) gives, on the
                    authority of Robinson, a local naturalist of the last century, the description
                    of a bird which cannot be reconciled with any species now known, though it must
                    have evidently been allied to the Cuban <hi rend="italic">A.
                    tricolor.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>It will perhaps be enough here to dwell on the best known species of the group,
                    and first the Blue-and-yellow Macaw, <hi rend="italic">A. ararauηa,</hi> which
                    has an extensive range in South America from Guiana in the east to Colombia in
                    the west, and southwards to Paraguay. Of large size, it is a bird to be seen in
                    almost every zoological garden, and is very frequently kept alive in private
                    houses, for its temper is pretty good, and it will become strongly attached to
                    those who tend it. Its richly-coloured plumage, sufficiently indicated by its
                    common English name, has the additional recommendation of supplying feathers
                    which are eagerly sought by salmon-fishers for the making of artificial flies.
                    Next may be mentioned the Red-and-blue Macaw, <hi rend="italic">A.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">macao,</hi> which is even larger and more gorgeously clothed, for,
                    besides the colours expressed in its ordinary appellation, yellow and green
                    enter into its adornment. It inhabits Central as well as South America as far as
                    Bolivia, and is also a common bird in captivity, though perhaps less often seen
                    than the foregoing. The Red-and-yellow species, <hi rend="italic">A.
                    chloroptera,</hi> ranging from Panama to Brazil, is smaller, or at least has a
                    shorter tail, and is not quite so usually met with in menageries. The
                    Red-and-green, <hi rend="italic">A. militaris,</hi> smaller again than the last,
                    is not unfrequent in confinement, and presents the colours of the name it bears.
                    This has the most northerly extension of habitat, occurring in Mexico and thence
                    southwards to Bolivia. All the other species are comparatively rare in a
                    reclaimed condition. Four of them, <hi rend="italic">A. hyacinthina,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">A. leari,</hi><hi rend="italic">A. glauca,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">A. spixi,</hi> are almost entirely blue, while in <hi
                    rend="italic">A. mandata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nobilis</hi> the prevailing colour is green, and A. <hi rend="italic"
                    >severa</hi> is green and blue.</p>
                <p>As is the case with most Neotropical birds, very little is known of the life
                    history of Macaws in a state of nature. They are said to possess considerable
                    power of flight, rising, high in the air and travelling long distances in search
                    of their food, which consists of various kinds of fruits; but of any special
                    differences of habit we are wholly ignorant. The sexes appear in all cases to be
                    alike in colouring, and the birds, though constantly paired, are said to live in
                    companies. As with others of the Order <hi rend="italic">Psittaci,</hi> the nest
                    is made in a hollow tree, and the eggs, asserted to be two in number, are white
                    without any lustre. Of the habits of these birds in confinement it is needless
                    to speak, as they are so extremely well known. If caged, their long tailfeathers
                    are sure to suffer, but chained by the leg to a perch, Macaws seem to enjoy
                    themselves as well as any captive can, and will live for many years.</p>
                <p>In our present state of ignorance as to the best mode of classifying Parrots, it
                    would be premature to hazard any guess as to the place occupied in the Order by
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Ara.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
