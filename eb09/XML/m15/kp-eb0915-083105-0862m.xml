                <p><label type="entry">MEISSÉN</label>, an ancient and important industrial town of
                    Saxony is situated on the left bank of the Elbe, between the streams Meisse and
                    Triebisch, in the district and about 9 miles to the north-west of the town of
                    Dresden. Its irregular hilly site and numerous fine old buildings give it a
                    quaint and picturesque appearance, and most of the streets are narrow and
                    uneven. The cathedral, one of the finest Early Gothic edifices in Germany, is
                    conspicuously situated on the Schlossberg, 160 feet above the town. It is said
                    to have been originally founded by the emperor Otho I., but the present building
                    was begun in the 13th century, and completed soon after 1400. The lofty tower
                    dates from the 15th century. Within the cathedral are the tombs of several Saxon
                    princes of the 15th and 16th centuries, including those of Albert and Ernest,
                    the founders of the present reigning lines. Adjoining the cathedral stands the
                    castle, dating originally from 1473-81, but restored and named Albrechtsburg in
                    1676. Another thorough restoration was undertaken in 1863, when a series of
                    historical frescos by celebrated modern artists was begun upon its walls. An old
                    stone bridge of the 13th century connects the Schlossberg with the Afraberg,
                    which owes its name to the old convent of St Afra. The convent was suppressed by
                    Duke Maurice in 1543, and converted into the “Fürstenschule,” one of the most
                    renowned schools in Germany, counting Lessing and Gellert among its former
                    pupils. The other chief buildings are the town-house, built in 1479, and
                    restored in 1875; the fine old town church, also called the Frauenkirche or
                    Marienkirche; and the churches of St Francis. St Nicholas (coeval with the
                    town), and St Afra. Since 1710, immediately after Böttcher’s great discovery,
                    Meissen has been the seat of the manufacture of the so-called Dresden china.
                    Till 1863 the porcelain factory was in the Albrechtsburg, but in that year it
                    was transferred to a large new building in the Triebisch-thal, close to the
                    town, where about six hundred and seventy hands are now employed. Meissen also
                    contains iron foundries, manufactories of earthenware stoves and pottery, a
                    jute-mill, sugar refineries, breweries, <pb break="no"

                    carried on in the wine produced in the surrounding vineyards. The population in
                    1880 was 14,166.</p>
                <p>Meissen, one of the oldest and most interesting towns in Saxony, was founded by
                    the emperor Henry I. in 928 as an outpost against the Wends, and became the
                    capital of a margraviate, which was afterwards merged in the duchy of Saxony.
                    Its margraves were among the most powerful mediaeval princes in Germany, and
                    were the direct ancestors of the present royal house of Saxony. From 965 till
                    1581 Meissen was also the seat of an important line of bishops, who ranked as
                    princes of the empire. The town suffered greatly from the Hussites in the 15th
                    Century, and it was captured by the imperial troops in the war of the
                    Smalkaldian League, and again in the Thirty Years’ War. In 1637 it was severely
                    handled by the Swedes, and in 1745 it fell into the hands of the Prussians.</p>
