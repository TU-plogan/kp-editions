                    rend="italic">Distressed Mother.</hi> In London his choice of characters was at
                    first confined chiefly to the romantic drama, but he showed his capacity for the
                    highest tragic parts when he played Richard III. at Covent Garden in 1819, and
                    in the following year his performance of Virginius, in the new play of Sheridan
                    Knowles, assisted to give solidity to his reputation. Transferring his services
                    to Drury Lane, he gradually rose in public favour, till, on the retirement of
                    Kean and Young, he was regarded as the legitimate successor of these tragedians.
                    In 1826 he completed a successful engagement in America, and in 1828 his
                    performances met with a very flattering reception in Paris. Already he had done
                    something to encourage the creation of a modern English drama through the
                    interest awakened by his performances in <hi rend="italic">Virginius,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gaius Gracchus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">William Tell,</hi> and
                    after entering on the management of Covent Garden in 1837 he introduced, besides
                    other new plays, Bulwer’s <hi rend="italic">Lady of Lyons</hi> and. <hi
                    rend="italic">Richelieu,</hi> the principal characters of which were among his
                    most effective parts. Both, however, in his management of Coveut Garden, which
                    he resigned in 1839, and of Drury Lane, which he held from 1841 to 1843, he
                    found his designs for the elevation of the stage ’ hampered and finally
                    frustrated by the sordid aims of the proprietors and the absence of adequate
                    public support. In 1843-44 he made a prosperous tour in the United States, but
                    his last visit to that country, in 1849, was marred by a riot at the Astor Opera
                    House, New York, arising from the jealousy of the actor Forrest, and resulting
                    in the death of twenty-two persons, who were shot by the military called out to
                    quell the disturbance. Macready retired from the stage in 1851; and the
                    remainder of his life was occupied chiefly in superintending the education of
                    his family, and in schemes for the welfare of the poorer classes. He died at
                    Cheltenham 27th April 1873.</p>
                <p>Macready’s performances always displayed fine artistic perceptions developed to a
                    high degree of perfection by very comprehensive culture, and even his least
                    successful personations had the interest resulting from thorough intellectual
                    study. He belonged to the school of Kean rather than of Kemble; but, if his
                    tastes were better disciplined and in some respects more refined than those of
                    Kean, his natural temperament did not permit him to give proper effect to the
                    most characteristic features of the great tragic ]&gt;arts of Shakespeare, <hi
                    rend="italic">King Bear</hi> perhaps excepted, which in some degree afforded
                    scope for his pathos and tenderness, the qualities in which he specially
                    excelled. With the exception of a voice of good compass and capable of very
                    varied expression, Macready was not in a special degree gifted physically for
                    acting, but the defects of his face and figure cannot be said to have materially
                    influenced his success. He created a considerable number of parts, which still
                    retain their hold on the stage, and, although not by virtue of natural genius
                    worthy of a place among tragedians of the first rank, he is almost entitled, to
                    this on account of the high degree of perfection to which he had cultivated his
                    powers, and from the fact that there is no tragedian of the second rank who can
                    be named his equal. See <hi rend="italic">Macready's Reminiscences,</hi> edited
