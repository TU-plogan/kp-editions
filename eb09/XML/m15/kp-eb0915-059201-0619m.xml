                <p><label type="entry">MARY I</label>., queen of England (1516-1558), unpleasantly
                    remembered as “the Bloody Mary” on account of the religious persecutions
                    sanctioned under her reign, was a woman whose private history demands no less
                    compassion than her policy as queen (if indeed it was her own) merits the
                    condemnation of a more humane and tolerant age. She was the daughter of Henry
                    VIII. and Catherine of Aragon, born in the earlier years of their married life,
                    when as yet no cloud had darkened the prospect of Henry’s reign. Her birth
                    occurred at Greenwich on Monday the 18th February 1516, and she was baptized on
                    the following Wednesday, Cardinal Wolsey standing as her godfather. She seems to
                    have been a singularly precocious child, and is reported in July 1520, when she
                    was little more than four years of age, as entertaining some visitors by a
                    performance on the virginals. When she was little over nine she was addressed in
                    a complimentary Latin oration by commissioners sent over from Flanders on
                    commercial matters, and replied to them in the same language “with as much
                    assurance and facility as if she had been twelve years old” (Gayangos, iii. pt.
                    1, 82). Her father, against whom it cannot be said that he depreciated learning,
                    had taken care to give her an excellent education, and was proud of her
                    achievements. About the same time that she replied to the commissioners in Latin
                    he was arranging that she should learn Spanish, Italian, and French. A great
                    part, however, of the credit of her early education was undoubtedly due to her
                    mother, who not only consulted the Spanish scholar Vives upon the subject, but
                    was herself Mary’s first teacher in Latin. She was also well instructed in
                    music, and among her principal recreations as she grew up was that of playing on
                    the virginals and lute.</p>
                <p>It was a misfortune that she shared with many other high-born ladies in those
                    days that her prospects of life were made a matter of sordid bargaining from the
                    first. Political alliances to be cemented by marriages between persons who were
                    at the time mere infants—or perhaps, more shameful still, between a child and a
                    superannuated debauchee—are among the most repulsive features of the times. Mary
                    was little more than two years old when she was proposed in marriage to the
                    dauphin, son of Francis I. Three years afterwards the French alliance was broken
                    off, and she was affianced to her cousin the young emperor Charles V. by the
                    treaty of Windsor. No one, perhaps, seriously expected either of these
                    arrangements to endure; and, though we read in grave state papers of some
                    curious compliments and love tokens (really the mere counters of diplomacy)
                    professedly sent by the girl of nine to the powerful cousin whom she had never
                    seen, not many years passed away before Charles released himself from this
                    engagement and made a more convenient match. In 1526 a rearrangement was made of
                    the royal household, and it <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n620/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0620-0593"/> was thought right to give Mary an establishment
                    of her own along with a council on the borders of Wales, for the better
                    government of the Marches. For some years she accordingly kept her court at
                    Ludlow, while new arrangements were made for the disposal of her hand in
                    connexion with the latest turn in the tortuous game of diplomacy. She was now
                    proposed as a wife, not for the dauphin as before, but for his father Francis
                    I., who had just been redeemed from captivity at Madrid, and who was only too
                    glad of an alliance with England to mitigate the severe conditions imposed on
                    him by the emperor. Wolsey, however, on this occasion, only made use of the
                    princess as a bait to enhance the terms of the compact, and left Francis free in
                    the end to marry the emperor’s sister.</p>
                <p>It was during this negotiation, as Henry afterwards pretended, that the question
                    was first raised whether Henry’s own marriage with Catherine was a lawful one.
                    The bishop of Tarbes, who was one of the ambassadors sent over by Francis to ask
                    the princess in marriage, had, it was said, started an objection that she might
                    possibly be considered illegitimate on account of her mother having been once
                    the wife of her father’s brother. The statement was a mere pretence to shield
                    the king when the unpopularity of the divorce became apparent. It is not only
                    extremely improbable in itself, but is proved to be untrue by the strongest
                    evidence, for we have pretty full contemporary records of the whole negotiation.
                    On the contrary, it is quite clear that Henry, who had already for some time
                    conceived the project of a divorce, kept the matter a dead secret, and was
                    particularly anxious that the French ambassadors should not know it, while he
                    used his daughter’s hand as a bait for a new alliance. The alliance itself,
                    however, was actually concluded by a treaty dated Westminster, the 30th April
                    1527, in which it was provided, as regards the Princess Mary, that she should be
                    married either to Francis himself or to his second son Henry, duke of Orleans.
                    But the real object was only to lay the foundation of a perfect mutual
                    understanding between the two kings, which Wolsey soon after went into France to
                    confirm.</p>
                <p>During the next nine years the life of Mary, as well as that of her mother, was
                    rendered miserable by the conduct of Henry VIII. in seeking a divorce. During
                    the most of that period mother and daughter seem to have been kept apart, and,
                    though sometimes living at no great distance from each other, were strictly
                    forbidden to see each other. Of the two it may be that Queen Catherine had the
                    hardest trial; but Mary’s was scarcely less severe. Removed from court and
                    treated as a bastard, she was, on the birth of Anne Boleyn’s daughter, required
                    to give up the dignity of princess and acknowledge the illegitimacy of her own
                    birth. On her refusal her household was broken up, and she was sent to Hatfield
                    to act as lady-in-waiting to her own infant sister. Nor was even this the worst
                    of her trials; her very life was in danger from the hatred of Anne Boleyn. Her
                    health, moreover, was indifferent, and even when she was seriously ill, although
                    Henry sent his own physician Dr Buttes to attend her, he declined to let her
                    mother visit her. So also at her mother’s death in January 1536 she was
                    forbidden to take a last farewell of her. But in May following another change
                    occurred which seemed to promise some kind of relief. Anne Boleyn, the real
                    cause of all her miseries, fell under the king’s displeasure and was put to
                    death. Mary was then urged to make a humble submission to her father as the
                    means of recovering his favour, and, after a good deal of correspondence with
                    the king’s secretary Cromwell, she actually did so. The terms exacted of her
                    were bitter in the extreme, but there was no chance of making life tolerable
                    otherwise, if indeed she was permitted to live at all; and the poor friendless
                    girl, absolutely at the mercy of a father who could brook no contradiction, at
                    length subscribed an act of submission, acknowledging the king as supreme,
                    repudiating the pope’s authority, and confessing that the marriage between her
                    father and mother “was by God’s law and man’s law incestuous and unlawful.”</p>
                <p>No act, perhaps, in the whole of Henry’s reign gives us a more painful idea of
                    his revolting despotism. Mary was a high-spirited girl, and undoubtedly popular.
                    All Europe looked upon her at that time as the only legitimate child of her
                    father, but her father himself compelled her to disown the title and pass an
                    unjust stigma on her own birth and her mother’s good name. Nevertheless Henry
                    was now reconciled to her, and gave her a household in some degree suitable to
                    her rank. During the rest of the reign we hear little about her except in
                    connexion with a number of new marriage projects taken up and abandoned
                    successively, one of which, to the count palatine Philip, duke of Bavaria, was
                    specially repugnant to her in the matter of religion. Her privy purse expenses
                    for nearly the whole of this period have been published, and show that Hatfield,
                    Beaulieu or Newhall in Essex, Richmond, and Ηunsdon were among her principal
                    places of residence. Although she was still treated as of illegitimate birth, it
                    was believed that the king, having obtained from parliament the extraordinary
                    power to dispose of the crown by will, would restore her to her place in the
                    succession, and three years before his death she was so restored by statute, but
                    still under conditions to be regulated by her father’s will.</p>
                <p>Under the reign of her brother Edward VI. she was again subjected to severe
                    trials, which at one time made her seriously meditate taking flight and escaping
                    abroad. Edward himself indeed seems to have been personally not unkind to her,
                    but the religious revolution in his reign assumed proportions such as it had not
                    done before, and Mary, who had done sufficient violence to her own convictions
                    in submitting to a despotic father, was not disposed to yield an equally tame
                    obedience to authority exercised by a factious council in the name of a younger
                    brother not yet come to years of discretion. Besides, the cause of the pope was
                    naturally her own. In spite of the forced declaration formerly wrung from
                    herself, no one really regarded her as a bastard, and the full recognition of
                    her rights depended on the recognition of the pope as head of the church. Hence,
                    when Edward’s parliament passed an Act of Uniformity enjoining services in
                    English and communion in both kinds, the law appeared to her totally void of
                    authority, and she insisted on having mass in her own private chapel under the
                    old form. When ordered to desist, she appealed for protection to the emperor
                    Charles V., who, being her cousin, intervened for some time not ineffectually,
                    threatening war with England if her religious liberty was interfered with. But
                    Edward’s court was composed of factions of which the most violent eventually
                    carried the day. Lord Seymour, the admiral, was attainted of treason and
                    beheaded in 1549. His brother, the Protector Somerset, met with the same fate in
                    1552. Dudley, duke of Northumberland, then became paramount in the privy
                    council, and easily obtained the sanction of the young king to those schemes for
                    altering the succession which led immediately after his death to the usurpation
                    of Lady Jane Grey. Dudley had, in fact, overawed all the rest of the privy
                    council, and when the event occurred he took such energetic measures to give
                    effect to the scheme that Lady Jane was actually recognized as queen for some
                    days, and Mary had even to fiy from Hoddesden into Norfolk. But the country was
                    really devoted to her cause, as indeed her right in law was unquestionable, and
                    before many days she was royally received in London, and took up her abode
                    within the Tower.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0621-0594"/>
                <p>Her first acts at the beginning of her reign displayed a character very different
                    from that which she still holds in popular estimation. Her clemency towards
                    those who had taken up arms against her was altogether remarkable. She released
                    from prison Lady Jane’s father, Suffolk, and had difficulty even in signing the
                    warrant for the execution of Northumberland. Lady Jane herself she fully meant
                    to spire, and did spare till after Wyatt’s formidable insurrection. Her conduct,
                    indeed, was in every respect conciliatory and pacific, and <hi rend="subscript">
                    t</hi> so far as they depended on her personal character the prospects of the
                    new reign might have appeared altogether favourable. But unfortunately her
                    position was one of peculiar difficulty, and the policy on which she determined
                    was far from judicious. Inexperienced in the art of governing, she had no trusty
                    councillor but Gardiner; every other member of the council had been more , or
                    less implicated in the conspiracy against her. And though she valued Gardiner’s
                    advice she was naturally led to rely even more on that of her cousin, the
                    emperor, who had been her mother’s friend in adversity, and had done such
                    material service to herself in the preceding reign. Following the emperor’s
                    guidance she determined almost from the first to make his son Philip her
                    husband, though she was eleven years his senior. She was also strongly desirous
                    of restoring the old religion and wiping out the stigma of illegitimacy passed
                    upon her birth, so that she might not seem to reign by virtue of a mere
                    parliamentary settlement.</p>
                <p>Each of these different objects was attended by difficulties or objections
                    peculiar to itself; but the marriage was the most unpopular of all. A
                    restoration of the old religion threatened to deprive the new owners of abbey
                    lands of their easy and comfortable acquisitions; and it was only with an
                    express reservation of their interests that the thing was <hi rend="superscript"
                    > -</hi> actually accomplished. A declaration of her own legitimacy necessarily
                    cast a slur on that of her sister Elizabeth, and cut her off from the
                    succession. But the marriage promised to throw England into the arms of Spain
                    and place the resources of the kingdom at the command of the emperor’s son. The
                    Commons sent her a deputation to entreat that she would not marry a foreigner,
                    and when her resolution was known insurrections broke out in different parts of
                    the country. Suffolk, whose first rebellion had been pardoned, proclaimed Lady
                    Jane Grey again in Leicestershire, while young Wyatt raised the county of Kent
                    and actually besieged the queen in her own palace at Westminster. In the midst
                    of the danger Mary showed great intrepidity, and the rebellion was presently
                    quelled; after which, unhappily, she got leave to pursue her own course
                    unchecked. She married Philip, restored the old religion, and got Cardinal Pole
                    to come over and absolve the kingdom for its past disobedience to the Holy
                    See.</p>
                <p>But the misgivings of those who had disliked the Spanish match were more than
                    sufficiently justified by the course of events. Mary yielded a loyal and womanly
                    devotion to a husband who did not too greatly esteem the treasure of her person.
                    Her health, which was feeble before, was bad for the remainder of her days, and
                    she fell under a delusion at first that it was owing to an approaching
                    confinement. Disappointment and vexation probably added to her helplessness. The
                    resources of the kingdom were at Philip’s command, and he even took ships of the
                    English fleet to escort his father the emperor, on his abdication, to Spain.
                    More extraordinary still, he ultimately succeeded in committing England to a war
                    against France, when France had made an alliance with the pope against him as
                    king of Spain; so the very marriage which was to confirm England in the old
                    religion led to a war agrinst the occupant of the see of Rome. And it was this
                    war with France which produced the final calamity of the loss of Calais which
                    sank so deeply into Mary’s heart some months before she died.</p>
                <p>The cruel persecution of the Protestants, which has cast so much infamy upon her
                    reign, began about six months after her marriage; and it is not difficult to see
                    that it was greatly due to the triumph of ideas imported from the land of the
                    Inquisition. Rogers, the first of the martyrs, was burnt on the 4th February
                    1555. Hooper, bishop of Gloucester, had been condemned six days before, and
                    suffered the same fate upon the 9th. From this time the persecution went on
                    uninterrupted for more than three years, numbering among its victims Ridley,
                    Latimer, and Cranmer. It seems to have been most severe in the eastern and
                    southern parts of England, and the largest number of sufferers was naturally in
                    the diocese of Bonner, bishop of London. From first to last nearly three hundred
                    victims are computed to have perished at the stake; and their fate certainly
                    created a revulsion against Rome that nothing else was likely to have effected.
                    How far Mary herself— who during the most part of this time, if not the whole
                    time, was living in the strictest seclusion, sick in body and mind, hysterical
                    and helpless—was personally answerable for these things^ it is difficult to say.
                    To her, no doubt, the propagators of heresy were the enemies of mankind, and she
                    had little cause to love them from her own experience. Yet perhaps she hardly
                    realized the full horror of what was done under her sanction. But there can be
                    little doubt what effect it had upon the people; and when Mary breathed her
