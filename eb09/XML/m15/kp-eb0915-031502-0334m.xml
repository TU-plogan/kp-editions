                    500,231. The rise from the sea is rapid, and the average elevation of the
                    province is considerable. Of the numerous sierras may be mentioned that of
                    Alhama, separating the province from Granada, and atone point rising above 7000
                    feet; its westward continuation in the Sierra de Abdalajis and the Axarquia
                    between Antequera and Malaga; and not far from the Cadiz boundary the Sierras de
                    Ronda, do Mijas, de Tolox, and Bermeja, converging and culminating in a summit
                    of nearly 6500 feet. The principal river is the Guadalhorce, which rises in the
                    Sierra de Alhama, and after a westerly course past the vicinity of Antequera,
                    bends southward through the wild defile of Penarrubia and the beautiful vega or
                    vale of Malaga, falling into the sea near that city. The only other considerable
                    stream is the Guadiaro, which has the greater part of its course within the
                    province, and flows past Ronda. The mountains are rich in minerals,—lead,
                    nickel, and (in the neighbourhood of Marbella) iron being obtained or obtainable
                    in large quantities. There are much frequented warm springs of sulphuretted
                    hydrogen at the baths of Carratraca. Though the methods of agriculture are for
                    the most part rude, the yield of wheat in good seasons is considerably in excess
                    of the local demand; and large quantities of grapes and raisins, oranges and
                    lemons, figs and almonds, are annually exported. The oil and wines of Malaga are
                    also highly esteemed; and in recent years, especially since the phylloxera
                    invasion, the growth of the sugarcane has developed into a considerable
                    industry. In 1880 the total production of wine within the province was estimated
                    at about 5,250,000 gallons; of this amount about 1,575,000 gallons were exported
                    (1,000,000 gallons to Great Britain and the continent of Europe, and the
                    remainder chiefly to South America and the Spanish colonies). In 1879 about
                    1,400,000 gallons of olive oil were exported, chiefly to the Baltic. The sugar
                    produced in 1880 was calculated to amount to about 5650 tons. The internal
                    communications of the province are in many parts, owing to the broken nature of
                    the surface, very defective; it is traversed, however, from north to south by
                    the Cordova-Malaga Railway, which sends off a branch, recently made continuous,
                    from Bobadilla to Granada. The only towns with a population exceeding 10,000 are
                    Malaga (the capital), Antequera, Ronda, and Velez Malaga.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Malaga,</hi> the capital of the above province, and, next to
                    Barcelona, the most important seaport of Spain, is finely situated on the
                    Mediterranean coast, at the southern base of the group of hills known to history
                    as the Axarquia, and at the eastern extremity of the fertile vega of Malaga (36°
                    43' N. lat., 4° 25' W. long.). The population in 1877 was 115,882. In the
                    clearness of its sky, which a cloud rarely obscures, and the beautiful sweep of
                    its bay, Malaga has sometimes been compared to Naples. The climate is one of the
                    mildest and most equable in Europe, the mean annual temperature being 66 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o-</hi> 7 Fahr. (55°'6 in winter, 80 <hi rend="superscript">
                    o,</hi> 4 in summer); the yearly average of rainy days is thirty-nine, and the
                    rainfall is slightly under 16 inches. The town lies principally on the left bank
                    of a mountain torrent, the Guadalmedina (“river of the city”); the streets near
                    the sea are spacious and comparatively modern, but those in the older part of
                    the town, where the buildings are huddled around the ancient citadel, are
                    narrow, winding, and often dilapidated. There are various squares or plazas and
                    public promenades: of the former the most important are the Plaza de Riego</p>
                <p>(containing the monument to General Torrijos, who, along with forty-eight others,
                    was executed in Malaga in 1831) and the Plaza de la Constitucion; adjoining the
                    quay is the fine Paseo de la Alameda. The town has no public buildings of
                    commanding importance architecturally or historically. The cathedral, on the
                    site of the ancient mosque, was begun about 1528, in the .Graeco-Roman style;
                    after the works had been once and again interrupted and resumed, it was
                    completed to its present state in the 18th century, and is in consequence an
                    obtrusive record of the degeneration of Spanish architecture. The woodwork of
                    the choir, however, is worthy of attention. The church of El Cristo de la
                    Victoria contains some relics of thé siege by the “Catholic kings.” Of the old
                    Moorish “Atarazanas” or arsenal only a single horse-shoe gateway now remains,
                    the rest of the site being chiefly occupied by an iron structure used as a meat
                    and provision market; the “Alcazaba” or citadel has entirely disappeared. The
                    castle of Gibralfaro, on a bold eminence to the north-east, dating from the 13th
                    century, is still in fairly good preservation. The harbour, which in the
                    beginning of the present century was deep enough to float a line-of-battle ship,
                    has in recent years been permitted to silt up, so that it is not now safe for
                    vessels drawing more than 18 feet to enter. These are consequently obliged to
                    lie in the roads outside, and receive and discharge cargo by means of lighters.
                    New harbour works were begun in 1880, but from time to time have been suspended,
                    and only some 280 yards of the new eastern mole (about onefourth of the intended
                    length) have been constructed in October 1882. The trade of the port is chiefly
                    in the products of the province,—lead, wine, raisins, oranges, lemons, figs, and
                    esparto being the staples. The most active period is from the middle of August
                    to the end of October. In 1880 the total quantity of muscatel raisins exported
                    was estimated at 1,864,000 boxes (of 25 ft each), 35,500 frails (of 25 ft), and
                    15,000 barrels (of 50 ft); of this amount more than half was sent to the United
                    States of America, and the remainder to other countries (chiefly Great Britain,
                    France, and Germany). In the same year 50,000 boxes of lemons and 21,500 boxes
                    of oranges were shipped, besides 20,000 barrels of muscatel grapes. The wine
                    exported in 1879 was only 1,400,000 gallons as against 3,108,000 in 1878; the
                    lead 310,251 cwts. as against 481,021. cwts. in 1878. The olive oil is sent
                    chiefly to the Baltic. The principal imports are coal (41,822 tons in 1878),
                    codfish, timber, pig-iron, hardware, machinery, and rails.</p>

                    The place seems to have been of some importance even during the Carthaginian
                    period; under the Romans it became a municipium, and under the Visigoths an
                    episcopal see. After the battle of Guadalete it passed into the possession of
                    the Arabs, and soon came to be regarded as one of the most important cities of
                    Andalucia. It was attached to the caliphate of Cordoba, but on the fall of the
                    Omayyad dynasty it became for a short time the capital of an independent
                    kingdom; afterwards it was dependent on Granada. In 1487 it was taken and
                    treated with great harshness by Ferdinand and Isabella after a protracted siege.
                    In 1810 it suffered much from the French general Sebastiani.</p>
