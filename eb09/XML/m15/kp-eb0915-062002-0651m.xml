                    act of personal service—f.&lt;∕., the engagement of a messenger for a single
                    occasion—generally make the one master and the other servant. It was held,
                    however, in relation to the offence of embezzlement, that a drover employed on
                    one occasion to drive cattle home from market was a servant within the statute.
                    (See article <hi rend="smallcaps">Embezzlement</hi> for definition of “clerk” or
                    “servant” in that connexion.) On the other hand, there are many decisions
                    limiting the meaning of “servants” under wills giving legacies to the class of
                    servants generally. Thus “a person who was not obliged to give his whole time to
                    the master, but was yet in some sense a servant,” was held not entitled to share
                    in a legacy to the servants. These cases are, however, interpretations of wills
                    where the intention obviously is to benefit domestic servants only. And so in
                    other connexions questions may arise as to the exact nature of the relations
                    between the parties—whether they are master and servant, or principal and agent,
                    or landlord and tenant, or partners, Ac.</p>
                <p>The terms of the contract of service are for the most part such as the parties
                    choose to make them, but in the absence of express stipulations terms will be
                    implied by the law. Thus, “where no time is limited either expressly or by
                    implication for the duration of a contract of hiring and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n652/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0652-0621"/> service, the hiring is considered as a general
                    hiring, and in point of law a hiring fora year.” But “in the case of domestic
                    and menial servants there is a well-known rule, founded solely on custom, that
                    their contract of service may be determined at any time by giving a month’s
                    warning or paying a month’s wages, but a domestic or other yearly servant, <hi
                    rend="italic">wrongfully</hi> quitting his master’s service, forfeits all claim
                    to wages for that part of the current year during which he has served, and
                    cannot claim the sum to which his wages would have amounted had he kept his
                    contract, merely deducting therefrom one month’s wages. Domestic servants have a
                    right by custom to leave their situations at any time on payment of a calendar
                    month’s wages in advance, just as a master may discharge them in a similar
                    manner” (Manley Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Law of Master and Servant,</hi> chaps,
                    ii. and iii.). The master’s rightto chastise a servant for dereliction of duty
                    (which appears to be still recognized in some American cases) is no longer
                    sustained in English law, unless perhaps in the case of servants under age, to
                    whom the master stands <hi rend="italic">in loco parentis.</hi></p>
                <p>The following are assigned by Manley Smith as in general sufficient grounds for
                    discharging a servant:—(1) wilful disobedience of any lawful order; (2) gross
                    moral misconduct; (3) habitual negligence; (4) incompetence or permanent
                    disability caused by illness.</p>
                <p>A master has a right of action against any person who deprives him of the
                    services of his servant, by enticing him away, harbouring or detaining him after
                    notice, confining or disabling him, or by seducing his female servant. Indeed
                    the ordinary and only available action for seduction in English law is in form a
                    claim by a parent for the loss of his daughter’s services.</p>
                <p>The death of either master or servant in general puts an end to the contract. A
                    servant wrongfully discharged may either treat the contract as rescinded and sue
                    for services actually rendered, or he may bring a special action for damages for
                    the breach. A master is bound to provide food (but apparently not medical
                    attendance) for a servant living under his roof, and wilful breach of duty in
                    that respect is a misdemeanour under <hi rend="italic">24</hi> &amp; 25 Vict. c.
                    100.</p>
                <p>A servant has no right to demand “a character” from an employer, and if a
                    character be given it will be deemed a privileged communication, so that the
                    master will not be liable thereon to the servant unless it be false and
                    malicious. A master by knowingly giving a false character of a servant to an
                    intending employer may render himself liable—should the servant for example rob
                    or injure his new master.</p>
                <p>For penalties incurred by personating masters and giving false certificates of
                    character, or by persons offering themselves as servants with false or forged
                    certificates, see 32 Geo. III. c. 56.</p>
                <p>Reference may be made to the article on <hi rend="smallcaps">Labour and Labour
                    Laws</hi> for the cases in which special termshave been introduced into
                    contracts of service by statute <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> Truck Act), and
                    for the recent legislation on the subject generally, including the Employers’
                    Liability Act, 1880.</p>
                <p>The master’s liability on the contracts of his servant depends on altogether
                    different principles from those on which his liability for negligence has been
                    justified. It is substantially a case of liability as principal for the acts of
                    an agent. The main question in all cases is whether the alleged agent had
                    authority to make a contract for his principal, and in the relation of master
                    and servant there may be any variety of circumstances giving rise to that
                    presumption. Here the rights of third persons have to be considered, and the
                    master will be held liable to them wherever he has ‘ ‘ by words, conduct, or
                    demeanour held out his servant as a general agent, whether in all kinds of
                    business or in transacting business of a particular kind,”—even if the servant
                    should act contrary to express orders. F or example, a horse-dealer sending his
                    servant to market with a horse to sell will be liable on the servant’s warranty,
                    although he has been positively ordered not to warrant; whereas an owner sending
                    a stranger to sell would not be liable on a warranty given contrary to express
                    directions.</p>
