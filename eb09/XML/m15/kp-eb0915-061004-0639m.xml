                    elected a fellow of Pembroke College. Mason was Gray’s attached friend, admirer,
                    and poetical pupil to the end of the greater poet’s life. More fancy than
                    judgment, and indolence in reading, were the chief faults that Gray found in his
                    young friend. With his usual penetration, Gray discerned the defects of
                    intellect that lie at the root of the weakness of Mason’s poetry. He was
                    painstaking enough and more than enough with his verses, his epithets, bis
                    phrases, his figures of speech, his rhymes; but be was deficient in energy of
                    thought, his intellectual grasp was feeble, and he accepted and polished the
                    easy suggestions of fancy instead of exerting himself to find exact expression
                    for his subject. For a modest youth, as Gray describes him, he formed a great
                    ambition, nothing less than the reconciliation of the modern with the ancient
                    drama, to be effected by the strict observance of the unities and the
                    restoration of the chorus. His <hi rend="italic">Elfrida,</hi> a tragedy
                    published in 1752 in pursuance of this ambition, is constructed elaborately upon
                    deeply considered principles, but the principles are drawn from pedantic books
                    and not from the dramatic needs of men, as may be judged from the dramatist’s
                    opinion that Shakespeare, “in compliance merely with the taste of the time,
                    showed a disregard of all the necessary rules of the drama.” <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elfrida</hi> is highly “incorrect” in two respects—one venial in a play, the
                    other fatal; it abounds in anachronistic allusions and moral improbabilities.
                    Mason’s second attempt, <hi rend="italic">Caractacus</hi> (published in 1759),
                    is much stronger in construction and situation, but he did not possess the rare
                    art of making his characters speak out of their own thoughts; they only speak as
                    Mason the poet might have done in their circumstances if his fancy had been
                    quite cool. Both <hi rend="italic">Elfrida</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caractacus</hi> were acted in 1776, when Mason had made a considerable
                    reputation by his <hi rend="italic">English Garden</hi> (a poem in blank verse,
                    first book published in 1772), his <hi rend="italic">Heroic Epistle to Sir IΓ.
                    Chambers</hi> in 1773, and his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Gray</hi> in 1775.
                    The plays were not successful; Mason did not expect success; his plays were
                    intended to be read as poems. The manager perhaps had hopes from the novelty of
                    the choruses of Saxon maidens and Druids. The second book of the <hi
                    rend="italic">English Garden</hi> was issued in 1777, the third in 1779, the
                    fourth in 1782. Mason took orders in 1754, and soon afterwards was presented to
                    the vicarage of Ashton in Yorkshire, the canonry of York, the prebend of
                    Driffield, and the precentorship of York cathedral. Ashton was his residence
                    till his death in 1797.</p>
