                    (1796-1852), a writer on several branches of natural science, but best known as
                    an ornithologist, was born in 1796. He studied as an arts student in King’s
                    College, Aberdeen, graduating M.A. in 1815, and also studied medicine, but did
                    not complete the latter course. In 1823 he became assistant to the professor of
                    natural history in Edinburgh University; and in 1831 he was appointed curator of
                    the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh. In 1841 he became
                    professor of natural history and lecturer on botany in Marischal College,
                    Aberdeen. He died in 1852. He possessed a wide and comprehensive knowledge of
                    natural science in its various departments, gained no less from personal
                    observations in the course of frequent excursions through different parts of
                    Scotland than from a study of the collections under his charge in Edinburgh and
                    of books. His industry and extensive knowledge are amply shown in his published
                    works. He contributed numerous articles on the zoology, botany, and geology of
                    Scotland to the scientific journals <pb break="no"

                <p>His larger works are numerous, and include biographies (of Humboldt, and of
                    zoologists from Aristotle to Linnaeus), <hi rend="italic">Text-books of Botany,

                    vols., 1837-52, The last work holds a high rank from the excellent descriptions
                    of the structure, habits, and haunts of birds, and from the use in
                    classification of characters afforded by their internal organs. In 1850 he spent
                    some time in the Highlands of Aberdeenshire. The results are embodied in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Natural History of Deeside,</hi> published after his death by
                    command of the queen.</p>
                <p>He made considerable collections, alike for the instruction of his students and
                    to illustrate the zoology, botany, and geology of the parts of Scotland examined
                    by him, especially around Aberdeen. His success in enlisting the interest and
                    co-operation of his students is shown by the assistance acknowledged by him in
                    his work on the mollusca of that district. His devotion to his favourite
                    sciences made him apt to be careless of risk to health, and seems to have led to
                    the illness that proved fatal. Though his reputation rests chiefly on his works
                    on birds and on mollusca, his other writings are also of interest and value. In
                    some respects he was in advance of most of his contemporaries, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> in the opinions in regard to species published in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Text-book of Botany</hi> (pp. 210, 211) in 1840.</p>
                <p>His reputation might have been greater as a specialist had he restricted his
                    investigations within narrower limits, but this he was prevented from doing as
                    much by the wide range of subjects that he had to teach as by his natural
                    inclination. He had to encounter great difficulties in ascertaining what had
                    been already accomplished by naturalists elsewhere from the want of a good
                    library and of named collections for reference. To this fact may be traced a
                    tendency to regard as undescribed and to name whatever animals he was unable to
                    identify from books within his reach, as well as occasional apparent neglect of
                    work done by others and some peculiar views on nomenclature and
                    classification.</p>
                <p>Throughout his life pecuniary difficulties, in part arising from the publication
                    of his books, pressed on him; and to this it was probably due, at least in part,
                    that, despite an amiable nature, he at times expressed himself in controversy in
                    a way that made him keen opponents. His books show that from all troubles he
                    found relief in tracing the proofs of wisdom and of goodness in nature.
                    Throughout his was a laborious life, and just before his death he completed his
                    <hi rend="italic">History of British Birds,</hi> an enduring and worthy memorial
                    of an earnest and true-hearted naturalist.</p>
                <p>His family inherited a taste for similar pursuits. One son, John, contributed
                    several articles to magazines on the natural history of Scotland, and published
                    an account of the voyage round the world of H.M.S. “Rattlesnake,” on board which
                    he was naturalist. Another son, Paul, published <hi rend="italic">Aberdeen
                    Flora</hi> in 1853.</p>
