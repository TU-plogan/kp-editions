                <p>The legend of the Argonautic expedition is a very ancient one. It is alluded to
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> (xii. 70), in more than one passage of
                    Aescliylus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>He alludes
                    to Phineus and the <hi rend="italic">Lemnia facinora {Eum.</hi> 50; <hi

                    subjects.</p></note> and is given at some length in the fourth Pythian ode of
                    Pindar, the close agreement of which with the Alexandrine compilation by
                    Apollonius Rhodius, entitled <hi rend="italic">Argonautica,</hi> in four books,
                    shows that, according to the general law of mythology, the main features of the
                    legend differed but little. The original story, it is probable, was contained in
                    a still older epic poem called <hi rend="italic">r</hi> ∣ Mιvυας <hi
                    rend="italic">τroiησιs,</hi> the authorship of vhich was ascribed to Prodicus of

                    prepared for her rival Glance, the new bride, with the Homeric “aegis,” and with
                    the garment smeared with phosphorus which was sent by Deianira to Hercules, and
                    burst into a flame when brought near to a sacrificial fire.<note anchored="true"

                    fleece, King Aeetes, to approach it till he had performed a certain task in
                    putting to the yoke fire-breathing bulls, which he effected by the aid of Medea.
                    The bιdl is a well-known symbol of the sun, and it occurs in the bull-slaying
                    group representing the Persian sun-god Mithras. Again, the slaying of a father
                    by a son (the old sun killed by the new one) is seen alike in Oedipus having
                    caused the death of his father Laius, in Aeson, the father of Jason, having been
                    restored to life by the magic arts of Medea, and in Pelias having been killed
                    and boiled in a caldron by his own daughters at the instigation of the
                    sorceress. Lastly, the legend that Medea was herself the granddaughter of the
                    Sun, and that she escaped in a car drawn by flying dragons, given to her for
                    safety by her grandsire,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    solar origin, and can be explained on that theory alone.</p>
                <p>This, indeed, has been well stated by Sir G. W. Cox,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Mythology and
                    Folklore,</hi> p. 264; see also <hi rend="italic">Mythology of the Aryan
                    Nations,</hi> pp. 240, 384, 388.</p></note> The “dragon chariot is simply the
                    chariot of Indra, Helios, and Achilles; and it is drawn by dragons because the
                    word denoted simply beings of keen sight, and was naturally applied to the
                    creatures which may be supposed to bear the sun across the heaven.”</p>
                <p>In all these legends about the sun the performance of certain imposed “toils” or
                    labours is included, the idea expressed being the hard necessity of the sun
                    going his daily course in the appointed time in spite of thickening storm-clouds
                    and opposing powers of darkness, through which he has to fight his way, both
                    visibly above and invisibly underneath the earth. Thus Hercules has his twelve
                    labours (the number corresponding to the lunar months), while Jason is not only
                    required by his uncle King Pelias to bring the golden fleece, but is commanded
                    by Aeetes to tame the bulls as a condition of obtaining it. The name Mτ)δ∈ια may

                <p>The existing literature on the love of Medea for Jason shows how popular was the
                    story in antiquity for its pathos and its sentimentality. Thus the <hi

                    and Melanthius<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ar., <hi

                    the long and fine Pythian ode of Pindar, already referred to, the touching
                    epistle “Medea Jasoni” in <hi rend="italic">the Meroides of</hi> Ovid, and the
                    interesting, beautiful, and too little read <hi rend="italic">Argonautica</hi>

                <p>Of course, the similarity of the names Mi)δoι and Mηδ∈ια led to etymological
                    speculations on the identity of the nomenclature, and one Medus, a son of Medea,
