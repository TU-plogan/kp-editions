                    And Abram gave him tithes of all his booty (Gen. xiv. 18-20). The Bible history
                    tells us nothing more about Melchizedek (comp. Hebrews vii. 3); but the majestic
                    figure of the king-priest, prior to the priesthood of the law, to whom even the
                    father of all Israel paid tithes, suggested a figurative or typical application,
                    first in Psalm ex. to the vicegerent of Jehovah, seated on the throne of Zion,
                    the king of Israel who is also priest after the order of Melchizedek, and then,
                    after the gospel had confirmed the Messianic interpretation of the Psalm (Matt,
                    xxii. 42 sy.), to the kingly priesthood of Jesus, as that idea is worked out at
                    length in the Epistle to the Hebrews.</p>
                <p>The theological interest which attaches to the idea of the pre-Aaronic
                    king-priest in these typical applications is practically independent of the
                    historical questions suggested by the narrative of Gen. xiv. It is generally
                    recognized that this chapter holds quite an isolated place in the Pentateuchal
                    history; it is the only passage which presents Abraham in the character of a
                    warrior, and connects him with historical names and political movements, and
                    there are no clear marks by which it can be assigned to any one of the documents
                    of which Genesis is made up. Thus, while one school of interpreters finds in the
                    chapter the earliest fragment of the political history of western Asia, some
                    even holding with Ewald that the narrative is probably based on old Canaanite
                    records, other critics, as Nqldeke, regard the whole as unhistorical and
                    comparatively late in origin. On the latter view, which finds its main support
                    in the intrinsic difficulties of the narrative, it is scarcely possible to avoid
                    the conclusion that the chapter is one of the latest additions to the Pentateuch
                    (Wellhausen). The historical arguments <hi rend="italic">pro</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">con</hi> may be seen at length in recent commentaries, but
                    especially in Tuch’s essay (Z. <hi rend="italic">D. Μ. G.,</hi> i. 161 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.,</hi> reprinted in the second edition of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Genesis),</hi> which was long viewed as decisive in favour of the narrative,
                    and in Nöldeke’s <hi rend="italic">Untersuchungen,</hi> 1869, p. 156 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.,</hi> with which compare Wellhausen in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jahrb. f. D. Th.,</hi> 1876, p. 414 <hi rend="italic">sq</hi> The Assyrian
                    monuments offer no decisive evidence, but are held to confirm the historical
                    possibility of the proper names (Schrader, <hi rend="italic">Kl. und</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">AT.,</hi> p. 46 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>; Delitzsch, <hi
                    rend="italic">Paradies,</hi> p. 224). Here we can only speak of the episode of
                    Melchizedek, which, though connected with the main narrative by the epithets
                    given to Jehovah in verse 22, seems to break the natural connexion of verses 17
                    and 21, and may perhaps have come originally from a separate source. As the
                    narrative now stands Salem must be sought in the vicinity of “the king’s dale,”
                    which from 1 Sam. xviii. 18 probably but not necessarily lay near Jerusalem.
                    That Salem is Jerusalem, as in Psalm lxxvi. 2, is the ancient and common view,
                    and is necessarily followed by those who view Melchizedek as a late creation.
                    Those who hold the opposite view now lean to the identification with the ∑αλ∈iμ
                    of John iii. 23, 8 miles south of Bethshean, which Jerome <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Ep.</hi> lxxiii. <hi rend="italic">ad Evangelium)</hi> confirms by a worthless
                    tradition. In a genuine record of extreme antiquity the union of king and priest
                    in one person, the worship of El as the supreme deity by a Canaanite,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On the other hand it is not
                    correct to appeal to the <hi rend="italic">Poenulus</hi> of Plautus for the
                    epithet elyôn.</p></note> and the widespread practice of the consecration of a
                    tithe of booty can present no difficulty; but, if the historical character of
                    the narrative is denied, the origin of the conception must be placed as late as
                    the rise of the temporal authority of the high priests after the exile. An
                    ancient legend identifies Melchizedek with Shem (Palestinian Targum, Jerome on
                    Isa. xli., Ephraem Syrus <hi rend="italic">in loco).</hi></p>
