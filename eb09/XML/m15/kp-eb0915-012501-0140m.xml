                    >maccare,</hi> “to bruise or crush ”) is a preparation of wheat originally
                    peculiar to Italy, in which country it is an article of food of national
                    importance. The same substance in different forms is also known as vermicelli,
                    pasta or Italian pastes, taglioni, fanti, &amp;c. These substances are prepared
                    from the hard semi-translucent varieties of wheat which are largely cultivated
                    in the south of Europe, Algeria, and other warm regions, and which are
                    distinguished by the Italians as <hi rend="italic">grano duro</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">grano</hi><hi rend="italic">da semolino.</hi> Hard wheats are much
                    richer in gluten and other nitrogenous compounds than the soft or tender wheats,
                    and their preparations are more easily preserved, to which conditions their
                    suitability for the manufacture of Italian pastes are mainly due. The various
                    preparations are met with in the form of fine thin threads which constitute
                    vermicelli, so called from its thread-worm like appearance, thin sticks and
                    pipes (macaroni), small lozenges, stars, disks, ellipses, &amp;c. (pastes), and
                    ribbons, tubes, and other fanciful forms. These various forms are prepared in a
                    uniform manner from a granular meal of hard wheat which itself, under the name
                    of semolina or semola, is a commercial article. The semolina is thoroughly mixed
                    and incorporated into a stiff paste or dough with boiling water, and in the hot
                    condition it is placed in a strong metallic cylinder, the end of which is closed
                    with a thick disk pierced with openings which correspond with the diameter or
                    section of the article to be made. Into this cylinder an accurately fitting
                    plunger or piston is introduced, and by very powerful pressure it causes the
                    stiff dough to squeeze out through the openings in the disk in continuous
                    threads, sticks, or pipes, as the case may be. When pipe or tube macaroni is
                    being made, the openings in the disk are widened internally, and mandrels, the
                    gauge of the tubes to be made, are centred in them. In making pastes the
                    cylinder is laid horizontally, the end is closed with a disk pierced with holes
                    having the sectional form of the pastes, and a set of knives revolves close
                    against the external surface of the disk, cutting off the paste in thin sections
                    as it exudes from each opening. Macaroni is dried rapidly by hanging it in long
                    sticks or tubes over wooden rods in stoves or heated apartments through which
                    currents of air are driven. It is only genuine macaroni, rich in gluten, which
                    can be dried in this manner; spurious fabrications made with common flour and
                    coloured to imitate the true material will not bear their own weight. Imitations
                    must therefore be laid out flat and dried slowly, during which they very readily
                    split and break up, while in other cases they become mouldy on the inside of the
                    tubes. True macaroni can be distinguished by observing the flattened mark of the
                    rod over which it has been dried within the bend of the tubes; it has a soft
                    yellowish colour, is rough in texture, elastic, and hard, and breaks with a
                    smooth glassy fracture. In boiling it swells up to double its original size
                    without becoming pasty or adhesive, maintaining always its original tubular form
                    without either rupture or collapse. It can be kept any length of time without
                    alteration or deterioration, and it is on that account, in many circumstances, a
                    most convenient as well as a highly nutritious and healthful article of food. In
                    its various forms it is principally used as an ingredient in soups, and for the
                    preparation of puddings, with cheese, &lt;fcc. Many of the good qualities of
                    genuine macaroni may be obtained by enriching the flour of common soft wheat
                    with gluten obtained in the preparation of wheaten starch, and proceeding as in
                    the case of semolina. Such imitations, and others of inferior quality, are
                    extensively made both in France and Germany.</p>
