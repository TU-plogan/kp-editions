                    very limited application, such as “mills” for boring cannon, or “engines” for
                    cutting the teeth of clock wheels, were almost their only representatives.
                    Machine tools of the modern type indeed would not then have been likely to have
                    found much favour even if they had been invented, owing to the difficulty of
                    providing sufficient power for driving them, except in the comparatively few
                    positions where water-power was available. The transmission of power was
                    unthought of, except for the very limited distances which were possible with the
                    ill-fitted “gudgeons” and “lanterns and trundles” of the old millwrights.</p>
                <p>The steam-engine, however, changed all this. On the one hand the hitherto
                    unheard-of accuracy of fit required by its working parts created a demand for
                    tools of increased power and precision, and on the other it rendered the use of
                    such tools possible in almost any situation. Thus, acting and reacting on each
                    other, machine tools and steam-engines have grown side by side, till our
                    workshops have become peopled with a race of giants, capable of uncomplainingly
                    performing tasks altogether beyond the powers of the easily wearied hands which
                    have brought them into existence. But the first steps in the process were costly
                    and difficult to a degree which it is not now easy to realize. James Watt, for
                    instance, in 1769, was fain to be content with a cylinder for his “fire-engine”
                    of which, though it was but 18 inches in the bore, the diameter in one place
                    exceeded that at another by about -∣ (’ 375) of an inch; its piston was not
                    unnaturally leaky, though he packed it with “paper, cork, putty, pasteboard, and
                    old hat.” In the bore of a cylinder of 120 inches there would not now be
                    admitted an error of <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi>
                    of an inch, and the leakage past the piston is practically <hi rend="italic"
                    >nil.</hi> Even this must by no means be taken to represent the extreme limit
                    attainable in respect of size and accuracy.</p>
                <p>Machine tools present so many points of difference that no classification of them
                    will be attempted beyond a broad division into general and special tools,—those
                    included under the latter head being such as are intended to perform repeatedly
                    one single operation (or one of a small number of varieties of that operation),
                    or are mainly employed in particular processes or manufactures.</p>
                <p>As an instance of special tools working successively in a series,—which is a
                    frequent arrangement with special tools,—the <hi rend="italic">block
                    machinery,</hi> for making ships’ blocks at Portsmouth dockyard, may be
                    mentioned. Erected in 1807 by Mr IT. Maudslay from designs by Mr (afterwards Sir
                    Marc) Brunel, on the recommendation of Sir S. Bentham, it enabled ten men to do
                    in a superior manner work which previously required one hundred and ten, and
                    effected in the annual expenditure of the nation a saving of about £24,000. Into

                    machines by which this was accomplished we cannot enter, but they are of great
                    interest, not only from their intrinsic merits, but also as being, if not the
                    very first, certainly superior to any which had previously been used. Our
                    limited space, however, will be more profitably devoted to giving a few examples
                    of the general tools used in engineers’ workshops.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Steam-Hammer,</hi> which in some respects may be regarded
                    as the most important of machine tools, has already been noticed (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hammer,</hi> vol. xi. p. 425). Second only to it in importance,
                    and long anterior to it in date, stands the <hi rend="italic">lathe.</hi> At
                    what exact point of its development from the simple foot lathe it first became
                    entitled to rank as a machine tool we will not stop to inquire, for the origin
                    of this, as of most of the mechanical legacies which have been handed down to us
                    by successive inventors and improvers, is involved in much obscurity. But as far
                    as tools laying any claim to precision are concerned it appears certainly to
                    have been the first to come into existence. On the Continent, mechanism to be
                    used in conjunction with it for oval turning, and for producing mouldings
                    oblique to the axis of the work, had been devised as early as 1569, in which
                    year one Jacques Besson published drawings of two lathes so arranged. Whether
                    much additional beauty was obtained by thus departing from the circular sections
                    producible with the simple lathe, and converting them into distorted ones, such
                    as that sketched in fig. 1 (reduced from Besson), may perhaps be questioned, but
                    the taste for this “swash” work, as it is called, ere long extended also to
                    England. Moxon, the first English writer on the subject, gives a drawing of a
                    very similar lathe, and he mentions the name of an established London maker
                    whose oval engines and swash engines, and all other engines, were “excellently
                    well made,” so they were apparently in some demand at the time of his writing
                    (1680).</p>
                <p>Screw cutting in the lathe was another problem—and a more worthy one—which
                    occupied the attention of inventors at the same early period. A curious but
                    mechanically very imperfect arrangement for accomplishing it (with which,
                    however, threads either right or left handed could be cut on tapered and oval as
                    well as on cylindrical work) is given in another of Besson’s engravings. In this
                    the tool is entirely supported and its movements are controlled by the machine
                    instead of being held in the hand,—an arrangement of which the great advantage
                    appears to have been but tardily appreciated, though it contains the germ of the
                    principle which, applied first in the slide-rest of the lathe, and subsequently
                    in machine tools of almost every type, has enabled tasks of constantly
                    increasing severity to be successfully dealt with.</p>
                <p>Nearly two centuries seem to have elapsed before what we now know as the <hi
                    rend="italic">slide-rest</hi> became a recognized adjunct to the turning lathe,
                    though in the meantime arrangements had been devised for controlling the motion
                    of the tool by attaching it to some portion of the mechanism in some special
                    cases,—as in that of two curious lathes for turning hyperbolic, spherical, or
                    plane mirrors for optical purposes, of which engravings were published at Rome
                    in 1648. Its first definite appearance in print occurs in the great French <hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopédie,</hi> published in 1772. Detail drawings of an
                    admirable slide-rest are given in one, and evidence of its being then in regular
                    use occurs in several of the very interesting engravings of that ponderous work,
                    which gives so clear an insight into the methods then employed in France in the
                    various crafts. The description, however, by no means settles the question of
                    its origin.</p>
                <p>It is pretty certain that the slide-rest was reinvented in England by the
                    ingenious Henry Maudslay, when he was employed in Mr Bramah’s workshop in
                    London, where “Maudslay’s go-cart” (as it was at one time derisively called) was
                    first set to work in 1794. That he had not previously seen the drawings just
                    mentioned cannot of course be proved, but the high price at which the <hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopédie</hi> was published makes it very probable that no
                    copy of it had at that time come under the notice of a hardworking English
                    mechanic. The intrinsic differences of the two slide-rests tend towards a
                    similar conclusion. Whoever may have been its first inventor, the slide-rest has
                    certainly proved itself to be the most invaluable of all the additions made to
                    the turning lathe. Its indispensability to the modern power-lathe will be
                    readily appreciated from the following examples.</p>
                <p>An engraving of a simple slide-rest for use with a foot lathe has already been
                    given (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Lathe),</hi> and its effect in reducing the
                    labour of the turner was then pointed out. The <hi rend="italic">self-acting
                    slide-rest</hi> (fig. 2) carries this reduction still farther; and, by deriving
                    from the lathe itself the small “feed” movement necessary for bringing the tool
                    to bear on successive portions of thb work, it dispenses wholly with the need
                    for physical exertion on the part of the workman, and does not even demand his
                    continuous supervision. One result of this is that the slide lathe ( for so
                    complete is the union between the slide-rest and the lathe that they must now be
                    regarded as one machine) affords a complete solution of the screw-cutting
                    problem, since, by varying the extent to which the rest traverses the lathe bed
                    during each revolution of the mandrel, a screw thread of any desired pitch can
                    be cut with a single tool.</p>
                <p>In fig. 3, which shows a self-acting <hi rend="italic">screw-cutting lathe</hi>
                    with double-geared headstock, of a type now well established, the arrangements
                    for obtaining and varying this traversing motion may be observed. A steel <hi
                    rend="italic">leading screw</hi> runs along the front of the lathe bed, and with
                    it the sliderest can be connected at pleasure. Two or more <hi rend="italic"
                    >change wheels,</hi> properly proportioned as to the number of their teeth,
                    connect the head of the screw with the hinder end of the mandrel.</p>
                <p>Although a leading screw is not the only nor in all cases the best mode of
                    rendering a lathe self-acting, ordinary screw-cutting lathes are very largely
                    used for other purposes than that implied by their name. The advantage of
                    perfect regularity in the feed is very great even for plain turning, and this
                    can only be secured when it is independent of human vigilance. The feed in a
                    direction <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n171/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0171-0154"/> transverse to the bed is also very commonly
                    rendered automatic by means into which we cannot here enter, lathes so provided
                    being distinguished as self-acting <hi rend="italic">surfacing</hi> lathes. In
                    this case, however, the varying diameter of the successive cuts introduces
                    serious objections to a uniform rate of feed. These were remedied as long ago as
                    1827 by that excellent mechanician Joseph Clement, —who was one of the greatest
                    improvers of the power lathe; but his arrangement has never come into general
                    use.</p>
                <p>To enable a comparatively small lathe to be used for surfacing work of larger
                    diameter than it would naturally admit, a portion of the bed is frequently made
                    removable so as to leave a “gap” close to the fixed headstock. An 8-inch <hi
                    rend="italic">gap lathe,</hi> for instance, .such as fig. 3, can thus admit an
                    article of 26 inches diameter instead of 16 inches only.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Break lathes,</hi> such as fig. 4, carry the same principle
                    still farther, so that they can take in work of considerable length as well as
                    of large diameter,—the treble-geared headstock and all other parts being in
                    their case made of sufficient strength to bear the heavy strains which result
                    from the increased size and weight of the work, a quality in which gap lathes
                    are not unfrequently deficient. Lathes of this kind were made by Mr (now Sir
                    Joseph) Whitworth as long ago as 1840, and the type is still the accepted one
                    for general heavy turning. The face plates on which large work is chucked in
                    these lathes are sometimes as much as 15 feet in diameter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Face lathes,</hi> of which the main duty is surfacing articles
                    whereof the diameter is great but the length small, are very similar to the
                    foregoing minus the entire right-hand portion of the bed and all that it
                    carries. They have occasionally been made for work of very large diameter,— such
                    as turning the roller paths of 40 feet railway turntables,—though it is now
                    found preferable to turn such things in a horizontal position, in lathes of
                    which the mandrels are vertical.</p>
                <p>But the point to which the growth of power-lathes has now attained will be best
                    illustrated by the following interesting particulars of two. which have been
                    quite recently designed and made in the Royal Gun Factories at Woolwich. Each of
                    these can take in a piece of work having a maximum diameter of 12 feet and a
                    total length of 36 feet,—which represents a truly appalling weight of metal to
                    have to deal with,—their main dimensions, &amp;c., being</p>

                <p>In lathes of this enormous size—as in all machine tools of the heaviest
                    class—great weight and a proper disposal of it on a thoroughly secure foundation
                    are necessary for obtaining the rigidity which is a first essential to success.
                    When, however, this and all other conditions have been fulfilled, and the tool
                    and the speed have been suitably adjusted, the operation of paring off great
                    shavings from the revolving mass becomes one of such apparent facility that it
                    is almost difficult for a stranger to believe that it is not lead or even some
                    yet softer substance, rather than wrought iron or steel, which is under
                    treatment.</p>
                <p>It has been found that in heavy turning the best results are obtained by taking
                    deep cuts at a low rate of speed, fast driving bringing no corresponding
                    increase in the amount of work got through. Various other means have therefore
                    been devised for accelerating operations. Each of the Woolwich lathes just
                    mentioned is furnished with two slide-rests, so that two independent cuts can be
                    taken at once at different parts of the work. The <hi rend="italic">duplex
                    system</hi> effects the same thing in a different way, two slide-rests (one in
                    front and the other at the back of the lathe) being mounted on one saddle and
                    adjusted simultaneously by a single right and left handed screw,—a plan which
                    has the advantage of subjecting the work to two opposite strains which either
                    wholly or partially balance each other. In some instances both the above
                    advantages are combined by using two duplex rests at different parts of the bed.
                    A <hi rend="italic">quick hand traverse</hi> is another time-saving arrangement,
                    now common to almost all screw cutting lathes. It enables the slide-rest to be
                    run quickly back from the end of one cut to the starting point of the next. In
                    turning up a number of similar articles upon each of which several different
                    tools have to be used in succession, the time which would be lost in changing
                    the tools is sometimes saved by employing a <hi rend="italic">capstan rest,</hi>
                    in which the whole series of tools is so fixed once for all that each in turn
                    can be brought to bear upon the work without further adjustment.</p>
                <p>Three examples of turning tools are given in fig. 5, the middle one being an
                    ordinary <hi rend="italic">hook tool,</hi> suited for outside work on wrought
                    iron or steel, and the one above it a <hi rend="italic">lefthand tool</hi> which
                    can be used also for inside. Their cutting edges are of course forged and ground
                    straighter or more pointed or otherwise varied according to circumstances, and
                    for cast iron or brass the angle of the edge is made much less acute, as in the
                    lowest of the three in the engraving. The size of the steel from which they are
                    made also varies, 2 inches square being by no means exceptionally large, so that
                    the weight of it uselessly employed in the shanks is very considerable, and
                    altogether disproportionate to that required for the cutting edges. The plan of
                    fixing a short steel cutter in an iron tool-holder, suggested many years ago by
                    Mr Babbage (which has already been mentioned in connexion with foot lathes),
                    has, however, not found the favour which at first sight might have been expected
                    for it, in spite of the saving which it effects in this respect.</p>
                <p>For chasing long or coarse-threaded screws the above-mentioned screw-cutting
                    lathes leave little or nothing to be desired. But for producing the large number
                    of screwed bolts, studs, &lt;fcc., now required in mechanical workshops more
                    rapid methods must be had recourse to, and special machines for forging,
                    turning, screwing, and finishing them have accordingly come into common use. Of
                    these one example only can be given—the <hi rend="italic">screwing machine,</hi>
                    fig. 6—with which the threads of bolts or nuts are cut to the “standard pitch”
                    which now (happily) is almost <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0172-0155"/> universally accepted. Immense loss and
                    inconvenience were formerly caused by the absence of uniformity in this respect,
                    but, thanks to the persevering manner in which the efforts of Maudslay and
                    Clement to put an end to this evil have been followed up by Whitworth, it has
                    now almost ceased to exist, and any bolt or nut can be substituted for any other
                    of a like size, however different the processes by which the two have been
                    manufactured. The machine (fig. 6) is in fact a lathe with a few special
                    features, such as the hollow mandrel, whichenables it to operate upon a barof
                    anylength. Dies mounted on a modified form of slide-rest cut the thread to the
                    full depth at a single traverse, and a simple arrangement enables nuts to be
                    tapped with equal facility. In some other varieties of screwing machines, more
                    particularly those intended for hand power only, the outward resemblance to the
                    turning lathe is less apparent, but if their action is looked into it will be
                    found that in them as in almost all machine tools it is the principle of the
                    slide which is mainly conducive to their success.</p>
                <p>Second only to the lathe in its importance stands the <hi rend="italic">planing
                    machine.</hi> Just as the slide lathe renders it easy to turn a cylindrical
                    surface true from end to end, a task which before its introduction had been one
                    of extreme difficulty, even for the most highly skilled workman, so the planing
                    machine supersedes, by a method giving vastly superior results, the difficult
                    and costly process of hand chipping and filing, by which flat surfaces of metal
                    were formerly produced. Although it is a comparatively modern invention, its
                    real origin is obscure. No drawings or description of any planing machine at all
                    resembling those now in use were published in England previously to those of one
                    made by Clement in 1825, which appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of
                    the Society of Arts.</hi> With this beautiful machine, which was of considerable
                    size, being capable of admitting articles measuring as much as 6 feet in height
                    or width, he obtained results which would satisfy all ordinary requirements at
                    the present day.</p>
                <p>The ordinary self-acting planing machine is shown in fig. 7. Its action bears no
                    resemblance to the familiar process of wood planing, but is analogous to that by
                    which the successive cuts of a narrow tool produce a cylindrical surface in a
                    slide lathe. A traversing table carries the work and forces it against the tool,
                    which is stationary while making its cut, but between the cuts has a slight
                    “feed” motion along its horizontal slide. Perfectly parallel cuts are thus taken
                    from every portion of the work in succession, the result being a surface, not
                    indeed perfectly smooth and free from scores, but (what is generally far more
                    important) possessing a general flatness and freedom'from twist which can be
                    obtained only with a great expenditure of time and trouble by hand labour. The
                    extent to which machinery has cheapened work of this kind will be appreciated
                    from the fact that in 1826 the cost of rendering a square foot of surface true
                    by hand chipping and filing was 12s., whereas in 1856 it could be done in the
                    planing machine at a cost of less than one penny.</p>
                <p>Planing machines, equally with lathes, are required not only to give good results
                    but to give them quickly. Provision is therefore made for regulating the
                    traverse of the table to suit the length of the cut, and for utilizing or
                    accelerating its return journeys. The former is sometimes done by fixing the
                    tool in a <hi rend="italic">revolving tool-holder</hi> or “jim crow,” so that
                    its face can be always turned towards its cut, and for accomplishing the latter
                    there are various arrangements which give a “quick return” to the table.. It is
                    also a common practice to use two tools at once, as in turning. It will be
                    observed that the size of the work which can be treated in a planing machine,
                    such as fig. 7, is strictly limited by the clear width between the standards,
                    and the height of the horizontal slide above the table when at its highest
                    point. Although these dimensions are very considerable in the larger sizes,
                    which can occasionally take in articles over 9 feet in width and height and 50
                    feet in length, yet it is sometimes desirable to be able to exceed them, and in
                    these large machines the weight of the table and the power consumed in driving
                    and reversing it become a serious consideration. It is therefore mechanically
                    preferable to keep the work at rest when it is large or heavy, and to give all
                    the requisite movements to the tool. This view is now gradually gaining favour,
                    and the makers of some recent machines have adopted a form of construction
                    entirely different from the above, which has the advantage of enabling cuts
                    either horizontal or vertical to be taken from any piece of work which can be
                    secured to the base-plate, so that its full size is almost immaterial.</p>
                <p>An ordinary <hi rend="italic">vertical drilling machine</hi> is represented in
                    fig. 8, one of comparatively small size and singlegeared having been chosen
                    rather than a larger example with greater complication. When once properly
                    started, this machine is self-acting, but for each hole the work has to be
                    adjusted by hand so as to bring the required portion exactly under the drill
                    spindle, and the small size of the table prevents its being at any great
                    distance from the edge. These objections are remedied in larger machines, either
                    by making the table capable of horizontal adjustment,—a good way of doing this
                    being to pivot a circular table at the end of an arm which can revolve round the
                    main standard of the machine,—or by mounting the drill spindle on a radial arm,
                    and enabling its distance from the standard to be varied. In the first case the
                    tool is than distinguished as a “pillar” and in the second as a “radial”
                    drilling machine. Either of these methods enables the drill to be brought to
                    bear exactly upon the desired spot <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n173/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0173-0156"/> (within certain limits as to distance from the
                    edge, &lt;fcc.), the first by adjusting the work below the drill, the second by
                    adjusting the drill over the work. A <hi rend="italic">wall drill</hi> dispenses
                    with a table altogether, and gives great facilities for operating on large
                    pieces of work, especially if the means of adjustment is secured by the radial
                    arm just mentioned. <hi rend="italic">Multiple</hi> drilling machines, with
                    which a series of holes can be drilled • at once, are serviceable tools for some
                    purposes, mainly on account of the saving of time which they effect. Three
                    drills are shown in fig. 9, the first the old, bad, but not yet quite superseded
                    pattern, which is incapable of making a straight or clean hole of any
                    considerable depth, and which loses its original diameter both in wear and in
                    sharpening; the second the <hi rend="italic">twist drill,</hi> which compares
                    favourably with it in every one of these respects; and the .third a <hi
                    rend="italic">pin drill,</hi> for enlarging a hole already existing.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Boring machines</hi> deal chiefly with apertures of large
                    diameter, for which great straightness and accuracy are required, such as the
                    cylinders of pumps, steam-engines, .&lt;fcc., or the bores of guns. The latter
                    object brought them very early into existence, as already mentioned, and the
                    general principle upon which the rude machinery of more than a century ago bored
                    out the old cast iron mortars is still used for the powerful weapons of our own
                    day. It consists in the employment of a <hi rend="italic">boring bar</hi> formed
                    by mounting a series of cutters (or a combination of guides and cutters) round
                    the periphery of a cylindrical “head” somewhat less in diameter than the
                    required bore. Fig. 10 will render evident the great similarity which exists
                    between the oldest and the most recent gun-boring heads, the one being taken
                    from the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie</hi> already referred to, and the other
                    from a drawing of a boring-bar used for a similar purpose at Woolwich, The head
                    may be either a fixture at the end of its bar, in which case it forms a kind of
                    drill with several cutting edges, or it may be so arranged as to traverse the
                    bar to a small extent at each revolution,—a plan which is generally preferred
                    for all open-ended cylinders, &amp;c., and which admits of the work being kept
                    stationary throughout the operation. The bar when in use is mounted either
                    vertically or horizontally, according to circumstances, in a lathe or boring
                    machine. The excellent results obtainable in this manner will be appreciated
                    from the fact that with the gun-boring machinery at Woolwich a hole 10 inches in
                    diameter and 10 feet deep can be bored in solid steel at a single operation, and
                    holes have been carried to a depth of 24 feet with a variation of less than τ⅜π
                    of an inch in the diameter. The accuracy of modern machine work indeed not
                    unfrequently brings into prominence sources of error which were previously
                    unsuspected. The boring of large cast iron cylinders affords àn instance of
                    this, for it has been found that, however true the boring tool may be, the
                    distortion of the cylinder itself, through being laid on its side, is sufficient
                    to mar the results obtained with it; consequently it has been found necessary
                    always to bore a large cylinder in the vertical position which it will occupy
                    when in use.</p>
                <p>In the construction of modem machinery, &amp;c., it is often necessary to depart
                    from the simple geometric forms to the production of which the tools which have
                    thus far occupied our attention are mainly adapted. We will now glance at some
                    of the labour-saving contrivances applicable to other cases.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">slot-drilling machine</hi> effects (by a method said to
                    have been first used about the year· 1848) the conversion of the circular cavity
                    producible with an ordinary drilling machine into an elongated “slot” or slit.
                    The extent of the elongation can be varied by increasing or diminishing the
                    reciprocating movement of the slide which carries the rotating drill. An example
                    of it is given in fig.</p>
                <p>11, and the cutting end of a <hi rend="italic">roughing drill</hi> is shown to an
                    enlarged scale. Where smoothness of the sunken surface is required this is
                    followed by a <hi rend="italic">rose</hi> or some other <hi rend="italic"
                    >finishing tool.</hi></p>
                <p>T^ιe <hi rend="italic">slotting machine</hi> (fig. 12) also cuts grooves and
                    slots, but in an entirely different manner. Those who are acquainted with the
                    wood mortising machine, from which the idea of this tool was derived by Roberts
                    of Manchester, will at once understand its principle, and will appreciate the
                    good service which can be rendered by this powerful paring tool. A large
                    proportion of the shaping, &amp;c., required in heavy work is now done in these
                    machines, which are sometimes of great size and power. The table on which the
                    work is placed is pivoted and mounted on a compound slide, and a self-acting
                    horizontal transverse or circular movement can thus be given to it.</p>
                <p>For work of moderate size <hi rend="italic">shaping machines,</hi> which are more
                    of recent introduction than either slotting or planing machines, both of which
                    they resemble in their action, are in some respects more convenient. The slide
                    which carries the tool is in their case horizontal, and its short but variable
                    strokes are in a direction transverse to the bed, along which it can travel,
                    just as a slide-rest travels along a lathe bed. Curved surfaces, either convex
                    or concave, as well as flat ones, can generally be worked up automatically in
                    these machines, one of which is shown in fig. 13, but their details and
                    arrangements vary considerably. For operating upon small surfaces, especially
                    those of complicated outline, the plan of employing a revolving cutter,
                    resembling a circular file, is now gaining favour. It is interesting to note
                    that this is but a return to a system which is stated to have been devised by Dr
                    Hooke in 1664, and which was certainly used in some of the early “engines” for
                    cutting the teeth of wheels. One such cutter or <hi rend="italic">milling
                    tool</hi> is shown in fig. 14. Others are of a plain cylindrical form, or are
                    varied in outline to any extent to suit the particular purpose for which they
                    are intended, amongst which purposes may be mentioned that of cutting the teeth
                    of other milling tools. When mounted on a compound slide and used in a <hi
                    rend="italic">milling machine,</hi> a tool of this kind is a labour-saving
                    contrivance of a very efficient kind, and it shoukl be observed that it may in
                    some cases be employed for finishing metal surfaces possessing a double
                    curvature, to which none of the foregoing planing or shaping machines could be
                    applied.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Profiling</hi> or <hi rend="italic">edge-milling machines</hi>
                    are a still more recent application of the milling-tool system. They enable the
                    curved or complicated outline of a previously prepared templet to be reproduced
                    with certainty any number of times in succession. They are in fact copying
                    machines, acting in a similar manner to Jordan’s carving machine or Blanchard’s
                    copying lathe, in both of which the form of the copy is derived from the
                    original pattern by causing this pattern to control the movements of the
                    revolving tool.</p>
                <p>Another class of machine tools, which has sprung up of late years and is rapidly
                    extending, is that of <hi rend="italic">emery grinders.</hi> One thing <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n174/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0174-0157"/> which has given much impetus to these is the now
                    not unfrequent necessity for turning or shaping steel in a more or less hard
                    condition, for doing which these and natural grinding-stones are the only
                    substances practically available on a large scale, while the rapid wear of the
                    latter unfits them for many of the pιιrposes to which the artificial
                    preparations of emery can be applied with great advantage. Accordingly <hi
                    rend="italic">emery wheels</hi> are now mounted for use in a great many
                    different ways,—either on slide-rests as turning tools, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >emery planers</hi> and <hi rend="italic">emery shaping machines</hi> (such as
                    fig. 15), and various others in which they take the place of steel cutters, or
                    as <hi rend="italic">tool grinders</hi> either general or special, in which the
                    rival material, so far from supplanting steel, does much towards increasing its
                    efficiency, by enabling the process of grinding to be applied to many cutting
                    tools which could previously be sharpened only with much greater labourand cost
                    by other methods. Saws, grooved rimers and screw taps, and twist drills are
                    familiar instances of this application. A high rate of speed is essential for
                    obtaining the full effect of an emery wheel, half a mile a minute being by no
                    means an unusual or excessive rate of travel for its cutting surface. A
                    considerable amount of heat is consequently developed at the point of contact
                    with the work, and the composition of the wheel must be such that it can endure
                    this without injury. Some which could not fulfil this requirement have long been
                    used by native workmen in India, but others which could fulfil it were patented
                    in England in 1842, though for years after this they were but little known or
                    used.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Punching and shearing machinery</hi> holds the same isolated
                    position amongst machine tools that punches and shears occupy amongst cutting
                    tools used by hand—if indeed either the one or the other can be regarded as
                    cutting tools at all. Yet, for performing.rapidly and in many cases without any
                    waste of material, shears can often claim superiority to any other means
                    available for accomplishing the same ends. The diagram (fig. 16) shows the old
                    arrangement known as <hi rend="italic">cropping shears,</hi> still in use at
                    many iron-works, where early appliances seem to enjoy a remarkable vitality. An
                    example of a self-contained <hi rend="italic">shearing and punchingmachine</hi>
                    is given in fig. 17. The apparent ease with which machines of this kind, acting
                    with a slow quiet stroke, shear or perforate plates of iron, even when of
                    considerable thickness, gives an altogether false impression of the amount of
                    power which the operation requires. Arrangements for obviating the difficulty of
                    placing the work exactly in the correct position for each one of a series of
                    holes to be punched in it were devised by Maudslay; his plan, which is the one
                    now usually adopted, being to place a traversing table in front of the machine,
                    from some part of which it is moved to a distance depending on the “pitch” of
                    the holes after each stroke of the punch. Another system, by which the holes
                    could be arranged in any required pattern, was subsequently invented by
                    Roberts.</p>
                <p>The above examples of workshop tools have been confined to those to which the
                    requisite power is transmitted from an independent steam-engine or some other
                    prime mover—the usual mode of transmission being by lines of <hi rend="italic"
                    >shafting</hi> carrying <hi rend="italic">pulleys</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >drums.</hi> Belts pass from these to similar pulleys, which may be observed on
                    many of the machines in the engravings. But this is not the invariable method.
                    The prime mover may itself form part of the machine, as it does in the case of a
                    steam-hammer. Or steam may be dispensed with and water confined under a high
                    pressure substituted,—which constitutes the <hi rend="italic">hydraulic
                    system</hi> of distribution, now largely applied to the working of cranes and
                    many other purposes, and to some extent also to machine tools. Punches and
                    shears lend themselves readily to this system on account of their slow
                    movements; so, too, do <hi rend="italic">riveting machines.</hi> The
                    distribution of power by hydraulic means, and also by compressed air, was
                    patented by Mr Bramah in 1796. Another formidable rival to steam also has now
                    sprung up in the shape of <hi rend="italic">electricity,</hi> and the results
                    from it which are promised to us—and which indeed seem likely to be
                    obtained—will go far towards revolutionizing all our present ideas as to the
                    difficulty of transmitting power to a distance, and will work a complete
                    transformation in the aspect of the machine tools of the future.</p>
                <p>One other class of machines must be mentioned before concluding, viz., <hi
                    rend="italic">measuring machines.</hi> The greatly increased accuracy of modem
                    work has rendered necessary the recording of very minute dimensions, such as are
                    quite beyond the measuring powers of ordinary rules and callipers. Difference
                    engines, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> machines which can measure minute
                    differences between two articles—such as a standard gau"e and an intended copy
                    of it—have thus found a place in engineers <hi rend="superscript"> γ</hi> works.
                    To their arrangement and manufacture, as well as to that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >standard measuring bars</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gaιιges,</hi> Sir J.
                    "Whitworth has paid great attention, and he has achieved such success that in

                    Board of Trade there is one of these machines, used for the verification of
                    standard gauges, which reads to the ττr⅛T0∙ °f <hi rend="superscript"> an</hi> i

                <p>The social influence of machine tools λve cannot discuss, though it is a subject
                    upon which the diffusion of correct ideas is greatly needed. The days of
                    mill-burning and implement-breaking mobs indeed are past, but the effect of the
                    introduction of the machinery of which these tools are the parents is one which
                    is still much misunderstood. More particularly is this the case amongst the
                    handworking classes in England, who see clearly the local and temporary
                    hardships which its introduction occasionally causes, hut are blind to the
                    greatly preponderating advantages which they reap from it in an especial degree.
