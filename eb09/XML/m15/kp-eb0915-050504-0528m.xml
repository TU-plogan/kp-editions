                    only to the excrements of animals, either alone or mixed with straw, is now more
                    widely used, and is given to all substances, or mixtures of substances, which
                    are added to the soil in order to increase its productiveness or to restore the
                    natural fertility lost by repeated cropping.</p>
                <p>The subject of manures and their application involves a prior consideration of
                    plant life and its requirements. The plant, growing as it does in the soil, and
                    surrounded by the atmosphere, derives from these two sources its nourishment and
                    means of growth through the various stages of its development. From these
                    sources, each equally indispensable, the plant obtains the materials which it
                    has the power of elaborating and building up to form its own structure.</p>
                <p>Chemical analysis has shown that plants are composed’</p>

                <p>of water, organic or combustible matters, and inorganic, incombustible, or
                    mineral matters. These last are left as the ash when the plant is burnt. The
                    elements forming the organic portion of plants are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and
                    nitrogen; the mineral portion, or ash, consists principally of lime, magnesia,
                    potash, soda, oxide of iron, phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, chlorine, and
                    silica.</p>
                <p>The atmosphere is the great storehouse of organic plantfood. The carbonic acid
                    always present in the air is, as is well known, eagerly, taken up by the leaves
                    of plants, all of which have the power of decomposing carbonic acid, giving off
                    its oxygen, and assimilating its carbon. Roughly speaking, three-fourths of the
                    dry substance of all plants is derived from the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Under conditions of natural growth and decay, when no crops are gathered in, or
                    consumed on the land by live stock, the herbage on dying down and decaying
                    returns to the atmosphere and the soil the elements taken from them during life;
                    but under cultivation a succession of crops deprives the land of the
                    constituents which are essential to healthy and luxuriant growth. Without an
                    adequate return to the land of the matters removed in the produce, its fertility
                    cannot be maintained for many years. In newly-opened countries, where old
                    forestshave been cleared and the land brought into cultivation, the virgin soil
                    often possesses at first a high degree of fertility, but gradually its
                    productive power decreases from year to year. Gene-rdly speaking, it is more
                    convenient to clear fresh forest land than to improve more or less exhausted
                    virgin land by the application of manure, labour, and skill. In all densely
                    peopled countries where such a mode of cultivation cannot be followed it is
                    necessary to resort to artificial means to restore the natural fertility of the
                    land and maintain and increase its productiveness.</p>
                <p>The researches of Liebig, Wiegmann, Polstorff, and others have proved beyond
                    doubt the important functions of the mineral constituents of the soil in
                    relation to plant life. The gradual removal of phosphate of lime in the tillage
                    of dairy districts, or the removal of other mineral matters essential to the
                    healthy growth of farm crops, certainly impoverishes the land. The exhaustion of
                    the soil is caused in a much more marked way, however, by the rapid loss in
                    available nitrogenous plant food which soils sustain when under cultivation
                    without manure.</p>
                <p>Agricultural improvements manifest themselves in two different directions—the
                    mechanical and the chemical. Under mechanical improvement the physical condition
                    of the soil is bettered and its latent stores of plant food brought into action
                    by mechanical means, such as ploughing, subsoiling, steam cultivation, &lt;tc.
                    The introduction of new and superior agricultural implements, good systems of
                    drainage, and intelligent division of labour characterize the first stage of
                    progress in agriculture. The second stage is marked by the application of
                    chemical principles to practical agriculture, an application shown by the
                    introduction of a rational system of feeding, a proper rotation of crops, and
                    chiefly the use of chemical, or artificial, manures for the purpose of restoring
                    the natural fertility of the soil and increasing its productive powers.</p>
                <p>The aid which chemistry has rendered during the last twenty-five or thirty years
                    to practical agriculture has greatly promoted agricultural improvements; and
                    farming, which is in a large measure dependent for success upon an economical
                    use of manures, is now being carried on much more rationally than in former
                    times. The proper application of various kinds of manures is one of the most
                    prominent features of successful modern farming.</p>
                <p>In considering the economical use of manures on the land, regard must be had to
                    the following points :—(T) the requirements of the crops intended to be
                    cultivated; (2) the physical condition of the soil; (3) the composition of the
                    soil; and (4) the composition of the manure. Briefly stated, the guiding
                    principle of manuring economically and profitably is to meet the requirements of
                    the crops intended to be cultivated, by incorporating with the soil, in the most
                    efficacious states of combination, the materials in which it is deficient, or
                    which the various crops usually grown on the farm do not find in the land in a
                    sufficiently available condition to ensure an abundant harvest.</p>
                <p>Soils vary greatly in composition, and hence it will be readily understood that
                    in one locality or on one particular field a certain manure may be used with
                    great benefit, while in another field the same manure has little or no effect
                    upon the produce. Although increased attention has of recent years been paid to
                    the chemical composition and properties of soils, there is still much room left
                    for improvement, for many farmers disregard almost altogether the composition of
                    their fields in buying artificial manures.</p>
                <p>It has been pointed out by Sir John Lawes that in actual English farm-practice
                    there is, speaking practically, a standard of natural produce which varies
                    within certain limits, as influenced by seasons and management, and which cannot
                    be permanently increased or reduced by cultivation; and further, when land is
                    spoken of as being in “good condition,” reference is made only to the temporary
                    rise of fertility by means of the manures employed, while by land “out of
                    condition” is signified the exhaustion of the manures by the removal of crops,
                    loss by drainage, &lt;fcc., and that the soil has merely gone back to its
                    standard of natural productiveness. Some soils, indeed, contain in their natural
                    condition hardly a sufficient proportion of available elements of plant food to
                    yield remunerative crops; such soils are naturally barren, and, although by the
                    constant use of manures they may be improved and may attain some degree of
                    fertility, they will, if left unrnanured, speedily revert to their former
                    natural unproductive state.</p>
                <p>The principal constituents of manures are—nitrogen, in the form of ammonia,
                    nitrates, and nitrogenous organic matters; organic matters not containing
                    nitrogen (humus); phosphoric acid, potash, soda, lime, magnesia, silica,
                    sulphuric acid, and chlorine. Of these constituents by far the most important
                    are the nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, and these will be considered more
                    in detail.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Nitrogen.—</hi> Nothing so much affects the productiveness
                    of soils as nitrogen, when it is supplied to plants in a form in which it can be
                    assimilated by them, and nothing is more readily removed from the land, either
                    in the crop grown or, in the form of nitrates, by drainage. The “good condition”
                    of land, to which allusion has been made already, is, in a great measure, the
                    fertility which has been imparted to the soil by the nitrogen supplied to it,
                    while the “natural productiveness” may be taken as that due to the phosphoric
                    acid, potash, and other mineral constituents of the soil.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sιipply of Nitrogenous Plant Food.—</hi> In the case of a crop
                    growing under natural conditions, and not removed from the land, the mineral
                    constituents taken from the soil, and carbonaceous as well as some nitrogenous
                    organic matter, principally derived from the atmosphere, are returned to the
                    land, and a rich carbonaceous soil or humus is produced in the course of years.
                    Such a soil is capable of supplying for a considerable number of years, when
                    under cultivation, the nitrogen needed by the crops grown on the land. This
                    supply of nitrogen, however, gradually becomes exhausted by repeated cropping.
                    The atmosphere, in addition to free nitrogen gas, which constitutes about
                    four-fifths of its volume, contains but very little combined nitrogen in the
                    forms of ammonia or nitric acid.</p>
                <p>Μ. Boussingault’s experiments clearly show that plants <pb break="no"

                    leaves and of assimilating the free nitrogen of the air. This conclusion has
                    been verified by the extensive researches of Messrs Lawes, Gilbert, and Pugh.
                    The nitrogen contained as nitric acid and ammonia in the air, and descending
                    upon the land in the shape of rain, dew, or snow, though, without doubt, adding
                    to the supply of nitrogen in the soil, is altogether insufficient to meet the
                    requirements of remunerative crops. The experiments of Messrs Lawes and Gilbert
                    and Professor Way show that the average proportion of nitrogen deposited
                    annually upon one acre of land at Rothamsted, St Albans, amounts to 7 ’ 21 lb,
                    of which quantity 6 ’ 46 Ib occur as ammonia and ’ <hi rend="italic">75</hi> ft)
                    as nitric acid.</p>
                <p>The further investigations of Dr Voelcker, Professor Frankland, and Messrs Lawes
                    and Gilbert upon the drainage water from cultivated soils show that a
                    considerable quantity of nitrogen in the shape of nitric acid j&gt;asses into
                    land drainage, and that this loss of nitrogen is much greater than the total
                    amount supplied to the land by the rain and dew. The results which Messrs Lawes
                    and Gilbert obtained in their experiments on the continuous growth of barley at
                    Rothamsted from 1852 to 1875 afford, as is shown in the following table (I.),
                    direct evidence of the insufficiency of the atmospheric supply of nitrogen, and
                    of that present in the soil in the form of nitrogenous organic matter.</p>

                <p>The Rothamsted soil is a moderately stiff one, of considerable depth, and
                    contains naturally the mineral elements of plant food in abundance; thus it has
                    been possible to grow corn crops for over twenty-five years without any m inure
                    (Plots 1). The crops in the second period of twelve years were, however, less
                    than those of the first period, and in neither case were full crops obtained.
                    While the application of mineral manures alone (Plots 2) produced only a slight
                    increase in the case of the wheat, and rather better, though poor, results with
                    barley, nitrogenous manures, applied to the land either in the shape of ammonia
                    salts or nitrate of soda, produced a strikingly large increase. The experiments
                    further show that while good crops, both of wheat and barley, can be grown by
                    the annual application of 14 tons of farmyard manure per acre, the best results
                    are obtained by the use of a mixture of mineral and nitrogenous manures.</p>
                <p>In Messrs Lawes and Gilbert’s experiments the amount of nitrogen removed in
                    different crops was determined with the following results :—over a period of
                    thirty-two years (to 1875), wheat yielded an average of 20 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7 ft) of nitrogen per acre per annum without any
                    manure, but the annual yield has decreased from an average of over 25 ft) in the
                    first eight to less than 16 lb in the last twelve years, and since 1875 it has
                    been still less; over a period of twenty-four years, barley, when unmanured,
                    yielded an average of 18 3 ft) nitrogen per acre per annum, but with a decline
                    from 22 lb in the first twelve to 14 ’ 6 in the last twelve years. Experiments
                    similar to those on wheat and barley have been made on oats, root crops,
                    leguminous and grass crops, all showing the gradual decline in produce when
                    grown continuously without nitrogenous manures, and proving that the soil and
                    not the atmosphere is the chief source of nitrogen in plants. In face of these
                    results the “mineral theory” of Liebig, which attached but small value to
                    nitrogen applied to the soil in the form of nitrogenous manures, and maintained
                    the sufficiency of the ammonia of the atmosphere for supplying the needs of the
                    plant, cannot be accepted without reserve.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the great effect produced by the nitrogenous manures, two-thirds
                    of the nitrogen supplied was unrecovered in the increase of crops when the
                    ammonia salts were supplied to wheat in autumn. When, however, nitrate of soda
                    was used, which is always applied in the spring, the quantity left unrecovered
                    was not much more than half that supplied.</p>
                <p>The following table (II.), by Messrs Lawes and Gilbert, shows the amount of
                    nitrogen recovered, and the amount not recovered, in the increase of the crop
                    for 100 supplied in manure, to wheat and to barley respectively, the result
                    being in each case the average over a period of twenty years :—</p>

                <p>The question will naturally be raised, What becomes of the one-half or two-thirds
                    of the nitrogen which is not recovered in the increase of the crops'? The
                    examination of some seventy samples by Dr Voelcker, and a number of independent
                    determinations by Dr Frankland, of the drainage-water from the experimental
                    wheat plots which yielded the above results throw much light on this loss. The

                <p>These experiments show how great may be the loss of nitrogen by drainage when
                    ammonia salts or nitrates are liberally applied to the land in autumn, should
                    there be much wet weather in winter, or even when applied in spring if there be
                    much heavy rain; also, that the quantity of nitrogen in drainage water as
                    nitrates is increased in proportion to the amounts of ammonia or nitrate
                    employed on the land. Assuming that from one-quarter to nearly one-half the
                    annual rainfall descends more than 40 inches below the surface, every inch of
                    rain passing through the dι*ains and carrying with it one part of nitrogen in.
                    100,000 of water, there will be a loss of 2⅜ lb of nitrogen per acre from the
                    manure. Dr Voelcker’s analysis of the drainage water of a wheat field manured in
                    autumn by ammonia salts supplying 82 ft&gt; of nitrogen per acre shows that for
                    every inch of rain passing through the drains in January a loss took place of
                    about 8⅜ lb of nitrogen, costing about ] s. per ∏&gt; as manure. The loss of
                    nitrogen thus is very large, and show's that by far the largest proportion of
                    the nitrogen of manure which is not recovered in the crop is lost in drainage.
                    In addition to the nitrogen removed in the crop and to that lost in drainage,
                    some small proportion is found by analysis to be retained in the soil itself.
                    The nitrogen may be of advantage to crops grown subsequently, according to the
                    source from which it was derived; for while ammonia salts and nitrates yield but
                    very small residues, and exert little or no effect beyond the first year, from
                    bones, cake, and other such materials we get large residues of nitrogen in the
                    soil, which tell markedly on future crops. The experiments on drainage water
                    have further shown the absorbent power of soils, and that manuring matters when
                    in contact with soils undergo remarkable changes, being taken up by plants, not
                    in the simple state in which they are applied, but in quite different kinds of
                    combination. Professor Way has the merit of having first proved that all soils
                    possess, in different degrees, the power of absorbing ammonia from its solution
                    in water, and that in passing solutions of salts of ammonia through soils the
                    ammonia alone is absorbed, and the acids of the ammonia salts pass through in
                    combination, generally with lime, or, if lime be deficient, with magnesia or
                    other mineral bases of the soil.</p>
                <p>In the drainage investigations at Dothamsted, it was found that, although large
                    quantities of ammonia salts were applied to some of the plots, the drainage
                    water from them contained mere traces of ammonia, but at all times of the year
                    nitrates were present in quantity; from this it would appear that it is chiefly,
                    if not solely, from nitrates that crops build up their nitrogenous organic
                    constituents. Before leaving the subject of drainage water it is worthy of note
                    here that phosphoric acid and potash, the most valuable mineral fertilizing
                    constituents of the manures, passed but little into the drainage water, but were
                    retained almost entirely in the land, while the more abundant and less important
                    mineral matters, such as lime, magnesia, soda, chlorine, sulphuric acid, and
                    soluble silica, passed in large quantities into the drainage water. It follows
                    from these investigations, first, that much more nitrogenous material must be
                    applied to the land than would be needed to produce a given increase in the
                    crop, supposing all the nitrogen to be recoverable; and secondly, that
                    nitrogenous organic matters when applied to the land undergo decomposition, and
                    are gradually resolved into ammonia compounds, which, after being retained a
                    short time by the soil, are finally oxidized into nitrates, in which form they
                    are most available and beneficial to plants, but are not absorbed by the soil,
                    and are readily washed out by rain. Nitrogen has great forcing properties, and
                    is most beneficial when applied to crops in their early stages. Grass land on
                    which nitrate of soda has been put as a top dressing shows very rapidly and
                    markedly the effects of the manure.</p>
                <p>Nitrate of soda, unless applied just at the time the crop is ready to take it up,
                    will be largely wasted in drainage; hence it is usual to apply nitrate of soda
                    as a top dressing in spring. Ammoniacal manures, such as Peruvian guano, soot,
                    sulphate of ammonia, &amp;c., when used for winter wheat, are best applied in
                    autumn, either before the wheat is sown or when it is fairly above ground. On
                    light land they are often used as top dressings for wheat early in spring. The
                    gradual decomposition of farmyard manures gives a more constant supply of
                    nitrogen than the manures already noticed, and as the fermentation of dung
                    proceeds but slowly it is best to apply it, when quite fresh, in autumn or
                    winter, allowing it to decompose in the land and to yield nitrogen as nitrates
                    when required in spring by the fresh growth of vegetation. In the case of
                    nitrogenous organic materials, such as wool or hair refuse, which take even
                    longer than farmyard manure to decompose, it is necessary to apply them some
                    three or four months before the seed is sown.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Phosphoric Acid.—</hi> Next in value to nitrogen as a
                    constituent of manures comes phosphoric acid. Of all the mineral or ash
                    constituents of plants, this is the most important, for the simple reason that
                    it occurs in most soils in comparatively small proportions, and is required
                    alike by corn and forage crops in larger quantities than lime, magnesia, and
                    other mineral matters, which occur in most soils in almost inexhaustible
                    quantities, or which, if deficient, can be easily and cheaply incorporated with
                    the land.</p>
                <p>Phosphoric acid occurs in soils principally in combination with lime as phosphate
                    of lime, a constituent which enters <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0532-0509"/> largely into the composition of recent and fossil
                    bones, coprolites, and guano, and of a variety of phosphatic minerals, such as
                    Norwegian and Canadian apatite, Sombrero and Curaçoa rock phosphate, South
                    Carolina phosphate, Spanish and Portuguese phosphorite, &lt;fcc. These and other
                    phosphatic materials are now used largely in the manufacture of superphosphate
                    and other artificial manures.</p>
                <p>Phosphate of lime is so sparingly soluble in pure water that, for all practical
                    purposes, it may be considered to be insoluble in water; it is, however,
                    attacked by the natural agencies at work in the soil, and rendered available as
                    plant food. According to the more or less porous condition of the phosphatic
                    manuring materials, phosphate of lime is rendered more or less readily
                    assimilable. Thus, while bone dust and guano, on account of their porous
                    condition, may be used with good effect as suppliers of phosphoric acid to the
                    soil, others, such as hard and crystalline Canadian or Norwegian apatite,
                    produce but little or no result when used as manures merely in a powdered state.
                    It was in 1840 that Liebig suggested the treatment of bones with sulphuric acid
                    in order to make their action more rapid. This treatment of bones by acid
                    converts the phosphate of lime into a soluble lime salt called superphosphate,
                    or, speaking chemically, transforms the original tribasic phosphate of lime into
                    the monocalcic phosphate, sulphate of lime being at the same time produced.
                    Following on this, Mr (now Sir) John Lawes treated mineral phosphates similarly
                    with sulphuric acid, and with results which led to the establishment of a new
                    industry, the manufacture of superphosphate and other artificial manures. The
                    yearly importation of phosphatic minerals, etc., into England for this
                    manufacture alone exceeds 500,000 tons.</p>
                <p>The acid or soluble phosphate of lime in superphosphate, when applied to the
                    soil, is first dissolved by the rain, and equally distributed in a portion of
                    the soil, in which it must be precipitated and rendered insoluble before it can
                    be assimilated by the plant. It is this intimate distribution and subsequent
                    precipitation in a most finely divided state that would seem to constitute the
                    beneficial effects of superphosphate, and its superiority over undissolved
                    phosphates. It supplies at once phosphoric acid, lime, and sulphuric acid to the
                    soil, and is much used in conjunction with nitrogenous materials.
                    Superphosphates are manufactured of various strengths, the percentage of
                    tribasic phosphate of lime, rendered soluble by acid, being taken as the basis
                    of valuation.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Potash.—</hi> The next to rank after phosphoric acid as a
                    valuable constituent of manures is potash. It enters largely into the
                    composition of all crops, especially root crops. Sandy soils, as a rule, are
                    poor in potash, for which reason they are benefited to a greater extent by the
                    application of potash salts than most clay soils, which contain sufficient
                    potash to meet the requirements of farm crops. In clay soils potash mainly
                    occurs in the form of insoluble silicate of potash together with other
                    silicates. By autumn cultivation, subsoiling, and similar means of facilitating
                    the free access of the air to clay-land potash is gradually liberated from the
                    insoluble silicates and is rendered available as plant food. Lime also seems to
                    be un important agent in the liberation of potash. Potash also occurs in
                    farmyard manure, urine, all excrements, in oil cakes, and largely in wood
                    ashes.</p>
                <p>Most potash salts are very soluble in water; this explains their greater
                    abundance in the liquid than the solid excrements of animals. On this account it
                    is a matter of importance, in making farmyard manure, to preserve the urine, and
                    not lose the benefit of the potash salts it contains. On most soils in a good
                    agricultural condition the addition of potash manures produces little or no
                    effect, but on poor sandy soils or worn-out pasture land the use of potash
                    salts, in conjunction with superphosphate, dissolved bones, and guano, is
                    followed by most beneficial results. Potash salts as an addition to manures for
                    potatoes have been found advantageous, while their effect on pasture seems to be
                    to improve the quality of the herbage rather than to increase the yield of grass
                    per acre.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">4. Soda.—</hi> Most soils contain in abundance all the soda
                    that farm crops require. With the exception of chloride of sodium (common salt),
                    which occasionally is applied with more or less benefit to light sandy soils,
                    and of nitrate of soda, which is employed as a nitrogenous manure, soda salts
                    are not used for manuring purposes.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Lime.—</hi> Lime is essential for the production of healthy
                    crops. Experience has shown that, when a soil is deficient in lime, farmyard
                    manure, Peruvian guano, and other manures, though used in abundance, produce
                    comparatively but little effect. Again, on poor sandy soils, lime, marl, or
                    chalk not unfrequently produces better crops than farmyard or expensive
                    artificial manures. Lime not only supplies an essential constituent of plants,
                    but also prevents the loss by drainage of fertilizing matters such as potash,
                    ammonia, and phosphoric acid. One of the functions of lime in the soil is to
                    combine with the acids of the potash and ammoniacal salts of guano and of
                    farmyard and other manures, and -to liberate potash and ammonia, which are
                    retained in the land, while the inexpensive lime salts pass into the land
                    drainage.</p>
                <p>Lime is used in agriculture in the form of quicklime, chalk (carbonate of lime)·,
                    gypsum (sulphate of lime), marl, and shellsand. For liming purposes gas-lime
                    also is frequently employed, and, if well exposed to the air before being put on
                    the land, may be used with safety and advantage.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Magnesia.—</hi> Magnesia is of but slight importance in
                    manures; it occurs with potash in kainite and other potash salts, and the
                    sulphate is sometimes used in making up artificial manures, but apparently
                    without benefit.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Silica.—</hi> Silica is a constituent of the ashes of all
                    plants, and occurs specially in large proportion in the straw of cereal crops.
                    All soils contain such an abundance of silica that no necessity exists of
                    supplying it artificially.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Chlorine, Sulphuric Acid, and Oxide of Iron.—</hi> These ash
                    constituents are of little practical importance, inasmuch as most soils contain
                    a sufficiency of them to meet the requirements of the crops usually cultivated
                    on the farm. It may be observed, however, that chlorine has been found to be
                    essential to plant life, and that iron is necessary for imparting to plants
                    their green colour.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Organic Matter or Humus.—</hi> The importance of organic
                    matter in manures was formerly much exaggerated. It has been conclusively proved
                    that the carbon of which the bulk of the dry substance of all agricultural
                    produce consists is derived from the carbonic acid of the atmosphere, and not
                    from humus of the soil or the non-nitrogenous organic matters supplied in the
                    manure. The organic matters present in dung in the shape of more or less
                    decomposed or rotten straw exert a beneficial effect by improving the physical
                    condition of both light and heavy land.</p>

                <p>composition varies greatly, according to the quantity of straw used as an
                    absorbent, the nature of the animals, the food they have consumed to produce it,
                    the length of time and way in which it has been kept, &amp;c. The analysis by Dr
                    Voelcker of well-made farmyard manure from horses, cows, and pigs, given in
                    Table IV., p. 509, will show its approximate composition.</p>
                <p>This analysis shows that farmyard manure contains all the constituents, without
                    exception, which are required by cultivated crops to bring them to perfection,
                    and hence it may be called a perfect manure. Dung, it will be observed, contains
                    a great variety of organic and inorganic compounds of various degrees of
                    solubility, and this complexity of composition—difficult, if not impossible, to
                    imitate by art —is one of the reasons which render farmyard manure a perfect as
                    well as a universal manure.</p>
                <p>The excrements of different kinds of animals vary in composition, and those of
                    the same animal will vary according to the nature and quantity of the food
                    given, the age of the animal, and the way it is generally treated. Thus a young
                    animal which is growing needs food to produce bone and muscle, and voids poorer
                    dung than one which is fully grown and only has to keep up its condition. The
                    solid and liquid excrements differ much in composition, for, while the former
                    contains a good deal of phosphoric acid, lime, magnesia, and silica, and
                    comparatively little nitrogen, the urine is almost destitute of phosphoric acid,
                    and abounds in alkaline salts and nitrogenous organic matters, which on
                    decomposition yield ammonia. Unless, therefore, the two kinds of excrements are
                    mixed, a perfect manure supplying all the needs of the plant is not obtained;
                    care must accordingly be taken to absorb all the urine by the litter. Farmyard
                    manure, it is well known, is much affected by the length of time and the way in
                    which it has been kept. Fresh dung is soluble in water only to a limited extent,
                    and in consequence it acts more slowly on vegetation, and the action lasts
                    longer than when dung is used which lias been kept some time; fresh dung is
                    therefore generally used in autumn or winter, and thoroughly rotten dung in
                    spring, when an immediate forcing effect is required.</p>
                <p>The changes which farmyard manure undergoes on keeping are illustrated by the
                    following table of analyses, by Professor Wolff of Hohenheim in Wiirtemberg, of
                    farmyard manure in its different stages of decomposition :—</p>

                <p>Forty tons of dung, according to this estimate, contain in round numbers 448 lb
                    of potash, 475 of phosphoric acid, and 573 of nitrogen.</p>
                <p>During the fermentation of dung a large proportion of the non-nitrogenous organic
                    matters disappears in the form of carbonic acid and water, while another portion
                    is converted into humic acids which effectually fix the ammonia gradually
                    produced from the nitrogenous constituents of the solid and liquid excrements.
                    The mineral matters remain behind entirely in the rotten dung, if care be taken
                    to prevent loss by drainage.</p>
                <p>Well-fermented dung, it will be noticed from the preceding table, is more
                    concentrated and consequently more efficacious than fresh farmyard manure.
                    Neither fresh nor rotten dung contains any appreciable quantity of volatile
                    ammonia, and hence there is no necessity for applying gypsum, dilute acid, green
                    vitriol, or other substances recommended as fixers of ammonia. If dung is carted
                    out into the field and spread out at once it may be left for weeks together
                    before it is ploughed in without the slightest risk of sustaining loss in
                    fertilizing matter by evaporation, for dung does not lose ammonia by evaporation
                    on exposure to the air, and any mineral soluble salts will be washed into the
                    soil where they are wanted. If, however, dung is kept for a length of time in
                    shallow heaps, or in open straw-yards and exposed to rain, it loses by drainage
                    a considerable proportion of its most valuable soluble fertilizing
                    constituents.</p>
                <p>With a view to ascertaining the loss in fertilizing substances which farmyard
                    manure sustains when it is kept for a long time exposed in open yards to the
                    deteriorating influences of rain, Dr Voelcker spread a weighed quantity of fresh
                    dung of known composition in an open yard, and after a period of twelve months
                    again weighed the dung and submitted it to analysis, when the results shown in

                <p>These tabulated results showed that the manure lost G9 ’ 8 per cent, of its
                    fertilizing matters; or, in round numbers, two-thirds of the dung was wasted and
                    only one-third left behind. Thus, after twelve months’ exposure to the weather,
                    nearly all the soluble nitrogen and 78 ’ 2 per cent, of the soluble mineral
                    matters were lost by drainage. To prevent this loss, farmyard manure, as had
                    been already pointed out, should, when possible, be carted into the field,
                    spread out at once, and ploughed in at the convenience of the farmer. It is,
                    however, not always practicable to apply farmyard manure just at the time it is
                    made, and, as the manure heap cannot be altogether dispensed with, it is
                    necessary to see how the manure may best be kept. For proper decomposition both
                    air and moisture are requisite, while extreme dryness or too much water will
                    arrest it. Farmyard manure is either prepared in dung-pits, which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n534/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0534-0511"/> are put in a separate place, or is accumulated
                    under the animal in the feeding-boxes; of the two plans the latter is the
                    better, the urine being more thoroughly absorbed, and, owing to the box manure
                    being more compact through constant treading on it, air enters less freely and
                    the decomposition goes on less rapidly, the volatile matters in consequence not
                    being so readily lost. External agents, such as rain, wind, sun, &lt;fcc., do
                    not affect it as they would in the case of dung-pits. If farmyard manure must be
                    stored in heaps, care should be taken to have the bottom and sides of the pit
                    impermeable to water, and the bottom slightly inclined to allow any liquid
                    manure which collects to run off into a tank below, from which, by means of a
                    pump, it may be again poured over the heap. A concrete bottom for the pit is
                    best, or, failing that, one of thick clay or well-beaten earth. The manure heap
                    should be kept as compact as possible, and always moist. The advantage of
                    farmyard manure lies, not only in its supplying all the constituents of plant
                    food, but also in the improved physical condition of the soil through its
                    application, as the land is kept porous, and air is allowed free access. While,
                    however, farmyard manure has these advantages, experience has shown that
                    artificial manures, properly selected to meet the requirements of the crops
                    intended to be grown, due regard being had to the chemical composition of the
                    soil, may be employed to greater advantage. In farmyard manure about two-thirds
                    of the weight is water and one-third dry matter; a large bulk thus contains only
                    a small proportion of fertilizing substance®, and expense is incurred for
                    carriage of much useless matter when dung has to be carted to distant fields.
                    When a plentiful supply of good farmyard manure can be produced on the farm or
                    bought at a moderate price in the immediate neighbourhood, it is economy to use
                    it either alone or in conjunction with artificial manures; but when food is dear
                    and fattening does not pay, or farmyard manure is expensive to buy, it will be
                    found more economical to use artificial manures.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manures from Feeding Stuffs.—</hi> The investigations of Messrs
                    Lawes, Gilbert, and Mure have shown that, in estimating the value of animal
                    manure, 90 per cent, of the nitrogen of the food may be reckoned to be recovered
                    in the case of feeding cakes, pulse, and other highly nitrogenous feeding
                    stuffs; 85 per cent, in the case of foods comparatively poor in nitrogen, such
                    as cereals and roots; and less than 65 per cent, in the case of bulky feeding
                    stuffs, such as hay and straw. As a source of manure, the value of fattening
                    foods is greater the more nitrogen they contain. Practically speaking, the whole
                    of the mineral constituents and about nine-tenths of the nitrogen of the food
                    are recovered in the dung and urine. For the same weight of dry substance
                    consumed, oxen void more manure than sheep, and sheep more than pigs. The
                    composition of the different foods given to fattening animals being well known,
                    it is easy to calculate the amounts of nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash of
                    the food which will be recovered in the manure. Each constituent having its
                    market value as a manuring constituent, the money value of the manure obtained
                    from the consumption of a ton of any ordinary food of which the composition is
                    known can be determined. Assuming ammonia to be worth 8d. per lb, potash 2d. per
                    lb, and phosphate of lime Id. per K&gt;, the money value of the manure produced
                    by the consumption of a ton of various foods is given by Mr Lawes in the
                    following table (VII.), which also shows the general composition of the
                    different foods as far as their manurial value is concerned.</p>
                <p>In these estimates it is presumed that the manure can be put on the land without
                    loss, but in practice some loss is unavoidable; it may be but slight, as, for
                    instance, when sheep are fed on the land, or when the manure is made in
                    feeding-boxes, but it will be considerable when the food has been consumed in
                    open yards in a very rainy season. Allowances must thus be made for the
                    circumstances under which the manure was produced.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Artificial Manures.—</hi> By some a distinction has been drawn
                    between those manures which, like superphosphate, dissolved bones, &lt;fcc., are
                    manufactured in chemical works and those which are produced naturally, such as
                    guano, nitrate of soda, &amp;c. However, the term artificial manure is generally
                    applied to all manures, natural or manufactured, which are not produced on the
                    farm, as distinguished from farmyard manure and manure from purchased foods,
                    which are essentially farm products. The value of all manures mainly depends on
                    their chemical composition.</p>
                <p>As compared with farmyard manure, artificial manures have the disadvantage that
                    they, unlike it, do not improve the physical condition of the soil. Artificial
                    manures have, on the other hand, the advantage over farmyard manure that they
                    can supply in a small compass, and even if used in small quantity, the needed
                    nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash, &amp;c., which crops require, and which
                    farmyard manure has but in small proportion ∙, they present the expensive
                    fertilizing matters in a concentrated form, and by their application save
                    expense in labour and carriage.</p>
                <p>The following are the principal artificial manures in use :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Nitrogenous Manures.—Penman Guano.—</hi> This is a natural
                    manure, valuable on account of the ammonia, phosphoric acid, and potash it
                    contains. It is the excrement, &amp;c., of sea birds accumulated in parts where
                    no rain falls. The earliest deposits found contained as much as 14 to 17 per
                    cent, of ammonia, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Chinches Island guano; those now
                    (1882) imported seldom exceed 8 per cent., and generally vary from 4 to 8
                    percent., of ammonia. In using guano it should be mixed with earth, &amp;c., to
                    prevent injury to the seeds or plants. Peruvian guano is also treated with
                    sulphuric acid, which renders the phosphates soluble and fixes the ammonia,
                    thereby preventing any loss of it; this constitutes dissolved guano, and is
                    frequently sold upon a guarantee of 20 per cent, of soluble phosphates, 4 per
                    cent, of insoluble phosphates, and 9 per cent, of ammonia. Peruvian guano is
                    used as a top dressing for wheai and barley; in addition to insoluble
                    phosphates, it contains soluble phosphates of the alkalies.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0535-0512"/>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ammonia Salts.—</hi> The principal one is sulphate of ammonia,
                    largely produced in gas works by neutralizing gas liquor with sulphuric acid; it
                    is usually sold on a basis of 24 to 25 per cent, of ammonia.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Soot</hi> is valuable on account of the sulphate of ammonia it
                    contains; the percentage of ammonia varies from 1⅛ to 4.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nitrate of soda</hi> is a natural deposit; it is greatly used
                    as a top dressing for wheat and barley. It usually contains common salt, and
                    when purified is sold on a basis of 95 per cent, of pure nitrate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Organic Nitrogenous Substances.—</hi> Wool, hair, fish, flesh,
                    horn, blood, rape cake, damaged cotton cake and other oil cakes. Wool refuse
                    (shoddy), according to its quality, contains from 4 to 8 per cent, of nitrogen,
                    flesh 14 to 15 per cent., blood (dried) 13 to 15 per cent., rape cake 4 to 5 per

                    The basis of these is superphosphate, which is mixed with other manuring
                    materials to meet the special requirements of particular crops and soils.</p>
                <p>The foregoing remarks made on the application of manures to different kinds of
                    crops may now in conclusion be summed up. Farmyard manure, in order to be most
                    beneficial, should be applied as quickly as possible after it is made, the best
                    time being in autumn or early winter. Nitrate of soda should be applied as a top
                    dressing early in spring; its effect will be seen in the first season only.
                    Ammonia salts, guano, dung, &amp;c., are best applied to heavy land in autumn or
                    winter, either before the seed is sown, or after the plant is fairly above
                    ground, but in the case of light land early in spring. The effect of bones in
                    the Various form of dissolved bones, bone dust, raw bones, &amp;c., will last
                    two or more seasons according to the.quantities used and their respective
                    solubility. Lastly, it may be observed that the presence of lime is essential to
                    the economical use of manures.</p>
                <p>As regards cereal crops, it has been found that mineral manures alone, whether
                    simple or complex, do not produce appreciable increase of crop, but that
                    nitrogenous manures, whether as ammonia salts, nitrate of soda, or farmyard
                    manure, greatly benefit the crop; that nitrate of soda does rather better than
                    ammonia salts.; and that, while on fairly heavy land farmyard manure will yield
                    good crops, the best results are obtained by using mineral and nitrogenous
                    manures together. On clay soils a top dressing of nitrate of soda often answers
                    all practical purposes, but on light soils nitrate of soda or ammonia salts
                    should not be used without mineral manures, while it is advisable even on heavy
                    land to use superphosphate as well.</p>
                <p>For root crops, on cold clays nothing answers so well as mineral superphosphate
                    alone, but on light land dissolved bones, bone dust, precipitated phosphate, or
                    a compound artificial manure will be found to be much preferable to
                    superphosphate. Bone meal mixed with mineral superphosphate makes, for instance,
                    a good manure for roots; for mangolds Peruvian guano and common salt in addition
                    are useful, and for potatoes potash salts with phosphatic and nitrogenous
                    manures.</p>
                <p>For pasture land the use of artificial manures is, as a rule, not economical;
                    nitrogenous manures raise the quantity and phosphatic and potash manures improve
                    the quality of the herbage, while, for worn-out pastures, potash with dissolved
                    bones or superphosphate or superphosphate and guano will do much good. The most
                    economical way of manuring pasture land is to apply farmyard manure liberally,
                    or feed it off with cattle, giving cotton cake in addition.</p>
                <p>The employment of artificial manures in a judicious manner has shown the occupier
                    of land that it is not necessary for him to be bound down to any system of
                    rotation of crops which may be practised in his particular district, but that he
                    has the means of pursuing the course of cropping, system of manuring, and
                    general management of his farm which will yield him the best returns. No more
                    striking instance of this could be put forward than the experience of Mr Prout,
                    who at Sawbridgeworth, Herts, has grown with much success cereal crops, year
                    after year, on heavy clay land, selling the whole of the growing crops, and
                    restoring the fertility of the soil by artificial manures. The land was
                    purchased in 1861, and up to the present time (1882) the crops have been as good
                    as ever, and the land has not been deteriorated, but on the other hand improved,
                    by continuous corn growing. The experiments of Messrs Lawes and Gilbert at
                    Rothamsted and of Dr Voelcker at Woburn have been thus verified on a large scale
                    in the experience of Mr Prout, and have shown beyond all possibility of doubt
                    the efficacy and economy of a liberal use of artificial manures. <hi
