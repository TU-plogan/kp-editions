                    from the nitrous earth in which the cave abounded; but it is now mainly turned
                    to account as a place of exhibition.</p>
                <p>The cavernous limestone of Kentucky covers an area of 8000 square miles, is
                    massive and homogeneous, and belongs to the Subcarboniferous period. It shows
                    few traces of dynamic disturbance, but has been carved, since the Miocene epoch,
                    into many caverns, of which the Mammoth Cave is the noblest specimen known. The
                    region is undulating, "but its valleys are mostly funnel-shaped depressions
                    emptying through fissures into subterranean streams, which feed rivers, often of
                    navigable size, and whose waters are never frozen over, even in severe winters.
                    Such valleys are called sink-holes.</p>
                <p>The natural arch that admits one to Mammoth Cave has a span of 70 feet, and from
                    a ledge above it a cascade leaps 50 feet to the rocks below, where it
                    disappears. A winding flight of stone steps leads the way down to a narrow
                    passage, through which the air rushes with violence, outward in summer, and
                    inward in winter. The temperature of the cave is uniformly 54° Fahr, throughout
                    the year, and the atmosphere is both chemically and optically of singular
                    purity. While the lower levels are moist from the large pools that have secret
                    connexion with Green river, the upper galleries are extremely dry. These
                    conditions led, at one time, to the erection of thirteen cottages, at a point
                    about 1 mile under ground, for the use of invalids, especially consumptives. The
                    experiment ended in failure, and only two cottages now remain.</p>
                <p>The Main Cave, from 40 to 300 feet wide, and from 35 to 125 feet high, has
                    several vast rooms, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    t</hi> the Rotunda, where are the ruins of the old saltpetre works; the Star
                    Chamber, where the protrusion of white crystals through a coating of the black
                    oxide of manganese creates an optical illusion of great beauty; the Chief City,
                    where an area of 2 acres is covered by a vault 125 feet high, and the floor is
                    strewn with rocky fragments, among which are found numerous half-burnt torches
                    made of canes, and other signs of prehistoric occupancy. Two skeletons were
                    exhumed near the Rotunda; but no other bones of any description have been found.
                    The so-called Mammoth Cave “mummies” <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> bodies kept
                    by being inhumed in nitrous earth), with accompanying utensils, ornaments,
                    braided sandals, and other relics, were found in Short and Salt caves near by,
                    and removed to Mammoth Cave for exhibition. The Main Cave, which abruptly ends 4
                    miles from the entrance, is joined by winding passages, with spacious galleries
                    on different levels; and, although the diameter of the area of the whole cavern
                    is less than 10 miles, the combined length of all accessible avenues is supposed
                    to be about 150 miles.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The present manager, Mr F. Klett, has undertaken the difficult task of a
                    thorough survey, the results of which, so far as completed, are presented in the
                    accompanying map. The portion beyond River Hall is supplemented from an older
                    survey by Stephen, the guide.</p></note></p>

                <p>The chief points of interest are arranged along two lines of exploration, besides
                    which there are certain side excursions. The “short route” requires about four
                    hours, and the “long route” nine. Audubon’s Avenue, the one nearest the
                    entrance, is seldom visited, except by the bats that hang from the walls in
                    clusters like swarms of bees. The Gothic Avenue contains numerous large
                    stalactites and stalagmites, and an interesting place called the Chapel, and
                    ends in a small double dome and cascade. Among the most surprising features of
                    cave scenery are the vertical shafts that pierce through all levels, from the
                    uppermost galleries, or even from the sink-holes, down to the lowest floor.
                    These are styled pits or domes, according to the position occupied by the
                    observer. A crevice behind a block of stone 40 feet long by 20 wide, called the
                    Giant’s Coflin, admits the explorer to a place where six pits, varying in depth
                    from 65 feet to 220 feet, exist in an area of 600 yards. This includes Gorin’s
                    Dome, which is viewed from a point midway in its side, and is by many regarded
                    as the finest room in the cavern. Others admire more the Mammoth Dome, at the
                    termination of Spark’s Avenue, where a cataract falls from a height of 250 feet
                    amid walls wonderfully draped with stalactitic tapestry. The Egyptian Temple,
                    which is a continuation of the Mammoth Dome, contains six massive columns, two
                    of them quite perfect, and 80 feet high and 25 feet in diameter. The combined
                    length of these contiguous chambers is 400 feet. By a crevice above they are
                    connected with an arm of Audubon’s Avenue. Lucy’s Dome, about 300 feet high, is
                    supposed to be the loftiest of all these vertical shafts. A pit called “the
                    Maelstrom,” in Croghan’s Hall, is the spot most remote from the mouth of the
                    cave; a son of Prentice, the poet, permitted himself to be lowered 190 feet by a
                    rope to the bottom, in 1859. There are some fine stalactites near this pit, and
                    others in the Fairy Grotto and in Pensico Avenue; but, considering the magnitude
                    of Mammoth Cave, its poverty of stalactitic ornamentation is remarkable. The
                    wealth of crystals is, however, surprising. These are of endless variety and
                    fantastic beauty. Besides the sparkling vault of the Star Chamber (300 feet long
                    and 80 high), there are halls canopied by fleecy clouds, or studded with mimic
                    snowballs, and others displaying various grotesque resemblances on the walls and
                    ceiling.</p>
                <p>Cleveland’s Cabinet and Marion’s Avenue, each a mile long, are adorned by myriads
                    of gypsum rosettes and curiously twisted crystals, called “oulopholites.” These
                    cave flowers are unfolded by pressure, as if a sheaf were forced through a tight
                    binding, ami the crystal fibres curl outward from the centre of the group. Thus
                    spotless arches of 50 feet span are embellished by floral clusters and garlands,
                    hiding nearly every foot of the grey limestone. The botryoidal formations
                    hanging by thousands in Mary’s Vineyard resemble mimic clusters of grapes, as
                    the oulopholites resemble roses. Again there are chambers with drifts of snowy
                    crystals of the sulphate of magnesia, the ceilings so thickly covered with their
                    efflorescence that a loud concussion of the air will cause them to fall like the
                    flakes of a snow storm.</p>
                <p>Many small rooms and tortuous paths, where nothing of special interest can be
                    found, are avoided as much as possible on the regular routes; but certain
                    disagreeable experiences are inevitable. There is peril also in the vicinity of
                    the deep pits. The one known as the Bottomless Pit was for many years a barrier
                    to all further exploration, but is now crossed by a wooden bridge. Long before
                    the shaft had been cut as deep as now, the water flowed away by a channel
                    gradually contracting to a serpentine way, so extremely narrow as to be called
                    the Fat Man’s Misery. The walls, only 18 inches apart, change direction eight
                    times in 105 yards, while the distance from the sandy path to the ledge overhead
                    is but 5 feet. The rocky sides are finely marked with waves and ripples, as if
                    running water had suddenly been petrified. This winding way conducts one to
                    River Hall, beyond which lie the crystalline gardens that have been described.
                    It used to be said that, if this narrow passage were blocked up, escape would be
                    impossible; but lately an intricate web of fissures, called the Corkscrew, has
                    been discovered, by means of which a good climber, ascending only a few hundred
                    feet, lands 1000 yards from the mouth of the cave, and cuts off one or two
                    miles.</p>
                <p>The waters, entering through numerous domes and pits, and falling, during the
                    rainy season, in cascades of great volume, are finally collected in River Hall,
                    where they form several extensive lakes, or rivers, whose connexion with Green
                    riveι ’ is known to be in two deep springs appearing under arches on its margin.
                    Whenever there is a freshet in Green river the streams in the cave are joined in
                    a continuous body of water, the rise sometimes being 60 feet above the low-water
                    mark. The subsidence within is less rapid than the rise; and the streams are
                    impassable for about seven months in each year. They are navigable from May to
                    October, and furnish interesting features of cave scenery. The first approached
                    is called the Dead Sea, embraced by cliffs 60 feet high and 100 feet long, above
                    which a path has been made, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n473/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0473-0450"/> whence a stairway conducts us down to the banks
                    of the River Styx, a body of water 40 feet wide and 400 feet long, crossed by a
                    natural bridge. Lake Lethe comes next—a broad basin enclosed by walls 90 feet
                    high, below which a narrow path leads to a pontoon at the neck of the lake. A
                    beach of the finest yellow sand extends for 500 yards to Echo river, the largest
                    of all, being from 20 to 200 feet wide, 10 to 40 feet deep, and about
                    three-quarters of a mile long. It is crossed by boats. The arched passage-way is
                    very symmetrical, varying in height from 10 to 35 feet, and famous for its
                    musical reverberations,—not a distinct echo, but an harmonious prolongation of
                    sound for from 10 to 30 seconds after the original tone is produced. "The long
                    vault has a certain keynote of its own, which, when firmly struck, excites
                    harmonics, including tones of incredible depth and sweetness.</p>
                <p>The fauna of Mammoth Cave has been classified by Putman, Packard, and Cope, who
                    have catalogued twenty-eight species truly subterraneous, besides those that may
                    be regarded as stragglers from the surface. They are distributed thus:— <hi
                    rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> 4 species; <hi rend="italic">Insecta,</hi> 11;
                    <hi rend="italic">Arachnida,</hi> 6; <hi rend="italic">Myriapoda,</hi> 2; <hi
                    rend="italic">Crustacea,</hi> 2; <hi rend="italic">Vermes,</hi> 3. Ehrenberg
                    adds a list of 8 Polygastric <hi rend="italic">Infusoria,</hi> 1 fossil
                    infusorian, 5 <hi rend="italic">Phytolitharia,</hi> and several microscopic
                    fungi. A bed of <hi rend="italic">Agaricus</hi> was found by the writer near the
                    River Styx; and upon this hint an attempt has been made to propagate edible
                    fungi in this locality. The most interesting inhabitants of Mammoth Cave are the
                    blind, wingless grasshoppers, with extremely long antennae; blind, colourless
                    crayfish <hi rend="italic">{Cambar us</hi><hi rend="italic">pellucidus,</hi>
                    Telk.); and the blind fish, <hi rend="italic">Amblyopsis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >spclaeus,</hi> colourless and viviparous, from 1 inch to 6 inches long. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Cambarus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Amblyopsis</hi> have wide
                    distribution, being found in many other caves, and also in deep wells, in
                    Kentucky and Indiana. Fish not blind are occasionally caught, which are
                    apparently identical with species existing in streams outside. The true
                    subterranean fauna may be regarded as chiefly of Pleistocene origin; yet certain
                    forms are possibly remnants of Tertiary life. The strongly marked divergence of
                    these animals from those found outside convinced the elder Agassiz that they
                    were specially created for the limits within which they dwell. But the opinion
                    now held is that they are modified from allied species existing in the sunlight,
                    and that their peculiarities may all be accounted for on principles of
                    evolution,—the process being accelerated (or retarded) by their migration from
                    the outer world to a realm of absolute silence and perpetual darkness.</p>
                <p>The literature of Mammoth Cave is extensive, though scattered through
                    manyperiodicals, volumes of travels, and scientific reports. See especially
