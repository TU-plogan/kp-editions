                    a brave and distinguished soldier, was one of the garrison of the Capitol while
                    besieged by the Gauls; when they attempted to scale the rock by night, Manlius,
                    aroused by the cackling of the sacred geese, rushed to the spot and threw down
                    the foremost. Several years after, seeing a centurion led to prison for debt, he
                    freed him with his own money, and even sold his estate to relieve other poor
                    debtors, while he accused the senate of embezzling public money. He was charged
                    with aspiring to kingship, and condemned by the comitia, but not until the
                    assembly had adjourned to a place without the walls, where they could no longer
                    see the Capitol which he had saved. His house on the Capitol was razed, and the
                    Manlii resolved that no patrician Manlius should henceforth bear the name of
                    Marcus.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Titus Manlius</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Imperiosus
                    Torquatus</hi> went to the tribune Pomponius, who had brought his father to
                    trial for overstepping the limits of his office, and threatened to kill him
                    unless he desisted from the accusation (365 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi>
                    Shortly after he slew a gigantic Gaul in single combat, and took from him a
                    torques or neck-ornament, whence his surname is said to have been derived. When
                    the Latins demanded an equal share in the government of the confederacy, Manlius
                    vowed to kill with his own hand the first Latin he saw in the senate-house. The
                    Latins and Campanians revolted, and Manlius, consul for the third time, marched
                    into Campania and gained two great victories, near Vesuvius (where Decius his
                    colleague devoted himself to gain the day), and at Trifanum. In this campaign
                    Manlius executed his own son, who had killed an enemy in single combat, and thus
                    disobeyed the express command of the consuls.</p>
                <p>Both these Manlii belong to a great extent to legend, much of which is probably
                    due to attempts to explain their surnames.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Titus Manlius</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Torquatus</hi>
                    in his first consulship (235 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) subjugated
                    Sardinia, recently acquired from the Carthaginians; he was consul again (224)
                    during the Gallic war. In 216 he opposed the ransoming of the Romans taken
                    prisoners at Cannae; and in 215 he was sent to Sardinia and defeated a
                    Carthaginian attempt to regain possession of the island.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Cnaeus</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Manlius</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Vulso,</hi> consul in 189 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.,</hi>
                    received Asia as his province. Starting from Ephesus in the spring, he marched
                    into Pamphylia, levying enormous contributions. He then attacked the Celts of
                    Galatia on the pretext that they had aided Antiochus. They took refuge in Mounts
                    Olympus and Magaba, but the missiles of the Roman light troops won each position
                    with great slaughter. In the winter, assisted by ten delegates sent from Rome,
                    he settled the terms of peace with Antiochus. He returned to Rome in 187, and
                    triumphed after much opposition. The discipline of his army was loose, and his
                    soldiers brought into Rome many foreign luxuries.</p>
