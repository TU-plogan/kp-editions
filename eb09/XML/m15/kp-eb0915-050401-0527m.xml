                    suburbs of Borgo di Fortezza to the north and Borgo di San Giorgio to the east,
                    may still be said to consist, as it formerly did mo’e distinctly, of two islands
                    separated by a narrow channel and united by a number of bridges. On the west
                    side lies Lago Superiore, on the east side Lago Inferiore —the boundary between
                    the two being marked by the <hi rend="italic">Argine del Mulino,</hi> a long
                    covered wooden bridge stretching northward from the north-west angle of the
                    city. As approached from the north by the old road, Mantua presents a beautiful
                    prospect with its “towers and walls and waters.” On the highest ground in the
                    city rises the cathedral, built after his death according to the plans of Giulio
                    Romano on the site of the ancient church of Sts Peter and Paul; it has double
                    aisles, a dome-covered transept, and a large tower, popularly assigned to the
                    Roman governor Arius. Architecturally much more important is the church of St
                    Andrew, built towards the close of the 15th century, after plans by Leon
                    Battista Alberti, and consisting of a single barrel-vaulted nave 350 feet long
                    by 62 feet wide. It has a noble façade, with a deeply recessed portico, and a
                    brick campanile of earlier date than the main building. The interior is richly
                    decorated with 18th century frescos. S. Maria delle Grazie, consecrated in 1399
                    as an act of thanksgiving for the cessation of the plague, has a curious
                    collection of <hi rend="italic">ex voto</hi> pictures and the tombs of the
                    Gonzaga family. The old ducal palace—one of the largest buildings of its kind in
                    Europe—was commenced in 1302 for Guido Bonaccolsi, and. probably completed in
                    1328 for Ludovico Gonzaga; but many of the accessory apartments are of much
                    later date, and the interior decorations are for the most part the work of
                    Giulio Romano and his pupils. Outside of the city, to the south of Porta
                    Pusterla, stands the Palazzo del Te, Giulio’s architectural masterpiece, erected
                    for Frederick Gonzaga; of the numerous fresco-covered chambers which it
                    contains, perhaps the most celebrated is the Sala dei Giganti, where, by a
                    combination of mechanical with artistic devices, the rout of the Titans still
                    contending with artillery of uptorn rocks against the pursuit and thunderbolts
                    of Jove appears to rush downwards on the spectator. Among the educational
                    institutions in Mantua are an academy of arts and sciences <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Accademia Vergiliana)</hi> occupying a fine building erected by Piermarini, a
                    public library founded in 1780 by Maria Theresa, a museum of antiquities dating
                    from 1779, a good botanical garden, and an observatory. The Monte di Pietà was
                    established in 1484, the civil hospital in 1449, Oil, beer, leather, and playing
                    cards are the chief products of the limited local industry. The population
                    increased from 26,687 in 1871 to 28,048 in 1881. Asa fortress Mantua was long
                    one of the most formidable in Europe, a force of thirty to forty thousand men
                    finding accommodation within its walls; but it had two serious defects—the
                    marshy climate told heavily on the health of the garrison, and effective sorties
                    were almost impossible.</p>
                <p>Mantua was originally an Etruscan town, and had still a strong Etruscan element
                    in its population during the Boman period. It was a Roman municipium; but
                    Martial calls it little Mantua, and, had it not been for Virgil’s interest in
                    his native place and in the expulsion of a number of the Mantuana from their
                    lands in favour of Octavian’s soldiers, we should probably have heard almost
                    nothing of its existence. In 568 the Lombards found Mantua a walled town of some
                    strength; recovered from their grasp in 590 by the exarch of Ravenna, it was
                    again captured by Λgilulf in 601. The 9th century was the period of episcopal
                    supremacy, and in the 11th the cityformed part of the vast possessions of
                    Bonifacio, marquis of Canossa. From him it passed to Geoffrey, duke of Lorraine,
                    and afterwards to the Countess Matilda, whose support of the pope led to the
                    conquest of Mantua by the emperor Henry IV. in 1090. Reduced to obedience by
                    Matilda in 1113, the city obtained its liberty on her death, and instituted a
                    communal government of its own, <hi rend="italic">salva imperiali justitia.</hi>
                    It afterwards joined the Lombard League; and the unsuccessful attack made by
                    Frederick II. in 1236 brought it a confirmation of its privileges. But after a
                    period of internal discord Ludovico Gonzaga attained to power (1328), and was
                    recognized as imperial vicar (1329); and from that time till the death of
                    Ferdinando Carbo in 1708 the Gonzagas were masters of Mantua (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Gonzaga,</hi> vol. x. p. 772). Under Gian Francesco II.,
                    Ludovico, and Federico II., the first duke of Mantua, the city rose rapidly into
                    importance as a seat of industry and culture. Claimed in 1708 as a fief of the
                    empire by Joseph I., it was governed for the greater part of the century by the
                    Austrians. In June 1796 it was besieged by Napoleon; but in spite of terrific
                    bombardments it held out till February 1797. A three days’ bombardment in 1799
                    again placed Mantua in the hands of the Austrians; and, though restored to the
                    French by the peace of Lunéville (1801), it became Austrian once more from 1814
                    till 1866. In the years between 1849 and 1859 the city was the scene of violent
                    political persecution.</p>
                <p>Besides Virgil, Mantua counts among its celebrities Sordello the Provençal poet,
                    Castiglioni, Folengo the writer of macaronies, and Pomponazzi the philosopher;
                    and it has a long roll of local historians—Donesmondi (ecclesiastical affairs),
                    Possevino, Daino, Amedei, Visi, Tonelli, and Count Carlo d’Arco.</p>
