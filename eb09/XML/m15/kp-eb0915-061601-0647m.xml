                    wine merchant, it is said of Jewish origin, and was born at Nice on May 6, 1758.
                    His parents were very poor, and he began life as a cabin boy. He did not care
                    much for the sea, and in 1775 enlisted in the Regiment Royal Italien, a regiment
                    of Italians in the pay of France. He quickly rose to be underofficer-adjutant;
                    but, finding his birth would prevent his ever getting a commission, he left the
                    army in 1789, retired to his native city, and married. At the sound of war, <pb

                    service increased, and he once more left Italy, and joined the 3d battalion of
                    the volunteers of the Var in 1792. In those days when men elected their
                    officers, and nearly all the old commissioned officers were dead or had
                    emigrated, promotion to a man with a knowledge of his drill was rapid, and by
                    April 1793 Masséna was chef de bataillon, or colonel. His regiment was one of
                    those in the army of General Anselme, which was ordered to occupy Nice, and his
                    knowledge of the country, of the language, and of the people was so useful that
                    in December he was already general of division. In command of the advanced guard
                    he won the battle of Saorgio in August 1794, capturing ninety guns, and after
                    many successes he at last, on November 23, 1795, with the right wing of the army
                    of Italy, won the great victory of Loano, in which four thousand Austrians and
                    Sardinians were put hors de combat. In Bonaparte’s great campaigns of 1796 and
                    1797 Masséna was his most trusted general of division; in each battle he won
                    fresh laurels, until the crowning victory of Rivoli, from which he afterwards
                    took his title. It was during this campaign that Bonaparte gave him the title of
                    <hi rend="italic">enfant</hi><hi rend="italic">chéri de la victoire,</hi> which
                    he was to justify till he met the English in 1810. Masséna’s next important
                    service was in command of the army in Switzerland, which united the army in
                    Germany under Moreau, and that in Italy under Joubert. There he proved himself à
                    great general; the archduke Charles and Suwaroff had each been successful in
                    Germany and in Italy, and now turned upon Masséna in Switzerland. That general
                    held his ground well against the archduke, and then suddenly, leaving Soult to
                    face the Austrians, he transported his army to Ziirich, where, on September 26,
                    1799, he entirely defeated Suwaroff, taking two hundred guns and five thousand
                    prisoners. His campaign and battle placed his reputation on a level with that of
                    his compatriot Bonaparte, and he might have made the revolution of Brumaire, but
                    he was sincerely attached to the republic, and had no ambition beyond a desire
                    to live well and have plenty of money to spend. Bonaparte, now first consul,
                    sent him to Genoa to command the débris of the army of Italy, and he nobly
                    defended Genoa from February to June to the very last extremity, giving time for
                    Bonaparte to strike his great blow at Marengo. He now went to Paris, where he
                    sat in tue Corps Législatif in 1803, and defended Moreau, but where Napoleon
                    took his measure, and did not interfere with him. In 1804 he was made one of the
                    first marshals of France of the new régime, and in 1805 was decorated with the
                    Grand Eagle of the Legion of Honour. In that year Napoleon needed an able
                    general to keep in check the archduke Charles in Italy, while he advanced
                    through Germany with the grand army. Masséna was chosen; he kept the archduke
                    occupied till he got news of the surrender of Ulm, and then on October 30th
                    utterly defeated him in the battle of Caldiero. After the peace of Pressburg had
                    been signed, Masséna was ordered to take possession of the kingdom of Naples,
                    and to place Joseph Bonaparte on the throne. This task done, Napoleon summoned
                    Masséna to Poland, where he as usual distinguished himself, and where he for the
                    time gave up his republican principles, and was made duke of Rivoli. In the
                    campaign of 1809 he covered himself with glory at Landshut and at Eckmühl, and
                    finally at the little village of Essling, which he held with such determination
                    that Napoleon had some right to call his otherwise complete defeat of Aspern a
                    victory. When the retreat to the island of Lobau was ordered, it was Masséna who
                    covered the broken regiments, and held the <hi rend="italic">tête du
                    pont</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and on the field of Wagram it was Masséna who,
                    though too ill to ride, directed from his carriage the movements of the right
                    wing, and recovered the honour of France. For his great services he was created
                    prince of Essling, and given the princely castle of Thouars. He was then ordered
                    to Spain to “drive the English into the sea.” The campaigns of 1810 and 1811,
                    the advance to and the retreat from Torres Vedras, are well known from Napier’s
                    history, who does full justice to Wellington’s great opponent. Masséna himself
                    ascribed his failure to the frequent disobedience of his three subordinate
                    generals Ney, Reynier, and Junot, and with some justice; but he alone could have
                    stayed so long before the lines, and could have made the long halt at Santarem,
                    which checked Wellington so thoroughly. The retreat was as finely conducted as
                    the advance, and would have been even more triumphant had Ney obeyed orders.
                    Even then he was again ready to try his fortune, and nearly defeated Wellington
                    at Fuentes d’Onoro, though much hampered by Bessières. Recalled with ignominy,
                    his prestige gone, the old marshal felt he had a right to complain of Ney and of
                    Napoleon himself, and, it is said, opened communications with Fouché, and the
                    remnant of the republican party. Whether this be true or not, Napoleon gave his
                    greatest marshal no more employment in the field, but made him merely commandant
                    of the 8th military division, ∖vith his headquarters at Marseilles. This command
                    he still held at the restoration of the Bourbons, when Louis XVIII. confirmed
                    him in it, and gave him letters of naturalization, as if the great leader of the
                    French armies had not ceased to be an Italian. When Napoleon returned from Elba,
                    Massena, probably by the advice of Fouché, kept Marseilles quiet to await
                    events, the greatest service he could do the royalists, but afterwards imputed
                    to him as a fault. After the second restoration Masséna was summoned to sit on
                    the court martial which tried Marshal Ney, but, though he had been on bad terms
                    with that general, and attributed his own disgrace to him, the old soldier would
                    not be his comrade’s judge. This refusal was used by the royalists to cruelly
                    attack the marshal, against whom they raked up every offence they could think
                    of, and whose victories they forgot. This annoyance shortened his life, and on
                    the 4th April 1817 the old hero died. He was buried in Père-la-Chaise, with only
                    the word “Masséna” upon his tombstone.</p>
                <p>In private life indolent, greedy, rapacious, ill-educated, morose, on the field
                    of battle Masséna λvas a man of genius, prompt in resource, indefatigable,

                    his indolence, but in his quickness of resource a real compatriot of Napoleon
                    himself.</p>
