                    (1790-1856), popularly known as Father Mathew, the “Apostle of Temperance,” was
                    descended from an illegitimate branch of the Llandaff family, and was born at
                    Thomastown, Tipperary, on October 10, 1790. He received his school education at
                    Kilkenny, whence he passed for a short time to Maynooth; from 1808 to 1814 he
                    studied at Dublin, where in the latter year he was ordained to the priesthood.
                    Having entered the Capuchin order, he, after a brief time of service at
                    Kilkenny, joined the mission in Cork, which was the scene of his religious and
                    benevolent labours for many years. The movement with which his name is most
                    intimately associated began in 1838 with the establishment of a total abstinence
                    association, which in less than nine months, thanks to his moral influence and
                    eloquence, enrolled no fewer than 150,000 names. It rapidly spread to Limerick
                    and elsewhere, and some idea of its popularity may be formed from the fact that
                    at Nenagh 20,000 persons are said to have taken the pledge in one day, 100,000
                    at Galway in two days, and 70,000 in Dublin in five days.</p>

                <p>In 1844 he visited Liverpool, Manchester, and London with almost equal success.
                    Meanwhile the expenses of his enterprise had involved him in heavy liabilities,
                    and led on one occasion to his arrest for debt; from this embarrassment he was
                    only partially relieved by a pension of £300 granted by the queen in 1847. In
                    1849 he paid a visit to the United States, returning in 1851. He died at
                    Queenstown on December 8, 1856, See <hi rend="italic">Father Mathew, a
                        Biography,</hi> by J. F. Maguire, M.P. (1863).</p>
