                <p><label type="entry">MALMESBURY, <hi rend="smallcaps">William of</hi></label>, an
                    historical writer of t∩e 12th century, the date of whose birth is usually
                    assigned to the year 1095, but may with more probability be placed some twenty
                    years earlier. It may reasonably be conjectured from his own statement
                    (“utriusque gentis sanguinem traho ”) that he was the son of a Norman father and
                    an English mother; he undoubtedly represents the fusion of the two races,
                    although his sympathies as a writer are unmistakably on the side of the
                    conquerors. He received his early education at the ancient Benedictine abbey at
                    Malmesbury, and he speaks of Aldhelm, bishop of Sherborne, the great benefactor
                    and second founder of that house, who died in 709, as his “lord and patron,” to
                    whom he was indebted both for his life and his learning <hi rend="italic"

                    273). The earliest known incident in his personal history is the fact, which he
                    himself records, that he assisted the abbot Godefrey in collecting books to form
                    the first library of the abbey. William himself subsequently became the
                    librarian, and was also precentor of the abbey; in 1140 he received the offer of
                    the abbacy, an honour which he declined, probably from a desire to secure as
                    much leisure as possible for study. In his later life he was honoured by the
                    particular friendship of Robert, earl of Gloucester, a natural son of Henry I.,
                    and a distinguished patron of learned men and letters. In politics he was a warm
                    partisan of the empress Matilda against Stephen, and he was present at the
                    council of Winchester convened by her supporters in 1141. His death is supposed
                    to have occurred in or after 1142.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Printed Works.—</hi> William’s earliest important work was the
                        <hi rend="italic">Gesta</hi><hi rend="italic">Regum Anglorum,</hi> which he
                    dedicated to his patron, the earl of Gloucester. It was originally completed in
                    1120, but subsequently brought down to 1128. It extends from 449 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> to the twentyeighth year of the reign of Henry
                    I., and is a record of the highest value, preserving from unknown sources
                    numerous facts which would otherwise be lost to us. In 1125 William completed
                    his <hi rend="italic">Gesta Pontificum</hi><hi rend="italic">Anglorum.</hi> He
                    himself tells us that the production of this work cost him especial pains, but
                    that the material for its composition was neither so abundant nor so easily
                    reducible <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n358/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0915-0358-0337"/> to consistency as that for the <hi
                        rend="italic">Gesta</hi><hi rend="italic">Regum.</hi> The work may be
                    regarded as the main source for our early ecclesiastical history, and
                    constitutes the basis of later productions relating to the same subject at the
                    same period. It is divided into five books, the bishops being grouped under
                    their respective sees, and the chief monasteries under their jurisdiction being
                    also noticed, sometimes at considerable length. The fifth book is mainly
                    occupied by the life of St Aldhelm, and includes numerous details of interest
                    not given in the earlier life by Faricius. The <hi rend="italic">Gesta
                        Pontificum</hi> is likewise brought by further additions down to the year
                    1140. William’s last work was a continuation of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Gesta</hi><hi rend="italic">Regum</hi> under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">Novella.</hi> It concludes abruptly with the
                    escape of Matilda from Oxford when besieged there by Stephen in 1142, and the
                    manner of its termination suggests that the narrative was broken off by the
                    death of the writer. Like the <hi rend="italic">Gesta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Regum,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi> is dedicated to the duke of
                    Gloucester, whose doings in behalf of his sister Matilda are described in such a
                    way äs to make him in a great measure the central figure of the narrative. Other
                    printed writings of William are an account of the church of Glastonbury
                    (included along with the life of St Aldhelm in Gale’s <hi rend="italic"

                    in the second volume of Wharton’s <hi rend="italic">Anglia Sacra.</hi> The best
                    text of the <hi rend="italic">Gesta</hi><hi rend="italic">Regum</hi> and the <hi

                    Sir T. D. Hardy in the edition published by the English Historical Society in
                    1840; the text in Savile’s <hi rend="italic">Scriptores</hi> is faulty in the
                    extreme. The <hi rend="italic">Gesta Pontificum</hi> was edited for the Rolls
                    Series, in 1870, by Mr N. E. S. A. Hamilton, from a manuscript which he was the
                    first to identify as the autograph of William himself.</p>

                    the British Museum, Lansdowne MS. No. 436). The work which we have probably most
                    cause to regret is the <hi rend="italic">Itinerarvum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Johannis</hi><hi rend="italic">Ablatis,</hi> or account of the journey of
                    John, abbot of Malmesbury, to Rome in 1140. This was written by William from the
                    oral account which he received from Peter Baldwin, John’s companion. A few
                    extracts are given by Leland in his <hi rend="italic">Collectanea,</hi> iii.
                    272.</p>
                <p>Malmesbury’s merits as an historian are of a very high order. He labours, it is
                    true, under the defect of being but imperfectly acquainted with English
                    institutions, and having but little sympathy with the English race, while he
                    occasionally evinces a Norman contempt for the English language. His habitual
                    carelessness in chronology is also at times extremely perplexing, and his
                    narrative of facts is alloyed with romantic details which serve to excite
                    distrust with respect to his general credibility. But, notwithstanding these
                    faults, he is entitled to rank as an authority (in relation to the period of
                    which he treats) with Bede and Matthew Paris. He is again the first of our
                    historical writers in whom the critical faculty is to any extent discernible,
                    and the comparisons which he occasionally institutes between two different and
                    discrepant accounts of the same events form a noteworthy feature in his mode of
                    treatment. The pains and judgment which he employs in the arrangement of his
                    materials are also often no less conspicuous than his industry in collecting
                    them.</p>
