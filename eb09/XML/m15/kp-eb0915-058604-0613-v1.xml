                        xml:id="kp-eb0915-0614-0587"/> afterwards lie read the life of the devoted
                    David Brainerd, the enthusiastic apostle of the Indians of North America, and,
                    “filled with a holy emulation,” resolved to devote his energies to the work of a
                    Christian missionary. On October 22, 1803, he was ordained deacon at Ely, and
                    afterwards priest, and served as Simeon’s curate at the church of Holy Trinity,
                    taking charge of the neighbouring parish of Lolworth. Still full of the thought
                    of working in heathen lands, he designed to volunteer for the Church Missionary
                    Society, but a sudden disaster in Cornwall deprived him and his unmarried sister
                    of all the provision their father had made for them, and rendered it necessary
                    that he should obtain a salary that would support her as well as himself. He
                    accordingly applied for, and obtained, a chaplaincy under the East India
                    Company. He left for India on July 5, 1805.</p>
                <p>For some months he was chiefly located at Aldeen, near Serampore; in October 1806
                    he proceeded to Dinapore, where he laboured for a time amongst the Europeans,
                    and soon found himself able to conduct divine worship among the natives in their
                    own vernacular language, and to establish schools for their instruction. At the
                    end of April 1809 he was ordered up to Cawnpore, where he made his first attempt
                    to preach to the heathen in his own compound, and had to endure frequent
                    interruptions “amidst groans, hissings, curses, blasphemies, and threatenings”;
                    nevertheless he pursued his work among the hundreds who crowded round him,
                    consoling himself that, if he should never see a native convert, God “might
                    design by his patience and continuance in the work to encourage other
                    missionaries.” Meanwhile the great business of his life was being diligently
                    carried on. Day after day he occupied himself with learning new languages, and
                    had already, during his residence at Dinapore, been engaged in revising the
                    sheets of his Hindustani version of the New Testament. He now translated the
                    whole of the New Testament into Hindi also, and into Persian twice over. He
                    translated the Psalms into Persian, the Gospels into Judaeo-Persic, and the
                    prayer book into Hindustani, in spite of the constant interruptions caused by
                    excessive weakness of body, and “the pride, pedantry, and fury of his chief
                    moonshee Sabat.” Ordered by the doctors to take a sea voyage for his health, he
                    got leave to go to Persia and correct his Persian New Testament, whence he made
                    up his mind to go on to Arabia, and there compose an Arabic version.
                    Accordingly, on October 1, 1810, having seen his work at Cawnpore crowned, on
                    the previous day, by the opening of a church, he left for Calcutta, whence he
                    departed on January <hi rend="italic">7,</hi> 1811, for Bombay, which he reached
                    on his thirtieth birthday. From Bombay he set out for Bushire, bearing letters
                    from Malcolm to men of position there, as also at Shiraz and Ispahan. After a
                    killing journey from the coast he reached Shiraz, and was soon plunged into
                    discussion with the disputants of all classes, “Sufi, Mohammedan, Jew, and
                    Jewish-Mohammedan, even Armenian, all anxious to test their powers of argument
                    with the first English priest who had visited them.” Having made an unsuccessful
                    journey to Tebriz to present the shah with his translation of the New Testament,
                    he was seized with a fever, which so thoroughly prostrated his energies that,
                    after a temporary recovery, he found it necessary to seek a change of climate.
                    On September 12, 1812, he started with two Armenian servants, crossed the
                    Araxes, rode from Tebriz to Erivan, from Erivan to Kars, from Kars to Erzeroum,
                    from Erzeroum to Chiflik, urged on from place to place by his cruel Tartar
                    guide, and, though the plague was raging at Tokat, he was compelled to stop
                    there from utter prostration caused by fever. On the 6th of October he died,
                    either from the plague or from the weakness of the disorders which harassed him
                    from day to day.</p>
                <p>By his valuable labours as a translator Martyn had placed portions of the
                    Scriptures within the reach of all who could read over one-fourth of the
                    habitable globe, and during his brief life he earned for himself a foremost
                    place among modern missionaries. Macaulay’s lines, written in 1818, testify to
                    the impression made by his enthusiastic career of self-devotion.</p>
