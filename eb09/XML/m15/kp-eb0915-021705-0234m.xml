                    it in general is present only as a quasi-contamination of the lime; in certain
                    mineral waters, on the other hand, known as bitter waters (as those of Epsom,
                    Sedlitz, Piillna), sulphate of magnesia forms the principal solid component. All
                    native chloride of sodium is accompanied by magnesia salts, including the cases
                    of salt-springs and of ocean-water, the latter containing about 0 <hi

                    chloride.</p>
                <p>Of magnesium minerals we may name the following:—</p>

                    both occur abundantly as components of more ordinary mixed rocks, all basalts
                    containing augite as a principal component. (4) Serpentine, SiO <hi

                    loosely combined),—a very common mineral; there are mountain masses consisting
                    almost of it alone. In all these silicates, and more especially in (2) and (3),
                    the MgO is partly replaced by FeO, CaO, MnO, and other isomorphous oxides, these
                    latter not unfrequently even predominating over the MgO itself. Their names, in
                    fact, represent genera of minerals comprising each numerous species. Asbestos
                    (so remarkable on account of its exceptional structure, which lends itself for
                    the production of fire-proof textile fabrics, paper, pasteboard, &amp;c.) must
                    be mentioned here, as some varieties fall under hornblende, others under
                    chrysotil (included in serpentine). More purely magnesian are—(5) talc, 4SiO <hi

                    digestion with powdered magnesite, and filtered off. The acidified muriate

                    and (like the anhydrous salt) soluble also in alcohol. When dehydrated by heat
                    it loses acid (HC1), so that the residue is largely contaminated with
                    oxychlorides, MgCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.icMgO. Certain of these are
                    industrially important as cements, used by dentists and otherwise. A
                    concentrated solution of the chloride, made into a paste with the ignited (CO
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>-free) oxide, in a few hours hardens into a stone
                    susceptible of polishing (Sorel). To prepare the anhydrous chloride, the
                    crystallized or dissolved hydrated salt is evaporated with sal-ammonia to
                    dryness, and the residue (a stable double salt) is ignited in platinum. Pure
                    chloride, MgCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, remains as a clear liquid,
                    solidifying on cooling into a compact aggregate of flexible crystal-leaves of a
                    mother-of-pearl lustre. From the chloride the metal can be produced, either by
                    electrolysing the fused substance, or (more conveniently) by Caron and Deville’s
                    method: 600 grammes of the chloride, 480 grammes of powdered fluor-spar, and 230
                    grammes of finely cut-up sodium are mixed, and thrown, small portions at a time,
                    into a red-hot crucible, which is then well covered. When the reaction, which is
                    violent, is over, the contents are well stirred with an iron rod to cause the
                    small metal-beads to unite into bigger lumps, which, after cooling, are picked
                    from the broken-up mass. Sonstadt (who, along with Mellor, was the first to
                    prepare magnesium industrially) substitutes for plain MgCl <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> the double chloride of potassium and magnesium, obtainable synthetically
                    from the hydrated components without the use of sal-ammoniac, or simply by
                    ignition of pure carnallite. To purify the crude metal Sonstadt and Mellor
                    distil it “per descensum” out of an iron crucible provided with a pipe piercing
                    the bottom and reaching up to almost the lid; an atmosphere of coal-gas is
                    established to prevent oxidation of the metal in this operation, as also in the
                    subsequent casting of the ingot.</p>
                <p>The metal magnesium has the colour of silver, and remains unchanged in <hi
                    rend="italic">dry</hi> air; in ordinary air it tarnishes a little more readily
                    than zinc does. It is malleable and ductile, but has little tenacity. The
                    specific gravity is 1 ’ 75; thus it is considerably lighter than even aluminium,
                    whose specific gravity is 2 ’ 6. It fuses and distils at about the same
                    temperatures as zinc. It is generally sold in the form of thin ribbon, being
                    used for the easy production of highly intense light. The ribbon kindles readily
                    in a candle flame, and then continues burning most intensely by itself, the
                    solid oxide produced radiating out abundant light. A wire 0 ’ 3 millimetre ( = ’
                    012 inch) thick gives out the light of 74 stearine candles weighing 100 grammes
                    (⅜ lb avoirdupois) a piece (Bunsen and Roscoe). It used to be employed for
                    photographing at night, but is now superseded by the electric light. Magnesium
                    has the exceptional property of combining (at a bright red heat) directly with
                    nitrogen gas into Mg <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> N∙ <hi rend="subscript">

                <p>Of magnesium salts the most important is the sulphate, <hi rend="smallcaps">Epsom
                    Salt (&lt;∕.w.).</hi> This salt serves as a raw material for the preparation of
                    two or three medicinally important substances, especially magnesia alba. When
                    epsom salt solution is precipitated by carbonate of soda, the salt MgOCO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, first formed, loses carbonic acid and takes up water,
                    forming a precipitate of the approximate composition 3MgCO <hi rend="subscript">

                    2</hi> O. When prepared by cold precipitation it forms a very light, when in the
                    heat a somewhat denser, white powder (magnesia alba levis and ponderosa). This
                    substance holds an important position in the history of chemistry, having
                    served, in the hands of Black, to prove finally the individual existence of
                    magnesia as something distinct from lime, and helped him in establishing the
                    true relation between “caustic” and “mild” alkalies. Before his time the
                    “causticity” was supposed to go into the “mild” substance from the fire; Black
                    showed that it is owing to the loss of a ponderablo substance, which he called
                    “fixed air,” that is, carbonic acid. It was in this memorable research that for
                    the first time in chemistry the balance was used for the precise determination
                    of quantitative relations.</p>
                <p>Magnesia, the oxide MgO, is produced by the gentle ignition of magnesia alba. It
                    is a white powder, absolutely infusible and non-volatile, and not reducible by
                    charcoal and is used medicinally. The gently ignited oxide combines very slowly
                    with water into the practically insoluble hydrate MgO.H <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> O. Magnesia when boiled with sugar-water dissolves into a solution of
                    saccharate, and in this form is sometimes administered medicinally in lieu of
                    plain magnesia. Magnesia alba (also the normal carbonate) dissolves rather
                    largely in carbonic acid water. According to R. Wagner, one part of MgOCO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> dissolves in 760 parts of water saturated by carbonic
                    acid under 1 atmosphere pressure. Under 6 atmospheres pressure it requires only
                    76 parts of carbonic acid water for its solution. Dinneford’s “fluid magnesia”
                    is a solution of such bicarbonate of magnesia. The bicarbonate solution, when
                    allowed to stand in air, deposits crystals of hydrated normal carbonate, MgCO
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + 3 or 5H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O.</p>
                <p>Magnesia preparations play a great part in therapeutics. The oxide and basic
                    carbonate (also the dissolved forms of saccharate and bicarbonate) are used in
                    small doses as anti-acids, in larger ones as very mild purgatives, for children
                    more especially. For the latter purpose, however, the sulphate is generally
                    preferred as acting far more energetically. The nauseous bitter taste of the
                    salt can be concealed, to some extent, by acidification of its solution with
                    dilute sulphuric acid. Citrate of magnesia, being exceptionally free of the <hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ti</hi><hi rend="italic">Bittererde</hi>” taste, was
                    introduced some thirty years ago by the French as a pleasant substitute for
                    Epsom salt, and it has since come much into fashion everywhere, although, weight
                    for weight, it is far less efficient than the sulphate. The preparation of dry
                    soluble citrate offering difficulties, the French originally dispensed it
                    exclusively in the dissolved form of “Limonade au citrate de magnésie,” a
                    flavoured, decidedly acid solution of the salt, rendered effervescent by
                    addition of some bicarbonate of soda immediately before corking up. In England
                    it is generally preferred to offer the dry ingredients of the “limonade” in the
                    form of “granular effervescent citrate of magnesia.” Magnesia alba is pounded up
                    with an excess of citric acid crystals and a few drops of water to produce a
                    paste of amorphous acid citrate, which is dried at a temperature below 30“ C. At
                    higher temperatures the salt would pass into a crystalline, insoluble, and
                    consequently therapeutically valueless modification. The citrate is mixed with
                    bicarbonate of soda, citric acid, and sugar, made into a “dough” with alcohol,
                    granulated, and dried. The granules, when thrown into water, dissolve with
                    effervescence. We must not omit to state here that much of what is sold under
                    the name is a mere concoction in which Epsom salt figures as “citrate.”</p>
                <p>To test a solution for magnesia, remove whatever can be precipitated by means of
                    sulphuretted hydrogen or sulphide of ammonium; then eliminate lime, baryta, and
                    strontia by precipitation with carbonate of ammonia in the presence of sal
                    ammoniac. The magnesia remains dissolved, and can be precipitated (and detected)
                    by addition of phosphate of ammonia (or soda) and free ammonia; the salt PO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> MgNH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>.6HnO gradually
                    separates out as a crystalline precipitate. This method of course fails when the
                    magnesia is present from the first as phosphate; but we cannot here enter into a
                    consideration of this or any other exceptionally difficult case. (w. <hi
