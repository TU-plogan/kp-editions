                    travels, written in French, and published between 1357 and 1371. By aid of
                    translations into many other languages it acquired extraordinary popularity,
                    while a few interpolated words in a particular edition of the English version
                    have gained for Mandeville in modern times the spurious credit of being “the
                    father of English prose.”</p>
                <p>In his preface the compiler calls himself a knight, and states that he was born
                    and bred in England, of the town of St Albans; had crossed the sea on
                    Michaelnιas Day 1322; had travelled by way of Turkey (Asia Minor), Armenia the
                    little (Cilicia) and the great, Tartary, Persia, Syria, Arabia, Egypt upper and
                    lower, Libya, great part of Ethiopia, Chaldaea, Amazonia, India the less, the
                    greater, and the middle, and many countries about India; had often been to
                    Jerusalem; and had written in Romance as more generally understood than Latin.
                    In the body of the work we hear that he had been at Paris and Constantinople;
                    had served the sultan of Egypt a long time in his wars against the Bedouins, had
                    been freely addressed by him on the corruption of contemporary Christendom, had
                    been vainly offered by him a princely marriage and a great estate on condition
                    of renouncing Christianity, and had left Egypt under Sultan Melech Madabron, <hi

                    visited the Holy Land with letters under the great seal of the sultan, which
                    gave him extraordinary facilities; had been in Russia, Livonia, Cracow,
                    Lithuania, “en roialme daresten” (? de Daresten or Silistria), and many other
                    parts near Tartary, but not in Tartary itself; had drunk of the well of youth at
                    Polombe (Quilon on the Malabar coast), and still seemed to feel the better; had
                    taken astronomical observations on the way to Lamary (Sumatra), as well as in
                    Brabant, Germany, Bohemia, and still farther north; had been at an isle called
                    Pathen in the Indian Ocean; had been at Cansay (Hangchow-fu) in China, and had
                    served the emperor of China fifteen months against the king of Manzi; had been
                    among rocks of adamant in the Indian Ocean; had been through an haunted valley,
                    which he places near Mille-storach ( = Millescorath, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> Malasgird in Armenia); had been at many great feats of arms, but had
                    been incapable of performing any himself; had been driven home against his will
                    in 1357 by arthritic gout (despite the well of youth !); and had written his
                    book as a consolation for his “wretched rest.” The paragraph which states that
                    he had had his book confirmed at Rome by the pope is, however, an interpolation
                    of the English version.</p>
                <p>This recital is of itself enough to provoke some little questioning, and on
                    investigating the sources of the book it will presently be obvious that part at
                    least of the personal history of Mandeville is mere invention. Under these
                    circumstances the truth of any part of that history, and even the genuineness of
                    the compiler’s name, become matter for serious doubt. No contemporary
                    corroboration of the existence of such a Jehan de Mandeville seems to be known.
                    Some French MSS., not contemporary, give a Latin letter of presentation from him
                    to Edward III., but this is so hopelessly vague that it might have been penned
                    by any writer on any subject. At Liège, in the abbey of the Guilelmites, now
                    pulled down, there certainly was in the 16th century a tomb of a man in armour
                    said to be Mandeville; but the old French inscription showed no name, and the
                    arms were quite unlike those of the Mandevilles, earls of Essex; while the Latin
                    inscription, stating that the tomb was Mandeville’s, and that -he died at Liège
                    on November 17, 1372, is not only apparently much later in style, but confounds
                    him with a physician called “ad Barbant,” who is said in a printed Latin edition
                    of Mandeville to have met him first at Cairo and again at Liège, and to have
                    persuaded and helped him to write his travels.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This physician is called in a French MS.
                    “Jehan de Bourgoιgne dit a la Barbe.” Μ. Michelant once saw the title of a
                    medical or botanical treatise bearing the name of Jehan de Bourgoigne. Can he
                    also have written these travels under a feigned name?</p></note></p>
                <p>Leaving this question, there remains the more complex one whether the book
                    contains, in any measure, facts and knowledge acquired by actual travels and
                    residence in the East. We believe that it may, but only as a small portion of
                    the whole, and that confined entirely to the section of the work which treats of
                    the Holy Land, and of the different ways of getting thither, as well as of
                    Egypt, and in general of what we understand by the Levant.</p>
                <p>The prologue indeed points almost exclusively to the Holy Land as the subject of
                    the work. The mention of more distant regions comes in only towards the end of
                    this prologue, and (in a manner) as an afterthought. As regards the writer’s
                    claim to have travelled in those more distant regions, it is somewhat
                    astonishing to find that any modern editor could have regarded this as possibly
                    founded in truth. And the apology sometimes made for the book, as only a
                    compilation of what was regarded as truth in the writer’s age, is not tenable in
                    the face of the frequent assertion (explicit or implicit) that he had himself
                    been in the remotest regions spoken of, and had witnessed some of the most
                    marvellous circumstances that he details. To this we shall recur later, for the
                    bearing of these statements can only be appreciated when the true derivation of
                    the matter about the further East shall have been exhibited.</p>
                <p>By far the greater part of these more distant travels, extending in fact from
                    Trebizond to Ormus, India, the Indian Archipelago, and China, and back again to
                    western Asia, has been appropriated from the narrative of Friar Odoric (written
                    in 1330). These passages, as served up by Mandeville, are almost always, indeed,
                    swollen with interpolated particulars, usually of an extravagant kind, whilst in
                    no few cases the writer has failed to understand the passages which he adopts
                    from Odoric and professes to give as his own experiences. Thus (p. 193)<note

                    shells were as big as cottages.</p>
                <p>In another place (p. 209), where Odoric has given a most curious and veracious
                    account of the Chinese custom of employing tame cormorants to catch fish, the
                    cormorants are converted by Mandeville into ‘ ‘ little beasts called <hi
                    rend="italic">loyres (layre,</hi> A. ), which are taught to go into the water”
                    (the word <hi rend="italic">loyre</hi> being apparently used here for “otter,”
                    <hi rend="italic">lutra,</hi><hi rend="italic">for</hi> which the Provençal is
                    <hi rend="italic">luria</hi> or <hi rend="italic">loiria).</hi> Where Odoric,
                    describing the court of the Great Khan, mentions the genuine Tartar custom which
                    forbade any man in entering to set down his foot on the threshold of the door
                    (an etiquette which P. della Valle found still in force at Ispahan in the 17th
                    century), Mandeville quite fails to understand the point (see p. 220).</p>
                <p>At a very early date the coincidence of Mandeville’s stories with those of Odoric
                    was recognized, insomuch that a MS. of Odoric, which is or was in the chapter
                    library at Mainz, begins with the words: <hi rend="italic">Incipit Itinerarius
                    fidelis fratris</hi><hi rend="italic">Odorici</hi><hi rend="italic">socii

                    peregrinationem suam descripsit.</hi> At a later day Sir T. Herbert calls Odoric
                    “travelling companion of our Sir John”; and Purchas, with most perverse
                    injustice, whilst calling Mandeville, next to Polo, “if next, . . . the greatest
                    Asian traveller that ever the world had,” insinuates that Odoric’s story was
                    stolen from Mandeville’s. Mandeville himself is crafty enough, at least in one
                    passage, to anticipate criticism by suggesting the probability of his having
                    travelled with Odoric (see p. 282, and below).</p>
                <p>Much again of Mandeville’s matter, particularly in Asiatic geography and history,
                    is taken bodily from the book of Hayton, an Armenian of princely family, who
                    became a monk of the Praemon-strant order, and in 1307 dictated this work on the
                    East in the French tongue at Poictiers, out of his own extraordinary
                    acquaintance with Asia and its history in his own time.</p>
                <p>It is curious that no passage in Mandeville can be plausibly traced to Marco
                    Polo, with one exception. This is (p. 163) where he states that at 0rmus the
                    people, during the great heat, lie in water,—a circumstance mentioned by Polo,
                    though not by Odoric. We should suppose it most likely that this fact had been
                    interpolated in the copy of Odoric used by Mandeville; for, if he had borrowed
                    it direct from Polo, he would have borrowed more.</p>
                <p>A good deal about the manners and customs of the Tartars is demonstrably derived
                    from the famous work of the Franciscan John of Plano Carpini (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Carpini,</hi> vol. v. p. 132), though possibly the immediate
                    source for Mandeville may have been some popular compilation. For though the
                    passages in question are all to be found in Carpini, more or less exactly, the
                    expression is condensed and the order changed. For examples compare Mandeville,
                    p. 250, on the tasks done by Tartar women, with Plano Carpini, p. 643;<note

                <p>The account of Prester John, and all the wonders of his court and realm, is taken

                    which was so widely diffused in the 13th century, and created that renown which
                    made it incumbent on every traveller in Asia to assume his existence, and to
                    find some new tale to tell of him. Many fabulous stories again of monsters, such
                    as Cyclopes, sciapodes, hippopodes, monoscelides, anthropophagi, and men whose
                    heads did grow beneath their shoulders, of the phoenix and the weeping
                    crocodile, such as Pliny has collected, are introduced here and there, derived
                    no doubt from the popular versions of Solinus. And interspersed, especially in
                    the chapters about the Levant, are the stories and legends that were retailed to
                    every pilgrim, such as the legend of Seth and the grains of paradise from which
                    grew the wood of the cross, that of the shooting of old Cain by Lamech, that of
                    the castle of the sparrow-hawk (which appears in the tale of Melusina), those of
                    the origin of the balsam plants at Matariya, of the dragon of Cos, of the river
                    Sabbation, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Even in that part of the book which may be admitted with probability to represent
                    some genuine experience, there are distinct traces that another work has been
                    made use of, more or less, as an aid in the compilation, we might almost say as
                    a framework to fill up. This is the itinerary of the German knight William of
                    Boldensele, written in 1336 at the desire of Cardinal Talleyrand de
                    Perigord.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is found in

                    ed. of same by Basnage, 1725, iv. 337.</p></note> A cursory comparison of this
                    with Mandeville leaves no doubt of the fact that the latter has followed its
                    thread, using its suggestions, and on many subjects its expressions, though
                    digressing and expanding on every side, and too often eliminating the singular
                    good sense of the German traveller. After such a comparison we may indicate as
                    examples Boldensele’s account of Cyprus (Mandeville, p. 28, and p. 10), of Tyre
                    and the coast of Palestine (Mandeville, 29, 30, 33, 34), of the journey from
                    Gaza to Egypt (34), passages about Babylon of Egypt (40), about Mecca (42), the
                    general account of Egypt (45), the pyramids (52), some of the particular wonders
                    of Cairo, such as the slave-market, the chicken-hatching stoves, and the apples
                    of paradise, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> plantains (49), the Red Sea (57), the

                    (74-76), &amp;c. The following may be quoted as a specimen, showing how
                    Mandeville has at once followed Boldensele and deviated from his good sense

                <p>It will be seen from these indications, and more particularly from the specific
                    analysis given below, that there is only a small residuum of the book to which
                    genuine character, as containing the experiences of the author, can possibly be
                    attributed. Yet, as has been intimated, the borrowed stories are frequently
                    claimed as such experiences. We have already alluded to Mandeville’s claim (p.
                    4) to have visited distant parts of Asia; to have drunk of the Fountain of
                    Youth, a favourite mediaeval fable which he interpolates in Odoric’s account of
                    Malabar (169); to his assertion that he had visited Lamary (Sumatra), and indeed
                    that he had gone beyond it to 33° 16' of S. lat. (181-82); and that he had been
                    at a certain other island in the Indian Archipelago (190). He alleges also that
                    he had witnessed the curious exhibition of the garden of transmigrated souls
                    (described by Odoric) at Cansay, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Hangchow-fu (211).
                    He and his fellows with their valets had remained fifteen months in service with
                    the emperor of Cathay in his wars against the king of Manzi,—Manzi, or Southern
                    China, having ceased to have any existence as a separate kingdom some seventy
                    years before the time referred to. Similar false statements are found at pp.
                    219, 235, 248, 271. But the most notable of these passages occurs in his
                    adoption from Odoric of the story of the Valley Perilous (282). This is, in its
                    original form, apparently founded on real experiences of Odoric viewed through a
                    haze of excitement and superstition. Mandeville, whilst swelling the wonders of
                    the tale with a variety of extravagant touches, appears to safeguard himself
                    from the reader’s possible discovery that the tale was stolen by the
                    interpolation: “And some of our fellows accorded to enter, and some not. So
                    there were with us two worthy men, Friars Minor, that were of Lombardy, who said
                    that if any man would enter they would go in with us. And when they had said so,
                    upon the gracious trust of God and of them, we caused mass to be sung, and made
                    every man to be shriven and houselled; and then we entered, fourteen persons;
                    but at our going out we were but nine,” &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In referring to this passage it is only fair to recognize that the description
                    (though the suggestion of the greatest part exists in Odoric) displays a good
                    deal of imaginative power; and there is much in the account of Christian’s
                    passage through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, in Bunyan’s famous allegory,
                    which indicates a possibility that John Bunyan may have read and remembered this
                    episode either in Mandeville or in Hakluyt’s Odoric.</p>
                <p>Such a passage, however, as that which we recently quoted, and which appears to
                    exist in all the MSS. and versions that have been examined, leaves no room for
                    the rehabilitation of Mandeville’s character as regards conscious mendacity. But
                    it does not necessarily follow that the whole work is borrowed or fictitious.
                    There are other examples in mediaeval works of travel in which fiction has been
                    linked to true experiences. Even the great Moorish traveller Ibn Batuta,
                    accurate and veracious in the main, seems, in one part at least of his
                    narrative, to invent experiences; and in such works as those of John of Hese and
                    Arnold von Harff, we have examples of pilgrims to the Holy Land whose narratives
                    begin apparently in sober truth, and gradually pass into flourishes of fiction
                    and extravagance. So in Mandeville also we find various particulars which we are
                    unable to trace to other writers, and which may therefore be, provisionally at
                    least, assigned to the writer’s own experience, or to knowledge acquired by
                    colloquial intercourse in the East.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to decide on the character of his statements as to reçent
                    Egyptian history. In his account of that country (pp. 37, 38) though the series
                    of the Comanian <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> of the Bahri Mameluke) sultans is
                    borrowed from Hayton down to the accession of <hi rend="italic">Melechnasser,
                    i.e.,</hi> El-Malik el-Nâgir Mohammed ibn Kalaùn, who came first to the throne
                    in 1299, Mandeville appears to speak.from his own knowledge when he adds that
                    this “<hi rend="italic">Melechnasser</hi> reigned long and governed wisely.” In
                    fact, though twice displaced in the early part of his life, Malik Nasir reigned
                    till 1341, a duration unparalleled<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n498/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0498-0475"/> in Mohammedan Egypt, whilst we are told that
                    during the last thirty years of his reign Egypt rose to a high pitch of wealth
                    and prosperity. Mandeville, however, then goes on to say that his eldest son <hi
                    rend="italic">Melechcmader</hi> was chosen to succeed, but this prince was
                    caused privily to be slain by his brother, who took the kingdom under the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">Melechmadabron.</hi> ’ ‘ And he was Soldan when I departed
                    from those countries.” Now Malik Nasir Mohammed was followed in succession by no
                    less than eight of his sons in thirteen years, the first three of whom reigned
                    in aggregate only a few months. The names mentioned by Mandeville appear to
                    represent those of the fourth and sixth of the eight, viz., El-Malik el-galih
                    <hi rend="italic">'Imddu-d-dln,</hi> and El-Malik <hi rend="italic"
                    >MMu∑affar</hi> Zainu-d-din Hajj; and these the statements of Mandeville do not
                    fit.</p>
                <p>Among particulars which seem to suggest personal knowledge may be instanced the
                    very good description of the Bedouins (p. 64), starting from that of Boldensele,
                    but largely and accurately expanded; the use of carrier pigeons in Syria (p.
                    118); the intimation that the Red Sea was frequented by Venetian merchants
                    trading with India (p. 140). There are some other particulars which the author
                    can hardly have witnessed, but which may possibly have been heard in
                    communication with other travellers (if not borrowed from some untraced source).
                    Such are the practice of polyandry in a certain island (p. 287), and the rite of
                    fraternal adoption between two persons by drinking each other’s blood (195). The
                    mention of Ani in Armenia with its thousand churches (148) is probably derived
                    from some book; the city and its thousand churches are mentioned by William of
                    Rubrouck.</p>
                <p>On several occasions the writer indicates some acquaintance with Arabic, though
                    the words are not always recognizable, owing perhaps to the carelessness of
                    copyists in such matters. Thus (p. 142) he gives the Mohammedan confession of
                    faith as <hi rend="italic">La Met Ma Machometh</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >rores</hi><hi rend="italic">alla</hi><hi rend="italic">(Roscl-alla,</hi> A.)
                    (La ilaha ilia ’ llah Muhamma-dun rasùlu ’ llah); (p. 50) the Arabic names of
                    the wood, fruit, and sap of the balsam plant; (p. 99) the name of bitumen,
                    “alkatran” <hi rend="italic">(al-Katrdn)</hi>; (p. 131) three titles of the
                    Koran, viz., <hi rend="italic">“Alkoran,” “Meshaf'' (i.e., mislμcf,</hi>
                    “written sheets or pages,” “a copy of the Koran”), and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Harme</hi><hi rend="italic">(i.e., haram,</hi> in the sense of “sacred,
                    inviolable ”); (p. 168) the names of the three different kinds of pepper (long
                    pepper, black pepper, and white pepper) as <hi rend="italic">sorbotin,
                    fulful,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bano</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bauo
                    (fulfill</hi> is the common Arabic word for pepper, the others we cannot explain
                    with any confidence); (p. 192) the name of the elephant (but in A. this runs:
                    <hi rend="italic">Et</hi><hi rend="italic">apeιle on</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >là</hi><hi rend="italic">les oliphans</hi><hi rend="italic">vaches).</hi></p>
                <p>Mandeville again, in some passages (and especially in one which is familiar from
                    its being cited by Dr Johnson in the preface to his dictionary) shows a correct
                    idea of the form of the earth, and of position in latitude ascertained by
                    observation of the pole star; he knows that there are antipodes, and that if
                    ships were sent on voyages of discovery they might sail round the world. And he
                    tells a curious story, which he had heard in his youth, how a worthy man did
                    travel ever eastward until he came to his own country again (p. 183). But on the
                    other hand he repeatedly asserts the old belief that Jerusalem was in the centre
                    of the world (79, 183), whilst he maintains in proof of this that at the equinox
                    a spear planted erect in Jerusalem casts no shadow at noon,— which if true would
                    only show that the city was on the equator.</p>

                <p>The oldest known MS. of the original is the earl of Ashburnham’s MS. Libri xxiv.,
                    dated 1371, but nevertheless very inaccurate in proper names. The English
                    version was made, at least as early as the beginning of the 15th century, from a
                    French MS. defective"between p. 36 1. 7 (“And there”) of Halliwell’s edition
                    andp. 621. 25 (“And that Valey”), and is represented in this state by nearly
                    every known English MS. It was completed and revised by two independent editors,
                    neither of them later than the first quarter of the 15th century. One of these
                    revisions is represented by the British Museum MS. Egerton 1982, and the very
                    badly abbreviated Bodleian MS. e Mus. 116. The other is represented by the
                    British Museum MS. Cotton Titus C. xvi. The first printed edition of the English
                    version is apparently the undated edition of Pynson, which gives the version in
                    its original defective shape. So do Wynkyn de Worde’s edition of 1499 and eleven
                    editions before 1725, except that they insert a paragraph seemingly abbreviated
                    from the revision represented by Cotton Titus C. xvi. This latter revision was,
                    however, followed in full by the editions of 1725 and 1727, and is, in
                    Halliwell’s editions, the text now current. The other revision seems never to
                    have been printed.</p>
                <p>That none of the forms of the English version can conceivably be from the same
                    hand which wrote the original work is made patent to any critical reader by
                    their glaring errors of translation, but the form now current asserts in the
                    preface that it was made by Mandeville himself, and this assertion has been
                    taken on trust by almost all modern historians of English literature. The words
                    of the original “je eusse cest livret mis en latin .... mais . . . je l’ay mis
                    en rômant” were mistranslated as if “je eusse” meant “I had” instead of “I
                    should have,” and then (whether of fraudulent intent or by the error of a
                    copyist thinking to supply an accidental omission) the words were added “and
                    translated it ajen out of Frensche into Englyssche.” Schönborn and Mätzner
                    respectively seem to have been the first to show that the current Latin and
                    English texts cannot possibly have been made by Mandeville himself. Dr J. Vogels
                    states the same of unprinted Latin versions which he has discovered in the
                    British Museum, and he has proved it as regards the Italian version.</p>
                <p>The terseness, the simplicity, and the quaintness of the English version,
                    together with the curiosity of the subject-matter, will always make it
                    delightfuj reading; but the title “father of English prose,” which in its
                    stricter sense already belonged to King Alfred, must in its looser sense be now
                    transferred to Wickliffe.</p>
