                    type="authorial"><p>The etymology of the word is seen in the terms “art magic,”
                    or the “magic art”; French, <hi rend="italic">art</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >magique·,</hi> Latin, <hi rend="italic">magiσa ars.</hi></p></note> has its
                    name from the <hi rend="italic">magi,</hi> Greek ∕zαγoι, the hereditary caste of
                    priests among the ancient Persians, thought to be of Median origin (Spiegel, <hi
                    rend="italic">Avesta,</hi> vol. ii. p. vi.). Among the magi the interpretation
                    of dreams was practised, as appears from the story of the birth of Cyrus
                    (Herodotus, i. 107); later writers describe them in both a sacerdotal and
                    magical capacity, Lucian <hi rend="italic">(Makro!).,</hi> 4) calling them a
                    prophetic class and devoted to the gods, while Cicero <hi rend="italic"
                    >(De</hi><hi rend="italic">Divinatione,</hi> i. 23, 41) writes of them as wise
                    men, augurs, and diviners. In such supernatural crafts the magi seem to have
                    much influenced the Western nations, to judge by their name having passed into a
                    set -of classical terms (μ,αγeiα, ∕zaγ∈υω, <hi rend="italic">magia, magice,</hi>
                    &amp;c.) applied to sorcery, enchantment, and occult science in general. In the
                    New Testament soothsaying and sorcery are so designated (Acts viii. 9, xiii. 6);
                    while the astrologers who divine the birth of the King of the Jews by the
                    appearance of a star in the east are called magi (Matt. ii.).</p>
                <p>The word magic is still· used, as in the ancient world, to include a confused
                    mass of beliefs and practices, hardly agreeing except in being beyond those
                    ordinary actions of cause and effect which men accustomed to their regularity
                    have come to regard as merely natural. Thus magical rites are difficult even to
                    arrange in systematic order. A large proportion of them belong properly to the
                    general theory of religion, inasmuch as their efficacy is ascribed to the
                    intervention of spiritual beings. Thus the ghosts of the dead are called up by
                    the necromancer to give oracles or discover hidden treasures, or sent to enter
                    men’s bodies and afflict them with diseases or to cure them, or in a score of
                    ways to do the behests of the magician, whose spells or incantations are thought
                    powerful enough to control the will even of such divine beings as can drive the
                    winds and give or withhold the rain. It must be noticed, on the other hand, that
                    many magical arts show no connexion with spirits at all, or, even if ghosts or
                    demons or gods have to do with them, the nature of these beings does not of
                    itself account for the processes employed or the effects believed to result.
                    This non-spiritual element in magic depends on imagined powers and
                    correspondences in nature, of which the adepts avail themselves in order to
                    discover hidden knowledge, and to act on the world around them by means beyond
                    the ordinary capabilities of men. Thus by mere effort of will, by traditional
                    formulas and rites, or by working on symbolic fancies, the sorcerer believes he
                    can bewitch others to sickness or death, the astrologer reads the future in the
                    aspects of the stars, the augur attends to omens from the cries of birds and
                    beasts, the haruspex prophesies by the heart or liver of a slaughtered animal,
                    and other classes of diviners judge of the hidden past and the yet more hidden
                    future by the falling of lots or dice, the twitching of their own fingers or the
                    tingling of their ears, and a host of other facts of nature which, as the
                    educated world has now found out, have no practical connexion with the magical
                    meanings or effects assigned to them. The great characteristic of magic is its
                    unreality. Its methods have often an ideal coherence which may be plainly
                    traced, but practical effect they have none, and so they may be altered or
                    transposed without being made worse or better.</p>
                <p>One remarkable consequence of this is the fixity with which some magical formulas
                    framed thousands of years ago hold on almost unchanged to this day. To
                    understand this, it must be borne in mind that, if there were any practical use
                    in such rules as those for divining by the cries of animals, the old rules would
                    have been improved by experience into new shapes. But, they being worthless and
                    incapable of improvement, this motive of change is absent, and the old precepts
                    have held their ground, handed on by faithful but stupid tradition, from age to
                    age. When the test of practical efficacy comes in upon the magic art, it is apt
                    either to destroy it utterly or to transform it into something more rational,
                    which passes from supernatural into natural science.</p>
                <p>Magic is to be reckoned among the’earliest growths of human thought. The evidence
                    for its remote antiquity lies partly in its presence among all races of mankind,
                    the ruder tribes especially showing it in such intelligible shapes that the
                    beginnings of magical crafts may be fairly supposed to have arisen in the oldest
                    and lowest periods of culture. An example may be taken from the wild natives of
                    Australia, whose whole life is pervaded by the belief, and embittered by the
                    terror, of sorcery. They imagine the sorcerers, armed with their mysterious
                    power called <hi rend="italic">boyl-ya,</hi> to come moving along in the sky,
                    invisible except to other sorcerers; they enter the bodies of men, and feed
                    stealthily on them, not eating the bones, but consuming· the flesh; the native
                    feels the pain as the boyl-ya enters him like a bit of pointed quartz, and in
                    this shape of quartz crystal the evil can be extracted by another sorcerer. The
                    sorcerer has other means of attacking his victim: he can creep near to him when
                    asleep, and bewitch him to death by merely pointing at him a leg bone of a
                    kangaroo; or he can steal away his kidney fat, where, as the natives believe, a
                    man’s power dwells; or he can call in the aid of a malignant demon to strike the
                    poor wretch with his club behind the neck; or he can get a lock of hair, and
                    roast it with fat over the fire till its former owner pines away too, and dies.
                    The Australians, like other low tribes in the world whose minds are thus set on
                    imaginary causes of death, hardly believe a man can die unless by being slain or
                    bewitched. When a native dies what we call a natural death, they ascribe it to
                    magic. Then other magic must reveal the hostile sorcerer who has done him to
                    death: either the corpse itself will seem to push its bearers in the direction
                    of the murderer, or the flames of the grave-fire are seen to flicker towards
                    where he is, or some insect will be seen creeping towards his home; and, when
                    the next of kin thus discover the magic enemy, they set off to take vengeance
                    with earthly weapons. The sorcerer has kindlier duties when he sits by a sick
                    man and charms and charms till he recovers, or sucks out the disease from his
                    body in the shape of a stone spear-head or a fish bone, or brings out the
                    ailment along a string, the other end of which he draws between his own lips
                    till it is covered with blood, telling the bystanders (who believe it) that this
                    blood came along the string out of the sick man. Not disease and cure only, but
                    other events of life, come within the scope of native magic. Storm and thunder
                    are the work of the sorcerers; they can bring rain and make the rivers swell, or
                    burn up the land with drought. Shooting stars and comets are to the natives
                    omens of disaster; the great hawk’s cry in the night portends the death of a
                    child, whose soul the bird is carrying off; but when a man’s finger-joints crack
                    he stretches out his arm, for in that direction some one is doing him a
                    kindness.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For these and

                <p>Taken together, such a repertory of the demonology and witchcraft of a special
                    group of savage tribes shows remarkable correspondence in principle with the
                    magic which once flourished in the civilized world, and which still lingers in
                    peasant folklore. The very details often agree so much as to raise the question
                    whether the magic of savages may sometimes have been borrowed from the lower
                    class of colonists. The superstitions of the peasant are in fact what the savage
                    would readily assimilate, as belonging to a state of mind like his own, and
                    there is even évidence of European charms and omens having been sometimes
                    borrowed by native tribes of Australia or America. It was necessary to mention
                    this, if merely to point out that such borrowing has been only slight and
                    superficial. It in no way upsets the genera] principle that the magic of the
                    lower races was developed among them, fitting as it does with their low level of
                    knowledge. Every book of travels in savage and barbaric countries shows the
                    influence of the native magician, who, often at once sorcerer and established
                    priest, and sometimes even chief of his tribe, by the aid of spirits and other
                    supernatural means interferes in every act of life. Thus in the Pacific islands
                    the Europeans found a whole class of sorcerers living by making diseases, their
                    method being the familiar one of burning or otherwise practising on some morsel
                    of hair or remnant of food, so as to send disease into its owner, by a malignant
                    spirit tying knots in his inside till he writhed with agony. Every sick man was
                    a source of profit to the sorcerer who was believed to have brought on the
                    disease by burning his rubbish, and of course had to be bought off by liberal
                    presents. In these Pacific islands a fact most important in the theory of magic
                    everywhere comes into view with particular distinctness—that such magical arts
                    prove effective through the patient’s own imagination; when he knows or fancies
                    that he has been bewitched he will fall ill, and he will actually die unless he
                    can be persuaded that he has been cured. Thus, wherever sorcery is practised
                    with the belief of its victims, some system of exorcism or some protective
                    magical art becomes, not only necessary, but actually effective, a mental
                    disease being met by a mental remedy to match it.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Ellis, <hi rend="italic">Polynesian
                    Researches</hi>; Turner, <hi rend="italic">Nineteen Years in Polynesia</hi>;
                    Polack, <hi rend="italic">Manners and Customs of New Zealanders</hi>; Waitz,
                    vols, v., vi.</p></note> At the discovery of America, the Spaniards found the
                    native sorcerers throwing themselves into delirious ecstasy by snuffing a
                    narcotic powder, their ravings in this state being held to be conversation with
                    departed souls, through whose help they were able to cure the sick by expelling
                    the disease. The class to which these sorcerers belong extends over South
                    America, and is generally known under the name of <hi rend="italic">paye</hi>
                    (or allied terms). The sorcerer is described as being initiated by living in
                    some wild spot till by fasting and self-torture he attains his supernatural
                    craft, becoming able to see spirits, to consecrate bits of bone or stone into
                    powerful amulets, to make good or bad weather, to gain mystic powers over
                    familiar birds and beasts, to take omens from their cries or from the itching of
                    his own skin, which latter symptom an Abipone diviner declared to portend an
                    attack from a tribe of enemies, in spite of the missionary, who irreverently set
                    it down to fleas. The old arts of the payés, their malicious witchcraft with
                    herbs and hair, the use of narcotics to produce ecstasy, and their mental
                    excitement by drumming, rattling, and dancing are still to be met with in the
                    wild districts of Guiana and Brazil. In North America practitioners of the same
                    kind are generally known as “medicine-men,” from the French colonists calling
                    them <hi rend="italic">médecins,</hi> as being the native doctors; the term is
                    really appropriate to barbaric magicians in all parts of the world, whose arts
                    of causing and curing disease generally include considerable knowledge of herbs
                    powerful as poisons and remedies, of simple stopping of wounds and bandaging
                    hurt limbs, in fact of medicine in its elementary state, as yet not separated
                    from the magic with which it was at first inextricably mixed up. The
                    medicine-man’s apparatus includes the sorcerer’s usual music, the rattle and the
                    drum, simple and primitive instruments whose constant association with the lower
                    magic bears witness to the beginnings of music and magic having been associated
                    together when civilization was yet in its low stages of development. The
                    American sorcerer carries a “medicinebag” made with the skin of his guardian
                    animal, which protects him in fight, cures the bites of serpents, and strikes at
                    a distance as a spiritual weapon. Be knows magic chants of power over the
                    elements; he can bysucking and blowing extract disease animals from the sick; he
                    can make pictures and images and pierce them with thorns so as to kill the men
                    or animals they represent; and he can compel love by practising on the heart of
                    the picture of the beloved one.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    native sorcerer bears the name of <hi rend="italic">mganga</hi> among the west
                    and central negro tribes, <hi rend="italic">nyanya</hi> among the Zulus of the
                    south. He is the rain-maker, an office of the utmost importance among tribes who
                    may perish of famine and disease after a long drought. In his craft a principal
                    part is played by what the English in Africa (using the Portuguese word <hi
                    rend="italic">feitiςo,</hi> charm or amulet) call “fetiches,” which are claws,
                    fangs, roots, stones, and any other odds and ends fancied to be inhabited by
                    spirits or invested with superhuman power. These fetiches the negroes trust in
                    for good and against evil fortune, with a confidence which no failure can shake
                    further than to cause the unlucky bearer to discard a particular fetich which
                    has failed, and to replace it by a more successful one. The African mganga has
                    intercourse with demons; and, being called on every day to predict the fortune
                    of a fight or a bargain, or to discover lost or stolen cattle, he professes to
                    gain information from the spirits, or uses his various modes of divination, such
                    as taking omens from the cries of the eagle or the owl, the swimming of berries,
                    or the moving of sticks in his own hands as they twitch spasmodically in nervous
                    excitement. As with magicians everywhere, his trade is profitable but dangerous,
                    for if his arts of killing have been successful beyond bearing, or still worse
                    if public opinion decides that he has wilfully withheld the rain, he may be
                    drowned or burned as miserably as one of the many victims he has done to
                    death.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Burton, <hi

                    which are remarkable for their uniformity in the most distant regions, among

                    however, such races as the African negroes come in contact with such foreigners
                    as the Arabs, who though more civilized than themselves hâve not outgrown the
                    magical stage, they borrow their more cultured magical arts, such as divination
                    by lots. In this way the natives of Madagascar appear to have borrowed from the
                    Arabs a system of lucky and unlucky days of birth, which, carried out with
                    stupid ferocity, has cost the lives of thousands of children, born truly in an
                    evil hour, for when the magician declares their birth ill-omened their fate is
                    settled at once by putting them to death.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    developed false as well as true science, we find magic in full vogue, hardly
                    differing in principle from that of the illiterate barbarians, but worked into
                    more elaborate system and ritual. Of ancient Egyptian magic various original
                    documents have been preserved, containing formulas, mostly of religious
                    magic,—that is, acting through the aid of deities invoked. For instance, there
                    are hymns against dangerous animals in the water, and spells for remaining in
                    the country; and the power ascribed to such formulas appears from passages like
                    the following :—“I confide in the efficacy of that excellent written book given
                    to-day into my hand, which repels lions through fascination, disables men, which
                    muzzles the mouths of lions, hyaenas, wolves, the mouth of all men who have bad
                    faces, so as to paralyse their limbs,” &amp;c. Ancient as Egyptian magic is, it
                    has evidently grown up from still earlier forms, as is shown by that plainest
                    symptom of old traditional lore, the relying on ancient or foreign epithets as
                    words of power over the gods. This practice appears in the ancient papyri, and
                    goes on to later ages, when the god Set is invoked by other mystically powerful
                    names which he must obey, such as “Joerbeth.” The medical art in ancient Egypt
                    shows an interesting combination of practical and magical remedies. The
                    practical recipe might contain nitre or cedar chips, or deer horn, or various
                    other ingredients administered in ointment or drunk in beer, but with this the
                    magical formula was also required to deal with the demon-cause of the ailment.
                    Thus an emetic was given with the following formula, “O demon who art lodged in
                    the stomach of M., son of N., thou whose father is called Head-smiter, whose
                    name is Death, whose name is cursed for ever !” &amp;c. It must be remembered
                    that such formulas, foolish as they seem to modern education, had and still have
                    great efficacy in relieving the mind of the superstitious patient, and giving a
                    fair chance to diet and medicaments. Their appearance in medicine so ancient as
                    that of Egypt is good historical evidence how the old magical treatment was
                    encroached upon by natural remedies, though then and for many ages-afterwards
                    the physicians, wise in their generation, thought it best not to discard the
                    supernatural charm. The Egyptians divided out the limbs and organs of the human
                    body, putting each-under the special care of a god, a system which, like many
                    other details of their magic, has lasted on into the modern world. From the
                    astrological point of view they made a calendar of lucky and unlucky days,
                    according to which for instance on the 19th of the month Athor one must not
                    embark on the Nile, while a child born on the 5th of the month Paopi will be
                    killed by a bull; traces of this set of precepts may be discerned still in the
                    modern Egyptian almanac. Another point deserving attention is the appearance in
                    early Egypt of the distinction between good and bad magic. Magical curative arts
                    were practised by learned scribes or priests, and were doubtless in high esteem,
                    but when it came to attracting love by charms or philtres, or paralysing men by
                    secret arts, this was held to be a crime. As long ago as the time of Rameses
                    III. it is recorded that one Hai was accused of making images and paralysing a
                    man’s hand, for which he was condemned to death; this was doubtless the ordinary
                    bewitching by an image or picture, here already mentioned among the lower races,
                    and to be mentioned again as not forgotten among ourselves.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Still more prominent among the ancient nations who brought magic into its
                    pseudo-scientific stage were the Babylonians, whose supernatural arts were
                    adopted and continued among the Assyrians. No savage tribe ever filled their
                    world with more swarming hosts of nature spirits and demons; only these more
                    cultured nations dealt systematically with them by set formulas of propitiation
                    and expulsion. The cuneiform writings preserve numerous documents of this kind,
                    such as “From the burning spirit of the entrails which devours the man, from the
                    spirit of the entrails which works evil, may the king of heaven preserve, may
                    the king of earth preserve!”—“The god . . . . shall stand by his bedside. Those
                    seven evil spirits he shall root out, and shall expel them from his body; and
                    those seven shall never return to the sick man again.” The magic power believed
                    to reside in the secret names of the gods was recognized by the Babylonians, one
                    of whose famous myths relates how by the utterance of these mystic names the
                    goddess Ishtar was delivered from Hades. In the rites of the magician priests,
                    this kind of supernatural power resided in sacred texts, whether chanted or tied
                    on as phylacteries. In divinatory magic the Babylonians had elaborate codes of
                    rules, of which many have been preserved. Thus omens were drawn from prodigies,
                    such as “when a woman bears a child and at the time of birth its teeth are cut,
                    the days of the prince will be long.” So with omens from animals: “if a dog goes
                    to the palace and lies down on a throne, that palace will be burned.” ,A
                    remarkable passage, Ezekiel xxi. 21, mentions three modes of divination
                    practised by the king of Babylon as he stood at the head of the two ways: “he
                    shuffled arrows, he consulted teraphim, he looked in the liver.” The
                    arrowdivination or belomancy here mentioned was done with pointless arrows
                    marked and drawn äs lots. They are often represented on Babylonian and Assyrian
                    cylinders, and their use was kept up among the Arabs till the time of Mohammed.
                    The Babylonian rules of haruspication, or examining the entrails of animals,
                    were most minute, to judge from the omens of prosperity or misfortune to be
                    drawn from the twisting and colour of the intestines of an ass. Diodorus Siculus
                    (ii. 29, &amp;c.), in his account of the Chaldaean priests, mentions with
                    evidently good information their hereditary skill in various branches of magic,
                    their use of purifications, sacrifices, and chants, to avert evil and obtain
                    good, their foretelling by omens, dreams, prodigies, &amp;c. But it is on their
                    astrology that he deservedly lays the greatest stress. The five planets, which
                    they called “interpreters,” they held to portend events by their rising and
                    setting and their colour, foretelling the wind or rain or heat, comets also, and
                    eclipses of the sun and moon, and earthquakes, and atmospheric changes,
                    beneficial or harmful, both to nations and kings and common men. The Babylonian
                    calendars still remain to show how eclipses were brought into connexion with
                    floods, invasions, good and bad harvests,—such ideas being worked out, not by
                    mere arbitrary fancy, but from such fancied regularities as that the same
                    weather and the same famines and pestilences tended to recur in a cycle of
                    twelve years. To the Babylonian astrological system belong the stars of men’s
                    nativities, the planetary houses, the twelve signs of the zodiac (probably
                    invented in observatories in Babylon), while the fixed stars are associated with
                    the planets and gods in a system which is seen at a glance to be the astrology
                    which later nations of Asia and Europe have followed since with servile
                    faithfulness.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Sayce

                <p>Egypt and Babylon, as these brief notices show, were the chief sources whence the
                    world learnt what may be called the higher branches of occult science, and from
                    the historical point of view the magical rites and beliefs of other ancient
                    Eastern nations, such as Asia Minor and India, are of little importance. It was
                    mainly through Greece and Rome that magic was consolidated and <pb break="no"

                    classic nations there may be traced the rude old magic inherited from barbaric
                    ancestors, to which in later times were added ceremonies and calculations
                    imported as Oriental wisdom. Ancient literature shows the Greeks as a people
                    whose religion ran much into the consultation of oracle-gods at many temples, of
                    which the shrine of Apollo at Delphi was the chief. No rite could keep up more
                    perfectly the habit of savage religion than their necromancy (v∈κpo∕xαvτeια, <hi
                    rend="italic">veκυoμavτeld)</hi> or consulting ghosts for prophecy; -there was
                    a' famous oracle of the dead near the river Acheron in Thesprotia, where the
                    departing souls crossed on their way to Hades (Herod., v. 92). The myth of Circe
                    turning the companions of Odysseus into swine shows the barbaric belief in
                    magical transformation of men into beasts, and the classic sorcerer was believed
                    to turn himself into a wolf by spells like the medicine-man of some modern
                    savage tribe. Not less clearly does the story of Medea and her caldron typify
                    the witch-doctress with her pharmacy <hi rend="italic">{φapμaκeia)</hi> powerful
                    both to kill and bring to life. The worship of Hecate, the moon, sender of
                    midnight phantoms, lent itself especially to the magician’s rites, as may be
                    seen from this formula to evoke her: “O friend and companion of night, thou who
                    rejoicest in the baying of dogs and spilt blood, who wanderest in the midst of
                    shades among the tombs, who longest for blood and bringest terror to mortals,
                    Gorgo, Mormo, thousand-faced moon, look favourably on our sacrifices !” This
                    magical record, preserved by an early Christian writer, may be compared with the
                    poetic picture in Theocritus’s idyll of the sorceress <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Idyll.,</hi> ii.), where the passionate witch cries in similar words to
                    Hecate, the moon, to shine clear while she compels by sacrifice her faithless
                    lover, and goes through her magic ritual of love and hate, striving to force her
                    beloved home to her by whirling the brazen rhomb, scattering his bones with the
                    scattered barley, melting him to love by the melting wax, casting into the
                    fierce flames a torn shred of his cloak and laurels to crackle and blaze and be
                    consumed that his flesh shall be consumed likewise.. This ancient witchcraft
                    ascribed magic power to such filth as pounded lizards and the blood of creatures
                    untimely dead, revolting messes made familiar to moderns by Shakespeare, who
                    introduces real magic recipes in the witches’ caldron in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Macbeth.</hi> The early Greeks lived in the same fear as southern nations still
                    do of the arts of “fascination” (∕3ασκαι√α, Lat. <hi rend="italic"
                    >fascinatio)</hi> worked by envious praise, or ill-wishing, or the evil eye; and
                    they sought to avert these bad influences by the means still in use, spitting
                    and symbolic gestures, and the use of charms and amulets. As to ancient Rome,
                    much of the magic in the Latin poets, such as Virgil and Horace, is only Greek
                    sorcery in a Latin dress. But severe Roman laws against those who practised such
                    malefic arts as making hail and spoiling the crops show that here also the
                    sorcerer was at his usual work. What is more remarkable is the high official
                    place given to divination in old Rome, where every public act was done under
                    magical sanction. The <hi rend="italic">auspex,</hi> or bird-viewer, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">augur,</hi> whose similar name seems to refer also to omens from
                    the flight and cries of birds, in fact carried on supernatural divination not by
                    omens from birds only, but by a variety of magical processes forming a complex
                    traditional system, partly adopted from the Etruscans, as to which some curious
                    remarks have come down to us in the treatise <hi rend="italic">On
                    Divination</hi> by Cicero, himself an augur, though living in the days when the
                    ancient lore was falling into contempt. The Roman divination was, as its name
                    implies, a religious system of consulting the gods, who sent the signs to guide
                    mankind. Jupiter, the Heavenfather himself, was heard and seen in thunder and
                    lightning; wherefore these heavenly manifestations were of the highest import,
                    observed by the augur in the <hi rend="italic">templum</hi> or division of the
                    sky marked out with his <hi rend="italic">lituus</hi> or curved wand; there was
                    no better omen than when Jove lightened on the left. Among birds, the fierce
                    eagle, Jove’s messenger, gave the highest’ presage of victory, while the owl
                    with its dismal cry was unluckiest. The good or ill signs given by many birds
                    depended on whether they were on the right or left hand, and the sacred chickens
                    gave their omens according as they were eager or not to feed, and dropped crumbs
                    on the ground. All prodigies were recorded as portents in Roman affairs; and
                    those which Livy mentions year by year, whether they were real or fictitious, in
                    either case had their effect on the minds of men who saw national signs in a
                    heavy hailstorm, a calf born with two heads, or a bullock found when sacrificed
                    to have no heart. It was in quest of such portents that the haruspex made his
                    professional examination of the entrails of the victims, and reported the
                    aspects of the head of the liver or cleft of the lungs,, as a sacred guide to
                    warriors and statesmen in the conduct of national affairs. Public divination
                    being on this footing, it is not to be wondered at that, in the time of the
                    empire, foreign soothsayers thronged to Rome to practise their craft among rich’
                    and credulous dupes. It appears that the magic of Egypt and Babylon still held a
                    prominent place, for Juvenal refers to both in his sixth satire, where he rails
                    at the superstitious women of his time for putting their trust in Chaldaean
                    astrologers, all the more, if under the laws against magicians they had been put
                    in prison or banished, while ladies would not go out for a drive or take a meal
                    without consulting their book of lucky and unlucky hours, which bore the
                    Egyptian name of <hi rend="italic">Petosiris.</hi></p>
                <p>In the classic world, however, the growth of knowledge and accurate reasoning
                    began to have their effect in bringing magic to the test of facts, and proving
                    its failure. Greek philosophy, with its physical theories of the universe, had
                    shaken the old religion, and with it the old magic. Though the Romans kept it up
                    as a matter of statecraft, the judgment of statesmen and philosophers revolted
                    from it, holding rather with Ennius, who pointed out the absurdity of the hungry
                    fortune-teller promising others wealth and begging a drachma for himself, or
                    with Cato, who wondered that one diviner could meet another and not burst out
                    laughing. These are both quoted by Cicero, with other passages argued quite in
                    the modern spirit, as where he asks on what principle a raven’s croak should be

                    could help dropping crumbs. Historically attacks of this kind have a particular
                    value, as recording many magical details which we do not know from the believers
                    themselves. Of such details Pliny’s <hi rend="italic">Natural History</hi> is
                    full, though he hates magic as the most fraudulent of arts; and among the most
                    instructive accounts of classic astrology must be reckoned the treatise written
                    against it by Sextus Empiricus. Had sceptical philosophy had its way, magic
                    would have perished ages earlier out of the civilized world. But there were
                    other influences already at work, not only to preserve it, but even to give it
                    another great expansion before its final decay.</p>
                <p>The Pythagorean philosophy, while on the one hand bringing in the science of
                    Egypt and Babylon, and develop- <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> ing it into Greek
                    mathematics and physics, on the; other hand favoured the growth of magic by
                    mystical speculations, such as those on numbers. Not that the Pythagoreans began
                    this delusive science, which had long been at home in Babylon, where the occult
                    powers of the planetary 7 and the zodiacal 12 were recognized, and spiritual
                    arithmetic was carried so far as to indicate good deities by whole numbers and
                    evil demons by fractions. But the Pythagoreans developed it further in their
                    mystic <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n220/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0220-0203"/> symbolism of the active 1 and the passive 2, the
                    sacred 4 of space proceeding from the 1⅛ the 7 of intelligence, the 8 of love,
                    and the 10 of the universe. Whatever rational thought may at first have been
                    veiled under all this, its literal nonsense suited the magical mind, and its
                    effects may be traced in magical literature ever since. With such speculations
                    was combined an animistic system of spirits pervading the world, ranging from
                    gods and demons down to the souls of beasts and plants. Both in mystic symbolism
                    and in the doctrine of demons the mind of Plato followed the Pythagorean track,
                    and at a later period the tendency towards magical speculation came out strongly
                    among the Neo-Platonists, when enthusiasts, not content with speculating about
                    the daemonic powers of the universe, sought to establish personal relations with
                    them, and use them for their own ends. The treatise on the Egyptian mysteries
                    ascribed to Iamblichus is an interesting record of this phase of thought.
                    Alexandria became the especial home of systems of theurgic magic, in which
                    invocations, sacrifices, diagrams, talismans, were employed with rule and
                    method, as though they were really effective. Much of this delusive craft has
                    perished or become unintelligible, but its once considerable hold on men’s minds
                    may be traced in such relics as the gem-talismans of the Gnostics, still objects
                    of curiosity to archaeologists; among their formulas is the celebrated <hi
                    rend="italic">Abraxas,</hi> the Greek letters of which <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Aβpαξας, Aβρaσaξ)</hi> stand with astronomical significance for the number
                    365. The theurgy which came down into mediaeval and modern Europe is strongly
                    marked with Jewish magical speculation. After the captivity, the Jews worked out
                    a classification and nomenclature of angels and demons. On the one side are
                    ranged such celestial powers as Gabriel and Raphael, while against them stand
                    such beings as <hi rend="smallcaps">Beelzebub</hi> (g ’.v.) and Ashmodai or
                    Asmodaeus (Tobit, chap, iii., &lt;fcc.), who is clearly the great evil demon
                    Aeshma-daeva of the Persian religion. Many centuries afterwards, in European
                    magic books of the Middle Ages we find the remains of these theurgic systems
                    still handed on. Their elaborate folly may be best realized by looking into such
                    books as Francis Barrett’s <hi rend="italic">Magus,</hi> or Horst’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Zauber-Bibliothek,</hi> where the actual rites and formulas for
                    raising demons are given. The evocations, with their uncouth jumbles of sacred
                    names, have some historical interest from their strangely mixed traces of
                    ancient religions, preserved by charlatans whose blunders show how little they
                    understood the words they copied. We can fancy the magician in his black robe
                    embroidered with mystic characters, waving his wand as he invokes at one breath
                    the great demons <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> Acheront,' ’ “Ashtaroth,”
                    “Asmodi,” names which the modern student recognizes as borrowed from the ancient
                    religions of three different countries—Greece, Phoenicia, Persia. Of all the
                    sources of this branch of magic, the Jewish tradition is the chief. The magician
                    relies on the power of divine Hebrew names, such as the <hi rend="italic">shem
                    hammephorash</hi> or the name Jehovah in its true pronunciation, with which
                    Solomon and other wonder-workers of old did marvellous things. He draws powerful
                    spells from the <hi rend="smallcaps">Kabbalah</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(ç.v.)</hi> of the later Jews, with its transposed letters and artificial
                    words,— using for instance the name <hi rend="italic">Agla,</hi> formed from the
                    initials of the Hebrew sentence—“Thou art a mighty God for ever.” But in
                    compelling the spirits he can use Hebrew and Greek in admired confusion, as in
                    the following formula (copied with its mistakes as an illustration of magical
                    scholarship in its lowest stage)—“Hel Heloym Sother Emmanuel Sabaoth Agla
                    Tetragrammaton Agyros Otheos Ischyros Atħanatos Jehova Va Adonai Saday Homousion
                    Messias Eschereheye !” One of the most curious features of the demon-evocation
                    is the use of the pentagram, an essential adjunct of the magic circle, whose
                    effect in barring the passage of Mephistopheles is described in a welkknown
                    scene in Goethe’s <hi rend="italic">Faust.</hi> This symbol is an interesting
                    proof of tradition from the Pythagoreans. It is a geometrical figure for the
                    construction of the regular pentagon (Euclid, iv. prop. 11), now familiar to
                    school-boys, but which to the school of Pythagoras was so wondrous a novelty
                    that they used it as a sign of fellowship (see Bretsch neider, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geometrie vor</hi><hi rend="italic">Euklides,</hi> p. 85), and it afterwards
                    became a magical symbol, still to be seen in use in every country from Ireland
                    to China.</p>
                <p>The magic of the Moslem world is in part adopted from Jewish angelology and
                    demonology, and in part carries on Babylonian-Greek astrology, as systematized
                    by such writers as Paul of Alexandria and Claudius Ptolemy. Thus the proceedings
                    of the Moslem magician, as met with in the <hi rend="italic">Thousand and One
                    Nights,</hi> mostly run parallel with those familiar in Europe, in their

                    these tricks, now come down among us to jugglers’ feats, were regarded as
                    supernatural. In the low Buddhism of the Mongols, mixed with native barbarism,
                    the <hi rend="italic">shamans</hi> or sorcererpriests, with their rude
                    sacrifices and demon-dances, are among the most remarkable types of their
                    ancient class. In this part of Asia, and farther east, a somewhat remarkable
                    system of divinatory magic has grown out of the reckoning of days, months, and
                    years by a zodiac-calendar, whose signs <hi rend="italic">ape, horse, dog,</hi>
                    &lt;fcc., are combined in series with the elements, male and female, so that a
                    year may be called that of the “female fire-dog.” It was inevitable that such a
                    system should lead the magicians to draw omens from its signs. They do so in a
                    most elaborate way, interfering with their presages on every occasion of life,
                    beginning when the child undergoes its ceremonial washing, and has its fate
                    defined by the signs it is born under, as “in the element fire, under the red
                    sign in the year of the tiger, in the month of the sheep and day of the hog, in
                    the fortieth division of the day under the influence of the ninth star,” &amp;c.

                    has extended across Asia, even into China. The magic of this latter country is
                    remarkable for its various and elaborate modes of divination. These may be
                    obtained from mediums possessed by spirits, and giving oracles by speech or
                    writing with the “descending pencil,” as has lately been done by “spiritualists”
                    in Europe. But higher authority is given to divination by throwing sacred lots,
                    as the two wooden <hi rend="italic">ka pwe,</hi> which fall with the flat or
                    rounded side up. The results of such processes of divination, in
                    themselves-meagre, may be brought to any required elaborateness by the use of
                    the “eight diagrams” obtained by combinations of the whole line (—) and the
                    broken line (—). These, primarily interpreted as representing the male and the

                    heavenly and earthly, are referred by systematic fancy to elements, qualities,

                <p>In the lower stages of civilization the distinction between religion and magic
                    hardly appears, the functions of priest and sorcerer being still blended, as was
                    long since pointed out by Meiners <hi rend="italic">(Geschichte der
                    Religionen,</hi> book xii.). As established religions were formed among nations
                    of a higher grade, the separation became more distinct between the official
                    rites of the priesthood and those practised by castes of magicians, rivalry
                    often becoming serious between them. Thus in ancient Egypt there appear, on the
                    one hand, the miracles worked by divinities under official sanction of the
                    priesthood, and, on the other hand, the unlicensed proceedings of sorcerers, who
                    indeed doubtless deserved ill of society by practices done by detestable means
                    or for detestable ends, such as bewitching by hurtful demons, or administering
                    love-potions. Here we come into view of the distinction still expressed by the
                    terms “white magic” and “black magic.” Laws were made against magic in these
                    ancient times, but it must be remembered that then and for thousands of years
                    later, the opposition to magic had seldom anything to do with the sceptical
                    doubts of its reality which arose among the classic philosophers. Magic was none
                    the less believed in for being hated and proscribed; and when a soothsayer was
                    looked upon as a false prophet the inference was, not that magic was unreal, but
                    that this particular magician was pretending to supernatural power he did not
                    possess. The Levitical law prohibits sorcery under penalty of death (Levit, xx.
                    27). Among the early Christians sorcery was recognize.d as illegal miracle; and
                    magic acts, such as turning men into beasts, calling up familiar demons, raising
                    storms, &amp;c., are mentioned, not in a sceptical spirit, but with reprobation.
                    In the changed relations of the state to the church under Constantine, the laws
                    against magic served the new purpose of proscribing the rites of the Greek and
                    Roman religion, whose oracles, sacrifices, and auguries, once carried on under
                    the highest public sanction, were put under the same ban with the low arts of
                    the necromancer and the witch.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>For an excellent account of the classical and mediaeval

                    its sway over Europe, the same antagonism continued, the church striving with
                    considerable success to put down at once the old local religions, and the even
                    older practices of witchcraft; condemning Thor and Woden as demons, they
                    punished their rites in common with those of the sorcerers who bewitched their
                    neighbours, and turned themselves into wolves or cats. Thus gradually arose the
                    legal persecution of witches, which went on through the Middle Ages under
                    ecclesiastical sanction both Catholic and Protestant. The literature of the
                    Middle Ages does not contribute many new elements to the study of magic, which
                    was carried on under the old traditional systems. But it shows on the one hand
                    how unbroken the faith of even the educated classes remained in the reality of
                    magic, and on the other hand that its more respectable branches, such as
                    astrology and alchemy, were largely followed, and indeed included in their scope
                    much of the real science of the period (see the works of Thomas Aquinas,
                    Gerbert, Roger Bacon, Cornelius Agrippa, &amp;c.). The final fall of magic began
                    with the revival of science in the 16th and 17th centuries, when the question
                    whether the supposed effects of magic really take place or not was raised, and
                    decided against it. In our day the occult sciences are rapidly dying out in the
                    educated classes of the civilized world, though astrology still has its
                    votaries, and the communications in “spirit circles” by possessed mediums and
                    spirit-writing are what would in old times have been classed as necromancy. The
                    magic which holds its place most firmly in Europe has come down by tradition in
                    popular folk-lore, which is full of precepts for bewitching and averting
                    witchcraft, and divining by omens. Among the practices which occur to everyone’s
                    mind are foretelling changes of the weather by the moon’s quarters, taking omens
                    from seeing magpies and hearing a dog howl at night, the fear of spilling salt,
                    observation of the shroud in the candle and the stranger in the tea-cup, the
                    girls’ listening to the cuckoo to tell how soon they will be married, pulling
                    off the row of leaves to settle what the lover’s calling will be, and perhaps
                    even compelling him to come by a pin stuck through the rushlight. Nor has the
                    wizard forgotten how to cure inflammation with a “thunderbolt,” generally an
                    ancient stone or bronze hatchet dug up in the fields, nor how to punish an enemy
                    by means of a heart stuck full of pins and hung in the chimney. These are but a
                    few out of hundreds to be found in Brand’s <hi rend="italic">Popular
                    Antiquities</hi> and the volumes published by the Folklore Society, or in the
                    similar collections from every country of Europe. If any one wonders that
                    popular magic still enjoys much credit in the peasant class, it should be
                    remembered that even the educated world still shows a remarkable
                    unreasonableness in connecting causes and effects. Thus the old magical belief
                    survives that a loadstone, because it draws steel, will also draw out pain.
                    Peasants may well carry a magnet in their trousers’ pocket against rheumatism
                    when better-informed people will wear with as great confidence a “galvanic
                    belt,” though any electrician will tell them it has not the power to hurt or
                    cure a fly. One of the most favourable proofs of the changed public opinion in
                    England is seen in the laws, where the penalties of the old statute against
                    those who keep familiar demons are abolished, and the time-honoured charge has
                    disappeared from the commission of the peace to inquire of all “inchantments,
                    sorceries, art magic, trespasses, forestallings, regratings, &amp;c.” But
                    persons pretending to exercise witchcraft, sorcery, enchantment, or conjuration,
                    or undertaking to tell fortunes or pretending by occult or crafty science to
                    discover lost or stolen goods, may be imprisoned under 9 Geo. II. c. 5, or
                    fortune-tellers dealt with as rogues and vagabonds under 5 Geo. IV. c. 83, or
                    they may be prosecuted for obtaining money under false pretences.</p>
                <p>Looked at as a series of delusions, magic is distasteful to the modern mind,
                    which, once satisfied of its practical futility, is apt to discard it as folly
                    unworthy of further notice.</p>

                <p>This, however, is hardly doing it justice, for iu the early developments of the
                    human mind both religion and science were intimately connected with magic, whose
                    various branches, unfruitful as they may be, are nevertheless growths from the
                    tree of knowledge. The universal diffusion of magical ideas among mankind,
                    excepting only the limited class who have abandoned them through higher
                    education, shows that we are here in presence of adeep-seated intellectual
                    process, while the strong likeness in the principles of magic among the rudest
                    tribes points to its having sprung up under most ancient and primitive
                    conditions. The connexion between magic and religion in its lower stages is
                    obvious from the impossibility of separating them, inasmuch as in every country
                    sorcerers and diviners, savage or civilized, are found invoking the aid of
                    ghosts, demons, or gods, to give them information or execute their will. So far
                    as magic is ascribed to the influence of spirits, its theory belongs to the
                    animistic philosophy developed in the lower levels of civilization, where all
                    the powers of life and nature are set down to spiritual beings (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Animism).</hi> A chief part of the magician’s business being to
                    converse with spirits and gain their help, he sets about this in various ways.
                    More often than not the spirit is considered to be a human ghost, which behaves
                    much as it did while it was still a living man’s soul; or if it is called a
                    demon or deity, still these are beings modelled on the human soul. Thus their
                    manner of hearing prayers and receiving offerings is like human intercourse,
                    especially in the frequent cases where the sorcerer is a “medium” possessed by
                    the spirit, who is considered to inhabit his body like his ordinary soul, and to
                    give oracles speaking by his human voice. In such supposed interviews with
                    spirits there is plenty of delusion and fraud, but nothing specially magical;
                    and, in fact, were the whole craft of the sorcerer of this spiritualistic kind,
                    there would be no practical distinction between the sorcerer and the priest, and
                    magic would fall into its place as an inferior branch of religion. It is because
                    magical practices are by no means accounted for altogether by the doctrine of
                    spirits, but involve other special explanations of their own, that it is found
                    convenient to make magic a department by itself. Such explanation is needed in
                    ordinary magical practices, like that of the American medicine-man, who draws a
                    deer on a piece of bark and shoots at it, expecting thereby to kill a real deer
                    next day, or of the Tongan soothsayer, who spins a cocoa-nut as a teetotum, in
                    order to discover a thief by noticing towards whom the monkey-face of the nut is
                    looking when it stops. The magical train of thought which leads men to resort to
                    such devices is childishly simple. It is merely imperfect reasoning, the
                    mistaking of an ideal connexion for a real one, the confusion of ineffective
                    analogy with effective cause. Our minds go with those of the barbaric magicians
                    so far as to recognize the analogy between shooting an animal and its picture;
                    we see as plainly as they that the cocoa-nut as it were looks in a particular
                    direction. The difference is that, in the magical stage of thought, these are
                    taken to be real connexions, while more advanced knowledge discards them as
                    ideal. As Wilhelm von Humboldt well remarks, “Man begins by seeking the
                    connexion even of external phenomena in the region of thought; . . . . pure
                    observation, still more experiment, follow at a wide distance after ideal or
                    phantastic systems. Man’s first attempt is to govern nature through its
                    idea.”</p>
                <p>So much of the intellect of mankind has been spent since remote antiquity on
                    magic that it may seem hard to believe the chief secret of the occult sciences
                    to be after all nothing but bad reasoning. This at any rate is very unlike the
                    theories propounded by those who have condemned magic as a real craft made known
                    to man by diabolical influence, or by those who have thought to find in its
                    mystic precepts relics of antique wisdom. The question is not, however, an
                    abstruse one, for every reader has the means of satisfying himself by inspection
                    of a few magical processes, as to what amount of reason really goes to making
                    them. In a large proportion of cases there may be perceived, not absolute
                    nonsense, but a kind of halfformed sense stopping short of practical value.
                    There being an evident relation between an object and the thought of it, it
                    becomes one of the chief practices of the sorcerer to try to make things happen
                    by thinking about them. Thus he so “takes the will for the deed” that when he
                    “ill-wishes” his enemies, and looks upon them with the “evil eye,” he believes
                    that he does them direct harm. On the other hand, those who know or suspect that
                    such influence has been used against them suffer in reality from fear, often
                    even dying of it. The belief in this mysterious power furnishes an explanation
                    which is resorted to when any one falls ill or has any misfortune, and thus the
                    belief in witchcraft among savages leads to constant enmity and revenge. Nor is
                    this state of things to be traced only in what is called the uncivilized world,
                    for those who have much intercourse with English country folks may still meet
                    with instances of some cow or child firmly believed to have been “overlooked,”
                    the death of which may possibly be revenged on a neighbouring cottager, supposed
                    to be the witch. Whenever a good or evil wish is uttered iu words, it becomes a
                    blessing or curse. When these are addressed to some deity or demon, they are in
                    fact prayers, but when they are merely expressed wishes, without reference to
                    any spiritual being, then their supposed effects are purely magical. Thus, in an
                    ancient Hindu love-charm, the girl expects to bring back an offended lover by
                    repeating the formula, “May thy heart devour itself for me, may thy dry mouth
                    water for me !” &amp;c. Still more does this kind of magic explain itself in the
                    various rites where some object is used as a symbol, and the association of
                    ideas transfers whatever is done to it to the person it represents. Thus Ovid’s
                    sorceress <hi rend="italic">(Herowl.,</hi> vi. 91)—</p>
                <p>“simulacraque cerea fingit, Et miserum tenuis in jecur urget acus.”</p>
                <p>King James in his <hi rend="italic">Daemonology</hi> says that “the devil
                    teacheth how to make pictures of wax or clay, that by roasting thereof the
                    persons that they bear the name of may be continually melted or dried away by
                    continual sickness.” By a similar association of ideas, any object which has
                    belonged to a person may be thus practised on, as has been already here
                    mentioned among the South Sea islanders, or, to take a case nearer home, when in
                    1618 two women were executed at Lincoln for burying the glove of Henry Lord
                    Rosse, so that, “as that glove did rot and waste, so did the liver of the said
                    lord rot and waste.” By like reasoning, when internal disease is ascribed to
                    knots within the patient’s body, it becomes a branch of witchcraft to tie magic
                    knots, which produce their corresponding effect within the victim. Kindlier
                    though not less delusive operations of misunderstood analogy are found in
                    attempted cures by sympathetic magic, on the same principle which malignant
                    sorcerers would have used in giving the disease itself. Thus knots are untied in
                    order to untie internal complications in the sick beast, and weapons treated to
                    cure by sympathy the wounds they made :—</p>
                <p>“But she has ta’en the broken lance,</p>
                <p>And washed it .from the clotted gore, And salved the splinter o’er and o’er.
                    William of Deloraine in trance,</p>
                <p>Whene’er she turned it round and round, Twisted, as if she galled his wound.</p>
                <p>Then to her maidens she did say</p>
                <p>That he should be whole man and sound Within the course of a night and day.” <hi

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0223-0206"/> medicine appear to have been chosen for magical
                    rather than medical motives, by a kind of reasoning which comes out very plainly
                    among Chinese physicians, who administer the heads, middles, and roots of plants
                    to cure their patients’ heads, bodies, and legs respectively. In like manner
                    European doctors long followed the “doctrine of signatures,” which was in fact
                    mere magic,—prescribing euphrasy or “eye-bright” for complaints of the eyes,
                    because of the likeness of an eye in the flower, and treating small-pox with
                    mulberries because their colour made them' proper to diseases of the blood (see
                    Pettigrew, <hi rend="italic">Superstitions of Medicine and Surgery).</hi> The
                    same easily-understood though practically absurd principle may be seen to have
                    guided the processes of divination, many of which show plainly the association
                    of ideas that suggested them. Thus, in the Roman augury already mentioned, there
                    is no difficulty in following the fancy which made the war-eagle give an omen of
                    victory, but attached a doleful foreboding to the melancholy owl. The same
                    half-rational meaning explains the reversal of omens accordingly as they come on
                    the right or left, that is, the good or bad hand. Any one who glances through
                    one of the cheap dream-books still bought by servant-maids, which fairly
                    represent the ancient books on <hi rend="italic">oneiromancy,</hi> such as that
                    of Artemidorus, will find many of the analogies still intelligible on which they
                    are founded, as that to dream of washing one’s hands.presages relief from
                    anxiety, while he who dreams of losing a tooth will lose a friend. The ancient
                    art of <hi rend="italic">chiromancy,</hi> or telling fortunes by the band, goes
                    on the evident analogy between the lines of the palm and the diverging courses
                    of human life; closely allied to this is <hi rend="italic">scapulimancy</hi> or
                    divining by the cracks of a shoulder-blade put into the fire. Of divination by
                    lots, so common that the term for throwing lots <hi rend="italic">(sortes)</hi>
                    has passed into <hi rend="italic">sorcery,</hi> there are many varieties. Some
                    are quite pictorial, such as the Maori diviner’s sticks set up in the ground to
                    show by their standing or falling the fate of the warriors they represent. But
                    this strong analogy is not necessary, for it only requires a particular lot to
                    be mentally associated with a particular idea to make the diviner believe that
                    the fall of that lot makes that idea true. It would be tedious to go at length
                    through other details of magic where the same key of imperfect analogy applies.
                    But it may be pointed out that this explanation is nowhere more conclusive than
                    in astrology. The very foundation of the science of the horoscope lies in the
                    mere analogy between the rising of a star above the horizon and the birth of a
                    man. Such circumstances as whether a planet is in conjunction or opposition
                    alter their effect on the “native” in corresponding ways. The names of gods,
                    happening to be given also to certain planets, are taken as omens, so that
                    because a planet bears the name of Mercury it is brought into fancifμl connexion
                    with wisdom, and in like manner the planet Venus with love. Each planet having a
                    colour assigned to it, the aspect of Mars or Saturn is believed to tell one,
                    when in quest of a thief, whether he will have on red or black clothes. So the
                    arbitrary names of the signs of the zodiac are made into presages, a just person
                    being found under the sign of Libra, and charms against bugs being effective in
                    the sign-of Cancer. For convenience some of these examples are. taken from
                    modern handbooks of astrology, but in principle the old starcraft has changed
                    little in the course of ages. In the study of magic it is necessary further to
                    notice that precepts which seem quite arbitrary, not showing even fanciful
                    half-reason, are often explained on further examination, which gives the key to
                    the symbolic process by which they are formed. For instance, it would hardly be
                    guessed why Cancer should be a sign involving movableness, but Scorpio firmness,
                    were it not known that this result is obtained by arranging the twelve signs in
                    order as they stand, as successivêly movable, fixed, and double (see Proclus,
                    <hi rend="italic">Paraphrasis,</hi> i. 15). Considering the antiquity of magic,
                    the wonder is not that so much of its sense should be lost, but that so much is
                    still intelligible.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For

                    really arrived at by the diviner himself, not by the twig, and the same is true
                    of various similar arts. From the earliest times also tricks of sleight-of-hand,
                    &amp;c., have been passed off by magicians as miracles to deceive their dupes;
                    our language still testifies to this in the use of the word <hi rend="italic"

                    what most practically manifests itself in history. Yet it must be borne in mind
                    that in its early stages it has been a source of real knowledge. True as it is
                    that misunderstood facts and misleading analogies have produced its delusions,
                    its imperfect arguments have been steps towards more perfect reasoning. Analogy
                    has always been the forerunner of scientific thought, and, as experience
                    corrected and restricted it into real effectiveness, from age to age whole
                    branches of what was magic passed into the realm of science. The vague and
                    misleading parts which could not be thus transformed were left behind as occult
                    science, and thus the very reason why magic is almost all bad is because when
                    any of it becomes good it ceases to be magic. From this point of view the
                    intellectual position of magic is well expressed by Adolf Bastian <hi
                    rend="italic">(Pechtsalterthümer,</hi> p. 242):—“Sorcery, or, in its higher
                    expression, magic, marks the first dawning consciousness of mutual connexion
                    throughout nature, in which man, feeling himself part of the whole, thinks
                    himself able to interfere for his own wishes or needs. So long as religion fills
                    the whole horizon of culture, the vague groping of magic contains the first
                    experiments which lead to the results of exact science. Magic is the physics of
                    mankind in the state of nature. It rests on the beginning of induction, which
                    remains without result only because in its imperfect judgments by analogy it
                    raises the <hi rend="italic">post hoe</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">propter
                    hoc,</hi> &amp;c.” The nature-spirits and demons with which the magician has so
                    much to do represent indeed the notion of physical cause in the rudimentary
                    science of the lower races, while the association of ideas on which his sorcery
                    and divination is based has much the same relation to the scientific induction
                    which succeeds it. That this • view is sound is best shown by noticing the great
                    departments of science whose early development is known to have taken place
                    through magic. Astronomy grew up in Babylon, not through quest of mechanical
                    laws of the universe, but through observation of the heavens to obtain presages
                    of wars and harvest; while even in modern times Kepler’s discoveries in physical
                    astronomy were led up to through mystic magical speculations. In alchemy appears
                    the early history of chemistry, which only emancipated itself in modern ages
                    from its magical surroundings. The astrological connexion of the metals each
                    with its planet was one of its fundamental ideas, of which the traces are still
                    to be found in the name of the metal “mercury,” and that of “<hi rend="italic"
                    >lunar</hi> caustic” for silver nitrate. Lastly, the history of medicine goes
                    back to the times when primitive science accepted demoniacal possession as the
                    rational means of accounting for disease, and magical operations with herbs
                    originated their more practical use in materia medica. <hi rend="smallcaps"> (e∙
