                    ”), a name, suggested by the conical or papillary form of the projections on the
                    molar teeth of some of the species, given by Cuvier to a genus of extinct
                    elephant-like animals. Their position in the suborder <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proboscidea</hi> of the great order <hi rend="italic">Ungulata</hi> has been
                    indicated in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> (p. 425 of the
                    present volume).</p>
                <p>In size, general form, and principal osteological characters the Mastodons
                    resembled the Elephants. It is by the teeth alone that the two groups ace to be
                    distinguished, and, as shown in the article just referred to, so numerous are
                    the modifications of these organs in each, and so insensibly do they pass by a
                    series of gradations into one another, that the distinction between the two is
                    an arbitrary and artificial one, though convenient and even necessary for
                    descriptive purposes.</p>
                <p>As in other Proboscideans, the teeth of Mastodons consist only of incisors and
                    molars. The incisors or tusks are never more than a single pair in each jaw. In
                    the upper jaw they are always present and of large size, but apparently never so
                    much curved as in some species of Elephant, and they often have longitudinal
                    bands of enamel, more or less spirally disposed upon their surface, which are
                    not met with in Elephants. Lower incisors, never found in true Elephants, are
                    present throughout life in some species of Mastodon, which have the symphysis of
                    the lower jaw greatly elongated to support them (as in <hi rend="italic">Μ.
                    angτιstidens, Μ. pentelici,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Μ. longirostris</hi> (see
                    fig. 1, C'). In the common American species (<hi rend="italic">Μ.
                    ohioticus,</hi> Blumenbacb) there were two tusks in the lower jaw in the young
                    of both sexes; these were soon shed in the female, but one of them was retained
                    in the male. In other species no inferior tusks have been found, at all events
                    in adult life (see figure of <hi rend="italic">Μ. turicensis).</hi></p>
                <p>The molar teeth are six in number on each side, increasing in size from before
                    backwards, and, as in the Elephants, with a horizontal succession, the anterior
                    teeth being lost before the full development of the posterior teeth, which
                    gradually move forward, taking the place of those that have been destroyed by
                    wear. This process is, however, not so complete as in the true Elephants, and as
                    many as three teeth may be in place in each jaw at one time. There is, moreover,
                    in many species a true vertical succession, affecting either the third, or the
                    third and second, or (in one American species, <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">productus)</hi> the first, second, and third of the six molariform
                    teeth. These three are therefore reckoned as milk molars, and their successors
                    as premolars, while the last three, which are never changed, correspond to the
                    true molars of those animals in .which the typical dentition is fully developed.
                    The study of the mode of succession of the teeth in the different species of
                    Mastodons is particularly interesting, as it exhibits so many stages of the
                    process by which the very anomalous dentition of the modern Elephants may have
                    been derived by gradual modification from the typical heterodont and diphyodont
                    dentition of the ordinary Mammal. It also shows that the anterior molars of
                    Elephants do not correspond to the premolars of other Ungulates, but to the milk
                    molars, the early loss of which in consequence of the peculiar process of
                    horizontal forward-moving succession does not require, or allow time for, their
                    replacement by premolars. It must be noted, however, that, in the Mastodon in
                    some respects the least specialized in tooth-structure, the <hi rend="italic">Μ.
                    ohioticus</hi> of North America, no vertical succession of the molars has yet
                    been observed, although vast numbers of specimens have been examined.</p>
                <p>The Mastodons have, generally speaking, fewer ridges on their molar teeth than
                    the Elephants <hi rend="italic">j</hi> the ridges are also less elevated, wider
                    apart, have a thicker enamel covering, and scarcely any cementum filling up the
                    space between them. Sometimes (as in <hi rend="italic">Μ. ohioticus)</hi> the
                    ridges are simple transverse wedge-shaped elevations, with straight or concave
                    edges. In other species the summits of the ridges are more or less subdivided
                    into conical cusps, and may have accessory cusps clustering around them (as in
                    <hi rend="italic">Μ. arvernensis,</hi> see fig. 2). When the apices of these are
                    worn by mastication, their surfaces resemble circles of dentine, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0654-0623"/> surrounded by a border of enamel, and as the
                    attrition proceeds different patterns are produced by the union of the bases of
                    the cusps, a trilobed or trefoil form being characteristic of some species.</p>
                <p>Certain of the molar teeth of the middle of the series in both Elephants and
                    Mastodons have the same number of principal ridges, and those in front of them
                    have fewer and those behind a greater number. These teeth were distinguished as
                    “intermediate” molars by Dr Falconer, to whose extensive and conscientious
                    researches we owe much of our knowledge of the structure of this group of
                    animals. In the restricted genus <hi rend="italic">Elephas</hi> there are only
                    two, the last milk molar and the first true molar (or the third and fourth of
                    the whole series), which are alike in the number of ridges; whereas in the
                    Mastodons there are three such teeth, the last milk molar and the first and
                    second true molars (or the third, fourth, and fifth of the whole series). In the
                    Elephants the number of ridges on the intermediate molars always exceeds five,
                    but in the Mastodons it is nearly always three or four, and the tooth in front
                    has usually one fewer and that behind one more, so that the ridge formula
                    (?&gt;., a formula expressing the number of ridges on each of the six molar
                    teeth) of most Mastodons can be reduced either to 1,2, 3, 3, 3, 4 or 2, 3, 4, 4,
                    4, 5. The former characterizes the section called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Triloρhodon,</hi> and the latter that called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tetralophodon</hi> by Dr Falconer. These divisions are very useful, as under
                    one or the other all the present known species of Mastodon can be ranged, but
                    observations upon a larger number of individuals have shown that the number of
                    ridges upon the teeth is by no means so constant as implied by the mathematical
                    formulae given above. Their exact enumeration is even difficult in many cases,
                    as “talons” or small accessory ridges at the hinder end of the teeth occur in
                    various stages of development, until they take on the character of true ridges.
                    Transitional conditions have also been shown, at least in some of the teeth,
                    between the trilophodont and the tetralophodont forms, and again between the
                    latter and what has been called a “pentalophodont” type, which leads on towards
                    the condition of dental structure characteristic of the true Elephants.</p>
                <p>The range of the genus <hi rend="italic">Mastodon</hi> in time was from the
                    middle of the Miocene period to the end of the Pliocene in the Old World, when
                    they became extinct; but in America several species— especially the best-known,
                    owing to the abundance of its remains, which has been variously called <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ. ohioticus, Μ. americanus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Μ.
                    gigantcus—</hi> survived quite to a late Pleistocene period.</p>
                <p>The range in space will be best indicated by the following list of the generally
                    recognized species. 1. Trilophodont series— <hi rend="italic">Μ. angustidens,
                    borsoni, pentetici, pyrenaicus, tapiroides</hi> (or <hi rend="italic"
                    >turicensis), υirgatidens,</hi> from Europe; <hi rend="italic">Μ. falconeri</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">pandionis,</hi> from India; <hi rend="italic">Μ.
                    ohioticus,</hi><hi rend="italic">obscur</hi><hi rend="italic">us,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">&amp;ηά</hi><hi rend="italic">productus,</hi> N orth America; and
                    <hi rend="italic">M.andium,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">humboldtii,</hi> South
                    America. 2. Tetralophodont series— <hi rend="italic">Μ. arυernensis, Μ.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dissimilis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">longirostris,</hi> from
                    Europe; <hi rend="italic">Μ. latidens, sivalensis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >peramensis,</hi> from India; <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mirificus,</hi> from North America. The only two of which remains have been
                    found in Great Britain are <hi rend="italic">Μ. arvcrnensis</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ. borsoni,</hi> both from the crags of Norfolk and Suffolk.</p>
                <p>The range of the genus was thus very extensive, and it has even been supposed to
                    reach to Australia, where no Ungulate mammal has ever been proved to exist. This
                    supposition until very recently has been based upon the evidence of a single
                    molar tooth of an animal undoubtedly belonging to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mastodon,</hi> and alleged to have been brought from near Boree Creek, an
                    affluent of the Lachlan river in the Ashburnham district, New South Wales, by
                    the late Count Strzelecki, and described by Professor Owen in 1844 under the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Μ. australis.</hi> Its identity with the South
                    American <hi rend="italic">Μ. andium</hi> has, however, been shown by Dr
                    Falconer, who has thrown grave doubts upon the locality assigned to the
                    specimen. A fragment of a tusk, of the Australian origin of which there is less
                    question, and which presents the characteristic structure only known at present
                    in Elephants and Mastodons, has been lately described by Professor Owen <hi
                    rend="italic">(Proc. Roy. Soc.,</hi> March 30, 1882). It was found in a
                    drift-deposit of a ravine in a district of Darling Downs, 60 miles to the
                    eastward of Moreton Bay, Queensland. Unfortunately no other portions of the
                    remains of the animal to which it belonged have been discovered.</p>
