                    consisting of twelve parallel streets intersected at right angles by ten others,
                    which cut it up into about 130 square sections of equal size. These blocks are
                    distinguished, after the American fashion, by letters and numerals. Except on
                    the south side all the streets debouch on the promenade, which forms a circle
                    round the town on the site of the old ramparts. Outside this ring are the
                    suburbs of Schwetz-inger Garten to the south and Neckargärten to the north.
                    Mannheim is connected by a handsome bridge with Ludwigshafen, a rapidly growing
                    commercial and manufacturing town on the left bank of the Rhine, in Bavarian
                    territory. The Neckar is spanned by a suspension bridge. In 1880 Mannheim
                    contained 53,545 inhabitants, of whom about 4500 were Jews, and the rest Roman
                    Catholics and Protestants in nearly equal proportions. Ludwigshafen contained
                    15,012 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Nearly the whole of the south-west side of the town is occupied by the palace,
                    built in 1720-29, and formerly the residence of the elector of the Palatinate.
                    It is one of the largest buildings of the kind in Germany, covering an area of
                    15 acres, and having a frontage of 650 yards. The left wing was totally
                    destroyed by the bombardment of 1795, but has since been restored. The palace
                    contains a picture gallery and collections of natural history and antiquities.
                    The large and beautiful garden at the back forms the public park of the town.
                    Among the other prominent buildings are the theatre, the arsenal, the synagogue,
                    the “kaufhaus,” the town-hall, the railway station, and the observatory. The
                    only noteworthy church is that of the old Jesuit college, the interior of which
                    is lavishly decorated with marble and painting. The square in front of the
                    theatre is embellished with statues of Schiller, Iffland the actor, and Dalberg,
                    intendant of the theatre in the time of Schiller. Mannheim is the chief
                    commercial town on the upper Rhine, and yields in importance to Coblentz and
                    Cologne alone among the lower Rhenish towns. The staple commodities of its trade
                    are tobacco, grain, petroleum, hops, timber, and coffee. Its new harbour,
                    constructed at a cost of £650,000, and measuring 2300 yards in length, is the
                    most extensive inland harbour in Germany. It is entered annually by 3000 river
                    craft, carrying nearly 700,000 tons of goods. The railway goods station and
                    warehouses in connexion with the harbour cover 400 acres of ground. The
                    principal industrial products of Mannheim are machinery, iron, brass,
                    india-rubber, sugar, mirrors, chemicals, wall-paper, and cigars. The
                    manufactories of Ludwigshafen produce aniline dyes, soda, tartaric acid, alum,
                    artificial manures, and lime. Mannheim is the seat of the central board for the
                    navigation of the Rhine, of a chamber of commerce, and of the supreme court of
                    Baden. Ten or twelve different countries are represented here by their consuls.
                    The schools and public institutions of Mannheim include a gymnasium, a
                    “realschule,” an industrial school, a high school for girls, a public library, a
                    large poorhouse, three hospitals, and an orphanage.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History. —</hi> The name of Mannheim was connected with its
                    present site as early as the 8th century, when a small village belonging to the
                    abbey of Lorsch lay in the marshy district between the Neckar and the Rhine. To
                    the south of this village, on the Rhine, was the castle of Eicholzheim, which
                    acquired some celebrity as the place of confinement assigned to Pope John XXIII.
                    by the council of Constance. The history of the modern Mannheim begins, however,
                    with the opening of the 17th century, when Elector John Frederick IV. founded a
                    town here, which he peopled chiefly with Protestant refugees from Holland. The
                    strongly fortified castle which he erected at the same time had the unfortunate
                    result of making the infant town an object of contention in the Thirty Years’
                    War, during which it was five times taken and retaken. In 1689 Mannheim, which
                    had in the meantime recovered from its former disasters, was captured by the
                    French under Melac, and ruthlessly destroyed. Ten years later it was rebuilt on
                    an extended scale and provided with fortifications. For its subsequent
                    importance it was indebted to Elector Charles Philip, who, owing to
                    ecclesiastical disputes, transferred his residence from Heidelberg to Mannheim
                    in 1720. It remained the capital of the Palatinate for nearly sixty years. In
                    1794 Mannheim fell into the hands of the French, and in the following year it
                    was retaken by the Austrians after a severe bombardment, which left scarcely a
                    single building uninjured. In 1802 it was assigned to the grand-duke of Baden,
                    who caused the fortifications to be razed. Ludwigshafen, originally only the <hi

                    present name in 1843, and became a town in 1859. Towards the end of last century
                    Mannheim attained great celebrity in the literary world as the place where
                    Schiller’s early plays were performed for the first time. It was at Mannheim
                    that Kotzebue was assassinated in 1819.</p>
