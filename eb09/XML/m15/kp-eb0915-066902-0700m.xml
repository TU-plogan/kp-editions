                    type="authorial"><p>Hijâz is here taken in the usual political sense of the
                    word. The Turkish Wâly of the Hijâz has his winter residence at Mecca and his
                    summer quarters at Tâif. In a narrower sense the Hijâz is the lofty mountainous
                    country between the central plateau of Nejd (or Negd, as it is called by the
                    natives) and the lowlands of the coast (Tihâma). In this sense El-Asma ’ i
                    reckons Mecca to the Tihâma, and well-informed Arabs still follow
                    him.</p></note> and the great holy city of Islâm, is situated two camel marches
                    (the resting-place being Bahra or Hadda in the Batn Marr), or about 45 miles,
                    almost due east, from Jidda, on the Red Sea.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    >(sur.</hi> iii. 90; Bekrι, 155 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>). For other names and

                    corrupt, and some of the names (Kùthâ and ’ Arsh or Ursh, “the huts ) are not
                    properly names of the town as a whole.</p></note> Thus on a rough estimate Mecca
                    lies in 21° 30' N. lat. and 40° E. long.</p>
                <p>It is said in the Koran <hi rend="italic">(sur.</hi> xiv. 40) that Mecca lies in
                    a sterile valley, and the old geographers observe that the whole Haram or sacred
                    territory round the city is almost absolutely without cultivation or date palms,
                    while fruit trees, springs, wells, gardens, and green valleys are found
                    immediately beyond. Mecca in fact lies in the heart of a mass of rough hills,
                    intersected by a labyrinth of narrow valleys and passes, and projecting into the
                    Tihâma or low country on the Red Sea, in front of the great mountain wall that
                    divides the coast lands from the central plateau, though in turn they are
                    themselves separated from the sea by a second curtain of hills forming the
                    western wall of the great Wâdy Marr. The inner mountain wall is pierced by two
                    and only two great passes, and the valleys descending from these embrace on both
                    sides the Mecca hills. The north-western pass, through which the Nejd traffic
                    descends to the coast, and which also affords the easiest though longest route
                    from Jidda and Mecca to Tâif and thence through the true Hijâz to Yemen, is the
                    Derb el-Seil or torrent path down the well-watered Wâdy Marr.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The upper part of this wâdy
                    has two branches, W. Leim un and W. Nakhla. In the latter lie the gardens of
                    Sola and the village of Zeima with its great hot spring (comp. Yâkùt, iii. 197).
                    Above Zeima the path is desert.</p></note> This Wâdy skirts the complex of Mecca
                    hills on the north-west from Zeima by Wâdy Fâtima (where it is joined by the
                    great coast road from Medina and Syria) to Hadda on the Mecca and Jidda road, a
                    distance of perhaps 50 miles. Main roads converge to Mecca from the three points
                    of the Wâdy just named, the distance of the city from the last two being about
                    20 miles. From this side the most prominent of the Mecca hills is the northern
                    “Mountain of Light” (J. Nur). The other pass, which affords a shorter mule road
                    to Tâif and the southern highlands, but is not practicable for ordinary baggage

                    From this point a tolerably level route skirts the Mecca hills on the south,
                    passing very close to Mecca under the opposite side of J. el-Thaur, is joined or
                    crossed by several roads from the south, including the great lowland Yemen road,
                    and ultimately falls into the road from Mecca to Hadda, a little beyond the
                    pillars that define the Haram. The broad valleys through which this southern
                    road leads are not so well watered as W. Marr, but have several fertile spots
                    and a good deal of laud cultivable after rain.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>To this description of the valleys
                    surrounding the Mecca group on three sides, which is mainly drawn from personal
                    observation in 1880, it may be added that there is a direct and easy camel route
                    from Zeima to 'Arafa between the Mecca hills and the mountains of the Hodheil.
                    Taking this fact with the statement of Wâkidi (Wellhausen’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Muh. in Med.,</hi> p. 341) that every wady in the sacred territory flows
                    outwards into common ground except that at Tan'im (near the Hudùd on the Medina
                    road, Yâkût, i. 879; Ibn Jubair, p. 110) we see that Mecca lies in an isolated
                    group of hills—a sort of outpost of the great mountain wall.</p></note> From
                    this description the importance of the situation of Mecca will be easily
                    understood. It commands both the great routes connecting the lowlands with
                    central Arabia, and thus has the advantage overTâif, its former commercial
                    rival, which lies indeed on the inland mountain road from Yemen to Nejd behind
                    Mount Kara, but has no ready connexion with the Tihâma. Mecca, on the contrary,
                    though apparently secluded in its hills from the main valleys—it is in fact not
                    visible from any point till one is quite close to the town—lies in the focus of
                    all the great roads from north to south or from the coast inland, with the
                    single exception of the mountain road behind Kara; and the low passes that
                    intersect the Mecca hills form a series of practicable short cuts connecting all
                    the chief points of the circle of valleys already described.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The inland road in ancient
                    times was not so valuable as the coast road to Syria, on account of the scarcity
                    of water <hi rend="italic">(Muh. in Med.,</hi> p. 100).</p></note></p>
                <p>Holding this position, and situated in a narrow and barren valley quite incapable
                    of supporting an urban population, Mecca must have been from the first a
                    commercial town.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mecca,
                    says one of its citizens, ap. Wâkidi (Kremer’s ed., p. 196, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Muh. in Med.,</hi> p. 100), is a settlement formed for trade with Syria in
                    summer and Abyssinia in winter, and cannot continue to exist if the trade is
                    interrupted.</p></note> In the palmy days of South Arabia it was probably a
                    station on the great incense route, and thus Ptolemy may have learned the name,
                    which he writes Makoraba. At all events, long before Mohammed we find Mecca
                    established in the twofold quality of a commercial centre and a privileged holy
                    place, surrounded by an inviolable territory (the Haram), which was not the
                    sanctuary of a single tribe but a place of pilgrimage, where religious
                    observances were associated with a series of annual fairs at different points in
                    the vicinity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Details as
                    to the inhabitants and constitution of Mecca before Islam will be given under

                    religion was no unusual thing in Arabia. Of old the incense trade had its
                    religious features, and indeed in the unsettled state of the country commerce
                    was possible only under the sanctions of religion, and through the provisions of
                    the sacred truce which prohibited war for four months of the year, three of
                    these being the month of pilgrimage, with those immediately preceding and
                    following. The first of the series of fairs in which the Meccans had an interest
                    was at 'Okâz on the easier road between Mecca and Tâif, where there was also a
                    sanctuary, and from it the visiters, drawn from tribes far and near, moved on to
                    points still nearer Mecca (Majanna, and finally Dhu’l-Majâz, on the flank of J.
                    Kabkab behind 'Arafa) where further fairs were held,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The details are variously related. See
                    Biπini, p. 328 (E. T., p. 324); Asma'i in Yâkût, iii. 705, iv. 416, 421; Azraki,

                    peak is due north of Sheddâd, the hamlet which Burckhardt (i. 115) calls Shedad.
                    According to Azraki, p. 80, the last shrine visited was that of the three trees
                    of'Uzzâ in W. Nakhla.</p></note> culminating in the special religious ceremonies
                    of the great feast at 'Arafa, Kuzah (Mozdalifa), and Mecca itself. The system of
                    intercalation in the lunar calendar of the heathen Arabs was designed to secure
                    that the feast should always fall at the time when the hides, fruits, and other
                    merchandise were ready for market,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    and the Meccans, who knew how to attract the Bedouins by profuse and systematic
                    hospitality, bought up these wares in exchange for imported goods, and so became
                    the leaders of the international trade of Arabia. Their caravans traversed the
                    length and breadth of the peninsula. Syria, and especially Gaza, was their chief
                    goal, and we read that the Syrian caravan intercepted, on its return, at Bedr
                    represented capital to the value of &lt;£20,000, an enormous sum for those

                <p>The victory of Mohammedanism made a vast change in the position of Mecca. The
                    merchant aristocracy became satraps or pensioners of a great empire; but the
                    seat of dominion was removed beyond the desert, and though Mecca and the Hijâz
                    strove for a time to maintain political as well as religious predominance, as
                    will be related under <hi rend="smallcaps">Mohammedan Empire,</hi> the struggle
                    was vain, and terminated on the death of Ibn Zubeyr, the Meccan prétendant to
                    the caliphate, when the city was taken by Hajj&lt;ij (G92 A.D.). On the other
                    hand, the sanctuary and feast of Mecca received a new prestige from the victory
                    of Islâm. Purged of elements obviously heathenish, the Ka'ba (Caaba) became the
                    holiest site, and the pilgrimage the most sacred ritual observance of
                    Mohammedanism, drawing worshippers from so wide a circle that the confluence of
                    the petty traders of the desert was no longer the main feature of the holy
                    season. The pilgrimage retained its importance for the commercial wellbeing of
                    Mecca; to this day the Meccans live by the Hajj—letting rooms, acting as guides
                    and directors in the sacred ceremonies, as contractors and touts for land and
                    sea transport, as well as exploiting for their own advantage the many
                    benefactions that flow to the holy city; while the surrounding Bedouins derive a
                    chief part of their support from the cameltransport it demands and from the
                    subsidies and gifts by which they are engaged to protect or abstain from
                    molesting the pilgrim caravans. But the ancient “fairs of heathenism” were given
                    up, and the traffic of the pilgrim season, sanctioned by the Prophet in <hi
                    rend="italic">sut',</hi> ii. 194, was concentrated at Minâ and Mecca, where most
                    of the pilgrims still have something to buy or sell, so that Minâ, after the
                    sacrifice of the feast day, presents the aspect of a huge international fancy
                    fair.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The older fairs
                    were not entirely deserted till the troubles of the last days of the Omayyads

                    important than it is now. Ibn Jubair in the 12 th century describes the mart of
                    Mecca in the eight days following the feast as full of gems, unguents, precious
                    drugs, and all rare merchandise from India,'Irâk, Khorâsân, and every part of
                    the Moslem world.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibn

                <p>Mecca, as has been already indicated, lies in a narrow sandy valley running
                    approximately from north to south between the Red Mountain on the west and the
                    loftier chain of J. Abu Kobeys on the east. These ranges, which are partly built
                    on and rise several hundred feet above the valley, so enclose the city that the
                    ancient walls only barred the valley at three points, where three gates led into
                    the town. In the time of Ibn Jubair the gates still stood though the walls were
                    ruined, but now the gates have only left their names to <pb break="no"

                    end was the Bàb el Ma' là, or gate of the upper quarter, whence the road
                    continues up the valley towards Minâ and 'Arafa as well as towards Zeima and the
                    Nejd. Beyond the gate, in a place called the Hajιin, is the chief cemetery, said
                    to be the resting-place of many of the companions of Mohammed. Here a
                    cross-road, running over the hill to join the main Medina road from the western
                    gate, turns off to the west by the pass of KadA, the point from which the troops
                    of the Prophet stormed the city <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.h.</hi> 8).<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is the cross-road
                    traversed by Burckhardt (i. 109), and described by him as cut through the rocks
                    with much labour.</p></note> Here too the body of Ibn Zubeyr was hung on a cross
                    by Hajjâj. The lower or southern gate, at the Masfala quarter, opened on the
                    Yemen road, where the rain-water from Mecca flows off into an open valley.
                    Beyond, there are mountains on both sides; on that to the east, commanding the
                    town, is the great castle, a fortress of considerable strength. The third or
                    western gate, Bâb el-Omra (formerly also Bâb el-Zâhir, from a village of that
                    name), lay almost opposite the great mosque, and opened on a road leading
                    westwards round the southern spurs of the Red Mountain. This is the way to Wâdy
                    Fâtima and Medina, the Jidda road branching off from it to the left.
                    Considerable suburbs now lie outside the quarter named after this gate; in the
                    Middle Ages a pleasant country road led for some miles through partly cultivated
                    land with good wells, as far as the boundary of the sacred territory and
                    gathering place of the pilgrims at Tanim, near the mosque of 'Aisha. This is the
                    spot on the Medina road now called the'Omra, from a ceremonial connected with it
                    which will be mentioned below.</p>
                <p>The length of the sinuous main axis of the city from the furthest suburbs on the
                    Medina road to the suburbs in the extreme north, now frequented by Bedouins, is,
                    according to Burckhardt, 3500 paces.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Istrakhri gives the length of the city proper from north to

                    great mosque across the valley and up the western slopes as two-thirds of the
                    length.</p></note> About the middle of this line the longitudinal thoroughfares
                    are pushed aside by the vast courtyard and colonnades composing the great
                    mosque, which, with its spacious arcades surrounding the Ka'ba and other holy
                    places, and its seven minarets, forms the only prominent architectural feature
                    of the city. The mosque is enclosed by houses with windows opening on the

                    side facing J. Abu Kobeys, a broad street runs south-east and north-west across
                    the valley. This is the Mas'à or sacred course between the eminences of Safà and
                    Merwa, and has been from very early times one of the most lively bazaars and the
                    centre of Meccan life. The other chief bazaars are also near the mosque in
                    smaller streets. The rest of the town presents no points of individual interest,
                    but its general aspect is picturesque; the streets are fairly spacious, though
                    ill-kept and filthy; the houses are all of stone, many of them well-built and
                    four or five stories high, with terraced roofs and large projecting windows as
                    in Jidda—a style of building which has not varied materially since the 10th
                    century (Mokaddasi, p. 71), and gains in effect from the way in which the
                    dwellings run up the sides and spurs of the mountains. Of public institutions
                    there are baths, ribâts or hospices for poor pilgrims from India, Java, &amp;c.,
                    a hospital with fifty beds, a public kitchen for the poor, badly administered by
                    the Turkish authorities. A settler from India has recently set up a theological
                    school; but the old colleges around the mosque have long since been converted
                    into lodgings.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The pious

                    are described at length by Azraki and Ibn Jubair. They are either connected with
                    genuine memories of the Prophet and his times, or have spurious legends to
                    conceal the fact that they were originally holy stones, wells, or the like, of

                    town in fact has little air of antiquity; genuine Arab buildings do not last
                    long, especially in a valley periodically ravaged by tremendous floods when the
                    tropical rains burst on the surrounding hills. The history of Mecca is full of
                    the record of these inundations, unsuccessfully combated by the great dam drawn
                    across the valley by the caliph Omar (Kutb el-Din, p. 76), and later works of

                    inadequate where there is so large a floating population—and that not merely at
                    the proper season of pilgrimage, the pilgrims of one season often beginning to
                    arrive before those of the former season have all dispersed. At the height of
                    the season the town is much overcrowded, and the entire want of a drainage
                    system is severely felt. Fortunately good water is tolerably plentiful; for,
                    though the wells are mostly undrinkable, and even the famous Zamzam water very
                    unwholesome and tainted with sewage, the underground conduit from beyond 'Arafa,
                    completed by Sultan Selim II. in 1571, supplies' to the public fountains a sweet
                    and light water, containing, according to 'Abd el-Razzâk, a large amount of
                    chlorides. The water is said to be free to townsmen, but is sold to the pilgrims

                    the Jidda speculators in the pilgrim traffic, down to the cicerones, pilgrim
                    brokers, lodging-house keepers, and semi-mendicant hangers on at the holy
                    places—being to pillage the visiter in every possible way. Thus the fanaticism
                    of the Meccan is an affair of the purse; the mongrel population (for the town is
                    by no means purely Arab) has exchanged the virtues of the Bedouin for the worst
                    corruptions of Eastern town life, without casting off the ferocity of the

                    mark of birth in the holy city. The unspeakable vices of Mecca are a scandal to

                <p>Since the fall of Ibn Zubeyr the political position of Mecca has always been
                    dependent on the movements of the greater Mohammedan world. In the splendid
                    times of the caliphs immense sums were lavished upon the pilgrimage and the holy
                    ςity; and conversely the decay of the central authority of Islàm brought with it
                    a long period of faction, wars, and misery, in which the most notable episode
                    was the sack of Mecca, with circumstances of great barbarity, by the Carmathians
                    at the pilgrimage season of 930 A.D. The victors carried off the “black stone,”
                    which was not restored for twenty-two years, and then only for a great ransom,
                    when it was plain that even the loss of the palladium could not destroy the
                    sacred character of the city. Under the Fatimites Egyptian influence began to be
                    strong in Mecca; it was opposed by the sultans of Yemen, while native princes
                    claiming descent from the Prophet—the Hâshimite emirs of Mecca, and after them
                    the emirs of the house of Katàda (since 1202)—attained to great authority and
                    aimed at independence; but soon after the final fall of the Abbasids the
                    Egyptian overlordship was definitively established by Sultan Bibars (1269 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> The Turkish conquest of Egypt transferred the
                    supremacy to the Ottoman sultans (1517), who treated Mecca with much favour, and
                    during the 16th century executed great works in the sanctuary and temple. The
                    Ottoman power, however, became gradually almost nominal, and that of the emirs
                    or sherifs increased in proportion, culminating under Ghâlib, whose accession
                    dates from 1786. Then followed the wars of the Wahhâbis (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Arabia,</hi> vol. ii. p. 260) and the restoration of Turkish
                    rule by the troops of Mohammed 'Alf. By him the dignity of sherif was deprived
                    of much of its weight, and in 1827 a change of dynasty was effected by the
                    appointment of Ibn 'Auu. Since that time the Turkish authority has again
                    decayed, though Mecca is still nominally the capital of a Turkish province, and
                    lias a governor-general and a Turkish garrison, while Mohammedan law is
                    administered by a judge sent from Constantinople. But, except within the larger
                    towns, at which troops are stationed, the Turks are practically powerless, and
                    the real sovereign of Mecca and the Hijàz is the sherif, who, as head of a
                    princely family claiming descent from the Prophet, holds a sort of feudal
                    position in the country. The dignity of sherif (or grand sherif, as Europeans
                    usually say for the sake of distinction, since all the kin of the princely
                    houses reckoning descent from the Prophet are also named sherifs), is often
                    conceived as a religious pontificate, and anti-Turkish Arabs contend that if the
                    sultan and the sherif were together in a mosque the latter would lead the
                    prayers as imàm; but it is more correct to regard the sherif as the modern
                    counterpart of the ancient emirs of Mecca already referred to, who were named in
                    the public prayers immediately after the reigning caliph. This dignity long ran
                    in the family of Hasan, son of the caliph'All, with which the present sherifs,
                    in spite of changes of dynasty, still count kindred. The influence of the
                    princes of Mecca has varied from time to time according to the strength of the
                    foreign protectorate in the Hijàz or in consequence of feuds among the branches
                    of the house; at present it is for most purposes much greater than that of the
                    Turks. The latter are strong enough to hold the garrisoned towns, and thus the
                    sultan is able within certain limits—playing off one against the other the two
                    rival branches of the aristocracy, viz., the kin of Ghàlib and the house of
                    Ibn'Aun—to assert the right of designating or removing the sherif, to whom in
                    turn he owes the possibility of maintaining, with the aid of considerable
                    pensions, the semblance of his much-prized lordship over the holy cities. The
                    grand sherif can muster a considerable force of freedmen and clients, and his
                    kin, holding wells and lands in various places through the Hijàz, act as his
                    deputies and administer the old Arabic customary law to the Bedouins. To this
                    influence the Hijàz owes what little of law and order it enjoys. After the
                    sherifs the principal family of Mecca is the house of Sheyb, which holds the
                    hereditary custodianship of the Ka' ba.</p>

                    the stones (like Solomon’s temple). The roof rested on six pillars; the door was

                    ground, and the extension of the building lengthwise to include the Hijr) were
                    corrected by Hajjaj under orders from the caliph, but the building retained its

                    rend="italic">Rel. d.</hi><hi rend="italic">Araber,</hi> p. 69). The later Arabs
                    not unnaturally viewed such cultus as imitated from that of Mecca (Yakut, iv.
                    622; comp. Dozy, <hi rend="italic">Israeliten</hi><hi rend="italic">te</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mekka,</hi> p. 125, who draws very perverse
                    inferences).</p></note> It was, as it still is, a frequent religious exercise of
                    the Meccans, and the first duty of one who returned to the city or arrived there
                    under a vow of pilgrimage; and thus the outside of the Ka'ba was and is more
                    important than the inside. Islâm did away with the worship of idols; what was
                    lost in interest by their suppression has been supplied by the invention of
                    spots consecrated by recollections of Abraham, Ishmael, and Hagar, or held to be
                    acceptable places of prayer. Thus the space of ten spans between the black stone
                    and the door, which is on the east side, between the black and 'Irâk corners,
                    and a man’s height from the ground, is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Multazam,</hi> and here prayer should be offered after the tawâf with
                    outstretched arms and breast pressed against the house. On the other side of the
                    door, against the same wall, is a shallow trough which is said to mark the
                    original site of the stone on which Abraham stood to build the Ka'ba. Here the
                    growth of the legend can be traced, for the place is now called the
                    “kneading-place” (Ma'jan) where the cement for the Ka'ba was prepared. This name
                    and story do not appear in the older accounts. Once more, on the north side of
                    the Ka'ba, there projects a low semicircular wall of marble with an opening at
                    each end between it and the walls of the house. The space within is paved with
                    mosaic, and is called the Hijr. It is included in the tawâf, and two slabs of
                    <hi rend="italic">verde</hi><hi rend="italic">antico</hi> within it are called
                    the graves of Ishmael and Hagar, and are places of acceptable prayer. Even the
                    golden or gilded <hi rend="italic">mizdb</hi> (waterspout) that projects into
                    the Hijr marks a place where prayer is heard, and another such place is the part
                    of the west wall close to the Yemen corner.</p>
                <p>The feeling of religious conservatism which has preserved the structural rudeness
                    of the Ka'ba through so many centuries did not interfere with the adoption of
                    costly surface decoration. In Mohammed’s time the outer walls were covered by a
                    vail (or <hi rend="italic">kiswa)</hi> of striped Yemen cloth. The magnificence
                    of the caliphs substituted a covering of figured brocade, and the sultan still
                    sends with each pilgrim caravan from Cairo a new kiswa of black brocade, adorned
                    with a broad band embroidered with golden inscriptions from the Koran, as well
                    as a richer curtain for the door. The aspect thus given to the Ka'ba is seen in
                    the woodcut; there are openings to show the two sacred stones.<note

                <p>The interior of the Ka' ba is now opened but a few times every year; there is a
                    great scramble for admission—the portable staircase being seldom brought
                    forward—and a great clamour for backshish; thus the modern descriptions, from
                    observations made under difficulties, are not very complete. Little change,
                    however, seems to have been made since the time of Ibn Jubair, who describes the
                    floor and walls as overlaid with richly variegated marbles, and the upper half
                    of the walls as plated with silver thickly gilt, while the roof was vailed with
                    coloured silk. Modern writers describe the place as windowless, but Ibn Jubair
                    mentions five windows of rich stained glass from 'Irâk. Between the three
                    pillars of teak hung thirteen silver lamps. A chest in the corner to the left of
                    one entering contained Korans, and at the'Irâlj: corner a space was cut off
                    enclosing the stair that leads to the roof. The door to this stair (called the
                    door of mercy—Bâb el-Bahma) was plated with silver by the caliph Mutawakkil.
                    Here, in the time of Ibn Jubair, the Makâm or standing-stone of Abraham was
                    usually placed for better security, but brought out on great occasions (pp. 131,
                    161).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Before Islam the
                    Kaba was opened every Mouday and Thursday; in the time of Ibn Jubair it was
                    opened with considerable ceremony every Monday and Friday, and daily in the
                    month Rajab. But, though prayer within the building is favoured by the example
                    of the Prophet, it is not compulsory on the Moslem, and even in the time of Ibn
                    Batιita the opportunities of entrance were reduced to Friday and the birthday of
                    the Prophet.</p></note></p>
                <p>The houses of ancient Mecca pressed close upon the Ka'ba, the noblest families,
                    who traced their descent from Kosay, the reputed founder of the city, having
                    their dwellings immediately round the sanctuary. To the north of the Ka'ba was
                    the Dâr el-Nadwa, or place of assembly of the Koreysh, where all matters of
                    public interest were discussed. The multiplication of pilgrims after Islâm soon
                    made it necessary to clear away the nearest dwellings and enlarge the place of
                    prayer around the Ancient House. 'Omar, 'Othmân, and Ibn ,Zubeyr had all a share
                    in this work, but the great founder of the mosque in its present form, with its
                    spacious area and deep colonnades, was the caliph El-Mahdi, who spent enormous
                    sums in bringing costly pillars from Egypt and Syria. The work was still
                    incomplete at his death in 785 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and was finished
                    in less sumptuous style by his successor. Subsequent repairs and additions,
                    extending down to Turkish times, have left little of El-Mahdi’s work untouched,
                    though a few of the pillars probably date from his days. There are more than
                    five hundred pillars in all, of very various style and workmanship, and the
                    enclosure—250 paces in length and 200 in breadth, according to Burckhardt’s
                    measurement—is entered by nineteen archways irregularly disposed.</p>
                <p>After the Ka'ba the principal points of interest in the mosque are the well
                    Zamzam and the Makâm Ibrâhîm. The former is a deep shaft enclosed in a massive
                    vaulted building paved with marble, and, according to Mohammedan tradition, is
                    the source (corresponding to the Beer-lahai-roi of Gen. xvi. 14) from which
                    Hagar drew water for her son Ishmael. This of course is pure invention, and
                    indeed the legend tells that the well was long covered up and rediscovered
                    by'Abd el-Muttalib, the grandfather of the Prophet. Sacred wells are familiar
                    features of Semitic sanctuaries, and Islâm, retaining the well, made a
                    quasi-Biblical story for it, and endowed its tepid waters with miraculous
                    curative virtues. They are eagerly drunk by the pilgrims, or when poured over
                    the body are held to give a miraculous refreshment after the fatigues of
                    religious exercise, and the manufacture of bottles or jars for carrying the
                    water to distant countries is quite a trade. Ibn Jubair (p. 139) mentions a
                    curious superstition of the Meccans, who believed that the water rose in the
                    shaft at the full moon of the month Sha'bân. On this occasion a great crowd,
                    especially of young people, thronged round the well with shouts of religious
                    enthusiasm, while the servants of the well dashed buckets of water over their
                    heads. The Makâm or standing place of Abraham is also connected with a relic of
                    heathenism, the ancient holy stone which once stood on the Ma'jan, and is said
                    to bear the prints of the patriarch’s <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0705-0674"/> feet. The whole legend of this stone, which is
                    full of miraculous incidents, seems to have arisen from a misconception, the
                    Makâm Ibrâhîm in the Korân meaning the sanctuary itself; but the stone, which is
                    a block about 3 spans in height and 2 in breadth, and in shape “like a potter’s
                    furnace” (Ibn Jubair), is certainly very ancient. It is now covered up, and no
                    one is allowed to see it, though the box in which it lies can be seen or touched
                    through a grating in the little chapel that surrounds it. In the Middle Ages it
                    was sometimes shown, and Ibn Jubair describes the pious enthusiasm with which he
                    drank Zamzam water poured on the footprints. It was covered with inscriptions in
                    an unknown character, one of which was copied by Fâkihi in his history of Mecca.
                    To judge by the facsimile in Dozy’s <hi rend="italic">Israeliten</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">te</hi><hi rend="italic">Mekka,</hi> the character is probably

                <p>The general aspect of the great mosque will be best understood by reference to
                    the woodcut, which is taken from a photograph. The photographer has taken his
                    stand on a lofty building facing the black stone corner of the Ka'ba, so that
                    house tops, with high parapets serving to protect the privacy of the women, who
                    spend much of their time on these terraces, form too prominent a feature in the
                    foreground, and obstruct the view of part of the cloistered area. The background
                    is the Red Mountain; the fort which is seen above the town is not the great
                    castle but a building of the sherif Ghalib, dating from about the beginning of
                    this century. It will be observed that at two places there are smaller
                    cloistered courts annexed to the main colonnade. That to the right, with a
                    polygonal minaret, corresponds to the ancient Dar el-Nadwâ, which was included
                    in the mosque by the caliph Mo'tadid. The other minor court is at the Bab
                    Ibrahim. Of the two walls of the Ka ’ ba concealed from view, that to the right
                    is the one adjoining the Hijr. The two-storied pagoda-like building facing this
                    wall is the Makâm or station for prayer of orthodox Moslems of the Hanafi rite,
                    to which the Turks belong. The similar stations of the other orthodox sects have
                    but one story; that of the Maliki rite is seen to the left of the Ka'ba; the
                    roof of the Hanbali station is just visible in the foreground a little to the
                    left of the “black” corner; the Shâfi'i station, which stands on the roof of the
                    Zamzam building, is more prominent a little to the right. Between this and the
                    Makam Hanafi rises the slender gilt spire of the white marble pulpit from which
                    sermons are preached on Fridays and high days. Between the pulpit and the Zamzam
                    is the small chapel of Abraham’s stone. It does not rise high enough to be seen
                    in the cut. The two small and ugly domes to the right of the Zamzam are the dome
                    of'Abbas and the dome of the Jewess. They are used as storerooms, but the
                    former, which has its name from the uncle of the Prophet, was formerly the
                    drinking-place of the pilgrims. In the time of Ibn Jubair it was still used for
                    cooling the Zamzam water. The oval part of the court next to the Ka'ba within
                    the railing is paved with marble; parts of the area beyond are also paved, part
                    being strewn with gravel. Around the railing a number of glass lamps are lighted
                    at night.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Safd and Merwa.—</hi> In religious importance these two points
                    or “hills,” connected, as we have seen, by the Mas'a, stand second only to the
                    Kaba. Safâ is an elevated platform surmounted by a triple arch, and approached
                    by a flight of steps.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    The surrounding ground no doubt has risen so that the old name “hill of Safâ” is
                    now inapplicable.</p></note> It lies south-east of the Kaba, facing the black
                    corner, and 76 paces from the “Gate of Safâ,” which is architecturally the chief
                    gate of the mosque. Merwa is a similar platform, formerly covered with a single
                    arch, on the opposite side of the valley. It stands on a spur of the Red
                    Mountain called J. Ku'aykian. The course between these two sacred points is 493
                    paces long, and the religious ceremony called the “sa'y” consists in traversing
                    it seven times, beginning and ending at Safâ. The lowest part of the course,
                    between the so-called green milestones, is done at a run. This ceremony, which,
                    ag we shall presently see, is part of the 'omra, is generally said to be
                    performed in memory of Hagar, who ran to and fro between the two eminences
                    vainly seeking water for her son. The observance, however, is certainly of pagan
                    origin; and at one time there were idols on both the so-called hills (see
                    especially Azraki, pp. 74, 78).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Ceremonies and the Pilgrimage.—</hi> Before Islâm the Ka'ba
                    was the local sanctuary of the Meccans, where they prayed and did sacrifice,
                    where oaths were administered and hard cases submitted to divine sentence
                    according to the immemorial custom of Semitic shrines. But besides this, as we
                    have seen, Mecca was already a place of pilgrimage. Pilgrimage with the ancient
                    Arabs was the fulfilment of a vow, which appears to have generally terminated—
                    at least on the part of the well-to-do—in a sacrificial feast. A vow of
                    pilgrimage might be directed to other sanctuaries than Mecca—the technical word
                    for it (ihlâl) is applied for example to the pilgrimage to Manât (Bekri, p.
                    519). He who was under such a vow was bound by ceremonial observances of
                    abstinence from certain acts <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> hunting) and sensual
                    pleasures, and in particular was forbidden to shear or comb his hair till the
                    fulfilment of the vow. This old Semitic usage has its close parallel in the vow
                    of the Nazarite. It was not peculiarly connected with Mecca; at Tâif, for
                    example, it was customary on return to the city after an absence to present
                    oneself at the sanctuary, and there shear the hair <hi rend="italic">{Muh. in
                    Med.,</hi> p. 381). Pilgrimages to Mecca were not tied to a single time, but
                    they were naturally associated with festive occasions, and especially with the
                    great annual feast and market already spoken of, when by extensive hospitality
                    the citizens did all in their power to attract the worshippers who were at the
                    same time their customers. The pilgrimage was so intimately connected with the
                    wellbeing of Mecca, and had already such a hold on the Arabs round about, that
                    the politic Mohammed could not afford to sacrifice it to an abstract purity of
                    religion, and thus the old usages were transplanted into Islâm in the double
                    form of the 'omra or vow of pilgrimage to Mecca, which can be discharged at any
                    time, and the hajj or pilgrimage at the great annual feast. The latter closes
                    with a visit to the Ka'ba, but its essential ceremonies lie outside Mecca, at
                    the neighbouring shrines where the old Arabs gathered before the Meccan
                    fair.</p>
                <p>The 'omra begins at some point outside the Haram or holy territory, generally at
                    Tan'im described above, both for convenience sake and because Αisha began the
                    'omra there in the year 10 of the Flight. The pilgrim enters the Haram in the
                    antique and scanty pilgrimage dress (ihrâm), consisting of two cloths wound
                    round his person in a way prescribed by ritual. His devotion is expressed in <pb

                    head shaved and resumes his common dress. This ceremony is now generally
                    combined with the hajj, or is performed by every stranger or traveller when he
                    enters Mecca, and the ihrâm. (which involves the acts of abstinence already
                    referred to) is assumed at a considerable distance from the city. But it is also
                    proper during one’s residence in the holy city to perform at least one 'omra
                    from Tan'im in connexion with a visit to the mosque of 'Aisha there. The absurd
                    triviality of these rites is ill concealed by the legends of the say of Hagar
                    and of the tawaf being first performed by Adam in imitation of the circuit of
                    the angels about the throne of God; but in truth the meaning of their ceremonies
                    seems to have been almost a blank to the Arabs before Islam, whose religion had
                    become a mere formal tradition. We do not even know to what deity the worship
                    expressed in the tawaf was properly addressed. There is a tradition that the
                    Kaba was a temple of Saturn (Shahrastâni, p. 431); perhaps the most distinctive
                    feature of the shrine may be sought in the sacred doves which still enjoy the
                    protection of the sanctuary. These recall the sacred doves of Ascalon (Philo,
                    vi. 200 of Richter’s ed.), and suggest Venus-worship as at least one element
                    (comp. Herod., i. 131; iii. 8; Ephr. Syr., <hi rend="italic">Op. Syr.,</hi> ii.
                    457).</p>
                <p>To the ordinary pilgrim the 'omra has become so much an episode of the hajj that
                    it is often described as a mere visit to the mosque of'Aisha; a better
                    conception of its original significance is got from the Meccan feast of the
                    seventh month (Rajab) graphically described by Ibn Jubair from his observations
                    in 1184 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Rajab was one of the ancient sacred
                    months, and the feast, which extended through the whole month, and was a joyful
                    season of hospitality and thanksgiving, no doubt represents the ancient feasts
                    of Mecca more exactly than the ceremonies of the hajj, in which old usage has
                    been overlaid by traditions and glosses of Islam. The 'omra was performed by
                    crowds from day to day, especially at new and full moon.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The 27th was also a great day, but this day
                    was in commemoration of the rebuilding of the Ka’ba by Ibn Zubeyr.</p></note>
                    The new moon celebration was nocturnal; the road to Tan'im, the Mas'a, and the
                    mosque were brilliantly illuminated; and the appearing of the moon was greeted
                    with noisy music. A genuine old Arab market was held, for the wild Bedouins of
                    the Yemen mountains came in thousands to barter their cattle and fruits for
                    clothing, and deemed that to absent themselves would bring drought and cattle
                    plague in their homes. Though ignorant of the legal ritual and prayers, they
                    performed the tawaf with enthusiasm, throwing themselves against the Kaba and
                    clinging to its curtains as a child clings to its mother. They also made a point
                    of entering the Kaba. The 29th of the month was the feast day of the Meccan
                    tvomen, when they and their little ones had the Kaba to themselves without the
                    presence even of the Sheybis.</p>
                <p>The central and essential ceremonies of the hajj or greater pilgrimage are those
                    of the day of'Arafa, the 9th of the “pilgrimage month” (Dhu’l Hijja), the last
                    of the Arab year; and every Moslem who is his own master, and can command the
                    necessary means, is bound to join in these once in his life. By them the pilgrim
                    becomes as pure from sin as when he was born, and gains for the rest of his life
                    the honourable title of hajj. Neglect of other parts of the pilgrim ceremonial
                    may be compensated by offerings, but to miss the “stand” (wokùf) at'Arafa is to
                    miss the pilgrimage. 'Arafa or 'Arafat is a space artificially limited, round a
                    small isolated hill called the Hill of Mercy, a little way outside the holy
                    territory, ou the road from Mecca to Tâif. One leaving Mecca after midday can
                    easily reach the place on foot the same evening. The road is first northwards
                    along the Mecca valley and then turns eastward. It leads through the straggling
                    village of Mina,occupying a long narrow valley (W. Mina), two to three hours
                    from Mecca, and thence by the mosque of Muzdalifa over a narrow pass opening out
                    into the plain of 'Arafa, which is an expansion of the great W. Na'mân, through
                    which the Tâif road descends from Mount Kara. The lofty and rugged mountains of
                    the Hodheyl tower over the plain on the north side and overshadow the little
                    Hill of Mercy, which is one of those bosses of weathered granite so common in
                    the Hijaz. 'Arafa, as we have already seen, lay quite near Dhu’l-Majâz, where,
                    according to Arabian tradition, a great fair was held from the 1st to the 8th of
                    the pilgrimage month; and the ceremonies from which the hajj was derived were
                    originally an appendix to this fair. Now on the contrary the pilgrim is expected
                    to follow as closely as may be the movements of the Prophet at his “farewell
                    pilgrimage” in the year 10 of the Flight (632 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi>
                    He therefore leaves Mecca in pilgrim garb on the 8th of Dhù’l Hijja, called the
                    day of tarwiya (an obscure and pre-Islamic name), and strictly speaking should
                    spend the night at Mina. It is now, however, customary to go right on and encamp
                    at once at 'Arafa. The night should be spent in devotion, but the coffee booths
                    do a lively trade, and songs are as common as prayers. Next forenoon the pilgrim
                    is free to move about, and towards midday he may if he please hear a sermon. In
                    the after noon the essential ceremony begins; it consists simply in “standing”
                    on 'Arafa shouting Labbeyka and reciting prayers and texts till sunset. After
                    the sun is down the vast assemblage breaks up, and a rush (technically <hi
                    rend="italic">if Ada, daf, nafr)</hi> is made in the utmost confusion to
                    Muzdalifa, where the night prayer is said and the night spent. Before sunrise
                    next morning (the 10th) a second “stand” like that on 'Arafa is made for a short
                    time by torchlight round the mosque of Muzdalifa, but before the sun is fairly
                    up all must be in motion in the second <hi rend="italic">if Ada</hi> towards
                    Mina. The day thus commenced is the “day of sacrifice,” and has four
                    ceremonies—(1) to pelt with seven stones a cairn <hi rend="italic">{jamrat el
                    'akaba)</hi> at the eastern end of W. Mina, (2) to slay a victim at Mina and
                    hold a sacrificial meal, part of the flesh being also dried and so preserved, or
                    given to the poor<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    sacrifice is not indispensable except for those who can afford it and arc

                    terminate the <hi rend="italic">ihr</hi><hi rend="italic">Am,</hi> (4) to make

                    and say <hi rend="italic">(omrat el-ifddd),</hi> returning thereafter to Mina.
                    The sacrifice and visit to Mecca may, however, be delayed till the llth, 12th,
                    or 13th. These are the days of Mina, a fair and a joyous feast, with no special
                    ceremony except that each day the pilgr im is expected to throw seven stones at
                    the <hi rend="italic">jamrat el 'akaba,</hi> and also at each of two similar
                    cairns in the valley. The stones are thrown in the name of Allah, and are
                    generally thought to be directed at the devil. This is, however, a custom older
                    than Islam, and a tradition in Azraki, p. 412, represents it as an act of
                    worship to idols at Minâ. As the stones are thrown on the days of the fair, it
                    is not unlikely that they have something to do with the old Arab mode of closing
                    a sale by the -purchaser throwing a stone (Birrini, p. 328).<note

                <p>The colourless character of these ceremonies is plainly due to the fact that they
                    are nothing more than expurgated heathen rites. In Islam proper they have no <hi
                    rend="italic">raison</hi><hi rend="italic">d’être</hi>; the legends about Adam
                    and Eve on 'Arafa, about Abraham’s sacrifice of the ram at Thabir by Mina,
                    imitated in the sacrifices of the pilgrimage, are mere clumsy afterthoughts, as
                    appears from their variations and only partial acceptance. It is not so easy to
                    get at the nature of the original rites, which Islam was careful to suppress.
                    But old usages were not quickly eradicated, and we find mention of practices
                    condemned by the orthodox, or forming no part of the Moslem ritual, which may be
                    regarded as traces of an older ceremonial. Such are nocturnal illuminations at
                    Minâ (Ibn Batûta, i. 396), 'Arafa, and Muzdalifa (Ibn Jubair, p. 179), and
                    tawâfs performed by the ignorant at holy spots at 'Arafa not recognized by law
                    (Snouck-Hurgronje, p. 149 <hi rend="italic">sq. ).</hi> We know that the rites
                    at Muzdalifa were originally connected with a holy hill bearing the name of the
                    god Kuzah (the Edomite Kozé) whose bow is the rainbow, and there is reason to
                    think that the <hi rend="italic">if Adas</hi> from ’ Arafa and Kuzah, which were
                    not made as -now after sunset and before sunrise, but when the sun rested on the
                    tops of the mountains, were ceremonies of farewell and salutation to the
                    sun-god.</p>
                <p>The statistics of the pilgrimage cannot be given with certainty and vary much
                    from year to year. The quarantine office keeps a record of arrivals by sea at
                    Jiddah (30,271 for the year 1878 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> or 1295 A.π.);
                    but to these must be added the great overland caravans from Cairo, Damascus, and
                    ’Irak, the pilgrims who reach Medina from Yanbu' and go on to Mecca, and those
                    from all parts of the peninsula. Burckhardt in 1814 estimated the crowd at
                    'Arafa at 70,000, Burton in 1853 at 50,000, 'Abd el-Razzâk in 1858 at 60,000.
                    This great assemblage is always a dangerous centre of infection, and the days of
                    Minâ especially, spent under circumstances originally adapted only for a Bedouin
                    fair, with no provisions for proper cleanliness, and with the air full of the
                    smell of putrefying offal and flesh drying in the sun, produce much
                    sickness.</p>

                    cosmographers, many of whom have been already cited, we have Ibn ’Abd Rabbih’s

                    the best account extant of Mecca and the pilgrimage. It has been much pillaged
                    by Ibn Batιita. The Arabic historians are largely occupied with fabulous matter
                    as to Mecca before Islam; for these legends the reader may refer to C. de
                    Perceval’s <hi rend="italic">Essai.</hi> How little confidence can be placed in
                    the pre-Islamic history appears very clearly from the distorted accounts of
                    Abraha’s excursion against the Hijtfz, which fell but a few years before the
                    birth of the Prophet, and is the first event in Meccan history which has
                    confirmation from other sources. See Nöldeke’s version of Tabari, p. 204 <hi
