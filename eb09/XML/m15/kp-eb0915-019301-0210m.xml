                    32' to 114’ 7' E. long., and is divided into two nearly equal portions by the
                    parallel of 7’ S. lat.; the· area is estimated at 2100 square miles. As the few
                    travellers who have visited Madura have been for the most part content to follow
                    the highways which, though running the whole length of the island, never strike
                    very far inland either from the north or the south coast, a considerable part of
                    the country is but vaguely known to Europeans. It may be safely asserted,
                    however, that the general configuration is fairly simple,—the island being a
                    plateau-like prolongation of the limestone range of northern Java, with frequent
                    interchange of hill and dale, culminating towards the east in G unong Pedjudan
                    or Tambuko at a height of 1542 feet. Hot springs are not unfrequent; and in the
                    valley between Gunong Geger and Bandjar lies the mud volcano of Banju Ening.
                    “Round the coast runs a girdle of tropical vegetation, broken only here and
                    there by small white peaks with steep perpendicular cliffs;” but, except in a
                    few alluvial tracts in the lower courses of the streams, the soil is thin and
                    poor, and better fitted for pastoral than agricultural purposes. Maize is by far
                    the most important of the crops; it is planted after rice in the non-irrigable
                    sawahs, and often before it in the irrigable; in the tagal fields it is
                    sometimes sown thrice in a single year, frequently along with <hi rend="italic"
                    >hαtjang</hi> (various kinds of native beans). European enterprise has not yet
                    invaded the island; there is only one sugar plantation, Tedjeh, near Pamakasan,
                    established in 1835. Much attention is paid to the rearing of cattle,—the small
                    Madura oxen being greatly prized in Java, and consequently forming a regular
                    article of export. Petroleum is found in small quantities in all the
                    departments, but the most valuable product of the island is its salt (hence
                    perhaps the name Madura; Sansk. <hi rend="italic">Mandura,</hi> salt). The
                    manufacture, a Dutch Government monopoly, was formerly carried on in several
                    places, as at Brantah and Bunder (where the salt pans now serve as fish ponds),
                    but in 1870 Sumenep was made the sole establishment for Java and Madura, and it
                    still remains by far the most important, though its annual production of 875,000
                    cwts. has since 1875 to be supplemented by Ragung and Pangaringan. The
                    population of Madura was in 1879 returned as 768,992,—472 Europeans (mostly at
                    Maringan near Sumenep), 3702 Chinese, 1445 Arabs and other Orientals, and
                    763,373 natives. These last constitute one of the three great races of Java and
                    Madura, and speak a distinct language, for which compare <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Java,</hi> vol. xiii.</p>
                <p>The following are the places of chief note in the island. Kamal at the south-west
                    corner is the point where people usually cross from Java. Bangkalang is the
                    large and flourishing chief town of Madura proper, with the old palace of the
                    sultan ana the residences of the princes of the blood; the mosque is adorned
                    with the first three suras of the Koran, thus differing from nearly all the
                    mosques in Java and Madura, though resembling those of western Islam. In the
                    vicinity once stood the Erfprins fort. Arisbaya (less correctly Arosbaya) is the
                    place where the first mosque was built in Madura, and where the Dutch sailors
                    first made acquaintance with the natives. The once excellent harbour is now
                    silted up. Ajermata, so called from its salt-springs, is the burial-place of the
                    princes of Bangkalang. Pamakasan, though a town of considerable extent, presents
                    nothing worthy of notice apart from the regent’s residence. Sampang, the seat of
                    an important market, seems hardly so flourishing as in Valentyn’s days. The town
                    or <hi rend="italic">kotα</hi> of Sumenep had 15,000 inhabitants in 1846; and
                    there are populous Malay, Arab, and Chinese villages between the town and the
                    European settlement of Maringan. On a hill in the neighbourhood, with a fine
                    outlook over the Bay of Sumenep, lies Asta, the burial-place of the Sumenep
                    princes; and Nâtâ Kusuma’s mausoleum excels everything of the kind in Java.</p>
                <p>Madura formerly consisted of three native states—Madura or Bangkalang, Pamakasan,
                    and Sumenep. Dutch authority was represented by an assistant resident, and the
                    whole island considered part of the Java residency of Surabaya. The separate
                    residency of Madura was constituted in 1857. On the death of the second sultan
                    of .Bangkalang (1847) the title had been reduced to that of panembahan; <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n211/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0211-0194"/> and in 1872 the new ruler was deprived of the
                    right of collecting taxes, and made a Government pensioner, while his territory
                    was split into the two Dutch “departments” of Madura and Sampang. The sultan of
                    Sumenep was in like manner succeeded by a panembahan in 1853; and the death of
                    the panembahan in 1879 afforded an opportunity of enlarging the Government
                    control. There are thus four “departments” in Madura,—Pamakasan, Madura,
                    Sumenep, and Sampang. The first three are also regencies, and the fourth a
                    subregency of Bangkalang; but Pamakasan alone has the full regency organization.
                    The number of village communities is 1271.</p>
