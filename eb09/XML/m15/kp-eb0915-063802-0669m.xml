                    the Turks and the French. In 1546, when Charles V. attacked the League of
                    Smalkald, Maurice sided with the emperor, the result being that he was made
                    elector of Saxony in place of his cousin John Frederick (of the Ernestine line),
                    who was taken prisoner and deposed. At this time Maurice was detested by the
                    German Protestants, who considered him a traitor to his religion; but the tide
                    soon turned. Fearing that the emperor’s ultimate aim was to strike at the
                    authority of the princes, he began silently to make preparations for war; and
                    Charles V. was imprudent enough to provide him with a pretext for opposition by
                    detaining the landgrave Philip of Hesse, whose freedom Maurice had guaranteed.
                    In 1551 Maurice concluded a secret treaty with Henry II. of France against the
                    emperor, and an alliance was also formed with several German princes. Charles V.
                    refused to believe in the reality of the danger; butin March 1552 he was
                    startled by the intelligence that Henry II. had entered Germany as an invader,
                    and that Maurice was hastening southward at the head of a powerful army. John
                    Frederick and Philip were at once released, and the emperor, after an
                    ignominious flight, was compelled to sign the treaty of Passau. After the
                    re-establishment of peace Maurice fought for some time against the Turks in
                    Hungary; he then returned to Saxony, and associated himself with the alliance
                    against Margrave Albert of Brandenburg, by whom the treaty of Passau had not
                    been recognized. At Sievershausen, on the 9th of July 1553, the margrave was
                    defeated; but during the battle Maurice was wounded, and two days afterwards he
                    died in his tent. He was not only a great diplomatist and general, but one of
                    the most enlightened rulers of his age, and his early death was sincerely
                    deplored by his subjects. In his last years he was content “with small diet and
                    little sleep.” “Therefore,” says Roger Ascham, who had seen him, “he had a
                    waking and working head, and became so witty and secret, so hardy and ware, so
                    skilful of ways, both to do harm to others and to keep hurt from himself, as he
                    never took enterprise in hand wherein he put not his adversary always to the
                    worse.”</p>
