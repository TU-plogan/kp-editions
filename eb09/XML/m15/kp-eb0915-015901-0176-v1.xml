                <p><label type="entry">MACKEREL</label>. Mackerels are pelagic fishes, belonging to
                    a small family, <hi rend="italic">Scombridae,</hi> of which the tunny, bonito,
                    albacore, sucking fish <hi rend="italic">{Echeneis),</hi> and a few other
                    tropical genera are members (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Ichthyology,</hi> vol.
                    xii. p. 690). Although the species are fewer in number than in the majority of
                    other families of fishes, they are widely spread and extremely abundant,
                    peopling by countless schools the oceans of the tropical and temperate zones,
                    and approaching the coasts only accidentally, occasionally, or periodically. The
                    mackerels proper (genus <hi rend="italic">Scomber)</hi> are readily recognized
                    by their elegantly shaped, well-proportioned body, shining in iridescent
                    colours. Small, thin, deciduous scales equally cover nearly the entire body. The
                    dorsal fin extends over a great part of the back, and consists of several
                    portions: the anterior, composed of feeble spines which can be laid backwards in
                    a groove; the posterior, of rays only, of which the five or six hindmost are
                    detached, forming isolated “finlets.” The shape of the anal finis similar to
                    that of the rayed dorsal. The caudal fin is crescent-shaped, strengthened at the
                    base by two short ridges on each side. The mouth is wide, armed above and below
                    with a row of very small, fixed teeth.</p>
                <p>No other fish shows finer proportions in the shape of its body. Every “line” of
                    its build is designed and eminently adapted for rapid progression through the
                    water; the muscles massed along the vertebral column are enormously developed,
                    especially on the back and the sides of the tail, and impart to the body a
                    certain rigidity which interferes with abruptly sideward motions of the fish.
                    Therefore mackerel generally swim in a straightforward direction, deviating
                    sidewards only when compelled, and rarely turning about in the same spot. They
                    are in almost continuous motion, their power of endurance being equal to the
                    rapidity of their motions. Mackerel, like all fishes of this family (with the
                    exception, perhaps, of <hi rend="italic">Echeneis,</hi> which has not yet been
                    examined in this respect), have a firm flesh; that is, the muscles of the
                    several segments are interlaced, and receive a greater supply of blood-vessels
                    and nerves than in other fishes. Therefore the flesh, especially of the larger
                    kinds, is of a red colour; and the energy of their muscular action causes the
                    temperature of their blood to be several degrees higher than in other
                    fishes.</p>
                <p>All fishes of the mackerel family are strictly carnivorous; they unceasingly
                    pursue their prey, which consists principally of other fish and pelagic
                    crustaceans. The fry of clupeoids, which likewise swim in schools, are followed
                    by the mackerel until they reach some shallow part of the coast, which their
                    enemies dare not enter.</p>
                <p>Mackerels are found in almost all tropical and temperate seas, with the exception
                    of the Atlantic shores of temperate South America, where they have not hitherto
                    been met with. The distinctive* characters of the various species have not yet
                    been fully investigated; and there is much confusion in the discrimination of
                    the species. So much is certain that the European mackerel are of two kinds, of
                    which one, the common mackerel, <hi rend="italic">Scomber scomber,</hi> lacks,
                    while the other possesses, an air-bladder. The best-known species of the latter
                    kind is <hi rend="italic">Scomber colias,</hi> the “Spanish” mackerel;<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The term ‘ ‘ Spanish
                            mackerel” is applied to a very different fish in America, viz., <hi
                                rend="italic">Cybium maculatum.</hi></p></note> a third, <hi
                        rend="italic">Scomber pneumatophorus,</hi> is believed by some
                    ichthyologists to be identical with N. <hi rend="italic">colias.</hi> Be this as
                    it may, we have strong evidence that the Mediterranean is inhabited by other
                    species different from <hi rend="italic">S. scomber</hi> and &amp; <hi
                        rend="italic">colias,</hi> and well characterized by their dentition and
                    coloration. Also the species from St Helena is distinct. Of extra-Atlantic
                    species the mackerel of the Japanese seas are the most nearly allied to the
                    European, those of New Zealand and Australia, and still more those of the Indian
                    Ocean, differing in many conspicuous points. Two of these species occur in the
                    British seas: <hi rend="italic">Scomber scomber,</hi> which is the most common
                    there as well as in other parts of the North Atlantic, crossing the ocean to
                    America, where it abounds; and the Spanish mackerel, <hi rend="italic">Scomber
                        colias,</hi> which is distinguished by a somewhat different pattern of
                    coloration, the transverse black bands of the common mackerel being in this
                    species narrower, more irregular or partly broken up into spots, while the
                    scales of the pectoral region are larger, and the snout is longer and more
                    pointed. The Spanish mackerel is, as the name implies, a native of the seas of
                    southern Europe, but single individuals or small schools reach frequently the
                    shores of Great Britain and of the United States.</p>
                <p>The home of the common mackerel (to which the following remarks refer) is the
                    North Atlantic, from the Canary Islands to the Orkneys, and from the
                    Mediterranean and the Black Sea and the coasts of Norway to the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>Towards the spring large schools approach the coasts. Two causes have been
                    assigned of this migration: first, the instinct of finding a suitable locality
                    for propagating their species; and, secondly, the search and pursuit of food,
                    which in the warmer season is more abundant in the neighbourhood of land than in
                    the open sea. It is probable that the latter is the true and only cause, for the
                    following reasons :—mackerel are known to increase much more rapidly in size
                    while in the neighbourhood of land than in the months during which they lead a
                    roving pelagic life in the open sea; and, further, one-year and two-year-old
                    fishes, which have not yet attained maturity, and therefore do not travel
                        landwards<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n177/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0915-0177-0160"/> for the purpose of spawning, actually take
                    the lead in the migration, and are followed later on by the older and mature
                    fishes. Finally, according to the observations made by Sars, vicinity of land or
                    shallow water are not necessary conditions for the oviposition of mackerel; they
                    spawn at the spot which they happen to have reached during their wanderings at
                    the time when the ova have attained their full development, independently of the
                    distance of the land or of the depth of water below them, as the ova float and
                    the embryo is developed on the surface of the water.</p>
                <p>In the month of February, or in some years as early as the end of January, the
                    first large schools appear at the entrance of the English Channel, and are met
                    by the more adventurous of the driftnet fishers many miles west of the Scilly
                    Islands. These early schools, which, as we mentioned above, consist chiefly of
                    one-year and two-year-old fishes, yield sometimes enormous catches, whilst in
                    other years they escape the drift-nets altogether, passing them, for some
                    hitherto unexplained reason, at a greater depth than that to which the nets
                    reach, viz., 20 feet. As the season advances, the schools penetrate farther
                    northwards into St George’s Channel or eastwards into the English Channel. The
                    fishery then assumes proportions which render it next in importance to the
                    herring and cod fisheries. In Plymouth alone a fleet of some two hundred boats
                    assembles; and on the French side of the Channel no less capital and labour are
                    invested in it, the vessels employed being, though less in number, larger in
                    size than on the English side. Simultaneously with the drift-net the
                    deep-sea-seine and shore-seine are used, which towards June almost entirely
                    supersede the drift-net. Towards the end of May the old fish become heavy with
                    spawn, and are in the highest condition for the table; and the latter half of
                    June or beginning of July may be regarded as the time at which the greater part
                    of mackerel spawn.</p>
                <p>Mackerel are scarcely less abundant in the German Ocean; probably some of the
                    schools never leave it, and this resident stock (if we are allowed to apply this
                    term to a fish which is ever shifting its quarters) is increased by the schools
                    coming from the Atlantic through the English Channel or round the north coast of
                    Scotland. The schools approach the coasts of the German Ocean somewhat later in
                    the season, partly owing to the greater severity of the weather, which detains
                    the resident fishes in the open sea, and partly owing to the greater distance
                    which the Atlantic shoals have to travel. On the Norwegian coast mackerel
                    fishing does not begin before May, whilst on the English coasts large catches
                    are frequently made in March. Large cargoes are now annually imported in ice
                    from Norway to the English market.</p>
                <p>After the spawning the schools break up into smaller companies which are much
                    scattered, and offer for two or three months employment to the hand-line
                    fishermen. They now begin to disappear from the coasts and return to the open
                    sea. Single individuals or small companies are found, however, on the coast all
                    the year round; they may have become detached from the main bodies, and be
                    seeking for the larger schools which have long left on their return
                    migration.</p>
                <p>Although, on the whole, the course and time of the annual migration of mackerel
                    are marked with great regularity, their appearance and abundance at certain
                    localities are subject to great variations. They may pass a spot at such a depth
                    as to evade the nets, and reappear at the surface some days after farther
                    eastwards; they may deviate from their direct line of migration, and even
                    temporarily return westwards. In some years between 1852 and 1867 the old
                    mackerel disappeared off Guernsey from the surface, and were accidentally
                    discovered feeding at the bottom. Many were taken at 10 fathoms and deeper with
                    the line, and all were of exceptionally large size, several measuring 18 inches,
                    and weighing nearly 3 ft&gt;; these are the largest mackerel on record.</p>
                <p>The mackerel most esteemed as. food is the common species, and individuals from
                    10 to 12 inches in length are considered the best flavoured. In more southern
                    latitudes, however, this species seems to deteriorate, specimens from the coast
                    of Portugal, and from the Mediterranean and Black Sea, being stated to be dry
                    and resembling in flavour the Spanish mackerel (N. <hi rend="italic"
                        >colias),</hi> which is not esteemed for the table. Seo also <hi
