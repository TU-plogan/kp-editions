                    education, received at Bergamo, he was indebted to a Jesuit priest named Mozzi,
                    whom the suppression of the order had caused to settle in the neighbourhood. He
                    afterwards accompanied Mozzi to a college at Colorno, in the duchy of Parma,
                    where the J esuits had been permitted to re-establish themselves; and there he
                    entered the noviciate of the society in 1799. In 1804, after the brief which
                    restored the Jesuits to the Two Sicilies had been granted, he was removed to
                    Naples as teacher of classics in the college there. Next, after completing his
                    theological studies at the Collegium Romanum, he lived for some time at Orvieto,
                    where he was admitted to priestly orders, and was engaged partly in teaching and
                    partly in the palaeographical studies for which he had already manifested a
                    strong partiality. The political events of 1808 necessitated his withdrawal from
                    Rome (to which he had meanwhile returned) to Milan, where· he assumed the
                    functions of a secular priest, and in 1813, through the influence of Mozzi, was
                    made custodian of the Ambrosian library. He now threw himself with
                    characteristic energy and zeal into the business of carefully exploring the
                    numerous and valuable MSS. committed to his charge, and in the course of the
                    next six years was able to restore to the world a considerable number of
                    long-lost works. With the full approval of all concerned he now withdrew from
                    his connexion with the Society of Jesus, and in 1819 he was invited to Rome as
                    chief keeper of the library of the Vatican. Soon after his installation there he
                    found the palimpsest from which he edited the <hi rend="italic">De
                    Pepublica</hi> of Cicero; this, probably the most important work of his life,
                    was followed by the publication of a vast number of fragments of Greek and Latin
                    fathers and historians. In 1833 Mai was transferred from the office of Vatican
                    librarian to that of secretary of the congregation of the Propaganda; on
                    February 12, 1838, he was raised to the dignity of cardinal. In this rank he
                    successively discharged the functions of prefect of the congregation for the
                    supervision of the Oriental press, prefect of the congregation of the council of
                    Trent, and cardinal librarian of the Roman Church. He died at Castelgandolfo,
                    near Albano, on September 9, 1854, bequeathing his valuable private library at
                    half its estimated value to the Vatican, the proceeds to be applied to the
                    relief of the poor of his native village.</p>

                    Generally speaking, it may be said that the services rendered to scholarship by
                    Mai (great though they were) were merely those of a laborious and persevering
                    pioneer; as a textual critic he does not rank high, either for sagacity or for
                    accuracy.</p>
