                    on the 2 4 th<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Most

                    of René, cited in the <hi rend="italic">Nouvelle Biographie Générale,</hi> the
                    day was the 24th.</p></note> March 1429. Her father, “the good King René/’ as he
                    was called in later years, did not at the time of her birth possess any of the
                    pompous titles to which he afterwards laid claim, but was simply count of Guise,
                    and younger brother of the existing duke of Anjou. He had, however, married
                    Isabella, daughter of Charles II., duke of Lorraine, and during Margaret’s
                    infant years he succeeded to two dukedoms, first Lorraine and then Anjou, and
                    afterwards to the crowns of Naples, Sicily, and Jerusalem. Some of these
                    acquisitions, however, were no more than empty titles. He had a competitor for
                    the duchy of Lorraine against whom he was unsuccessful in war, and he was
                    actually a prisoner in the hands of the duke of Burgundy whenthe death of Joan
                    II. of Naples first made him nominally a king. He deputed his wife Isabella to
                    go to Naples and take possession of his new kingdom for him, and she took with
                    her while on this enterprise her second son Louis and her second daughter
                    Margaret, then in her seventh year. René himself obtained his liberty after a
                    time, and followed his wife to Naples, but, being defeated by a rival there
                    also, he returned to France after more than four years’ absence. Before
                    revisiting Lorraine or Anjou, he spent some time in Provence, and there received
                    a proposal for the marriage of Margaret, who had by this time nearly completed
                    her fourteenth year, from Charles, count of Nevers. It was accepted, and the
                    contract was actually signed; but the marriage was delayed on account of some
                    disputes about the settlement, and next year it was set aside for the more
                    splendid match offered by the king of England.</p>
                <p>This was in 1444. The earl, afterwards duke, of Suffolk, had proposed the match
                    to Henry VI. as a means of terminating the long war with France, and securing
                    peace upon a solid basis. Henry fully entered into the scheme, and was content
                    for so great an object, not only to accept a bride without a dowry, but to give
                    up to King René the provinces of Anjou and Maine. A great embassy was sent over
                    to France, with Suffolk himself at its head, tj negotiate the matter, and some
                    months later the . marriage was celebrated by proxy at Tours, Suffolk acting as
                    Henry’s representative. In April of the following year, 1445, Margaret crossed
                    the Channel, and was received by Henry on her landing at Porchester. A few days
                    later, 22d April, they were married in Tichfield Abbey, or, as some other
                    authorities say, at Southwick,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Southwick, according to Fabyan, who is followed by Hall and

                    30th of May Margaret was crowned at Westminster. Suffolk was now high in favour
                    at court, but the policy he had pursued of giving up territory for the sake of
                    peace was not likely to be generally acceptable in itself, and the events of the
                    next few years completed his unpopularity. War broke out again with France in
                    1449, and in the course of a single year the whole of Normandy was lost to the
                    English. Suffolk was impeached by the Commons, and the king was persuaded that
                    the best way to protect him was to order him to quit the country. But he was
                    taken and murdered at sea, and for some time the country was in a state of
                    fearful anarchy. Margaret’s position was now one that required great tact and
                    delicacy. The king’s marriage was already unpopular, and the fact was soon
                    manifest that his wife possessed far higher abilities and greater power of
                    governing than himself. This, together with the king’s occasional attacks of
                    mental imbecility, was really the great source of her misfortunes. During
                    Henry’s intervals of sanity it was she who really governed, and unfortunately
                    she gave her whole support to the duke of Somerset, whose mismanagement abroad
                    had been the immediate cause of the loss of Normandy. The duke of York vainly
                    endeavoured to procure Somerset’s removal, but he was so protected by the court
                    that the complaints of his accuser were utterly unheeded, except during the
                    king’s periods of total incapacity, when the lords made York protector. Civil
                    war at last broke out, and Somerset fell at St Alban’s in 1455. Party feeling
                    was bitterly exasperated, and Margaret, as we learn from a contemporary French
                    historian, actually instigated an attack on Sandwich by the French out of hatred
                    to the duke of York. At length, in 1460, that nobleman openly challenged the
                    crown as his right and obtained from parliament, with the consent of Henry
                    himself, a settlement of the succession in his favour. But at this time Margaret
                    was out of the way. The king had been taken prisoner the year before by the
                    Yorkists at the battle of Northampton, and she had sought refuge in Wales and
                    Scotland along with her only son Edward, prince of Wales, then seven years old,
                    who was now disinherited. Margaret’s friends took up her cause in the north of
                    England, and the duke of York, going to meet them, fell at the battle of
                    Wakefield, 30th December 1460. Margaret naturally endeavoured to improve her
                    victory by marching on to London. But Edward, earl of March, the duke of York’s
                    son, defeated her adherents on the borders of Wales, while the earl of Warwick
                    with the king in his custody left London to oppose her. The ill-disciplined
                    troops that she brought with her from the north ravaged the country as they
                    went, and made themselves generally detested. But they overthrew Warwick’s
                    forces at St Alban’s (the second battle fought there in this war), and liberated
                    the king. The earl of March, however, soon came up and entered London, where he
                    was proclaimed king by the name of Edward IV., amid the shouts of the citizens,
                    who had always been devoted to his father. Margaret then thought it advisable to
                    withdraw into the north along with Henry and her son, and Edward and Warwick
                    pursued them into Yorkshire, where the bloody battle of Towton (29th March 1461)
                    utterly crushed for the time the hopes of the house of Lancaster. Henry and
                    Margaret fled to Scotland, and surrendered Berwick to the Scots as the price of
                    their assistance. Margaret and her son soon after entered England with a body of
                    Scots, who besieged Carlisle, but they were driven back by Lord Montague. Then
                    King Henry accompanied another invasion into the county of Durham which was
                    equally unsuccessful. Next year (1462) Margaret sailed from Kirkcudbright to
                    seek aid in France, and offered the surrender of Calais to Louis XI. if Louis
                    enabled her husband to regain his kingdom. Louis gave her two <pb break="no"

                    Brëzé, and with these she made a descent upon Northumberland and took Bamborough
                    and some other castles, which, however, were soon after besieged by King
                    Edward’s forces, and after a while recovered. King Edward himself, on hearing of
                    her landing, hastened into the north, on which Margaret took ship to sail for
                    France, but meeting with a storm was driven to land at Berwick and lost all her
                    treasure. On the total failure of this expedition the well-known story is told
                    by a French writer of her wandering with her son in a forest where she was
                    attacked by robbers, and appealing successfully to the loyalty of one of them to
                    save the son of his king.</p>
                <p>Soon after, in April 1463,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This is clearly the date intended by William Wyrcestre (p. 496); and it
                    agrees entirely with Monstrelet (iii. 96). Yet almost all modern historians
                    (except Lingard) and even biographers of Margaret of Anjou date her departure to
                    Flanders after the battle of Hexham, at which she certainly was not present, as
                    they would have her.</p></note> she sailed to Flanders and sought the aid of
                    Philip of Burgundy, but he declined to do more than relieve her poverty, and she
                    retired to a castle in Lorraine, which her father gave her to occupy. Here Sir
                    John Fortescue, who accompanied her into exile, superintended the education of
                    her son, and composed for his benefit his celebrated treatise on the laws of
                    England. Here also she apparently remained while her husband made further
                    efforts and met with further defeats,—while he lay concealed, for more than a
                    year, in Lancashire, was taken prisoner, and committed to the Tower. But in
                    1470, when her old enemy the earl of Warwick, having rebelled against King
                    Edward, sought a refuge in France, Louis XI. induced her, though with great
                    difficulty, to pardon him and concert measures along with him for her husband’s
                    restoration to the throne. The negotiation was cemented by an agreement for the
                    marriage of her son, the prince of Wales, to the earl’s daughter after the
                    kingdom should be recovered, and so successful was the project that Edward was
                    actually driven into exile, and for a period of six months Henry was again
                    acknowledged as king. But the return of King Edward and the battle of Barnet
                    once more changed the aspect of affairs before Margaret was able to rejoin her
                    husband, and when she at length landed again in England she was defeated and
                    taken prisoner at Tewkesbury. To add to her misery her only son Prince Edward
                    was butchered after the battle. Four years later, in 1475, on peace being made
                    between England and France, she was ransomed by Louis XI., and returned to her
                    native country. She died at Dampierre near Saumur in Anjou, on the 25th of
                    August 1482.</p>
