                    or about 1743, since which time it has been accepted generally, and is now used
                    for those which form the Family <hi rend="italic">Pipridεe</hi> of modern
                    ornithologists. The Manakins are peculiar to the Neotropical Region, and are
                    said to have many of the habits of the Titmouse Family (Pane?«), living, says
                    Swainson, in deep forests, associating in small bands, and keeping continually
                    in motion, but feeding almost wholly on the large soft berries of the different
                    kinds of <hi rend="italic">Melastoma.</hi> However, as with most other South
                    American Passerine birds, little is really known of their mode of life; and it
                    is certain that the <hi rend="italic">Pipridas</hi> have no close affinity with

                    (Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1876, p. 518). The Manakins are nearly all birds of
                    gay appearance, generally exhibiting rich tints of blue, crimson, scarlet,
                    orange, or yellow in combination with chestnut, deep black, black and white, or
                    olive green; and among their most obvious characteristics are their short bill
                    and feeble feet, of which the outer toe is united to the middle toe for a good
                    part of its length. The tail, in most species very short, has in others the
                    middle feathers much elongated, and in one the outer rectrices are attenuated
                    and produced into threads. They have been divided by various authors into
                    upwards of twenty so-called genera; but Messrs Sclater and Salvin <hi
                    rend="italic">(Nomenclator,</hi> pp. 53-55) recognize only fifteen, though
                    admitting sixty species, of which fifteen belong to the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pipra</hi> as now restricted, the <hi rend="italic">P. leucocilla</hi> of
                    Linnaeus being its type. This species has a wide distribution from the isthmus
                    of Panama to Guiana and the valley of the Amazon; but it is one of the most
                    plainly coloured of the Family, being black with a white head. The genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Machaeropter</hi><hi rend="italic">us,</hi> consisting of four
                    species, is very remarkable for the extraordinary form of some of the secondary
                    wing-feathers in the males, in which the shaft is thickened and the webs changed
                    in shape, as described and illustrated by Mr Sclater <hi rend="italic">(Proc.
                    Zool. Society,</hi> 1860, p. 90; <hi rend="italic">Ibis,</hi> 1862, p. 175<note

                    these birds are also much thickened, no doubt in correlation with this abnormal
                    structure. A like deviation from the ordinary character is found in the allied
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Manacus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Chiromachaeris,</hi>
                    comprehending six species, and that gentleman believes it enables them to make
                    the singular noise for which they have long been noted (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 770), described by Mr Salvin <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ibis,</hi> 1860, p. 37) in the case of one of them, <hi rend="italic">Μ.

                    which is “followed by a rattling sound not unlike the call of a landrail”; and
                    it is a similar habit that has obtained for another species, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Μ. edwardsi,</hi> the name in Cayenne, accord ing to Buffon <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Hist. Nat.</hi><hi rend="italic">Oiseaux,</hi> iv. ρ. 413), of <hi
                    rend="italic">Casse-noisette.</hi> This view is supported by Mr Layard, who,
                    writing of the last species, says <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1873, p. 384)—
                    “They make a curious rattling noise (I suspect, by some movement of the oddly
                    shaped wing-feathers), which constantly betrays their presence in the forests,”
                    while of the congeneric <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >gutturosus,</hi> Mr J. F. Hamilton remarks <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1871,
                    p. 305)—“The first intimation given of the presence of one of these birds is a
                    sharp whirring sound very like that of a child’s small wooden rattle, followed
                    by two or three sharp snaps.” The same observer adds <hi rend="italic">(loc.
                    cit.)</hi> of a member of the kindred genus <hi rend="italic">Chiroxip^hia,</hi>
                    containing five species, that <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >caudata</hi> is known to the Brazilians as the Fandango-bird from its “habit of
                    performing a dance.” They say that “one perches upon a branch and the others
                    arrange themselves in a circle round it, dancing up and down on their perches to
                    the music sung [?] by the centre one.” Exception must be taken to this story so
                    far as regards the mode in which the “music” is produced, for these birds have
                    no true song-muscles; but the effect is doubtless as described by Mr Hamilton’s
                    informant. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a, n.)</hi></p>
