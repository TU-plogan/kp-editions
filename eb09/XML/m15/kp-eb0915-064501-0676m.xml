                    was at war with Turkey. The sultan Soliman II. was conciliated by the cession of
                    all the territories he had conquered in Hungary, and by the promise of a yearly
                    tribute of 300,000 florins. Soon afterwards Soliman renewed the war on behalf of
                    the prince of Transylvania; but after his death in 1566 his successor, Selim,
                    concluded with Maximilian an armistice of eight years. Maximilian’s brothers,
                    Ferdinand and Charles, fought incessantly against Protestantism in their
                    respective lands; but it was tolerated by Maximilian in Austria, Bohemia, and
                    Hungary. His authority, however, was greatly limited by the influence of the
                    Jesuits. He died on the 12th of October 1576. Of his eight children (six sons
                    and two daughters) two—Rudolph II. and Matthias—became emperors.</p>

                <p>. MAXIMILIAN (1832-1867), archduke of Austria (Ferdinand Maximilian Joseph) and
                    emperor of Mexico, was the second son of the archduke Francis Charles, and was
                    born in Vienna on July 6, 1832. He was trained for the navy, and ultimately
                    attained a high command in that branch of his country’s service. In February
                    1857 he was appointed governor of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom, and in the same
                    year he married the Princess Charlotte, daughter of Leopold I., king of the
                    Belgians. On the outbreak of the war of 1859, he retired into private life,
                    chiefly at Trieste, until 1863, when at the instance of Napoleon III. he
                    accepted the crown which had been offered to him by the notables of Mexico. He
                    landed at Vera Cruz on May 28, 1864, but from the commencement of his reign
                    found himself involved in difficulties of the most serious kind, which in 1866
                    made apparent to almost every one outside of Mexico the necessity for his
                    abdicating. This, however, he declined to do. Withdrawing, in February 1867, to
                    Querétaro, he there sustained a siege for several weeks, but on May 15 resolved
                    to attempt an escape through the enemy’s lines. He was, however, arrested before
                    he could carry out this resolution, and, after trial by court martial, was
                    condemned to death. The sentence was carried out on June 19, 1867. His remains
                    were conveyed to Vienna, where they were buried in the imperial vault early in
                    the following year. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Mexico.</hi> Maximilian’s papers
