                    specially a conversion of a portion of the starch into sugar. The varieties of
                    grain usually employed for malting are barley and bere or bigg, and the
                    processes of preparing the substance are fully explained under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Brewing</hi> (vol. iv. p. 266).</p>
                <p>The specific effect of the malting of grain is to transform by the process of
                    germination a proportion of the starch into soluble sugar and dextrin. These
                    changes are effected by the agency of a peculiar nitrogenous ferment, diastase,
                    which exists in the grain, but which is increased in amount during the
                    germination. The precise sequence of changes, and the exact nature of the new
                    chemical compounds evolved, are still matters of some doubt. It is clearly
                    established that the ferment of barley is incapable of transforming the starch
                    on which it operates entirely into sugar, the ultimate products of the action
                    being partly dextrin and partly sugar. The relative proportions of these bodies
                    evolved by fermentation from starch have been matter of dispute, some holding
                    that from three molecules of starch there are evolved two molecules of dextrin
                    and one of sugar, while others affirm that the yield is two of sugar and one of
                    dextrin, and a third party hold that for each molecule of sugar there is one of
                    dextrin produced, thus :—</p>

                <p>These statements, however, are based on the assumption that the sugar which
                    results from the fermentation of germinating barley is ordinary grape sugar or
                    dextrose, <hi rend="smallcaps">C</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> 6</hi><hi

                    it is a form of sugar possessed of peculiar properties to which the name maltose
                    has been given. Maltose, according to O’Sullivan, is isomeric with cane sugar, C

                    times as great = + 154°. According to Dubrunfaut the efficient ferment in barley
                    is maltin, a much more richly nitrogenous and active body than diastase, which
                    he considers to be only a product of the decomposition of maltin.</p>
                <p>By the processes of malting 100 parts by weight of barley yield about 80 of
                    kiln-dried malt and 2 to 3 of dried radicle and plumule called “malt dust.” The
                    progressive modification in composition is shown in the accompanying table of
                    analyses extracted from the report presented by Mr (now Sir) J. B. Lawes to the

                    for malt as a feeding material were largely illusory :—</p>

                <p>Since the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Brewing</hi> was written the malt tax then
                    in force in the United Kingdom has been repealed, and in its place, under the
                    provisions of the Inland Revenue Act 1880 (43 &amp; 44 Vict. cap. 20), an
                    equivalent duty on beer has been substituted. By that enactment numerous
                    modifications have been made practicable in the use of malt for feeding and
                    other industrial purposes, and much greater latitude has been given to brewers
                    in the selection and use of raw materials for the manufacture of the beverages
                    hitherto known as malt liquors. Taking as the unit of measurement the bushel of
                    malt, which is defined by statute as equivalent to 42 ib of malt or corn of any
                    description, or to 28 lb of sugar, the malt duty, which under the provisions of
                    the repealed statutes amounted to 2s. 7d., with 5 per cent, additional, has been
                    transformed into a beer duty of 6s. 3d. charged upon every 36 gallons of wort of
                    a specific gravity of 1057; and every brewer is deemed to have brewed 36 gallons
                    of worts of that gravity who has used 2 bushels of malt in brewing. In the case
                    of brewers for sale, should the quantity of worts produced and the specific
                    gravity of such worts exceed by more than 4 per cent, the quantity and gravity
                    above specified, the duty is charged for the excess over and above such 4 per
                    cent. Brewers for domestic use and for the use of their own farm labourers are
                    exempt from duty when the annual value of the house occupied by the brewer is
                    not more than £10, and all brewers for domestic use who occupy houses exceeding
                    in value that amount, and who consequently are subject to the beer tax, must
                    brew their beer on their own premises only.</p>
                <p>The malt tax, which in reality was a duty on raw grain, had long been regarded as
                    a grievous impost, and its repeal was systematically agitated for by the
                    agricultural interest. The tax, it was alleged, operated injuriously on the
                    cultivators of barley, and prevented stockholders from freely using malt for the
                    feeding of cattle and of ewes at the lambing season, &amp;c. On the part of
                    brewers it was maintained that the operation of the tax restricted them to the
                    use of the heaviest and most expensive classes of barley alone; and that they
                    were consequently precluded from using many varieties of grain and saccharine
                    materials which under other conditions they might employ with advantage both to
                    themselves and to the consumers of beer. No sooner, however, was it proposed by
                    the Government to effect the change so long clamoured for—not indeed the entire
                    abolition of taxation on malt liquors, but the freeing of a raw material from
                    fiscal impost—than the agricultural community discovered they had made a
                    mistake, and that, while it was really the beer drinker who paid the malt tax,
                    its operation had rather tended to give the British barleygrower a monopoly of
                    the trade in that raw material, and to artificially enhance the value of the
                    heavier qualities of the grain. Further it was found that the idea of using malt
                    for feeding purposes to any considerable extent, a right which stockholders
                    already possessed under the provisions of the “Gladstone Act” (27 &amp; 28 Vict.
                    cap. 9)was entirely illusory; and as a matter of fact no demand has arisen for
                    malt for such purposes. On the other hand, the freedom of choice as to raw
                    materials which the Inland Revenue Act 1880 has given to brewers has not been
                    without influence on the industry, although the modifications have up to this
                    time been by no means so numerous and important as had been anticipated. Barley
                    continues to be the principal, and, supplemented by sugar, almost the only, raw
                    material of wort; but brewers no longer have any interest in confirming
                    themselves to the heaviest and plumpest growths, and consequently much light
                    foreign-grown barley is now used. It was also expected that raw grain, and
                    particularly maize, would be largely used with malt in the mashings, especially
                    as a method had been devised and. patented by Mr R. Blair Robertson of Glasgow
                    for removing the germ of that grain, which contains a peculiar acrid oil, and
                    which communicates a bitter unpleasant flavour to the wort in which it may be
                    infused. To a limited extent a “maize beer,” in which one-third part of
                    Robertson’s patent prepared maize is mashed with two-thirds of malt, is being
                    brewed with quite satisfactory results, but the mixture does not appear to have
                    com mended itself generally to the trade either on the score of quality or of
                    cheapness.</p>
                <p>Malt is also the raw material from which the whisky of Scotland and Ireland is
                    principally distilled, and it is the source of the greater part of the best
                    qualities of table and pickling vinegar. Chiefly on account of the great solvent
                    power over starch possessed by the diastase or maltin it contains, malt is
                    extensively used as a combination in prepared farinaceous food for infants, and
                    in the form of a malt extract it possesses considerable reputation in
                    pharmacy.</p>
