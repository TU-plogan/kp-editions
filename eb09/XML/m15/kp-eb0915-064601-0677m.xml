                <p><label type="entry">MAXIMUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">St</hi></label>, abbot of
                    Chrysopolis, known as “the Confessor” from his orthodox zeal in the Monothelite
                    controversy, or as “the monk,” was born of noble parentage at Constantinople
                    about the year 580. Educated with great care, he early became distinguished by
                    his talents and,acquirements, and some time after the accession of the emperor
                    Heraclius in 610 was made his private secretary. In 630 he abandoned the secular
                    life and entered the monastery of Chrysopolis (Scutari), actuated, it was
                    believed, less by any longing for the life of a recluse than by the
                    dissatisfaction he felt with the Monothelite leanings of his master. The date of
                    his promotion to the abbacy is uncertain. In 633 he was one of the party of
                    Sophronius at the council of Alexandria; and in 645 he was again in Africa, when
                    he held in presence of the governor and a number of bishops the disputation with
                    Pyrrhus, the deposed and banished patriarch of Constantinople, which resulted in
                    the (temporary) conversion of his interlocutor to the Dyothelite view. In the
                    following year several African synods, held under the influence of Maximus,
                    declared for orthodoxy. In 649, after the accession of Martin I., he went to
                    Rome, and did much to fan the zeal of the new pope, who in October of that year
                    held the (first) Lateran synod, by which not only the Monothelite doctrine but
                    also the moderating <hi rend="italic">ecthesis</hi> of Heraclius and <hi
                    rend="italic">typus</hi> of Constans II. were anathematized. About 653 Maximus,
                    for the part he had taken against the latter document especially, was
                    apprehended by order of Constans and carried a prisoner to Constantinople, and
                    in 655, after repeated examinations, in which he maintained his theological
                    opinions with memorable constancy, was banished to Byzia in Thrace, and
                    afterwards to Perberis. In 662 he was again brought to Constantinople and was
                    condemned by a synod there to be scourged, to have his tongue cut out by the
                    root, and to have his right hand chopped off. After this sentence had been
                    carried out he was again banished to Lazica, where he died on August 13, 662. He
                    is venerated as a saint both in the Greek and in the Latin Church,—in the former
                    on January and on August 12th and 13th, in the latter on August 13th.</p>
                <p>Λ collection of his works, which are of importance for the history of the
                    Monothelite controversy, was undertaken by Combefis, who published two volumes
                    in 1675 (&lt;S ’. <hi rend="italic">Maximi Confessoris,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    but did not live to complete his labours. A list of the more important of the
                    writings of Maximus, with bibliographical details, will be found in Smith’s <hi

                    “Catalogue raisonné,” by Wagenmann, occurs in vol. ix. (1881) of the new edition

                    disputation with Pyrrhus and of the martyrdom are given very fully and clearly
