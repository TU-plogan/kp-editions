                    Sporades of the Aegean Sea, situated at the south-west corner of the
                    archipelago, in 36° 45' N. lat. and 24° 26' E. long., 75 miles due east from the
                    coast of Laconia. From east to west it measures about 14 miles, from north to
                    south 8 miles, and its area is estimated at 52 square miles. The greater portion
                    is rugged and hilly, and the culminating point, Mount Elias in the west, reaches
                    a height of 2538 feet. Like the rest of the cluster to which it belongs, the
                    island as a whole is of volcanic origin, with tuff, trachyte, and obsidian among
                    its ordinary rocks. The great natural harbour, which, with a depth diminishing
                    from 70 to 30 fathoms, strikes in from the north-west so as to cut the island
                    into two fairly equal portions, with an isthmus not more than 1} miles broad, is
                    evidently the hollow of the principal crater. In one of the caves on the south
                    coast the heat is still so great that one cannot remain within more than a few
                    minutes, and on the eastern shore of the harbour there is a remarkable cluster
                    of hot sulphurous springs. Sulphur is found in abundance on the top of Mount
                    Kalamo and elsewhere. In ancient times the alum of Milo was reckoned next to
                    that of Egypt (Pliny, XXXV. 15 [52]), and millstones, salt (from a marsh at the
                    east end of the harbour), and gypsum are still exported. The Melian earth <hi

                    throughout the island, which, however, is too dry to have any profusion of
                    vegetation. The vine, the cotton plant, and barley are the main objects of
                    cultivation. Including the neighbouring islands of Antimilos (4 square miles),
                    Cimolos (16 square miles), and Polinos (5∣ square^miles), the total population
                    of Melos was only 5538 in 1879.</p>

                    in antiquity the subject of dispute between the Melians and Cimolians. It has
                    long been almost uninhabited.</p>
                <p>In ancient times the city of Melos, built terrace fashion round a hill in the
                    north-east of the main island, was a place of considerable size; “the western
                    wall, of Cyclopeaħ masonry, is traceable all the way down from the summit to the
                    sea,” and among the ruins are a temple in the Corinthian style and a beautiful
                    little theatre cleared in 1836 by order of the king of Bavaria. Painted vases
                    (the ancient Melians were great makers of this kind of ware), bronzes, gold
                    ornaments, and similar specimens of art workmanship have been recovered from the
                    debris; and in 1820 the “Venus of Milo,” now in the Louvre, the noblest extant
                    representation of Aphrodite, was found in the neighbourhood of the theatre. The
                    top of the hill is now occupied by Castro, the principal village in the island.
                    At some distance to the south-east, at the place called Tripiti <hi
                        rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi><hi rend="italic">τρυπητή,</hi> “the perforated ”),
                    lies a remarkable cluster of catacombs containing frescos, &amp;c., of evidently
                    Christian origin. Palaea Chora, about 5 miles farther south-east, is now an
                    almost deserted village, but down to the beginning of the last century it had
                    about 5000 inhabitants, and it continued for a time to be considered the capital
                    of the island.</p>
                <p>The first occupants of Melos were probably Phoenicians, but the island was
                    Hellenized at an early date by Minyans and Dorians from Laconia. Though its
                    inhabitants sent a contingent to the Greek fleet at Salamis, they held aloof
                    from the Attic league, and sought to remain neutral during the Peloponnesian
                    War. But in 416 B.c. the Athenians, having attacked the island and compelled the
                    Melians to surrender at discretion, slew all the men capable of bearing arms,
                    made slaves of the women and children, and introduced a body of five hundred
                    Athenian colonists. Lysander restored the island to its old Dorian possessors,
                    but it never recovered its former prosperity. There were many Jewish settlers in
                    Melos in the beginning of theChristian era, and Christianity was early
                    introduced. During the “Frankish” period the island formed part of the duchy of
                    Naxos, except for the few years (1341-83) when it was a separate lordship under
                    Marco Sanudo and his daughter.</p>
