                    education at Madrid and Segovia, he went to Salamanca, and duly graduated in
                    laws. At an early age he had begun to write verses in imitation of the then much
                    admired though now justly forgotten Eugenio Lobo; but at Salamanca he came under
                    the influence of the purer literary taste of the elder Moratin, while to the
                    friendship of the cultivated and well-read Cadahalso he owed his introduction to
                    the writings of recent English poets. At the age of twenty-six Melendez obtained
                    the prize of the Spanish Academy for the best eclogue, one of the unsuccessful
                    competitors being the well-known Iriarte; the poem <hi rend="italic">(Batilo:
                    egloga</hi><hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">alabanzade</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">la vida</hi><hi rend="italic">del</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >campo,</hi> 1780) continues to be highly spoken of by native critics, who echo
                    in various forms the remark of one of the adjudicators, that it was “redolent of
                    the wild thyme.” In 1781 Melendez went to Madrid, where Jovellanos became his
                    friend, and obtained for him in 1783 the appointment of professor of the
                    humanities at Salamanca. In 1784, in competition for a prize offered by the city
                    of Madrid, he produced his longest poem, a “dramatic eclogue” entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Las Bodas de Camacho</hi> (“Camacho’s Wedding”), which secured the
                    vote of the judges, but did not add to his reputation, and soon fell into
                    neglect. His genius does not seem to have been at all dramatic; at any rate he
                    was unfortunate in his choice of a subject so little capable of dramatic
                    treatment as the well-known episode in <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote.</hi> In
                    the following year, at the age of thirty-one, he published a little volume of
                    lyrics and pastorals which gave him the first place he still holds among Spanish
                    poets of the 18th century. Several editions were exhausted in a single year. Μ
                    ith poetical fame came professional advancement, and in 1789 the “Restorer of
                    Parnassus” (Restaurador del Parnaso), as Melendez is sometimes pedantically
                    called by his countrymen, received a judicial appointment at Saragossa, which in
                    1791 he exchanged for a chancery <pb break="no"

                    publication of a new and greatly enlarged edition of his works, dedicated to the
                    prince of the peace, was followed by his removal to Madrid to a high post in
                    connexion with the treasury. The new poems included somewhat heavy philosophical
                    epistles written after the manner of Young, and an unmistakably dull epic canto
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Caida de Luzbel</hi> (“The Fall of Lucifer”),
                    suggested by Milton, as well as an <hi rend="italic">Ode to Winter,</hi> which
                    showed how well the author had made himself acquainted with Thomson. On the fall
                    of his friend Jovellanos in 1798 Melendez was ordered away from Madrid, first to
                    Medina del Campo and afterwards to Zamora, and it was not till 1802 that he was
                    permitted to settle in Salamanca. For the next six years his literary activity
                    was but slight, being limited to the production of a short poem on “Creation”
                    and the preparation of an unfinished translation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aeneid.</hi> After the revolution of Aranjuez (1808) Melendez accepted from
                    King Joseph the post of councillor of state and afterwards that of minister of
                    public instruction, a failure of patriotism which involved him in many
                    indignities and even dangers; in 1813 he was of course compelled to quit his
                    country, and, after sojourning successively at Alais, Nîmes, and Toulouse, he
                    died in considerable poverty and neglect at Montpellier, on May 24, 1817. During
                    his exile he employed himself in the preparation of a complete edition of his
                    works, with numerous additions and corrections; this was afterwards published,
                    along with a life of the author by Quintana, at the expense of the Government (4
                    vols. 8vo, Madrid, 1820; reprinted at Paris, 1832, and at Barcelona, 1838).</p>
