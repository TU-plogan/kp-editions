                    the same name, <hi rend="smallcaps">Massa Carrara,</hi> a city of Italy, the
                    chief town of the province of Massa, lies on the left bank of the Frigido, a
                    small stream falling into the Gulf of Genoa about 3 miles lower down. It is 78∣
                    miles south-east of Genoa by rail, and 26 miles north of Pisa. The ancient part
                    of the city stands on a hill. Among the objects of interest it is sufficient to
                    mention the old ducal palace, the new cathedral (erected instead of the building
                    destroyed by Elisa Bacciocchi because it interfered with the view from the
                    palace windows), the technical school, and the academy of science and
                    literature, originally known as Dei Derelitti. Like Carrara, Massa is largely
                    engaged in the marble trade; it also manufactures silk, oil, and paper. The
                    population of the city was 4786 in 1871; that of the commune was 15,017 in 1861
                    and 18,031 in 1881.</p>
                <p>Massa is first mentioned in the 9th century. About the close of the 10th it was
                    bestowed by Otho the Great on the bishops of Luni, and in consequence it came to
                    be distinguished for a time as Massa Lunense. From the bishops it passed to the
                    marquises of Luni (hence <hi rend="italic">Massa del Marchese),</hi> and more
                    particularly to a branch of the Malaspina family. After a period in which Lucca,
                    Pisa, the Visconti, the Fieschi, and others were successively in possession it
                    returned, under Florentine protection, to Alberico Malaspina, and finally
                    through the marriage of Ricciarda Malaspina with Lorenzo Cybo became (1519) <hi
                    rend="italic">Massa Cybea.</hi> Raised under Alberico Cybo from being little
                    better than a feudal village to the rank of a fortified town, Massa was in 1568
                    made the capital of a principality by Maximilian II., and in 1664 the capital of
                    a duchy by Leopold I. By the marriage of Maria Teresa dei Cybei with Duke Ercole
                    III. of Modena it passed to the Este family; and after the period of the French
                    Revolution, during which it formed part of the duchy of Lucca assigned to
                    Napoleon’s sister and brother-in-law, it was restored by tlιe congress of Vienna
                    to Beatrice, duchess of Modena. Massa was made an episcopal see only in 1828,
                    though the design of giving it this dignity had been entertained and almost
                    realized in 1757. The total area of the duchy of Massa and Carrara was 62 square
                    miles, of which 35 belonged to Massa.</p>
