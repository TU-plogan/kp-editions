                    >Maia,</hi> the mother of Mercury, to whom the Romans were accustomed to
                    sacrifice on the first day of the month. It was considered unlucky among the
                    Romans to contract marriages during this month, on account of the celebration of
                    the Lemuria,—a superstition of which traces are still to be found among
                    ourselves. In the Roman Catholic Church May is known as “the month of Mary.”</p>
                <p>May-day is the name given to the first day of the month in England, when,
                    according to ancient custom, all ranks of the people rose at early dawn and went
                    out <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> a-Maying” to welcome the advent of spring.
                    The customs of the day chiefly took their rise with the Romans. In the southern
                    counties of England they differ materially from those of the northern and
                    western. That of gathering branches of trees and flowers, to deck the person, is
                    still observed in many places.</p>
                <p>The May-Pole was once general throughout the country. The assemblage of the
                    people, sanctioned by the presence of the priests, marching on May morning in
                    procession to some neighbouring wood, returned in triumph with the pole, round
                    which were suspended flowers, boughs, and other tokens of the spring season. On
                    one of these festive occasions, Henry VIIΓ. assembled his court at Shooter’s
                    Hill; and Queen Elizabeth also used to keep “May Games” at Greenwich. The
                    May-pole, once fixed, often remained until nearly the end of the year; and there
                    were some specially made of durable wood, which remained for many years, and
                    were from time to time resorted to at other seasons of festivity. The last
                    May-pole erected in London, 100 feet in height, was on the spot where the church
                    in the Strand now stands, near Somerset House. Being taken down in 1717-18 it
                    was conveyed to Wanstead Park in Essex, where it was fixed as part of the
                    support of a large telescope set up by Sir Isaac Newton. The May Lady, Maulkin,
                    Jack in the Green, and Morris Dancing are merely variations in the mode of
                    representing the goddess Flora. The chimney sweepers, who are now the principal
                    performers, are probably more interested than any other class in May sports.
                    For, as the commencement of summer deprives them in a considerable degree of
                    their business occupation, they naturally seek to avail themselves of the
                    customary liberality of festive meetings.</p>
                <p>The other principal fixed days observed and noted in th·e month are May 9,
                    Half-Quarter-Day, and May 15, Whitsunday term,—not to be confounded with Whit
                    Sunday, which is a movable feast.</p>
