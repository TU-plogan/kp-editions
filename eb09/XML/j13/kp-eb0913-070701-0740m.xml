                    exception has been taken to the title “epistle” as applied to this document,
                    seeing that it bears the name neither of sender nor of recipient, and carries
                    with it no definiteness of message to a special correspondent. But, though it
                    may be admitted that with regard to its literary form it would more properly be
                    described as a homily or discourse, the frequently recurring terms “I wrote,” I
                    have written,” imply that the message was written, not orally delivered.</p>

                    frequently cited by Irenaeus, a disciple of Polycarp, as we learn both from the
                    statement of Eusebius (77. <hi rend="italic">E.,</hi> v. 8) and from his extant

                    the canon of Muratori are probably the Second and Third, but the absence of
                    reference to the First in that particular connexion implies its acknowledged
                    canonicity; moreover, the same canon contains a citation of 1 John i. 1, 4. The
                    early fraggιent called the letter to Diognetus has unmistakable allusions to the
                    Johannine epistles. The Peshito contains the epistle, and there is an undoubted
                    reference to it in the letter from the churches of Vienne and Lyons. All those
                    authorities belong to the first two centuries. In the succeeding centuries the
                    volume of evidence grows. Eusebius reckons the epistle among the <hi
                    rend="italic">Homoloyoumena</hi> or writings of acknowledged authority, and the
                    testimony of Tertullian, Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen, and Cyprian, in addition
                    to the evidence already adduced, indicates its reception in all the
                    churches.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The epistle

                    the other writings of St John.</p></note></p>
                <p>To those who accept the Fourth Gospel as John’s, the strength of the internal
                    evidence for the Johannine authorship of the epistle lies in the similarity of
                    words, of teaching, and of style between the two writings. This similarity is so
                    marked that it requires no argumentative proof. It is a similarity not only of
                    diction, or of parallel expressions and peculiarities of style, but one which is
                    penetrated by the more subtle correspondence of under-currents of thought and of
                    implied knowledge. See on this part of the subject Westcott, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introduction to the Gospel of St John,</hi> p. lxi. <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi>
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Speaker's Commentary</hi>; and Davidson’s <hi

                    rend="italic">sq.</hi> On the other hand, the very closeness of the connexion
                    between the epistles and the gospel has necessarily involved the former in the
                    assaults of recent criticism upon the genuineness of the latter.<note

                    >Gospels,</hi> vol. x. p. 828.</p></note> Some critics, however, while admitting
                    the similarity of style, contend that there are differences of doctrine between
                    the gospel and epistle which preclude identity of authorship. The main points
                    advanced in behalf of this statement are—the supposed differences in
                    eschatological views, the application of the term “Paraclete” to the work of the
                    Holy Spirit in the gospel and to the office of Christ alone in the epistlé, the
                    introduction into the epistle of such terms as <hi rend="italic">ϊλασμός</hi>
                    and χpισγzα, which are not found in the gospel, and, lastly, the polemical and
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n741/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0741-0708"/> strongly anti-Docetic tone which is said to
                    distinguish the epistle from the gospel. Such differences, however, are in part
                    more apparent than real (they are certainly not contradictions), and in part may
                    be naturally explained by the changed circumstances in which the two writings
                    were composed and the different aims proposed in them. On this point see
                    Westcott, p. lxxxviii., and Reuss, <hi rend="italic">Introduction,</hi> p. 358
                    57.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Date.—</hi> The date of the epistle must remain in uncertainty;
                    but it is generally viewed as later in composition than the gospel. “The phrases
                    in the gospel,” writes Professor Westcott, “have a definite historic connexion;
                    they belong to circumstances which explain them. The phrases in the epistle are
                    in part generalizations and in part interpretations of the earlier language in
                    view of Christ’s completed work, and of the experience of the Christian church.”
                    The same writer assigns on good grounds to the gospel as well as to the epistle
                    a date subsequent to the fall of Jerusalem. In this view <hi rend="italic"
                    >έσχατη</hi><hi rend="italic">ωpα,</hi> ch. ii. 18, must be understood of the
                    approach of the second advent of Christ.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Occasion and Contents.—</hi> Mr Browning has in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Death in the Desert</hi> caught the true occasion of the apostle’s
                    letter: it was written in view of the time when</p>
                <p>“There is left on earth No one alive who knew (consider this),— Saw with his eyes
                    and handled with his hands That which was from the first, the Word of Life; How
                    will it be when none more saith ‘ I saw ’ ?”</p>
                <p>It is the testimony of the last surviving eyewitness of the Lord, far removed
                    from the scenes and words which he attests, giving, in view of rising
                    error,—Gnostic and Docetic, —the apostolic judgment on questions of the day, and
                    founding the truth of Christian doctrine on a recognition of the historical
                    Christ.</p>
                <p>The subject and character of the epistle answer these conditions. The direct
                    testimony to the real existence of Jesus Christ in the flesh, the declaration of
                    spiritual tests (as in ch. i. 6, ii. 29, iii. 19, and in many other passages)
                    which gives an introspective element to the epistle, and, lastly, the impressive
                    re-delivery of familiar truths not freshly defined but exhibited in different
                    mutual relations, are characteristic of an address given by an aged teacher to a
                    generation of men who had not seen the Lord,—from whom therefore objective proof
                    had been withdrawn, and who in consequence would desire some clear testimony of
                    the facts about Jesus, and some definite tests of comm,union with God and of the
                    reality of their spiritual condition. It is an address to the instructed. Much
                    therefore is taken for granted; many elementary principles and truths of the
                    Christian life are left unnoticed; and religious terms frequent in other parts
                    of the New Testament are absent from this epistle. The apostle writes “because
                    they have known Him that was from the beginning” (ii. 13), and his aim is a
                    deepening of the spiritual life and a confirmation of faith.</p>
                <p>After an introduction, giving his credentials as a witness and stating his aim,
                    the apostle delivers his message to the church, “God is light” (i. 5). This
                    thought is the subject of the epistle; it is illustrated by the opposite of
                    light—darkness, and by analogous pairs of opposites, in which the principal
                    theme is exhibited in different aspects: these are—righteousness and sin, truth
                    and falsehood, love and hate, God and the world, life and death. To those ideas,
                    which are in truth varied expressions of one and the same idea, the apostle
                    turns and returns, not repeating himself, but on each reiteration of the truth
                    adding some fresh thought and deeper truth. Through these opposites runs another
                    thought—judgment or decision,—which is viewed not as a future but as an
                    everpresent fact in the Christian life.</p>
                <p>After the delivery of his message (αγγeλtα) the apostle proceeds toset forth some
                    effects of the “light,”—fellowship with one another, confession of sin,
                    forgiveness of sin (i. 5-10). This suggests one aspect of the object of the
                    “message,” freedom from sin, the test of which, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in
                    other words, the test of knowing God, is observance of His commandments, which
                    are summed up in love (αγατ∏∕) (ii. 1-11). Here the apostle reminds his readers
                    why he sends the message; it is because (on) they to whom it comes are
                    Christians, whose sins have been forgiven, who have known Christ, who have
                    conquered Satan; it comes to all,—to little children, to young men, to the aged
                    (ii. 12-14). Therefore let them not love the world nor the things of the world
                    (ii. 15-17). Hence the thought of the end of the world and the signs thereof. Of
                    these one is the Antichrist. There are now many Antichrists even in the nominal
                    church. But there is a test of the true Christian,—to have the Father, the Son,
                    the unction (χρίσμα) of the Holy Spirit, and the truth (ii. 18-28).</p>
                <p>A new section begins with the thought of sonship of God. The test of sonship is
                    doing righteousness because God is righteous. Sonship is a proof of the Father’s
                    love, and the condition of it is likeness to the Father (ii. 28-iii. 9). The
                    connexion is then traced between righteousness and love (10-13), between love
                    and life, and hate and death (14, 15). This suggests the range of
                    love,—selfsacrifice even to death (16-18). Truth (suggested by reality of love)
                    is shown to be tested by keeping the commandments, the first of which is love
                    (19-23), the result is the indwelling of Christ which the Spirit testifies (24).
                    The mention of the Spirit leads the apostle’s thoughts once more, as in ch. ii.
                    18 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> to the distinction between true spirits and
                    false. The test is the same, the acknowledgment that Christ has come in the
                    flesh (iv. 1-6). The thought of the true Christian as distinguished from the
                    false again suggests mutual love, which springs from God’s love to us manifested
                    by the mission of Christ. Mutual love is a proof of the indwelling Christ
                    (7-13). Here the apostle pauses to bear impressive witness to the mission of
                    Christ and the love of God (14-16), and then resumes the subject of love. A
                    result of perfect love is confidence in the day of judgment. But absence of
                    brotherly love means want of love to God (17-21). For the test of brotherly love
                    is love to God, which consists in keeping His commandments through the faith in
                    Jesus Christ that overcomes the world (v. 1-5). Jesus Christ then is the object
                    of faith. Faith brings its own evidence, and its evidence is that God gave
                    eternal life (6-12). To effect the knowledge of this (the possession of eternal
                    life), and the belief in the Son of God, were the apostle’s objects in writing.
                    Such knowledge and belief bring assurance, from which results certainty of
                    answer to prayer. The instance given is intercessory prayer (13-17). In
                    conclusion the apostle recapitulates some of the leading truths dwelt upon in
                    the epistle.</p>
                <p>From this brief summary it will be seen that the sections are sometimes linked
                    together by a manifest chain of reasoning, and that sometimes the concluding
                    word in one paragraph suggests the fresh train of thought in the next. Some
                    expositors detect a more logical sequence in the epistle. But the varying
                    results of their expositions go to prove the improbability that the apostle had
                    in view any such systematic arrangement. See, however, Düsterdieck, whose scheme
                    is mainly followed by Alford, and Davidson, <hi rend="italic">Introduction to
                    the Study of the New Testament.</hi><hi rend="italic">Where Written and to Whom
                    Addressed.—</hi> The epistle was probably written at Ephesus, where the most

                    the church of Ephesus, or as an encyclical letter to the churches of Asia. In

                    destination of the epistle is unlikely in itself, receives no support from the
                    Greek Church, and is opposed to ecclesiastical tradition. Hence the best
                    criticism rejects the superscription. It is variously accounted for. Whiston, in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Commentary on the Epistles</hi> (1719), suggests that the
                    original address was τrpos <hi rend="italic">παρθένους,</hi> and that this

                <p>Before textual criticism was studied scientifically, much controversy turned upon
                    the words contained in vers. 7 and 8 of ch. v. The disputed passage, <hi

                    with less decisive evidence than that of the First Epistle. Irenaeus quotes 2

                    stated, probably contains a reference to the two minor epistles.</p>

                    the Presbyter rests on the slender authority of an inference from a statement by
                    Papias (Eus., <hi rend="italic">H. E.,</hi> iii. 39); that the style and
                    expressions in the disputed epistles are so manifestly Johannine that, if they
                    did not proceed from John the apostle, they must be the work of a conscious
                    imitator, who, if honest, would have used his own name, if an intentional
                    deceiver, that of the apostle; that the term <hi rend="italic">ό
                    πρεσβυτέρας</hi> (“the elder,” or “the aged ”), 2 John 1, 3 John 1, is either a
                    title of dignity or descriptive of age (if the first it may be paralleled by the
                    use of <hi rend="italic">συμπρεσβυτερoς,</hi> 1 Pet. v. 1; if the second, by
                    that of <hi rend="italic">πρεσβύτης,</hi> Phil. 9, both applied by an apostle to
                    himself).</p>
                <p>The greeting in the Second Epistle <hi rend="italic">εκλεκτή κυρία</hi> is
                    variously interpreted—either <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> of a person (to the
                    elect lady, to the elect Kyria, or to the lady Eclecta), or (6) of a church
                    mystically addressed under a personal appellation. The last hypothesis is
                    unlikely, and is not supported either by New Testament usage or by the early
                    apocryphal writings. If either <hi rend="italic">εκλεκτή</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">κυρία</hi> be a proper name, it is better to regard <hi
                    rend="italic">κυρία</hi> as such, since <hi rend="italic">εκλεκτός</hi> is a
                    term applied to all the saints, and in this very letter to the lady’s sister,
                    ver. 13. On the whole it is more probable that both <hi rend="italic"
                    >εκλεκτή</hi> and <hi rend="italic">κυρία</hi> bear their ordinary meanings, and
                    that the A.V. is correct.</p>
                <p>The Third Epistle is addressed to Gaius or Caius, a name so common that all
                    identifications must be regarded as purely conjectural. From the epistle we
                    learn that he was a Christian of good report, probably a layman, whom the
                    apostle commends for his hospitality to certain missionaries of the faith who
                    seem to have visited his city. Two other names are mentioned—Diotrephes, a
                    leading and ambitious presbyter, who had refused to obey the apostle’s
                    injunctions, and Demetrius, either the bearer of the epistle or a member of the
                    same church to which Caius belonged.</p>
                <p>The time when and the place where these epistles were written must remain unknown
                    from the absence of any data by which to determine them.</p>
                <p>The works consulted for this article have been the commentaries of Alford,
                    Ebrard, Lücke, and Reuss on the Epistles, and that of Westcott on the Gospel of
                    St John <hi rend="italic">(Speaker's Commentary')</hi>; Westcott, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Canon of the New Testament</hi>; Neander’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Planting of Christianity</hi> (Bohn’s trans., vol. ii. ); F. D. Maurice’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Lectures on the Epistles of St John</hi>; and Davidson’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Introduction to the New Testament.</hi> There are also
                    commentaries, among others, by Düsterdieck, 1852; Luthardt, 1860; Haupt, 1869;
                    Baur, 1848; Hilgenfeld, 1854, the last two representing the Tübingen school of
                    criticism. (A. C. *)</p>
