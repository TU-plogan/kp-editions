                    considerable <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> literary reputation, for which indeed
                    his strange novel <hi rend="italic">L’Ane Mort et</hi><hi rend="italic">la
                    Femme</hi><hi rend="italic">Guillotinée</hi> (1829) would have sufficed. <hi
                    rend="italic">La Confession,</hi> which followed, was less remarkable in
                    substance but even more so in style; and <hi rend="italic">Barnave,</hi> in
                    1831, sustained the literary reputation of the author, though the violent
                    attacks it contained on the Orleans family did not, when they were taken with
                    his subsequent conduct, increase his reputation for consistency. From the day,
                    however, when Janin became the theatrical critic of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Debats,</hi> though he continued to write books indefatigably, he was to most
                    Frenchmen a dramatic critic and nothing more. His system was odd enough. He
                    called himself “prince of critics,” a self-presented testimonial in which the
                    mixture of irony and vanity (in all senses of the word) which marked all his
                    work may be detected. He was outrageously inconsistent, and judged things from
                    no general point of view whatsoever, though at least latterly his judgment was
                    usually good-natured. But few journalists have ever been misters of a more
                    attractive fashion of saying the first thing that came into their heads, and if
                    he had called himself a prince of journalists he would not have been far wrong.
                    After many years of <hi rend="italic">feuilleton</hi> writing he collected some
                    of his articles in the work called <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la littérature
                    dramatique,</hi> which, as may be gathered from what has been said, by no means
                    deserves the title. In 1865 he made his first attempt upon the Academy, but was
                    not successful till five years later. Meanwhile he had not been content with his
                    <hi rend="italic">feuilletons,</hi> written persistently about all manner of
                    things. No one was more in request with the Paris publishers for prefaces,
                    letterpress to illustrated books, and all the other hackwork which usually
                    engages in France men of letters of a somewhat higher class than those who
                    generally devote themselves to it in England. He travelled (picking up in one of
                    his journeys a curious windfall, a country house at Lucca, which fell to him in
                    a lottery), and wrote accounts of his travels; he wrote numerous tales and
                    novels, for the titles of which we have no space here, and composed many other
                    works, of which by far the best is the oddly entitled <hi rend="italic">Fin Tun
                    Monde</hi><hi rend="italic">et du Neveu</hi><hi rend="italic">de Rameau,</hi> in
                    which, under the guise of a sequel to Diderot’s masterpiece, he showed to
                    considerable advantage his great familiarity with the late 18th century. He
                    married in 1841; his wife had money, and he was always in easy circumstances. In
                    the early part of his career he had many quarrels, notably one with Felix Pyat,
                    but latterly, partly owing to his critical authority and partly to his good
                    temper and hospitality, he was a very popular man with his craft, and at his
                    death his library was said to contain the greatest number of gift and dedication
                    copies of contemporary works that had ever been brought to the hammer. Even in
                    the few years since his death, however, his reputation has rapidly faded, and
                    except with those who know how to look at literature in the largest and most
                    tolerant way, it is not likely to revive. His <hi rend="italic">Âne</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mort</hi> is really a most remarkable book. Written half in
                    parody, half in deliberate pursuance of the romantic ideas, it anticipated by
                    fifty years in point of time and far excelled in point of literary value the
                    recent performances of the naturalist school. Those who wish to know what Janin
                    might have been should read this, <hi rend="italic">Barnave,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fin Tun Monde.</hi> But for the most part his work is mere
                    improvisation, and has no elements of vitality in it except a light and vivid
                    style.</p>
