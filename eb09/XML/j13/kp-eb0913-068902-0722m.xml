                    state, and the state of Jaora; and on the W. by detached tracts belonging to
                    Sindhia and Holkar. This portion lies between 23° 48' and 24° 48' N. lat., and
                    between 75° 55' and 77° E. long. The lesser detached area is bounded on the N.,
                    E., and S. by the Gwalior state, and on the W. by Kotah, and lies between 25° 5'
                    and 25° 25' N. lat., and 76° 55' and 77° 25' E. long. The main portion of
                    Jhâlâwâr is situated on a raised plateau. The northern, eastern, and part of the
                    southern portions are very hilly, and intersected by numerous streams. The hills
                    are for the most part covered with timber and grass, and frequently enclose
                    lakes. The rest of this tract is a rich undulating plain, dotted with evergreen
                    trees. The soil generally is very rich, consisting in great part of dark clayey
                    mould, which produces valuable crops. Of the many streams running through the
                    territory, the most important are—the Parwau, with its tributary the Newâj; the
                    Kâli Sind, with its tributary the Αύ; and the Chhota Kâli Sind. The population
                    in 1875 was 226,000, of whom the majority were Hindus. The area of the whole
                    state is 2500 square miles.</p>
                <p>In Jhâlâwâr all the ordinary Indian grains are cultivated, and in the southern
                    districts opium is extensively grown. In the rest of the state wheat and opium
                    are the chief crops, except in Shâhâbâd, where <hi rend="italic">bdjrα</hi> is
                    chiefly produced. Irrigation is principally carried on by means of wells. Near
                    Jhalra Patan, the capital, there is a large artificial lake, from which water is
                    drawn by a channel 2 miles long. In 1876, 507,418 acres, or barely two-fifths of
                    the total area, were cultivated. The total revenue for 1876 was £174,719. The
                    police number 100 horse and 2000 foot. Education is at present very backward in
                    the state. In the districts the village priest teaches the young people. In the
                    capital and cantonment there are schools in which Hindi, Urdu, and English are
                    taught. The only metalled roads in the state are in the cantonment. All other
                    roads are simply cart tracks, which in the rains are useless for wheel traffic.
                    Opium is exported; the imports are English cloths and grain. The chief towns aτe
                    Jhalra Patan and the chhaoni or cantonment, Shâhâbâd, and Kailwara. The climate
                    resembles that of Central India, and is generally healthy. In the hot weather
                    the thermometer ranges during the day from 85° to 88° Fahr. The temperature
                    during the rains is cool and pleasant, and in the cold weather it is
                    occasionally frosty.</p>
                <p>The ruling family of Jhâlâwâr belongs to the Jhâlâ clan of Râjputs, and their
                    ancestors were petty chiefs of Halwad in the district of Jhâlâwâr, in Kâthiâwâr.
                    About 1709 one of the younger sons of the head of the clan left his country with
                    his son to try his fortunes at Delhi. At Kotah he left his son Madhu Sinh, who
                    soon got into great favour with the mahârâjâ, and got from him an important
                    post, which became hereditary. On the deathbed of one of the Kotah râjâs, the
                    country was left to the charge of Zalfιn Sinh, a descendant of Madhu Sinh. From
                    that time Zalim Sinh was the real ruler of Kotah. He brought it to a wonderful
                    state of prosperity, and under his administration, which lasted over forty-five
                    years, the Kotah territory was respected by all parties. In 1838 it was
                    resolved, with the consent of the chief of Kotah, to dismember the state, and to
                    create the new principality of Jhâlâwâr as a separate provision for the
                    descendants of Zalim Sinh. The districts then severed from Kotah were considered
                    to represent one-third (£120,000) of the income of Kotah; by treaty they
                    acknowledged the supremacy of the British, and agreed to pay an annual tribute
                    of £8000. Madan Sinh received the title of mahârâjâ rânâ, and was placed on the
                    same footing as the other chiefs in Râjputâna. The present mahârâjâ rânâ of
                    Jhâlâwâr has a force of 20 field and 75 other guns, 150 artillerymen, 425
                    cavalιy, and 4400 infantry.</p>
