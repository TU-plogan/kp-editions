                    the district between Monte Video and Santa Fé as many as two thousand were
                    killed yearly. The jaguar is usually found singly, or sometimes in pairs, and
                    preys upon such quadrupeds as the horse, tapir, capybara, dogs, or cattle, and
                    its strength is so great that it has been known to swim with a horse it had
                    killed across a wide river, and then to carry its prey into the woods. It rarely
                    slays at a time more than is requisite to satisfy its hunger, and leaves the
                    unconsumed portions for the benefit of any stray prowler who may find them. Its
                    manner of killing its victim is, after springing upon it, to strike it to the
                    earth by a blow of its powerful paw. The jaguar often feeds upon turtles,
                    sometimes following the reptiles into the water to effect a capture; having
                    secured one and turned it over on its back, it inserts a paw between the shells
                    and drags out the body of the turtle by means of its sharp claws. Occasionally,
                    after having tasted human flesh, the jaguar becomes a confirmed man-eater. The
                    cry of this great cat, which is heard at night, and most frequently during the
                    pairing season, is deep and hoarse in tone, and consists of the sound <hi
                    rend="italic">pu, pu,</hi> often repeated. The female brings forth from two to
                    four cubs towards the close of the year; they are able to follow their mother in
                    about fifteen days after birth. The colour of the jaguar varies greatly among
                    individuals, ranging from white to black, the rosette markings in the extremes
                    being but faintly visible. The general or typical coloration is a rich tan upon
                    the head, neck, body, outside of legs, and tail near the root. The upper part of
                    the head and sides of the face are thickly marked with small black spots, and
                    the rest of body is covered with rosettes, formed of black spots, with a black
                    spot in the centre, and ranged lengthwise along the body in five to seven rows
                    on each side. These black rings are heaviest along the back. The lips, throat,
                    breast, and belly, the inside of the legs, and the lower sides of tail are pure
                    white, marked with irregular spots of black, those on the breast being long
                    bars, and on the belly and inside of legs large blotches. The tail has large
                    black spots near the root, some with light centres, and from about midway of its
                    length to the tip it is ringed with black. The ears are black behind, with a
                    large buff spot near the tip. The nose and upper lip are light rufous brown. The
                    size varies, the total length of a very large specimen measuring 6 feet 9
                    inches; the average length, however, is about 4 feet from the nose to root of
                    tail. In form the jaguar is thick-set; it does not stand high upon its legs; and
                    in comparison with the leopard it is heavily built. But its movements are very
                    rapid, and it is fully as agile as its more graceful relative. The skull
                    resembles that of the lion and tiger, but is much broader in proportion to its
                    length. The forehead is concave, and the nasal region broad. The frontal
                    processes of the maxillary are rounded, in contradistinction to the truncated
                    form of the tiger and the pointed one of the lion, and do not extend as far back
                    as the fronto-nasal articulation. On the inner edge of the orbit is a
                    well-developed tubercule. The canines are long and stout, the molar series well
                    developed. The second sillon on the outer side of the crown of the canines is
                    rudimentary, sometimes absent.</p>
