                    (1770-1840), a French educationist, and author of the method of “Émancipation
                    intellectuelle,” was born at Dijon, March 4, 1770. He was educated at the
                    university of Dijon, where in his nineteenth year he was chosen professor of
                    Latin, after which he studied law, became advocate, and at the same time devoted
                    a large amount of his attention to mathematics. In 1788 he organized a
                    federation of the youth of Dijon for the defence of the principles of the
                    Revolution; and in 1792, with the rank of captain, he set out to take part in
                    the campaign of Belgium, where he conducted himself with bravery and
                    distinction. After for some time filling the office of secretary of the
                    “commission d’organisation du mouvement des armées,” he in 1794 became deputy of
                    the director of the Polytechnic school, and on the institution of the central
                    schools at Dijon he was appointed to the chair of the “method of sciences,”
                    where he made his first experiments in that mode of tuition which he afterwards
                    developed more fully. On the central schools being replaced by other educational
                    institutions, Jacotot occupied successively the chairs of mathematics and of
                    Roman law until the overthrow of the empire. In 1815 he was elected a
                    representative to the chamber of deputies; but after the second restoration he
                    found it necessary to quit his native land, and, having taken up his residence
                    at Brussels, he was in 1818 nominated by the Government teacher of the French
                    language at the university of Louvain, where he perfected into a system the
                    educational principles which he had already practised with success in France.
                    His method was not only adopted in several institutions in Belgium, but also met
                    with some approval in France, England, Germany, and Russia. An account of it
                    will be found in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Education,</hi> vol. vii. pp.
                    677-78. After the revolution of 1830 Jacotot returned to France, and he died at
                    Paris. July 30, 1840.</p>
