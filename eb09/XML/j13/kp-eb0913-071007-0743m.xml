                    Adrian II., was a Roman by birth. His chief aim during his occupancy of the
                    papal chair was to build up his temporal power by uniting the various discordant

                    unbending will, an unscrupulous readiness to employ any means that might best
                    advance his purpose, and a thorough mastery of diplomatic intrigue. Events,
                    however, were so fatally opposed to his designs that no sooner did one of his
                    schemes begin to realize itself in fact than it was shattered and dissipated by
                    an unlooked-for chance. To take advantage of the opportunity of winning a
                    recognition of the dependence of the imperial authority on that of Rome, as well
                    as to obtain an influential alliance against his enemies, he agreed, in 875, to
                    bestow the imperial crown on Charles the Bald, but that monarch was too much
                    occupied in Germany to grant him much effectual aid, and about the time of the
                    death of Charles he found it necessary to come to ignominious terms with the
                    Saracens, who were only prevented from entering Rome by the promise of an annual
                    tribute. Carloman, the opponent of Charles’s son Louis, soon after invaded
                    northern Italy, and, securing the support of the bishops and counts, demanded
                    from the pope the imperial crown. John attempted to temporize, but Duke Lambert
                    of Spoleto, a partisan of Carloman, whom events had recalled to Germany, entered
                    Rome in 878 with an overwhelming force, and for thirty days virtually held him a
                    prisoner in St Peter’s. He was, however, unsuccessful in winning any concession
                    from the pope, who after his withdrawal carried out a previous purpose of going
                    to France. There he presided at the council of Troyes, which promulgated a ban
                    of excommunication against the supporters of Carloman—amongst others Adalbert of
                    Tuscany, Lambert of Spoleto, and Formosus, bishop of Porto, who was afterwards
                    elevated to the papal chair. In 879 John returned to Italy accompanied by Duke
                    Boso of Provence, whom he adopted as his son, and made an unsuccessful attempt
                    to get recognized as king of Italy. In the same year he was compelled to give a
                    promise of his sanction to the claims of Charles the Fat, who received from him
                    the imperial crown in 881. Previous to this, in order to secure the aid of the
                    Greek emperor against the Saracens, he had agreed to sanction the restoration of
                    Photius to the see of Constantinople, and had withdrawn his consent on finding
                    that he reaped from the concession no substantial benefit. Charles the Fat,
                    partly from unwillingness, partly from natural inability, gave him also no
                    effectual aid, and the last years of John VIII. were spent chiefly in hurling
                    vain anathemas against his various political enemies. According to the authority
                    of Fulda, he was murdered by one of his near relations. His successor was Martin
                    II.</p>
