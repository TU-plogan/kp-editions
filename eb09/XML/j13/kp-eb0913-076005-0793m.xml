                    his admission into the apostolic circle are not stated; according to the Fourth
                    Gospel (vi. 64), his treachery had been foreseen by Jesus from the very first,
                    but this is not suggested by the synoptists. The motives by which he was
                    actuated in rendering to the J ewish authorities the petty and base service of
                    enabling them to arrest his Master without tumult have been analysed by scholars
                    with very various degrees of subtlety and insight. According to some his sole
                    object was to place Jesus in a position in which He should be compelled to make
                    what had seemed to His followers the too tardy display of His Messianic power;
                    according to others (and their view seems the best supported by the narrative of
                    the Gospels) he was simply an avaricious and dishonest man, who felt that his
                    opportunities for petty peculation—as keeper of the common purse, John xii. 6,
                    xiii. 29—were rapidly disappearing. As regards the effects of his subsequent
                    remorse and the use to which his ill-gotten gains were put, the strikingly
                    apparent discrepancies between the narratives of Matt, xxvii. 3-10 and Acts i.
                    18, 19 have continually attracted the attention of Biblical scholars ever since
                    Papias, in his fourth book, of which a fragment has been preserved, discussed
                    the subject; the probability is that they simply represent divergent traditions,
                    one of which has possibly been coloured by the history of Ahithophel. In
                    ecclesiastical legend and in sacred art Judas Iscariot has taken a prominent
                    place, being generally treated as the very incarnation of treachery,
                    ingratitude, and impiety. The Middle Ages, after their fashion, have supplied
                    the lacunae in what they deemed his too meagre biography. According to the
                    common form of their story, he belonged to the tribe.of Reuben<note

                    was destined to murder his father, commit incest with his mother, and sell his
                    God. The attempts made by her and her husband to avert this curse simply led to
                    its accomplishment. At his birth he was enclosed in a chest and flung into the
                    sea; picked up on a foreign shore, he was educated at the court until an act of
                    murder committed in a moment of passion compelled his flight. Coming to Judaea,
                    he entered the service of Pontius Pilate as page, and during this period
                    committed the first two of the crimes which had been expressly foretold.
                    Learning the secret of his birth, he, full of remorse, seeks the prophet who, he
                    has heard, has power on earth to forgive sins. He is accepted as a disciple and
                    promoted to a position of trust, where avarice, the only vice in which he has
                    hitherto been unpractised, gradually takes possession of his soul, and leads to
                    the complete fulfilment of his evil destiny. This Judas legend, as given by
                    Jacobus a Voragine, obtained no small popularity; and it is to be found in
                    various shapes in every important literature of Europe. For the history of its

                    with the Oedipus story. The popular hatred of Judas has found strange symbolical
                    expression in various parts of Christendom. In Corfu, for instance, the people
                    at a given signal on Easter eve throw vast quantities of crockery from their
                    windows and roofs into the streets, and thus execute an imaginary stoning of
                    Judas (see Kirkwall, <hi rend="italic">Ionian Islands,</hi> vol. ii. p. 47). At

                    country villa existed in the island, and that his descendants were to be found
                    among the local Jews. Details in regard to some Judas legends and superstitions
