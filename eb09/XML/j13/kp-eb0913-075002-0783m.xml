                <p><label type="entry">JOSEPH II</label>. (1741-1790), Holy Roman emperor, born in
                    Vienna March 13, 1741, was the son of the emperor Francis I. and Maria Theresa,
                    He was made king of the Romans in 1764; and in 1765 he succeeded his father as
                    Holy Roman emperor. Maria Theresa declared him coregent of her hereditary
                    states, but almost all real power she retained in her own hands. He received
                    full authority only in the regulation of the military system, into which he
                    introduced many changes, following in the main the example of Frederick the
                    Great. Chiefly by his advice Maria Theresa was induced to associate herself with
                    Russia and Prussia in the partition of Poland; and in 1777 he persuaded her to
                    force Turkey to surrender Bukowina. When the younger branch of the house of
                    Wittelsbach died out in 1777, Joseph claimed a large part of its territory; but
                    Frederick the Great resisted his pretensions, and in 1779, after a nominal war,
                    the emperor accepted the treaty of Teschen, by which he obtained only a small
                    concession. Before this time he had sought to prepare himself for his future
                    duties by extensive travels in his own states and in foreign countries; and
                    everywhere he had made a favourable impression by his genial courtesy. In 1769
                    he had visited Frederick the Great, for whom he had at that time a warm
                    admiration; and in the following year Frederick returned the visit, going back
                    to Prussia with the conviction that it would be necessary “to keep his eye on
                    that young man.” On the death of Maria Theresa in 1780, Joseph became sole ruler
                    of the Austrian states. He was penetrated by the characteristic ideas of the
                    18th century as to the duties of an absolute monarch, and began at once to give
                    effect to them in a fearless and almost revolutionary spirit. His first step was
                    to combine the various nationalities subject to him into a single state with
                    thirteen administrative districts. He refused to be crowned king of Hungary, and
                    would not summon the Hungarian diet, insisting that the country should be
                    governed as a province, and causing German to be used as the official language.
                    Among other reforms he proclaimed the abolition of serfdom, substituted various
                    punishments for the capital penalty, established common tribunals, and issued
                    new codes based on the principle that all citizens are equal before the law. He
                    transferred the censorship of books from the clergy to laymen of liberal
                    sympathies, and granted complete freedom to journalism. He instituted public
                    libraries and observatories, founded a medical college in Vienna, a university
                    in Lemberg, and schools for the middle classes in various parts of the monarchy,
                    and encouraged art by offering prizes in connexion with the academy of the
                    plastic arts. Industry and trade he fostered by destroying many monopolies, by
                    aiding in the establishment of new manufactures, by raising Fiume to the
                    position of a free harbour, and by opening the Danube to his subjects from its
                    source to the Black Sea. His ecclesiastical policy was of so bold a character
                    that Pope Pius VI. went to Vienna for the purpose of expostulating with him, but
                    found that the emperor was beyond the range of his influence. The hierarchy was
                    forbidden to correspond with the Roman see without express permission; and papal
                    bulls were subjected to the <hi rend="italic">Placetum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Regium.</hi> In 1781 he issued an edict of toleration, granting freedom of
                    worship to all Protestants and to members of the Greek Church; and between 1782
                    and 1790 about seven hundred monasteries were closed, the members of religious
                    orders being reduced from 63,000 to 27,000. All these changes were well-meant,
                    but the emperor, in the ardour of his philanthropy, shot too far ahead of the
                    prevailing sentiment of his people. Moreover, his good intentions were often
                    rendered fruitless by unskilful or unsympathetic subordinates. In nearly every
                    part of the monarchy discontent soon manifested itself, and some of the
                    inhabitants of Tyrol broke into open rebellion. The Hungarians bitterly resented
                    the suppression of their ancient privileges, and in 1787 the emperor’s new
                    institutions led in several districts to a furious conflict between the
                    peasantry and the nobles. The estates of the Austrian Netherlands persistently
                    opposed the execution of his schemes, the clergy being especially active in
                    stirring up popular indignation; and when, in 1789, he altogether destroyed
                    their constitution, they rebelled and were able for some months to maintain
                    their independence. In Hungary there was so dangerous an agitation that in
                    January 1790 Joseph had to undo almost everything he had attempted to accomplish
                    in that country during the previous nine years; he succeeded only in maintaining
                    the decrees by which he had abolished serfdom and established toleration. Thus
                    his last days were rendered miserable by the conviction that his career had been
                    a failure. He was not more fortunate in his foreign policy than in his home
                    government. Early in his reign, indeed, he gained some advantages over the
                    Dutch, who were obliged to abandon their fortresses on the frontier of the
                    Austrian Netherlands. And when they refused to open the Scheldt, they had to
                    compensate him (in 1785) by a payment of ten million florins. In the same year
                    he renewed his claims on Bavarian territory, but was thwarted by Frederick the
                    Great, who formed his famous league of princes for the <pb break="no"

                    ambition. After the conclusion of the treaty of Teschen, Joseph made it one of
                    the chief objects of his foreign policy to form an enduring alliance between
                    Austria and Russia; and in 1788, in association with Catherine II., he declared
                    war against Turkey. He did not' live to see the end of this war, which brought
                    him little honour. On the 20th of February 1790 he died, deeply disappointed
                    that he had been able to achieve so few of the objects with which he had begun
                    his reign. He was twice married, first to the Princess Marie Louise of Parma,
                    afterwards to the Princess Marie Josephe of Bavaria. His only daughter died in
                    childhood, so that he was succeeded by his brother Leopold II. Notwithstanding
                    the defeat of so many of bis plans, his reign marked an epoch in the history of
                    Austria; and the interest still excited by his name was shown by the enthusiasm
                    with which the people of Austria celebrated in 1880 the centenary of his
                    accession as sole ruler. On the pedestal of his statue in Vienna, erected by
                    Francis I. in 1807, are these words:—“Josepho secundo, qui saluti publicae vixit
                    non diu, sed totus.” (j. si.)</p>
