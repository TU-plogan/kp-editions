                <p><label type="entry">JENGHIZ KHAN</label> (1162-1227) Mongol emperor, was born in
                    a tent on the banks of the river Onon, in 1162. His father Yesukai was absent at
                    the time of his birth, being engaged in a campaign against a Tatar chieftain
                    named Temuchin. In this conflict the fortune of war favoured the side of
                    Yesukai, who having slain his enemy returned to his encampment in triumph. Here
                    he was met by the news that his wife Yulun had given birth to a son. On
                    examining the child he observed in its clenched fist a clot of coagulated blood
                    like a red stone. In the eyes of the superstitious Mongol this circumstance took
                    the shape of a mysterious reference to his victory over the Tatar chieftain, and
                    he therefore named the infant Temuchin. The death of Yesukai, which placed
                    Temuchin, who was then only thirteen years old, on the Mongol throne, was the
                    signal also for the dispersal of several tribes whose allegiance the old
                    chieftain had retained by the exercise of an iron rule. When remonstrated with
                    by Temuchin on their desertion of his banner, the rebels replied: “The deepest
                    wells are sometimes dry, and the hardest stone is sometimes broken; why should
                    we cling to thee!” But Yulun was by no means willing thus to see her son’s power
                    melt away, and seizing the national standard she led those retainers who
                    remained faithful against the deserters, and succeeded in bringing back fully
                    one half to their allegiance. With this doubtful material for the maintenance of
                    his chieftainship, Temuchin succeeded in holding his ground against the
                    insidious plots and open hostilities of the neighbouring tribes, more especially
                    of the Naimans, Keraιts, and Merkits. With one or other of these he maintained
                    an almost unceasing warfare until the year 1206, when his power was so firmly
                    established that he felt the time had arrived when he might proclaim himself the
                    ruler of an empire. He therefore summoned the notables of his kingdom to an
                    assembly on the banks of the Onon, and at their unanimous request adopted the
                    name and title of Jenghiz Khan (Chinese <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n648/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0913-0648-0621"/> Ching-sze, or “perfect warrior ”). At this
                    time there remained to him but one open enemy on the Mongolian steppes, namely,
                    Polo the Naiman khan. Against this chief he now led his troops, and in one
                    battle so completely shattered his forces that Kushlek, the successor of Polo,
                    who was left dead upon the field, fled with his ally Toto, the Merkit khan, to
                    the river Irtish. Having thus further consolidated his sovereignty, Jenghiz Khan
                    now meditated an invasion of the empire of the Kin-Tatars, who had wrested
                    northern China from the emperors of the Sung dynasty. As a first step in this
                    programme he invaded western Hea, and, having captured several strongholds,
                    retired in the summer of 1208 to Lung-ting to escape the great heat of the
                    plains. While there news reached him that Toto and Kushlek, the Merkit and
                    Naiman khans, were preparing for war. He thereupon at once marched against them,
                    and in a pitched battle on the river Irtish overthrew them completely. Toto was
                    amongst the slain, and Kushlek fled for refuge to the Khitan Tatars. Satisfied
                    with his victory, Jenghiz again directed his forces against Hea. There also good
                    fortune attended him, and, after having defeated the Kin army under the
                    leadership of a son of the sovereign, he captured the Wu-leang-hai Pass in the
                    Great Wall, and penetrated as far as Ning-hea Fu in Kansuh. With unceasing
                    vigour he pushed on his troops into the country, and even established his sway
                    over the province of Leaou-tung. The saying that nothing succeeds like success
                    was eminently true in his case. Several of the Kin commanders, seeing how
                    persistently victory attended his banners, deserted to him, and garrisons
                    surrendered at his bidding. Having thus secured a firm footing within the Great
                    Wall, he despatched three armies in the autumn of 1213 to overrun the empire.
                    The right wing, under the command of his three sons Juji, Jagatai, and Oghotai,
                    marched towards the south; the left wing under his brothers Hochar, Kwang-tsin
                    Noyen, and Chow-tse-te-po-shi, advanced eastward towards the sea; while Jenghiz
                    and his son Tulé with the centre directed their course in a south-easterly
                    direction. Complete success attended all three expeditions. The right wing
                    advanced as far as Honan, and after having captured upwards of twenty-eight
                    cities rejoined headquarters by the great western road. Hochar made himself
                    master of the country as far as Leaou-se; and Jenghiz ceased his triumphal
                    career only when he reached the cliffs of the Shan-tung promontory. But either
                    because he was weary of the strife, or because it was necessary to gain a
                    respite that he might revisit his Mongolian empire, he sent an envoy to the Kin
                    emperor in the spring of the following year (1214), saying, “All your
                    possessions in Shan-tung and the whole country north of the Yellow river are now
                    mine with the solitary exception of Yenking (the modern Peking). By the decree
                    of heaven you are now as weak as I am strong, but I am willing to retire from my
                    conquests; as a condition of my doing so, however, it will be necessary that you
                    distribute largess to my officers and men to appease their fierce hostility.”
                    These terms of safety the Kin emperor eagerly accepted, and as a peace offering
                    he presented Jenghiz with a daughter of the late emperor, another princess of
                    the imperial house, 500 youths and maidens, and 3000 horses. No sooner, however,
                    had Jenghiz passed beyond the Great Wall than the Kin emperor, fearing to remain
                    any longer so near the Mongol frontier, moved his court to Kai-fung Fu in Honan.
                    This transfer of capital appearing to Jenghiz to indicate a hostile attitude, he
                    again turned southward and once more marched his troops into the doomed
                    empire.</p>
                <p>While Jenghiz was thus adding city to city and province to province in China,
                    Kushlek, the fugitive Naiman chief, was not idle. With characteristic treachery
                    he requested permission from his host, the Khitan khan, to collect the fragments
                    of his army which had been scattered by Jenghiz at the battle on the Irtish, and
                    thus having collected a considerable force he leagued himself with Muhammed, the
                    shah of Khuarezm, against the confiding khan. After a short but decisive
                    campaign the allies remained masters of the position, and the khan was compelled
                    to abdicate the throne in favour of his late guest.</p>
                <p>With the power and prestige thus acquired, Kushlek' prepared once again to
                    measure swords with the Mongol chief. On receiving the news of his hostile
                    preparations, Jenghiz at once took the field, and in the first battle routed the
                    Naiman troops and made Kushlek a prisoner. A short shrift was given to the
                    treacherous Naiman, and his ill-gotten kingdom became an apanage of the Mongol
                    empire. Jenghiz now held sway up to the Khuarezm frontier. Beyond this he had no
                    immediate desire tb go, and he therefore sent envoys to Muhammed, the shah, with
                    presents, saying, “I send thee greeting; I know thy power and the vast extent of
                    thine empire; I regard thee as my ' most cherished son. On my part thou must
                    know that I have conquered China and all the Turkish nations north of it; thou
                    knowest that my country is a magazine of warriors, a mine of silver, and that I
                    have no need of other lands. I take it that we have an equal interest in
                    encouraging trade between our subjects.” This peaceful message was well received
                    by the shah, and in all probability the Mongol armies would never have appeared
                    in Europe but for an unfortunate occurrence which turned Jenghiz’s friendly
                    overtures into a declaration of war. Shortly after the despatch of this first
                    mission Jenghiz sent a party of traders into Transoxiana who were seized and put
                    to death as spies by Inaljuk, the governor of Otrar. As satisfaction for this
                    outrage Jenghiz demanded the extradition of the offending governor. Far from
                    yielding to this summons, however, Muhammed beheaded the chief of the Mongol
                    envoys, and sent the others back without their beards. This insult made war
                    inevitable, and in the spring of 1219 Jenghiz set out from Karakoram on a
                    campaign which was destined to be as startling in its immediate results as its
                    ulterior effects were far reaching. The invading force was in the first instance
                    divided into two armies: one commanded by Jenghiz’s second son Jagatai was
                    directed to march against the Kankalis, the northern defenders of the Khuarezm
                    empire; and the other, led by Juji, his eldest son, advanced by way of Sighnak
                    against Jend. Against this latter force Muhammed led an army of 400,000 men, who
                    after a bloody battle with the invaders were completely routed, leaving it is
                    said 160,000 dead upon the field. With the remnant of his host Muhammed fled to
                    Samarkand. Meanwhile Jagatai marched down upon the Jaxartes by the pass of Taras
                    and invested Otrar, the offending city. After a siege of five months the citadel
                    was taken by assault, and Inaljuk and his followers were put to the sword. To
                    mark their sense of the crime of which it had been the scene, the conquerors
                    levelled the walls with the ground, after having given the city over to pillage.
                    At the same time a third army besieged and took Khogend on the Jaxartes; and yet
                    a fourth, led by Jenghiz and his youngest son Tulé, advanced in the direction of
                    Bokhara. Tashkend and N ur surrendered on their approach, and after a short
                    siege Bokhara fell into their hands. On entering the town Jenghiz ascended the
                    steps of the principal mosque, and shouted to his followers, “The hay is cut;
                    give your horses fodder.” No second invitation to plunder was needed; the city
                    was sacked, and the inhabitants either escaped beyond the walls or were
                    compelled to submit to infamies which were worse than death. As a final act of
                    vengeance the town was fired, and before the last of the Mongols left the
                    district, the great mosque and <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n649/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0913-0649-0622"/> certain palaces were the only buildings left
                    to mark the spot where the “centre of science” once stood. From the ruins of
                    Bokhara Jenghiz advanced along the valley of the Sogd to Samarkand, which,
                    weakened by treachery, surrendered to him, as did also Balkh. But in neither
                    case did submission save either the inhabitants from slaughter or the city from
                    pillage. Beyond this point Jenghiz went no further westward, but sent Tulé, at
                    the head of 70,000 men, to ravage Khorassan, and two flying columns under Chépé
                    and Sabutai Bahadar to pursue after Muhammed, who had taken refuge in Nishapoor.
                    Defeated and almost alone, Muhammed fled before his pursuers to the village of
                    Astara on the shore of the Caspian Sea, where he died of an attack of pleurisy,
                    leaving the cause of his empire to his son Jalâluddîn. Meanwhile Tulé carried
                    his arms into the fertile province of Khorassan, and after having captured Nessa
                    by assault appeared before Merv. By an act of atrocious treachery the Mongols
                    gained possession of the city, and, after their manner, sacked and burnt the
                    town. From Merv Tulé marched upon Nishapoor, where he met with a most determined
                    resistance. For four days the garrison fought desperately on the walls and in
                    the streets, but at length they were overpowered, and, with the exception of 400
                    artisans who were sent into Mongolia, every man, woman, and child was slain.
                    Herat escaped the fate which had overtaken Merv and Nishapoor by opening its
                    gates to the Mongols. At this point of his victorious career Tulé received an
                    order to join Jenghiz before Talikhan in Badakshan, where that chieftain was
                    preparing to renew his pursuit of Jalâluddîn, after a check he sustained in an
                    engagement fought before Ghazni. As soon as sufficient reinforcements arrived
                    Jenghiz advanced against Jalâluddîn, who had taken up a position on the banks of
                    the Indus. Here a desperate battle was fought. The Turks, though far
                    outnumbered, defended their ground with undaunted courage, until, beaten at all
                    points, they fled in confusion. Jalâluddîn, seeing that all was lost, mounted a
                    fresh horse and jumped into the river, which flowed 20 feet below. With admiring
                    gaze Jenghiz watched the desperate venture of his enemy, and even saw without
                    regret the dripping horseman mount the opposite bank. From the Indus Jenghiz
                    sent in pursuit of Jalâluddîn, who fled to Delhi, but failing to capture the
                    fugitive the Mongols returned to Ghazni after having ravaged the provinces of
                    Lahore, Peshawur, and Melikpoor. At this moment news reached Jenghiz that the
                    inhabitants of Herat had deposed the governor whom Tulé had appointed over the
                    city, and had placed one of their own choice in his room. To punish this act of
                    rebellion Jenghiz sent an army of 80,000 men against the offending city, which
                    after a siege of six months was taken by assault. For a whole week the Mongols
                    ceased not to kill, burn, and destroy, and 1,600,000 persons are said to have
                    been massacred within the walls. Having consummated this act of vengeance,
                    Jenghiz returned to Mongolia by way of Balkh, Bokhara, and Samarkand.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Chépé and Sabutai marched through Azerbijan, and in the spring of 1222
                    advanced into Georgia. Here they defeated a combined force of Lesghs,
                    Circassians, and Kipchaks, and after taking Astrakhan followed the retreating
                    Kipchaks to the Don. The news of the approach of the mysterious enemy of whose
                    name even they were ignorant was received by the Russian princes at Kief with
                    dismay. At the instigation, however, of Mitislaf, prince of Galicia, they
                    assembled an opposing force on the Dnieper. Here they received envoys from the
                    Mongol camp, whom they barbarously put to death. “You have killed our envoys,”
                    was the answer made by the Mongols; “well, as you wish for war you shall have
                    it. We have done you no harm. God is impartial; He will decide our quarrel.” If
                    the arbitrament was to be thus decided, the Russians must have been grievously
                    in the wrong. In the first battle, on the river Kaleza, they were utterly
                    routed, and fled before the invaders, who after ravaging Great Bulgaria retired,
                    gorged with booty, through the country of Saksin, along the river Aktuba, on
                    their way to Mongolia.</p>
                <p>In China the same success had attended the Mongol arms as in western Asia. The
                    whole of the country north of the Yellow river, with the exception of one or two
                    cities, was added to the Mongol rule, and, on the death of the Kin emperor Seuen
                    Tsung in 1223, the Kin empire virtually ceased to be, and Jenghiz’s frontiers
                    thus became conterminous with those of the Sung emperors who held sway over the
                    whole of central and southern China. After his return from central Asia, Jenghiz
                    once more took the field in western China. ΛVhiIe on this campaign the five
                    planets appeared in a certain conjunction which to the superstitiously minded
                    Mongol chief foretold that evil was awaiting him. With this presentiment
                    strongly impressed upon him he turned his face homewards, and had advanced no
                    farther than the Se-Keang river in Kansuh when he was seized with an illness of
                    which he died a short time afterwards (1227) at his travelling palace at
                    Ha-laou-tu, on the banks of the river Sale in Mongolia. By the terms of his will
                    Oghotai was appointed his successor, but so essential was it considered to be
                    that his death should remain a secret until Oghotai was proclaimed that, as the
                    funeral procession moved northwards to the great ordu on the banks of the
                    Kerulon, the escort killed every one they met. The body was then carried
                    successively to the ordus of his several wives, and was finally laid to rest in
                    the valley of Keleen.</p>
                <p>Thus ended the career of one of the greatest conquerors the world has ever seen.
                    Born and nurtured as the chief of a petty Mongolian tribe, he lived to see his
                    armies victorious from the China Sea to the banks of the Dnieper; and, though
                    the empire which he created ultimately dwindled away under the hands of his
                    degenerate descendants, leaving not a wrack behind, we have in the presence of
                    the Turks in Europe a consequence of his rule, since it was the advance of his
                    armies which drove their Osmanli ancestors from their original home in northern
                    Asia, and thus led to their invasion of Bithynia under Othman, and finally their
                    advance into Europe under Amurath I.</p>
