                    Dijon his compositions attracted the attention of an inspector who had him
                    placed (1814) in the Normal School, Paris. He there came under the influence of
                    Cousin, and in 1817 he was appointed assistant professor of philosophy at the
                    Normal and Bourbon schools. Three years later, being thrown upon his own
                    resources, he began a course of lectures in' his own house, and formed literary
                    connexions with <hi rend="italic">Le Courrier Français, Le Globe, H Encyclopédie
                    Moderne,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">La Revue Européenne.</hi> The variety of his
                    pursuits at this time carried him over the whole field of ancient and modern
                    literature. But he was chiefly attracted to the philosophical system represented
                    by Reid and Stewart. The application of “common sense” to the problem of
                    substance supplied a more satisfactory analytic for him than the scepticism of
                    Hume which reached him through a study of Kant. He thus threw in his lot with
                    the Scotch philosophy, and his first dissertations are, in their leading
                    position, adaptations from <hi rend="italic">The Inquiry.</hi> His tendency
                    towards eclecticism makes his philosophical position undefinable, but his limpid
                    style and capacity for generalizing historical movements are as distinct in his
                    earlier as in his later works. In 1826 he wrote a preface to a translation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Moral Philosophy</hi> of Stewart, demonstrating the
                    possibility of a scientific statement of the laws of consciousness; in 1828 he
                    began a translation of the works of Reid, and in his preface estimated the
                    influence of Scotch criticism upon philosophy, giving a biographical account of
                    the movement from Hutcheson onwards. In the same year he assisted Milon in
                    ancient philosophy at the Faculty of Letters, and, while carrying on a course
                    upon recent philosophy, he returned to the Normal School in 1830. Next year he
                    was returned to parliament by the arrondissement of Pontarlier; but the work of
                    legislation was ill-suited to his powers. Swift, practical decisions on
                    questions demanding immediate settlement were repugnant to his habits of mind.
                    He tried to introduce a reform in the manner of considering petitions,—his sole
                    suggestion of any weight during the years of his representation; though he
                    frequently spoke, he never gained any real influence. Yet he attended to his
                    parliamentary duties conscientiously, and ultimately broke his health in their
                    discharge. In 1833 he was appointed professor of Greek and Roman philosophy at
                    the college of France and a member of the Academy of Sciences; he then published
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mélanges Philosophiques,</hi> a collection of fugitive
                    papers in criticism and philosophy and history. In them is foreshadowed all that
                    he afterwards worked out in metaphysics, psychology, ethics, and aesthetics. He
                    had already demonstrated in his prefaces the possibility of a psychology apart
                    from physiology, of the science of the phenomena of consciousness distinct from
                    the perceptions of sense. He now classified the mental faculties, premising that
                    they must not be confounded with capacities or properties of mind. They were,
                    according to his analysis, personal will, primitive instincts, voluntary
                    movement, natural and artificial signs, sensibility and the faculties of
                    intellect; on this analytic he founded his scheme of the universe. In 1835 he
                    published a <hi rend="italic">Cours de Droit</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturel,</hi>
                    which, for precision of statement and logical coherence, is the most important
                    of his works. Starting from the conception of a universal order in the universe,
                    he reasons from it to a Supreme Being, who has created it and who has conferred
                    upon every man in harmony with it the aim of his existence, leading to his
                    highest good. As to the nature of good and evil, how is it to be judged? The
                    good, he says, is the fulfilment of man’s destiny, the evil the thwarting of it.
                    Every man being organized in a particular way has, of necessity, an aim, the
                    fulfilment of which is good; and he has faculties for accomplishing it, directed
                    by reason. The aim is only good, however, when reason guides it for the benefit
                    of the majority, but that is not absolute good. When reason rises to the
                    conception of universal order, when actions are submitted, by the exercise of a
                    sympathy working necessarily and intuitively, to the idea of the universal
                    order, the good has been reached, the true good, good in itself, absolute good.
                    But he does not follow his idea into the details of human duty, though he passes
                    in review fatalism, mysticism, pantheism, scepticism, egotism, sentimentalism,
                    and rationalism. In 1835 his health failed and he went to Italy, where he
                    continued to translate the Scotch philosophers. On his return he became
                    librarian to the university, and took the chair of recent philosophy at the
                    Faculty of Letters. He died in Paris, 4th February 1842. After his death were
                    published <hi rend="italic">Nouveaux Mélanges Philosophiques</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cours cl</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Esthétique.</hi> The former
                    contributed nothing new to the system except a more emphatic statement of the
                    distinction between psychology and physiology. The latter formulated his theory
                    of beauty. The beautiful, by his analysis, is that which aesthetically pleases,
                    without consideration of interest. Utility being defined as the satisfaction of
                    human wants, the beautiful may be useless. Order and proportion he takes to be
                    the components of beauty,— an order and proportion not leading to the useful,
                    but giving pleasure without consideration of the end. Unity and variety are the
                    conditions of beauty; it demands their coexistence, the former for the
                    satisfaction of sensibility, the latter of intelligence. Jouffroy’s claim to
                    distinction rests upon his ability as an expositor of other men’s ideas. He
                    founded no system; he contributed nothing of importance to philosophical
                    science; he initiated nothing which has survived him. But his enthusiasm for
                    mental science, and his command over the language of popular exposition<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n788/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0788-0755"/>, made him a great, international medium for the
                    transfusion of ideas. He stood between Scotland and France and Germany and
                    France; and, though his expositions are vitiated by loose reading of the
                    philosophers he interpreted, he did serviceable, even memorable work.</p>
