                    daughters were both preferred to Joséphine, her father carried her to Havre in
                    1779, she being already described to her aunt and the Beauharnais as possessing
                    a fine complexion, beautiful arms and eyes, and with a sweet voice and a
                    remarkable taste for music—altogether “très-avancée et formée pour son âge.” On
                    the 13th of December she was married to the Vicomte Alexandre Beauharnais at
                    Noisy-le-Grand. Her son Eugène was born at a time when her relations with her
                    husband were embittered by jealousy; and after the birth of her daughter
                    Hortense-Eugénie he sought a separation, but, though he carried his request to
                    the parliament, his petition was dismissed. Joséphine went back to her parents
                    in June 1788, and was with them when the Revolution broke out. At the request of
                    the vicomte she returned, however, to France in 1790. He was then a member of
                    the constituent assembly, receiving at his house the chiefs of the
                    constitutional party; and Joséphine was admired by all of them for her dignity,
                    simplicity, and sweetness. As the crisis became more acute, her husband thought
                    it prudent to withdraw to Ferté-Beauharnais, in Sologne, where he left his
                    family when he went to command the army of the Rhine. After his execution by
                    order of the Convention, Joséphine was reduced to great straits, and not till
                    the end of 1795 did regular remittances from Martinique begin again. She was
                    living in the Rue Chautereine, Paris, in a house of her own, when she paid her
                    first visit ta Napoleon, to thank him for restoring the sword of her husband.
                    She was in the full flower of her womanhood; Napoleon was at once drawn to her;
                    on the 9th of March 1796 they were married. In twelve days he left her to take
                    command of the army in Italy; but in J une, at his earnest request, she joined
                    him at Milan and went on to Brescia. After the peace of Léoben they lived at
                    Montebello near Milan, and Joséphine was for some time the queen of a court
                    frequented by great officers and diplomatists. Having visited Rome, she went
                    back to Paris, and at her house assembled the most distinguished men of the day.
                    During the expedition to Egypt she moved between the capital and Plombières; but
                    she had her first quarrel with Napoleon on his return, because, by an oversight,
                    she omitted meeting him. Social duties of the most brilliant and difficult sort
                    began to accumulate round her during the consulate. At the palace of the
                    Luxembourg and the Tuileries her drawing-room was again the centre of attraction
                    in Paris; her receptions were ruled by the old traditions of regal ceremony, and
                    there was an endless round of fetes, entertainments, and plays. Her beauty and
                    amiability won upon everybody; and when she wanted rest she retired to
                    Malmaison, a country seat she had bought, and amused herself with a variety of
                    light studies in botany and natural history. Rumours now began to reach her that
                    Napoleon, in despair of offspring, meant to sue for a divorce. She had long
                    known that his relatives were trying to undermine her position; and even when
                    she knelt beside him at Notre Dame, and received ’the triple unction at the
                    ceremony which crowned her empress, she knew it to be a concession wrung from
                    him. After the coronation he gave her less and less of his society. It was not,
                    however, until the winter of 1809 that he deliberately proposed to dissolve the
                    connexion. He divorced her with much show of tenderness, and she retired to
                    Malmaison with an annual grant of two million francs for her establishment. Her
                    affection for Napoleon, and her anxiety for his success, remained strong to the
                    hour of her death, on May 24, 1814; and but for his inordinate ambition he would
                    never have sought to live apart from her. She often provoked him by a certain
                    mild duplicity in her character; she was extravagant and superstitious; yet, to
                    fulfil the high destiny to which she was called, she brought much gentleness,
                    courage, and sweetness, qualities which carried her through her reverses with
                    admirable dignity.</p>
