                    been disputed whether the name was written originally d’Arc or Darc. It is
                    beyond doubt that the father of Joan was not of noble origin, but Bouteiller

                    Jacques Darc, peasant proprietor of Domremy, a small village partly in Champagne
                    and partly in Lorraine, and of his wife Isabeau de Vouthon, who from having made
                    a pilgrimage to Rome had received the usual surname of Romée. Joan never learned
                    to read or write, and received her sole religious instruction from her mother,
                    who taught her to recite the Pater Noster, Ave Maria, and Credo. In her
                    childhood she was noted for her abounding physical energy; but her vivacity, so
                    far from being tainted by any coarse or unfeminine trait, was the direct outcome
                    of intense mental activity and an abnormally sensitive nervous temperament.
                    Towards her parents her conduct was uniformly exemplary, and the charm of her
                    unselfish kindness made her the special favourite of many in the village. In all
                    household work she was specially proficient, her skill in the use of the needle
                    not being excelled by that of any matron even of Rouen. As she grew to womanhood
                    she became inclined to silence, and spent much of her time in solitude and
                    prayer. All advances made by the young men of her acquaintance with the view of
                    winning her attention or favour she decisively repelled; and, while active in
                    the performance of her usual round of duties, and apparently finding her mode of
                    life quite pleasant and congenial, inwardly she was engrossed with thoughts
                    reaching far beyond the circle uf her daily concerns.</p>
                <p>At this time, through the alliance and support of Philip of Burgundy, the English
                    had extended their conquest over the whole of France north of the Loire as well
                    as Guienne; and, while the infant Henry VI. of England had in 1422 been
                    proclaimed king of France at his father’s grave at St Denis, Charles the
                    dauphin, devoted only to present ease and pleasure, was almost passively
                    contemplating the slow dismemberment of his kingdom by internal confusion and
                    misery, and by the progressive encroachments of the English rule. The fact that
                    the hard straits to which the kingdom was reduced were greatly owing to the
                    conduct of Isabella, the dauphin’s mother, who disinherited her son <pb

                    her daughter Catherine, supplied an opportunity for the fulfilment of the
                    ancient prophecy of the enchanter Merlin, that the calamities which should fall
                    upon France through the depravity of a woman would be removed by the
                    instrumentality of a chaste virgin. To the imagination of the time there was,
                    moreover, nothing strange in such a mode of deliverance, for it was no uncommon
                    occurrence for damsels to accompany their lovers to the wars, and, disguised as
                    pages, to share to some extent in their dangers and adventures. In the country
                    of Joan the tradition was current that this virgin should come out of the forest
                    of Domremy, where Joan was accustomed in her childhood to tend her father’s
                    sheep. How it therefore became fixed in her mind that she was the destined
                    deliverer of her country there is little difficulty in understanding. She
                    possessed a nature strongly sympathetic, and it was kindled to ardent patriotism
                    by the sad condition of her country; her imagination was so overpower-ingly
                    vivid that it frequently deceived her reason; and her consciousness of
                    endowments which could find no proper scope for their activity within her narrow
                    sphere must have confirmed if they did not originate her prognostications that
                    she was appointed to some high destiny. Gradually her whole attention became so
                    engrossed with her country’s wrongs that all her waking hours were one continued
                    and prolonged prayer for its deliverance. The result was that, owing to a
                    peculiarity in her nervous constitution, her own thoughts and hopes seemed to
                    take audible voice, and returned to her as assurances and commands spoken to her
                    by the saints. At last, when in 1428 Orleans, the key to the south of France,
                    was invested by the English under the earl of Salisbury, the voices became so
                    peremptory and urgent as to overcome all pretexts for delay on account of
                    previous discouragements and rebuffs. Notwithstanding the strong remonstrances
                    of her parents, who viewed her resolve with poignant grief and dismay, she now
                    renewed with increased determination her efforts to win from Robert de
                    Baudricourt, governor of Vaucou-Ieurs, an introduction to the dauphin Charles.
                    In all her subsequent acts she professed to be guided by the voices of the
                    saints, who had set before her the twofold task of relieving Orleans and
                    crowning the young dauphin at Rheims. By persistent importunity, the effect of
                    which was increased by the simplicity of her demeanour and her calm assurance of
                    success, she at last prevailed on the governor to grant her request; and in
                    February 1429, accompanied by two knights, she set out on her perilous journey
                    to the court of the dauphin at Chinon. At first Charles refused to see her, but
                    the rising tide of popular feeling in her favour induced his advisers to
                    persuade him after three days to grant her an interview. Of the divinity of her
                    commission she is said to have persuaded him by discovering him though disguised
                    in the crowd of his courtiers, and by assuring him regarding his secret doubts
                    as to his legitimacy. Accordingly, after a commission of doctors had reported
                    that they had found in her nothing of evil or contrary to the Catholic faith,
                    and a council of matrons had reported on her chastity and virginity, she was
                    permitted to set forth with an army of 4000 or 5000 men designed for the relief
                    of Orleans. At the head of the army she rode clothed in a coat of mail, armed
                    with an ancient sword which she had divined to be hidden near the altar of St
                    Catherine de Fierbois, and carrying a white standard of her own design
                    embroidered with lilies and having on the one side the image of God seated on
                    the clouds and holding the world in his hand, and on the other a representation
                    of the annunciation. Joan was of medium height, stoutly built, but finely
                    proportioned; and her frame was capable of enduring great fatigue.
                    Notwithstanding subsequent traditions, she does not appear to have been
                    strikingly handsome. Conventional beauty of the highest type could not be
                    expected in one accustomed to her mode of life, but the most authentic
                    testimonies represent her as less comely than many in her own station. Her
                    features were, moreover, expressive rather of rustic honesty and innocence than
                    of mental power, although she is said to have possessed grand melancholy eyes
                    which, probably on account of the high and noble purpose which animated them,
                    exercised an indescribable charm.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of great sweetness, and her manner possessed a fine natural dignity and grace,
                    which, while it repelled familiarity, softened and subdued even the rudest of
                    the soldiers. Nominally she had been entrusted with the command of the army, but
                    in reality it was under the direction of experienced generals; and it cannot be
                    pretended that the victories accomplished in consequence of her co-operation
                    were the result of brilliant military genius. Indeed, the blind obstinacy with
                    which in the face of overwhelming odds she refused to acknowledge defeat place
                    it beyond doubt that she was unable to estimate the elements of success in
                    battle, and was actuated throughout by a fatalistic persuasion that victory was
                    inevitable if she persevered unflinchingly in her efforts to obtain it. At the
                    same time she possessed a shrewd and penetrating judgment both as to men and
                    things, and the manner in which she conducted herself amid the varied
                    difficulties of her career indicated extraordinary force of character and high
                    and noble prudence. What, however, she chiefly supplied to the French cause was
                    concentrated energy and resolution. Above all, she inspired the soldiery with a
                    fanatic enthusiasm armed with the sanctions and ennobled by the influences of
                    religion; and she overawed the enemy by the superstitious fear that she was in
                    league with supernatural powers.</p>
                <p>By a remarkable stroke of good luck Joan succeeded in entering Orleans on the
                    29th April 1429, and through the vigorous and unremitting attacks of the French
                    the English gradually became so discouraged that on the 8th of May they raised
                    the siege. By the capture of Jargeau and Beaugency, followed by the great
                    victory of Patay, where Talbot was taken prisoner, the English were driven
                    beyond the Loire. With some difficulty the king was then persuaded to set out
                    towards Rheims, which he entered with an army of 12,000 men on July 16th, Troyes
                    having on the way been taken by assault at the sole instigation of the Maid. On
                    the following day, holding the sacred banner, she stood next to Charles at his
                    coronation in the cathedral. After an endeavour to detach Burgundy from the
                    English cause, the king at last agreed to attempt the capture of Paris, but on
                    account of the disastrous result of an attack made on the 8th September, in
                    which Joan was wounded, he resolved, notwithstanding her passionate
                    remonstrance, to withdraw from the city, and disbanded his troops. Joan went
                    into Normandy to assist the duke of Alençon, but in December returned to the
                    court, and on the 29th she and her family were ennobled with the surname of du
                    Lis. Unconsoled by such honours, she rode away from the court in March, to
                    assist in the defence of Compiègne against the duke of Burgundy; and on the 24th
                    May she led an unsuccessful sortie against the besiegers, when on account of her
                    determination to fight to the last she was surrounded and taken prisoner.
                    Charles, partly perhaps on account of his natural indolence, partly on account
                    of the intrigues at the court, made no effort to effect her ransom, and never
                    showed any sign of interest in her fate. Probably he had found her so difficult
                    to <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n730/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0730-0697"/> manage and control that he as well as his
                    generals regarded her presence with the army as more embarrassing than helpful;
                    and doubtless her capture dissipated the halo of supernatural power that had
                    surrounded her. By means of negotiations instigated and prosecuted with great
                    perseverance by the university of Paris and the Inquisition, and through the
                    persistent scheming of Pierre Cauchon, the ejected bishop of Beauvais, she was
                    sold in November by Luxembourg and Burgundy to the English, who on January 3,
                    1431, at the instance of the university of Paris, delivered her over to the
                    Inquisition for trial. After a public examination, begun on the 9th January and
                    lasting six days, and another conducted in the prison, she was, on the 20th
                    March, publicly accused as a heretic and sorcerer, and, being in the end found
                    guilty, she made her submission at the scaffold on the 24th May, and received
                    pardon. She was still, however, the prisoner of the English, and, having been
                    induced by those who had her in charge to resume her male clothes, she was on
                    this account judged to have relapsed, was sentenced to death, and burned at the
                    stake on the streets of Rouen, May 30,1431. The sentence was revoked by the pope
                    on the 7th July 1456, and since then it has been the custom of Catholic writers
                    to uphold the reality of her divine inspiration. In 1436 an impostor appeared,
                    professing to be Joan of Arc escaped from the flames, who succeeding in inducing
                    many people to believe in her statement, but afterwards confessed her
                    imposture.</p>
                <p>There is no doubt that Joan herself believed in her supernatural guidance, and
                    her judges, notwithstanding all their efforts, were unable to bring to light the
                    smallest semblance of a sign of conscious dishonesty on her part. At the same
                    time the nobility of her purpose was unstained by the faintest symptom of
                    selfish regard to her own fame and glorification. Indeed the greatness of her
                    career did not consist in her military achievements, but in her pure, true, and
                    ardent character, which made her a pathetic victim to the mean and grovelling
                    aims of those in whose cause she fought with such simple sincerity of faith, and
                    to the cruelties of a superstitious age.</p>

                <p>The earliest life by other than contemporaries is that in Latin by Jean Hordal,
                    1612. Edmond Richer, who had procured the original documents of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Procès,</hi> finished a life of Joan in 1628 which was never
                    published, but of which Lenglet-Dufresnoy made use to correct his own work,
                    published in 1754 in two volumes. Charles du Lys, a descendant of her kin,
                    published <hi rend="italic">D’</hi><hi rend="italic">l'extraction et parenté de

                    were republished by Vallet de Viriville in <hi rend="italic">Trésor des pièces
                    rares et anciennes,</hi> 1856. In 1790 L’Averdy published an analysis of the
                    manuscript of the <hi rend="italic">Procès</hi> in the 3d vol. of <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> of the Academy or Inscriptions. The principal other
                    works previous to the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Procès</hi> are those

                    1880. Of the numerous dramas and poems of which Joan of Arc has been the

                    the scandalous burlesque-epic of Voltaire. A drama in verse by Jules Barbier has
