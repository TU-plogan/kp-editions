                <p><label type="entry">JAMES II</label>. (1633-1701), king of England, and as king
                    of Scotland James VII., second surviving son of Charles I. and Henrietta Maria,
                    was born at the palace of St James’s, October 15, 1633, and was created duke of
                    York in January 1643. During the civil war he was taken prisoner by Fairfax at
                    Oxford in 1646, but in 1648 he made his escape to Holland. After the second
                    failure of the Stuart cause he served for some time in the French army under
                    Turenne, but at the command of his brother he in 1656 accepted a military
                    commission from Spain. At the Restoration in 1660 he was appointed lord high
                    admiral and lord warden of the Cinque Ports. For the management of the civil
                    administration of the navy he had the qualification of industry and careful
                    regard to details; and if his victory over the Dutch in 1665 was principally a
                    happy stroke of good luck, and his drawn battle with De Ruyter in 1672 was more
                    to his antagonist’s credit than to his, still the fact that his career as an
                    admiral was free from disaster shows that his seamanship must have been at least
                    respectable. Outside, however, the sphere of practical routine, James was blind
                    and insensate, and his whole political conduct—while it indicated that he could
                    stoop to compromise and deception when he deemed these necessary—was marked by a
                    heedlessness and perverse obstinacy possible only to a rigid and contracted
                    understanding preoccupied with a single purpose. He possessed the vices of his
                    race without its virtues and redeeming points, and in him the propensity to
                    despotism developed itself in a form unmitigated by any mildness or amiable
                    weakness of temper, unenlightened by any gift of foresight or practical wisdom,
                    and unadorned by any personal accomplishment. Although at the Restoration his
                    sympathies were so little Catholic that he supported the policy of Clarendon,
                    whose daughter Anne he secretly married in September 1660, publicly
                    acknowledging the union in the December following, he soon thereafter became a
                    convert to Romanism, and in 1672, in opposition to the expostulations of his
                    brother, openly avowed his change of faith. Anne Hyde having died in 1671, he
                    also persuaded his brother to defy the wishes of both Houses of Parliament by
                    permitting him in 1673 to marry the Catholic princess Mary of Modena. On account
                    of the Test Act, passed in this year, he had been compelled to resign his office
                    of admiral, and, although the marriage in 1677 of his daughter Mary to William,
                    prince of Orange, somewhat allayed the distrust with which he was regarded, it
                    was deemed advisable on the discovery of the Popish plot in 1679 that he should
                    retire for a time to Brussels. Afterwards he was appointed lord high
                    commissioner to Scotland, where his arbitrary bigotry found congenial employment
                    in the persecution of the Covenanters; but in 1684 Charles ventured to dispense
                    in his case with the Test Act, and restored him to his office of admiral.</p>
                <p>The influence of the loyal enthusiasm which surrounded the last days of Charles
                    in 1685 was felt in the calm acquiescence with which the nation witnessed
                    James’s succession to the throne on February 6, and his coronation on April
                    23,1686. The trust awakened by his promise to preserve the Government both in
                    church and state as by law established was indeed almost immediately rudely
                    shaken by his public celebration of mass, by his prohibition of preaching
                    against Catholicism, and by his appointment of Catholic officers to the army;
                    but that the goodwill at <pb break="no"

                    manifested by the grant of a revenue of two millions, and by the enactment of
                    severer measures against treason. If the loyalty of the nation had begun to
                    waver, it was also for the time strengthened by the premature and headstrong
                    attempts at rebellion by Argyll in Scotland, and Monmouth in England. The
                    renewal of the Covenanting persecutions had, however, branded the name of James
                    with the hatred of the Scottish people, and the butchery of the Bloody Assizes,
                    which in England followed the discomfiture of Monmouth, left behind it a
                    widespread horror, the repression of which only wrought effects on the mind of
                    the nation the deeper and more ineffaceable. But James was too intent on his one
                    aim—the establishment of irresponsible despotism—to scrutinize or consider the
                    indirect consequences of his acts. In that aim was necessarily involved the
                    restoration of Popery, because James was a Papist, but happily the accidental
                    prominence given to this secondary and subordinate aim made the other impossible
                    of success. In his imprudent zeal to accomplish his purpose, James outran the
                    wishes even of Rome, but that was because the purpose which to the one was
                    secondary was to the other primary. James required both a large standing army
                    and freedom from the control of parliament; but for these ends a foreign source
                    of money supply was at first necessary, and this he could only obtain by an
                    arrangement which, while it was unpalatable to himself and loathsome to the
                    nation, was far from acceptable to the pope,—namely, by becoming the temporary
                    vassal of Louis of France, whose ambitious designs, notwithstanding his intense
                    and virulent Catholicism, had awakened the jealousy of Rome. Besides, many of
                    the individual acts of James were prompted by the Jesuits, with whom the pope
                    was then at feud. The progress of James’s ill-starred design was marked by clear
                    and well-defined steps. While all England was shocked by the cruelties following
                    the revocation by Louis of the edict of Nantes, James resolved to demand the
                    repeal of the Test Act, and when this was refused by parliament he fabricated by
                    means of corrupted judges a semblance of legal sanction for his disregard of its
                    provisions, and not only encamped an army on Hounslow Heath, chiefly officered
                    by Catholics, but manifested his determination that henceforth to be a Catholic
                    should be a recommendation and not a bar to the highest offices of state, by
                    creating Father Petre and five Catholic peers privy councillors. An appearance
                    of liberality was indeed given to his policy by a declaration of indulgence to
                    Protestant dissenters, but this only quickened suspicion as to his ultimate
                    purpose. Moreover, while a commission was illegally appointed to restrain the
                    discussion of political subjects by the clergy, the publication of Romanist
                    sentiments was freely permitted, monasteries and Catholic schools were being
                    rapidly augmented, and an attempt was made to swamp the Protestantism of the
                    universities by conferring the principal dignities as they became vacant on
                    Catholics. This final step, and a second declaration of indulgence of April
                    1688, which contained a provision for the prosecution of those clergymen who
                    might refuse to read the declaration in their pulpits, dissipated the last atoms
                    of veneration in the minds of the Tories for the divine right of the king; and
                    after the birth of a son to James in May of the same year nearly every party in
                    the state was prepared to support the invitation to William of Orange to aid in
                    the restitution of the liberties of the country. The discussion of the motives
                    which induced William to accept this invitation, and the results which followed
                    his landing in England, belong properly to the article on <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >William</hi> III. James, finding the bulwarks of despotism crumbling around
                    him, after refusing the advice of a council of lay and temporal peers to open
                    negotiations with William, made a pretence of yielding only to gain time to
                    escape, and by his cowardly flight, which he persevered in even after being
                    intercepted and brought back to London, rendered the coronation of Mary and
                    William indispensable. All hope in England was for the time lost, and as by his
                    action on the Test Act he had alienated the sycophantic estates of Scotland, the
                    rising in the Highlands afforded no permanent benefit to his cause; but in
                    Ireland it might be possible for him still to enjoy, though in diminished
                    lustre, the glories of sovereignty until he should be restored to his wider
                    dignities. If his policy towards Ireland had been dictated by the position in
                    which he was now placed, it failed of its purpose, for even before the arrival
                    of William he discovered that he had to fight his way to dominion, and finally,
                    notwithstanding the aid of French troops, his craven irresolution in the face of
                    danger lost him the battle of the Boyne, July 1, 1690, after which he made a
                    hurried escape to France. An expedition to England in his favour was projected
                    by Louis in 1692, but was frustrated by the defeat of the French fleet off Cape
                    La Hogue on May 17, and another invasion planned to follow on the success of an
                    assassination plot on February 10, 1696, was foiled by the discovery of the
                    treachery. James died at St Germain, September 1701.</p>
