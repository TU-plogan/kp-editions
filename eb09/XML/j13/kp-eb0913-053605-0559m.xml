                    Of a retiring disposition, and far more inclined to thoughtful meditation than
                    to practical activity, Jacobi mainly associated himself at Geneva with the
                    literary and scientific circle of which the most prominent member was Lesage. He
                    studied closely the works of Bonnet, the Swiss naturalist and metaphysician, and
                    was brought into contact with the new political ideas of Rousseau and Voltaire.
                    In 1763 he was called back to Düsseldorf, and in the following year he married
                    and took his place at the head of the mercantile concern handed over to him by
                    his father. After a short period he gave up his commercial career, and in 1770
                    became a member of the council for the duchies of Juliers and Berg, in which
                    capacity he distinguished himself by his ability in the management of financial
                    affairs, and his zeal in the direction of social reforms. Like his

                    Jacobi kept up his interest in literary and philosophic matters by an extensive
                    correspondence, and his mansion at Pempelfort, near Düsseldorf, was the centre
                    of a distinguished literary circle. With Wieland he contributed to start a new
                    literary journal, the <hi rend="italic">Mercury,</hi> in which some of his
                    earliest writings, mainly on practical or economical subjects, were published.
                    Here too appeared in part the first of his philosophic works, the <hi

                    containing a remarkable delineation of that which we may call the principle of
                    the early romantic school in Germany. This was followed in 1779 by <hi
                    rend="italic">Woldemar,</hi> a philosophic novel, of very imperfect structure,
                    but full of genial speculation, and giving the most complete picture of Jacobi’s
                    method of philosophizing. In 1779 he was invited to Munich as member of the
                    privy council, but after a short stay there differences with his colleagues and
                    with the authorities of Bavaria drove him back to Pempelfort. A few unimportant
                    tracts on questions of theoretical politics were followed in 1785 by the. work
                    which first brought Jacobi directly into relation with the contemporary
                    philosophical public. A conversation which he had held with Lessing in 1780, in
                    which Lessing avowed that he knew no philosophy, in the true sense of that word,
                    save Spinozism, led him to a protracted study of Spinoza’s works, while his
                    statement of Lessing’s confession induced a correspondence with Moses
                    Mendelssohn. The <hi rend="italic">Letters on Spinoza's Theory</hi><hi

                    clearly Jacobi’s strenuous objection to a demonstrative system in philosophy,
                    and drew upon him the vigorous enmity of the Berlin clique, whose philosophic
                    protagonist was Moses Mendelssohn. Jacobi was ridiculed as endeavouring to
                    reintroduce into philosophy the antiquated notion of unreasoning belief, was
                    denounced as an enemy of reason, as a pietist, and as in all probability a
                    Jesuit in disguise, and was especially taken to task for his employment of the
                    ambiguous term “belief” <hi rend="italic">{Glaube,</hi> which may mean <hi
                    rend="italic">belief</hi> in the ordinary sense, or <hi rend="italic">faith</hi>
                    in the specifically theological significance). Mendelssohn’s reply showed little
                    more than the writer’s very slight acquaintance with the Spinozistic system to
                    which he had so frequently and so earnestly appealed, and his mortification at
                    the public disclosure of the fact that he had remained in entire ignorance that
                    Spinoza’s <hi rend="italic">Opera</hi><hi rend="italic">Posthuma</hi> contained

                    what he had employed it for in the <hi rend="italic">Letters on Spinoza,</hi>
                    but that the nature of the cognition of facts as opposed to the construction of
                    inferences could not be otherwise expressed. In this writing, and especially in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Appendix,</hi> Jacobi came into contact with the critical
                    philosophy, and subjected the Kantian view of knowledge to searching
                    examination.</p>
                <p>The outbreak of the war with the French republic induced Jacobi in 1793 to leave
                    his home at Düsseldorf, and for nearly ten years he resided in Holstein. While
                    there he became intimately acquainted with Reinhold, in whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Beiträge,</hi> pt. iii., 1801, his important work <hi rend="italic">On the
                    Endeavour of the Critical Philosophy to bring Reason to Understanding</hi> was
                    first published, and with Matthias Claudius, the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wandsbecker</hi><hi rend="italic">Bote.</hi> During the same period the
                    excitement caused by the accusation of atheism brought against Fichte at Jena
                    led to the publication of Jacobi’s <hi rend="italic">Letter to Fichte,</hi> in
                    which he made more precise the relation of his own philosophic principles to
                    theology.</p>
                <p>Soon after his return to Germany, Jacobi received a call to Munich in connexion
                    with the new academy of sciences just founded there. The loss of a considerable
                    portion of his fortune induced him to accept this offer; he settled in Munich in
                    1804, and in 1807 became president of the academy. In 1811 appeared his last
                    philosophic work, directed against Schelling specially, <hi rend="italic">On
                    Divine Things</hi><hi rend="italic">{Von den göttlichen Dingen),</hi> the first
                    part of which, a review of the <hi rend="italic">Wandsbecker</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Bote,</hi> had been written in 1798. A bitter reply from Schelling
                    was left without answer by Jacobi, but gave rise to an animated controversy in
                    which Fries and Baader took prominent part. In 1812 Jacobi retired from the
                    office of president, and began to prepare a collected edition of his works. He
                    died before this was completed, on 10th March 1819. The edition of bis writings
                    was continued by his friend Koppen, and was completed in 1825. The works fill
                    six volumes, of which the fourth is in three parts. To the second is prefixed an
                    introduction by Jacobi, which is at the same time an introduction to his
                    philosophy. The fourth volume has also an important preface.</p>
                <p>The philosophy of Jacobi presents itself as in no way a system,— indeed, as, from
                    its principle, essentially unsystematic. A certain fundamental view which
                    underlies all his thinking is brought to bear in succession upon those
                    systematic doctrines which appear to stand most sharply in contradiction to it,
                    and any positive philosophic ι∙esults are given only occasionally. The leading
                    idea of the whole is that of the complete separation between understanding and
                    apprehension of real fact. For Jacobi understanding, or the logical faculty, is
                    purely formal or elaborative, and its results never transcend the given material
                    supplied to it. From the basis of immediate experience or perception thought
                    proceeds by comparison and abstraction, establishing connexions among facts, but
                    remaining in its nature mediate and finite. The principle of reason and
                    consequent, the necessity of thinking each given fact of perception as
                    conditioned, impels understanding towards an endless series of identical
                    propositions, the records of successive, comparisons and abstractions. The
                    province of the understanding is therefore strictly the region of the
                    conditioned; to it the world must present itself as a mechanism. If, then, there
                    is objective truth at all, the existence of real facts must be made known to us
                    otherwise than through the logical faculty of thought; and, as the regress from
                    conclusion to premises must depend upon something not itself capable of logical
                    grounding, mediate thought implies the consciousness of immediate truth.
                    Philosophy therefore must resign the hopeless ideal of a systematic (i.e.,
                    intelligible) explanation of things, and must content itself with the
                    examination of the facts of consciousness. It is a mere prejudice of philosophic
                    thinkers, a prejudice which has descended from Aristotle, that mediate or
                    demonstrated cognition is superior in cogency and value to the immediate
                    perception of truths or facts.</p>
                <p>The fundamental principle of Jacobi’s system, thus sketched, presents a most
                    interesting analogy with that which has become familiar in English philosophy
                    through the writings of Sir W. Hamilton. Upon the historical relations between
                    the two thinkers nothing requires here to be said. No reader of Hamilton can
                    fail to be made aware of the great obligations the Scotch psychologist was under
                    to his German predecessor. But attention to the results of Jacobi’s fundamental
                    doctrine, as these were wrought out by comparison of it with the speculative
                    systems of Spinoza, Kant, and Schelling, will throw great light upon Hamilton’s
                    writings, and make clear the connexions of the several parts which in his
                    imperfect expositions too frequently remained in obscurity.</p>
                <p>As Jacobi starts with the doctrine that thought is partial and limited,
                    applicable only to connect facts, but incapable of explaining their existence,
                    it is evident that for him any demonstrative system of metaphysic which should
                    attempt to subject all existence to the principle of logical ground must be
                    repulsive. Now in modern philosophy the first and greatest demonstrative system
                    of metaphysic is that of Spinoza, and it lay in the nature of things that upon
                    Spinoza’s system Jacobi should first direct his criticism. A summary of the
                    results of his examination is thus presented <hi rend="italic">(Werke,</hi> i.
                    216-223):—“(1) Spinozism is atheism; (2) the Kabbalistic philosophy, in so far
                    as it is philosophy, is nothing but undeveloped or confused Spinozism; (3) the
                    philosophy of Leibnitz and Wolff is not less fatalistic than that of Spinoza,
                    and carries a resolute thinker to the very principles of Spinoza; (4) every
                    demonstrative method ends in fatalism; (5) we can demonstrate only similarities

                    proceeding always in identical propositions; every proof presupposes something
                    already proved, the principle of which is immediately given <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Offenbaτnιng,</hi> revelation, is the term here employed by Jacobi, as by many
                    later writers, <hi rend="italic">c.g.,</hi> Lotze, to denote the peculiar
                    character of an immediate, unproved truth); (6) the keystone <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Element)</hi> of all human knowledge and activity is belief <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Glaube).</hi> Of these propositions only the first and fourth require further
                    notice. Jacobi, accepting the law of reason and consequent as the fundamental
                    rule of demonstrative reasoning, and as the rule explicitly followed by Spinoza,
                    points out that, if we proceed by applying this principle so as to recede from
                    particular and qualified facts to the more general and abstract conditions, we
                    land ourselves, not in the notion of an active, intelligent creator of the
                    system of things, but in the notion of an all-comprehensive, indeterminate <hi
                    rend="italic">Nature,</hi> devoid of will or intelligence. Our unconditioned is
                    either a pure <hi rend="italic">abstraction,</hi> or else the impossible notion
                    of a completed system of conditions. In either case the result is atheism, and
                    this result is necessary if the demonstrative method, the method of
                    understanding, is regarded as the only possible means of knowledge. Moreover,
                    the same method inevitably lands in fatalism. For, if the action of the human
                    will is to be made intelligible to understanding, it must be thought as a
                    conditioned phenomenon, having its sufficient ground in preceding circumstances,
                    and, in ultimate abstraction, as the outflow from nature which is the sum of
                    conditions. But this is the fatalist conception, and any philosophy which
                    accepts the law of reason and consequent as the essence of understanding is
                    fatalistic. Thus for the scientific understanding there can be no God and no
                    liberty. It is impossible that there should be a God, for if so he would of
                    necessity be finite. But a finite God, a God that is <hi rend="italic"
                    >known,</hi> is no God. It is impossible that there should be liberty, for if so
                    the mechanical order of phenomena, by means of which they are comprehensible,
                    would be disturbed, and we should have an unintelligible world, coupled with the
                    requirement that it shall be understood.</p>
                <p>Cognition, then, in the strict sense, occupies the middle place between sense
                    perception, which is belief in matters of sense, and reason, which is belief in
                    supersensuous fact. (Jacobi wavered much in his terminology, especially with
                    respect to the word reason; but even at this stage of his thinking the
                    distinctions just named are sufficiently apparent. ) Such a view, and especially
                    the fundamental peculiarity that the categories of the understanding are to be
                    regarded as mere forms of the conditioned, from their very nature limited and
                    relative, presented a certain analogy to the critical philosophy, and
                    accordingly, in the second period of Jacobi’s speculative development, he is
                    driven to a comparison of his doctrines with those of Kant.</p>
                <p>His adverse criticism of the Kantian doctrines was directed on three points
                    mainly, and, though in itself but ill-founded, it deserves the careful
                    consideration of all Kantian students. (1) The categories of the understanding
                    and the forms of intuition supply a blank scheme for the given element of sense.
                    But if the given element be merely sensation, and not actually the external
                    thing, we are still, Jacobi thinks, within the position of subjective idealism.
                    At no point in the whole process do we ever get beyond empty form, bare
                    identity. The synthetical unity of consciousness, if no reality be supplied in
                    regard to which it may operate, is mere repetition of the form of conjunction,
                    mere <hi rend="italic">possibility</hi> of cognition. Whence do we obtain the
                    reality, the <hi rend="italic">objectivity,</hi> of knowledge? To Jacobi it
                    seemed that Kant, in the second edition of the <hi rend="italic">Kritik,</hi>
                    made an effort to demonstrate the external reality of phenomena of experience,
                    and he views the change in Kant’s doctrine as the effect of his own critical
                    comments. Nevertheless such demonstration still seems to him unsatisfactory; it
                    yields only the thought-form of externality, not externality in fact. (2) Jacobi
                    agrees with Kant so far as the critical view of the incapacity of understanding
                    to encompass the ideas is concerned, but he thinks Kant in error in supposing
                    that such incapacity results from the subjective limitation of our power of
                    thinking and not from the nature of the categories of understanding in
                    themselves. At the same time he holds that Kant treats the ideas unjustly, and
                    that in his view of reason he tends to make that faculty inferior to
                    understanding. (3) Kant’s moral theory is as little satisfactory as his theory
                    of perception. Here, too, in the demand for universally valid law as the law of
                    a will that is its own content, Jacobi can find but the form and not the reality
                    of a universal rule. The universal will is void of content, and the sharp
                    opposition which in the Kantian ethics appears between the ethical motive and
                    all modes of feeling is the natural result of mere formalism. When Jacobi
                    endeavours to supply the place of the Kantian theorems which ⅛e rejects, the
                    inherent weakness of his own principle becomes apparent. External things are
                    known to us by immediate perception, a combination of intuition and belief. The
                    principle of inference to realities is that of cause and effect, the
                    significance of which we learn from observing the relation between our will and
                    changes in the objective world, and this principle by a natural necessity we
                    extend to all existence. The infinite progress from consequents, to grounds,
                    which is the form of procedure of understanding, yields no conclusion as regards
                    the being of a God. But when we regard the whole system of real things, we are
                    compelled to infer a real cause, which, from the significance of the causal
                    principle, is seen to be of necessity an active intelligent will, a God who
                    foresees events. This apprehension of God is faith, reason, or feeling, as
                    Jacobi, following Fries, is willing to call it.</p>
                <p>Not even in his latest work of importance <hi rend="italic">(Von den göttlichen
                    Dingen),</hi> which is specifically on religion, does Jacobi manage to make
                    clear the step, which he has himself characterized as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >salto mortale</hi> of the human intellect, from the finite to the infinite;
                    still less the further difficulty as to the possibility of holding that the God
                    who for cognition is the unknown God must be held to possess providence,
                    personality, life. He acknowledges that this is anthropomorphic, bitterly
                    assails Schelling for identifying divine and human reason, but leaves the
                    problem standing. The truth is that what Jacobi called feeling, and regarded as
                    immediate knowledge, is not a simple act of mind, capable of yielding simple
                    results, but the very essence of complex thinking. We cannot separate knowledge
                    of things from apprehension of them in the way he has adopted. Nor can the human
                    reason rest satisfied with a system devoid of inner coherence and harmony.</p>
                <p>The best introductions to Jacobi’s philosophy are the preface to the second vol.
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Worts,</hi> and Appendix 7 to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Letters on Spinoza's Theory.</hi> There are two monographs of some extent upon
