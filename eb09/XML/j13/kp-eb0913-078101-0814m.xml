                    ranges to the north and those of Dauphiné to the south. But in very early days,
                    before these gorges had been carved out, there were no openings in the Jura at
                    all, and even now its three chief rivers—the Doubs, the Loue, and the Ain—flow
                    down the western slope, which is both much longer and but half as steep as the
                    eastern. Some geographers extend the name Jura to the Swabian and Franconian
                    ranges between the Danube and the Neckar and the Main; but, though these are
                    similar in point of composition and direction to the range to the south, it is
                    most convenient to limit the name to the mountain ridges lying between France
                    and Switzerland, and this narrower sense will be adopted here.</p>
                <p>The Jura has been aptly described as a huge plateau about 156 miles long and 38
                    miles broad, hewn into an oblong shape, and raised by internal forces to an
                    average height of from 1950 to 2600 feet above the surrounding plains. The shock
                    by which it was raised, and the vibration caused by the elevation of the great
                    chain of the Alps, produced many transverse gorges or “cluses,” while on the
                    plateaus between these subaerial agencies have exercised their· ordinary
                    influence.</p>
                <p>Geologically, the sedimentary rocks of the Jura belong to the Mesozoic age, and
                    were deposited in a sea of variable depth, traces of which survive in the vast
                    salt mines from which Salins and Lons-le Saunier derive their names. The special
                    name of these fossiliferous strata is Oolitic; they are also called Jurassic,
                    from the fact that the Jura is entirely made up of such layers. They include
                    sands, sandstones, marls, clays, and limestones; and the water that deposited
                    these strata must have been highly charged with carbonate of lime, since
                    calcareous rocks abound in the Jura. The action on these rocks of the carbonic
                    acid gas discharged by all animals has been to transform them into bicarbonate
                    of lime, a very soluble body, and hence the work of erosion has been much
                    facilitated. The countless blocks of gneiss, granite, and other crystalline
                    formations which are found, in such numbers on the slopes of the Jura, and go by
                    the name of “erratic blocks” (of which the best known instance—the Pierre à
                    Bot—is 40 feet in diameter, and rests on the side of a hill 900 feet above the
                    Lake of Neuchâtel), have been transported thither from the Alps by ancient
                    glaciers, which have left their mark on the Jura range itself in the shape of
                    striations and moraines.</p>
                <p>The general direction of the chain is from north-east to south-west, but a
                    careful study reveals the fact that there ’were in reality two main lines of
                    upheaval, viz., north to south and east to west, the former best seen in the
                    southern part of the range and the latter in the northern; and it was by the
                    union of these two forces that the lines northeast to south-west (seen in the
                    greater part of the chain), and north-west to south-east (seen in the Villebois
                    range at the south-west extremity of the chain), were produced. This is best
                    realized if. we take Besançon as a centre; to the north the ridges run east and
                    west; to the south, north and south, while to the east the direction is
                    north-east to south-west.</p>
                <p>Before considering the topography of the interior of the Jura, it may be
                    convenient to take a brief survey of its outer slopes.</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">northern face</hi> dominates on one side the famous
                    “Trouée” (or Trench) of Belfort, one of the great geographical centres of
                    Europe, whence routes run north down the Rhine to the North Sea, south-east to
                    the Danube basin and Black Sea, and south-west into France and so to the
                    Mediterranean basin. It is now so strongly fortified that it becomes a question
                    of great strategical importance to prevent its being turned by means of the
                    great central plateau of the Jura, which, as we shall see, is a network of roads
                    and railways. On the other side it overhangs the “Trouée” of the Black Forest
                    towns on the Rhine (Rheinfelden, Säckingen, Laufenburg, and Waldshut) through
                    which the central plain of Switzerland is easily gained. On this north slope two
                    openings offer routes into the interior of the chain,—the valley of the Doubs
                    belonging to France, and the valley of the Birs belonging to Switzerland.
                    Belfort is the military, Mühlhausen the industrial, and Basel the commercial
                    centre of this slope.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">eastern and western faces</hi> offer many striking
                    parallels. The plains through which flow the Aar and the Saône have each been
                    the bed of an ancient lake, traces of which remain in the lakes of Neuchâtel,
                    Bienne, and Morat. The west face runs mainly north and south like its great
                    river, and for a similar reason the east face runs north-east to south-west.
                    Again, both slopes are pierced by many transverse gorges or ‘ ‘ cluses” (due to
                    fracture and not to erosion), by which access is gained to the great central
                    plateau of Pontarlier, though these are seen more plainly on the east face than
                    on the west; thus the gorges at the exit from which Lons le Saunier, Poligny,
                    Arbois, and Salins are built balance those of the Suze, of the Vai de Ruz, of
                    the Vai de Travers, and of the Vai d’Orbe, though on the east face there is but
                    one city which commands all these important routes—Neuchâtel. This town is thus
                    marked out by nature as a great military and industrial centre, just as Besançon
                    on the west, which has besides to defend the route from Belfort down the Doubs.
                    These easy means of communicating with the Free County of Burgundy or Franche
                    Comté accounts for the fact that the dialect of Neuchâtel is Burgundian, and
                    that it was held generally by Burgundian nobles, though most of the country near
                    it was in the hands of the house of Savoy until gradually annexed by Bern. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Chasscron</hi> (5286 feet) is the central point of the eastern
                    face, commanding the two great railways which join Neuchâtel and Pontarlier. It
                    is in a certain sense parallel to the valley of the Loue on the west face, which
                    flows into the Doubs a little to the south of Dôle, the only important town of
                    the central portion of the Saône basin. South of the Vai d’Orbe the east face
                    becomes a rocky wall crowned by all the highest summits of the chain—the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mont Tendre</hi> (5512 feet), the <hi rend="italic">Dôle</hi>
                    (5507 feet), the <hi rend="italic">Rcculet</hi> (5643 feet), the <hi
                    rend="italic">Crét</hi><hi rend="italic">de la</hi><hi rend="italic">Neige</hi>
                    (5653 feet), and the <hi rend="italic">Gram! Credo</hi> (5276 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n815/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0815-0782"/> feet), the uniformity of level being as striking
                    as on the west edge of the Jura, though there the absolute height is far less.
                    The position of the Dôle is similar to that of the Chasseron, as along the sides
                    of it run the great roads of the <hi rend="italic">Col de St Cergues</hi> (4159
                    feet) and the <hi rend="italic">Col de la</hi><hi rend="italic">Faucille</hi>
                    (4341 feet), the latter leading through the Vallée des Dappes, which was divided
                    in 1862 between France and Switzerland, after many negotiations. The height of
                    these roads shows that they are passages across the chain, rather than through
                    natural depressions.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">soιdhcm face</hi> is supported by two great pillars—on
                    the east by the <hi rend="italic">Grand Credo</hi> and on the west by the ridge
                    of <hi rend="italic">Rcvermont</hi> (2529 feet) above Bourg en Bresse; between
                    these a huge bastion (the district of <hi rend="italic">Bugey')</hi> stretches
                    away to the south, forcing the Rhone to make a long détour. On the two sides of
                    this bastion the plains in which Amberieu and Culoz stand balance one another,
                    and are ths meeting points of the routes which cut through the bastion by means
                    of deep gorges. On the eastern side this great wedge is steep and rugged, ending
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Grand</hi><hi rend="italic">Colombier</hi> (5033 feet)
                    above Culoz, and it sinks on the western side to the valley of the Ain, the
                    district of Bresse, and the plateau of Dombes. The junction of the Ain and the
                    Surand at Pont d’Ain on the west balances that of the Valserine and the Rhone at
                    Bellegarde on the east.</p>
                <p>The Jura thus dominates on the north one of the great highways of Europe, on the
                    east and west divides the valleys of the Saône and the Aar, and stretches out to
                    the south so as nearly to join hands with the great mass of the Dauphiné Alps.
                    It therefore commands the routes from France into Germany, Switzerland, and
                    Italy, and hence its enormous historical importance.</p>
                <p>Let us now examine the topography of the interior of the range. This naturally
                    falls into three divisions, each traversed by one of the three great rivers of
                    the Jura—the Doubs, the Lone, and the Ain.</p>
                <p>1. In the <hi rend="italic">northern division</hi> it is the east and west line
                    which prevails—the <hi rend="italic">Lomont,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Mont.
                    Terrible,</hi> the defile of the Doubs from St Ursanne to St Hippolyte, and the
                    “Trouée” of the Black Forest towns. It thus bars access to the central plateau
                    from the north, and this natural wall does away with the necessity of artificial
                    fortifications. This division falls again into two distinct portions.</p>
                <p>(a) The first is the <hi rend="italic">part east of the deep gorge of the
                    Doubs</hi> after it turns south at St Hippolyte; it is thus quite cut off on
                    this side, and is naturally Swiss territory. It includes the basin of the river
                    Birs, and the great plateau between the Doubs and the Aar, on which, at an
                    average height of 2600 feet, are situated a number of towns, one of the most
                    striking features of the Jura. These include Locle and La Chaux de Fonds, and
                    are mainly occupied with watchmaking, an industry which does not require bulky
                    machinery, and is therefore well fitted for a mountain district.</p>
                <p>(δ) <hi rend="italic">The part west of the “Cluse” of the Doubs.—</hi> Of this,
                    the district east of the river Dessoubre, isolated in the interior of the range
                    (unlike the Locle plateau), is called the “<hi rend="italic">Haute
                    Montagne,”</hi> and is given up to cheese making, curing of hams, saw mills,
                    &amp;c. But little watchmaking is carried on there, Besançon being the chief
                    French centre of this industry, and being connected with Geneva by a chain of
                    places similarly occupied, which fringe the west plateau of the Jura. The part
                    west of the Dessoubre, or the <hi rend="italic">Moyenne</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Montagne,</hi> a huge plateau north of the Loue, is more especially devoted to
                    agriculture, while along its north edge metal working and manufacture of
                    hardware are carried on, particularly at Besançon and Audincourt.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">central division</hi> is remarkable for being without
                    the deep gorges which are found so frequently in other parts of the range. It
                    consists of the basin of which Pontarlier is the centre, through notches in the
                    rim of which routes converge from every direction; this is the great
                    characteristic of the middle region of the Jura. Hence its immense strategical
                    and commercial importance. On the north-east roads run to Morteau and Locle, on
                    the north-west to Besançon, on the west to Salins, on the south-west to Dôle and
                    Lons-le-Saunier, on the east to the Swiss plain. The Pontarlier plateau is
                    nearly horizontal, the slight indentations in it being due to erosion, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> by the river Drugeon. The keys to this important
                    plateau are to the east the <hi rend="italic">Fort de Joux,</hi> under the walls
                    of which meet the two lines of railway from Neuchâtel, aud to the west <hi
                    rend="italic">Salins,</hi> the meeting place of the routes from the Col de la
                    Faucille, from Besançon, and from the French plain.</p>
                <p>The Ain rises on the south edge of this plateau, and on a lower shelf or step,
                    which it waters, are situated two points of great military importance—Nozeroy
                    and Champagnole. The latter is specially important, since the road leading
                    thence to Geneva traverses one after another, not far from their head, the chief
                    valleys which run down into the South Jura, and thus commands the southern
                    routes as well as those by St Cergues and the Col de la Faucille from the Geneva
                    region, and a branch route along the Orbe river from Jougne. The fort of <hi
                    rend="italic">Les Rousses,</hi> near the foot of the Dôle, serves as an advanced
                    post to Champagnole, just as the Fort de Joux does to Pontarlier.</p>
                <p>The above sketch will serve to show the character of the central Jura as the
                    meeting place of routes from all sides, and the importance to France of its
                    being strongly fortified, lest an enemy approaching from the north-east should
                    try to turn the fortresses of the “Trouée de Belfort.” It is in the western part
                    of the central Jura that the north and south lines first appear strongly marked.
                    There are said to be in this district no less than fifteen ridges running
                    parallel to each other, and it is these which force the Loue to the north, and
                    thereby occasion its very eccentric course. The cultivation of wormwood
                    wherewith to make the tonic “absinthe” has its headquarters at Pontarlier.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">southern division</hi> is by far the most complicated
                    and entangled part of the Jura. The lofty ridge which bounds it to the east
                    forces all its drainage to the west, and the result is a number of valleys of
                    erosion (of which that of the Ain is the chief instance), quite distinct from
                    the natural “cluses” or fissures of those of the Doubs and of the Loue. Another
                    point of interest is the number of roads which intersect it, despite its extreme
                    irregularity. This is due to the great “cluses” of Nantua and Virieu, which
                    traverse it from east to west. The north and south line is very clearly seen in
                    the eastern part of this division; the north-east and south-west is entirely
                    wanting, but in the Villebois range south of Ambérieu we have the principal
                    example of the north-west to south-east line. The plateaus west of the Ain are
                    cut through by the valleys of the Valorise and of the Surand, and like all the
                    lowest terraces on the west slope do not possess any considerable towns. The Ain
                    receives three tributaries from the east:—</p>
                <p>(a) The <hi rend="italic">Bienne,</hi> which flows from the fort of Les Rousses
                    by St Claude, the industrial centre of the South Jura, famous for the
                    manufacture of wooden toys, owing to the large quantity of boxwood in the
                    neighbourhood. Septmoncel is busied with cutting of gems, and Morez with watch
                    and spectacle making. Cut off to the east by the great chain, the industrial
                    prosperity of this valley is of recent origin.</p>
                <p>(δ) The <hi rend="italic">Oignon,</hi> which flows from south to north. It
                    receives the drainage of the lake of Nantua, a town noted for combs and silk
                    weaving, and which communicates by the “cluse” of the Lac de Silan with the
                    Valserine valley, and so with the Rhone at Bellegarde, and again with the
                    various routes which meet under the walls of the fort of Les Rousses, while by
                    the Vai Romey and the Séran Culoz is easily gained.</p>
                <p>(c) The <hi rend="italic">Albarine,</hi> connected with Culoz by the “cluse” of
                    Virieu, and by the Furan flowing south with Belley, the capital of the district
                    of Bugey (the old name for the South Jura).</p>
                <p>Thë “cluses” of Nantua and Virieu are now both traversed by important railways;
                    and it is even truer than of old that the keys of the South Jura are Lyons and
                    Geneva. But of course the strategic importance of these gorges is less than
                    appears at first sight, because they can be turned by following the Rhone in its

                <p>The name Jura, which occurs in Caesar and in Strabo, is a form of a word which
                    appears under many forms <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Joux, Jorat, Jorasse,
                    Juriens), and is a synonym for a wood or forest. The German name is <hi
                    rend="italic">Leberl&gt;erg, Leber</hi> being a provincial word for a hill.</p>
                <p>Politically the Jura is French (departments of the Doubs, Jura, and Ain) and
                    Swiss (parts of the cantons of Geneva, Vaud, Neuchâtel, Bern, Solothurn, and
                    Basel); but at its north extremity it takes in a small bit of Alsace (Pfirt or
                    Ferrette). In the Middle Ages the southern, western, and northern sides were
                    parcelled out into a number of districts, all of which were gradually absorbed
                    by the French crown, viz., Gex, Vai Romey, Bresse, and Bugey (exchanged in 1601
                    by Savoy for the marquisate of Saluzzo), Franche Comté, or the Free County of
                    Burgundy, an imperial fief till annexed in 1674, the county of Montbéliard
                    (Mümpelgard), acquired in 1793, and the county of Ferrette (French 1648—1871).
                    The northern part of the eastern side was held by the bishop of Basel as a fief
                    of the empire, but was given to Bern in 1815 (as a recompense for its loss of
                    Vaud), and now forms the Bernese Jura, a French-speaking district The centre of
                    the eastern slope formed the principality of Neuchâtel and the county of
                    Vallangin, which were generally held by Burgundian nobles, came by succession to
                    the kings of Prussia in 1707, and were formed into a Swiss canton in 1815,
                    though they did not become free from formal Prussian claims until 1857. The
                    southern part of the eastern slope originally belonged to the house of Savoy,
                    but was conquered bit by bit by Bern, which was forced in 1815 to accept its
                    subject district Vaud as a colleague and equal <pb break="no"

                    Bold’s defeats at Grandson and Morat which led to the annexation by the
