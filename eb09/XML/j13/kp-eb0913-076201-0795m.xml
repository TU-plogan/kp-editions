                <p><label type="entry">JUDGE</label>, an officer appointed by the sovereign power in
                    a state to administer the law. The duties of the judicial office, whether in a
                    civil or a criminal matter, are to hear the statements on both sides in open
                    court, to arrive at a conclusion as to the truth of the facts submitted to him,
                    or when a jury is engaged to direct the jury to find such a conclusion, to apply
                    to the facts so found the appropriate rules of law, and to certify by his
                    judgment the relief to which the parties are entitled or the obligations or
                    penalties which they have incurred. With the judgment the office of the judge is
                    at an end, but the judgment sets in motion the executive forces of the state,
                    whose duty it is to carry it into execution. Such is the type of a judicial
                    officer recognized by mature systems of law, but it is not to be accepted as the
                    universal type, and the following qualifying circumstances should be noticed. 1.
                    In primitive systems of law the judicial is not separated from the legislative
                    and other governing functions. 2. Although the judge is assumed to take the law
                    from the legislative authority, yet, as the existing law never at any time
                    contains provision for all cases, the judge maybe obliged to inventor create
                    principles applicable to the case. This is called by Bentham and the English
                    jurists judge-made and judiciary law. 3. The separation of the function of judge
                    and jury, and the exclusive charge of questions of law given to the judge, are
                    more particularly characteristic of the English judicial system. During a
                    considerable period in the history of Roman law an entirely different
                    distribution of parts was observed. The adjudication of a case was divided
                    between the <hi rend="italic">magistratus</hi> and ∖ <hi rend="italic">fιo
                    judex,</hi> neither of whom corresponds to the English judge. The former was a
                    public officer charged with the execution of the law; the latter was an
                    arbitrator whom the magistrates commissioned to hear and report upon a
                    particular case. The following are points more specially characteristic of the
                    English system and its kindred judicial systems. 1. Judges are absolutely
                    protected from action for anything that they may do in the discharge of their
                    judicial duties. This is true in the fullest sense of judges of the supreme <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n796/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0796-0763"/> courts. “It is a principle of English law that no
                    action will lie against a judge of one of the superior courts for a judicial
                    act, though it be alleged to have been done maliciously and corruptly.” Other
                    judicial officers are also protected, though not to the same extent, against
                    actions. 2. The highest class of judges are irremovable except by what is in
                    effect a special Act of Parliament, viz.,a resolution passed by both Houses and
                    assented to by the sovereign. The inferior judges and magistrates are removable
                    for misconduct by the Lord Chancellor. 3. The judiciary in England is not a
                    separate profession. The judges are chosen from the class of advocates, and
                    almost entirely according to their eminence at the bar. 4. Judges are in England
                    appointed for the most part by the crown. In a few cases municipal corporations
                    may appoint their own judicial officer, and the coroner is elected by the
                    freeholders of the county.</p>
                <p>In the United States judges of the supreme courts, as well as ambassadors and
                    other public functionaries, are nominated and appointed by the president with
                    the consent of the Senate, and hold their offices during good behaviour. ' In
                    the separate States the practice varies, but the tendency is in favour of
                    electing the judges and limiting their tenure of office. In the revised
                    constitution of New York of 1846, the principle was established that all public
                    officers, inclusive of the judges, should be chosen by popular election. “The
                    constitutional provision for making judges elective for short periods by
                    universal suffrage is contagious, and every new constitutional reform or
                    establishment tends that way” (Kent’s <hi rend="italic">Commentaries,</hi> i.
                    295, where a summary of the practice will be found).</p>
