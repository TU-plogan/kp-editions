                    southern Albania, or—to retain the ancient designation—Epirus. The position of
                    Janina is strikingly picturesque. At the foot of the grey limestone mass of
                    Mount Mitzekeli (1500 ft.), which forms part of the fine range of hills running
                    north from the Gulf of Arta, there lies a valley (the Hellopia of antiquity)
                    partly occupied by a lake; and on the slopes of a slight eminence, stretching
                    down to the western shore, stands this town of St John. It has greatly declined
                    from the state of barbaric prosperity which it enjoyed in the beginning of this
                    century, when it was the seat of Ali Pasha, estimated to have from 30,000 to
                    50,000 inhabitants. The fortress—Demir-Kule or Iron Castle, which like the
                    principal seraglio was built on a promontory jutting down into the lake—is now
                    in ruins. But the town still possesses fourteen mosques, each embosomed by a
                    cluster of trees, and there are also seven churches, two synagogues, a Greek
                    college, a library, and a hospital. As the centre of a vilayet it contains a
                    governor’s residence (rebuilt in 1870). Sayades (opposite Corfu) and Arta are
                    the places through which it receives its imports. A considerable activity in
                    trade and industry is maintained by the Greek population, the rich gold and
                    silver embroidery for which the town has long been famous being still one of the
                    notable articles in its bazaar. According to M. Moreau, the French consul <hi
                    rend="italic">(BuU. de la Soc. de G.eogr.,</hi> Faris, 1876), Janina contained
                    16,230 inhabitants in 1875, of whom 4136 were Mahometans, 8989 Christians, and
                    3105 Jews. Synvet <hi rend="italic">(Les</hi><hi rend="italic">Grecs</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de l' Empire Ottoman,</hi> Constantinople, 1878) reckons the
                    Greeks alone at 14,362 (the island on the lake being included). The vilayet of
                    Janina, previous to the cessions made to Greece in 1881, comprised the sandjaks
                    of Janina, Argyrocastro, Berat (Avlona), Prevesa, and Thessaly, and the sandjak
                    contains the districts of Janina (town and country), Aidwat, Prevena, Cognitza,
                    Metzovo, and Philates. The lake (perhaps to be identified with the Pambotus of
                    antiquity) is 6 miles long, and has an extreme breadth of 3 miles. In time of
                    flood it is united with the smaller lake of Labchistas, which lies to the north.
                    According to Guido Cora’s investigations in 1878, the greatest depth does not
                    exceed 32 feet. There are no affluents of any considerable size, and the only
                    outlets are underground passages or katavothra extending for many miles through
                    the calcareous rocks.</p>
                <p>The theory supported by Leake (ΛWΛenι <hi rend="italic">Greece)</hi> that the
                    citadel of Janina is to be identified with Dodona, is now generally surrendered
                    in favour of the claims of a more southern site. As Anna Comnena, in describing
                    the capture of the town (τα <hi rend="italic">'∖οαvvιvα)</hi> by Bohemond in
                    1082, speaks of the walls as being dilapidated, it may be supposed that the
                    place existed before the 11th century. It is mentioned from time to time in the
                    Byzantine annals, and on the establishment of the lordship of Epirus by Michael
                    Angelus Comnenas Ducas, it became his capital. During the 14th century it was
                    frequently attacked by the Albanians; but it was still in possession of the
                    successors of Michael when the forces of Sultan Amurath appeared before it in
                    1430 (ς∕ ’. Hahn, <hi rend="italic">Alban.</hi><hi rend="italic">Studien,</hi>
                    pp. 319-322). Since 1431 it has continued under Turkish rule. In modern times it
                    became famous as the seat of the tyrant Ali (1788-1822). See <hi
