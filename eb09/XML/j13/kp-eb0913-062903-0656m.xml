                    of the Jordan occupied by the Israelites. The city was destroyed, and, though it
                    is mentioned from time to time under its usual name (2 Sam. x. 5) or by its
                    epithet “city of palm trees” (Judg. i. 16, iii. 13; comp. Deut, xxxiv. 3), it
                    was not rebuilt as a fortified place till the reign of Ahab (1 Kings xvi. 34),

                    the prophet Elisha (2 Kings ii.). The narrative of the healing of the waters by
                    Elisha is referred by Josephus <hi rend="italic">{Β. J.</hi> iv. 8, 3) to the

                    margin of the Jordan valley, 700 feet below the Mediterranean level, and just
                    under the cliffs of M. Quarantania. The mounds surrounding the spring are of
                    sun-dried brick, and show no traces of ancient building. The position of the
                    town, in a district of great fertility, with rose gardens (Eccles, xxiv. 14),
                    various species of date palms, and valuable cultivation of henna, opobalsamum,
                    and myrobalan (Jos., <hi rend="italic">ut supra-,</hi> Strabo, xvi. 2), secured
                    its prosperity, while its situation at the gate of the great pass leading up
                    from the Jordan valley to Jerusalem gave it strategical importance. Thus we find
                    that it shared the calamities of the Babylonian exile (Ezra ii. 34), was
                    reoccupied on the restoration (Neh. iii. 2), and was fortified by Bacchides in
                    the Maccabee wars (1 Mac. ix. 50). In the time of Strabo there were two forts,
                    Threx and Taurus, protecting the pass above Jericho. Antony gave the groves of
                    Jericho as a rich gift to Cleopatra. From her they passed to Herod the Great,
                    who made the city his winter residence, and adorned it with buildings, crowning
                    the height above with a fortress named after his mother Cyprus. Here it was that
                    the tyrant died. It appears, however, that the Jericho of Herod was not on the
                    site of the old city (Jos., <hi rend="italic">ut supra)</hi> but a mile to the
                    south, where there are also mounds and the remains of five aqueducts conveying
                    water from three distant springs. A great tank, of which the ruins are still
                    traced, has been conjectured to be the same in which Herod drowned Aristobulus
                    (Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> xv. 2, 3). In the time of Christ the
                    pilgrims from Peraea and Galilee appear to have gathered at Jericho on their way
                    to Jerusalem, and so the town is repeatedly mentioned in the Gospels. According
                    to Eusebius <hi rend="italic">{Onom.,</hi> ed. Lagarde, p. 265) Jericho was
                    destroyed at the time of the fall of Jerusalem, and a new town sprang up, from
                    which he distinguishes the ruins of two earlier cities as still visible. To the
                    third Jericho, which was an episcopal city, may be referred the Byzantine
                    remains immediately east of Tell es Sultân. The present village of Rîhâ or
                    Arîhâ, which stands nearly half an hour south-east of the Sultan’s Spring, is a
                    still more modern site, with a square tower of crusading date. Yâkùt, in the
                    beginning of the 13th century, still speaks of Jericho as producing dates,
                    bananas, and excellent sugar, but all these have disappeared with the gradual
                    decay of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n657/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0657-0630"/> the place. The modern village is but a group of
                    squalid huts, and the ancient groves are represented by a thicket of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Spina Christi</hi> and other trees between the village and the
                    Sultan’s Spring.</p>
