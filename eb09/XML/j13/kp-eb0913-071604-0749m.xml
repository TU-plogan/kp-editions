                <p><label type="entry">JOHN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Don</hi></label>, of Austria
                    (1545-1578), was the bastard son of the emperor Charles V. by Barbara Blomberg,
                    the daughter of a well-to-do citizen of Ratisbon. He was born in that free
                    imperial city (according to a not very probable tradition in the “imperial
                    hostelry” there, which still survives as the inn of the Golden Cross), on
                    February 24, 1545, the anniversary of his father’s birth and coronation, and of
                    the battle of Pavia. On another visit to Ratisbon in the following year, after
                    arranging a marriage between the fair Barbara and one of his German courtiers,
                    Hieronymus Piramis Kegell, the emperor carried off the young Geronimo, as he was
                    then conveniently called. The worthy Don Luis de Quijada, to whose care he was
                    hereupon confided, watched over his early childhood with jealous care. It was at
                    first sought to conceal the connexion between the emperor and the child of his
                    declining years, who was brought up in retirement, chiefly in Quijada’s castle
                    of Villagarcia in Spain. In the year before the emperor’s death, however, the
                    boy was brought into the immediate neighbourhood of San Yuste, where his
                    presence brightened the close of his father’s life. In his last will Charles V.
                    acknowledged “Geronimo” as his son, and commended him to the care of his
                    successors, expressing a wish that he should take monastic vows, but that in the
                    event of his declining these a handsome income should be provided for him out of
                    the revenues of Naples.</p>
                <p>In September 1559 the boy was publicly recognized by king Philip II. as his
                    brother; and henceforth he resided at court under the name of Don Juan d’Austria
                    as a member of the royal family. With the heir to the throne, the unhappy Don
                    Carlos, his relations were so friendly that, when at the end of the year 1567
                    the infante was plotting his flight from Spain, he confided his more or less
                    treasonable scheme to his half-brother, and even requested the latter to
                    accompany him on his expedition. A sense of duty, at which it is difficult to
                    cavil, prompted Don John to reveal this unsought confidence to the king, and <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0750-0717"/> thus he helped to bring about the fatal
                    catastrophe, as it proved, of the imprisonment of Don Carlos.</p>
                <p>It was not the habit of Philip II. to allow those who served him to choose their
                    own seasons and methods of doing so. The impetuous Don John, whom the king would
                    have preferred to see a monk, had in 1565 been refused permission to serve in
                    the fleet ordered to sail for the relief of Malta; and an express royal command
                    had been needed to bring him back when on the point of making the voyage on his
                    own account. His obedience was rewarded when in 1568 he was appointed to the
                    great office of <hi rend="italic">Capitan general de la mar.</hi> His first
                    actual service, however, was by land, and of a kind unattractive to any but the
                    genuine Spanish blood. In 1569 he was charged with a task, the execution of
                    which the captain-general of Granada, the marquis of Mondejar, had begun, but
                    was unwilling relentlessly to complete. The reformation of the converted
                    Moriscoes had come to mean the suppression of the remnants of their national as
                    well as religious life; and after the insurrection of Aben Humeya had been
                    overcome, the wholesale deportation of all the Moriscoes from their habitations
                    was decreed, and executed on All Saints’ Day 1570. Don John cannot be held
                    responsible either for the cruelty of this ordinance, or for the general policy
                    of the war, which from the time when the jealousy of the king had allowed him to
                    take the field, instead of remaining at Granada, he had carried on with vigour
                    and skill. The capture of Guejar had been his first deed of arms (December
                    1569); it had been followed by that of Galera; and in August 1570 the Alpujarras
                    mountains were cleared of the Moriscoes, of whom more than 10,000 are said to
                    have been killed or captured in the space of a single month.</p>
                <p>Before long a nobler crusade engaged the energy of the obedient and successful
                    commander. Philip II., though he was during nearly the whole of his reign
                    engaged in hostilities with the Turks, had hitherto displayed no great vigour in
                    resisting their still unceasing inroads upon the domain of Christendom. His
                    fleet had for the time saved Malta; but Cyprus was torn by the infidel from the
                    Venetians without his having offered timely co-operation for its defence (1571);
                    and the barbarous proceedings of the conquerors had filled Europe with horror
                    and shame. Not even the waters of the Adriatic were secure from the Turkish
                    vessels, and the league which shortly before the loss of Cyprus papal diplomacy
                    had succeeded in knitting between Spain, Venice, and Rome, and which purported
                    to aim at the extinction of the Mahometan power, had as yet remained a dead
                    letter. At length the forces of the allies— 208 galleys, 6 galeases, and a
                    number of smaller craft, with more than 20,000 Spanish, German, and Italian
                    soldiers on board—assembled at Messina. Don John of Austria had been named
                    admiral of the league, with power (granted at the request of Pope Pius V.) of
                    free action after consultation with his captains and the Venetian commander.
                    Thus the day of Lepanto was in every sense his own, though it was his good
                    fortune that the Turks had underestimated his numbers, which were in truth
                    little inferior to theirs. The Christian victory was complete. Only forty of the
                    Turkish vessels effected their escape, the rest being burnt or captured; and
                    35,000 of their men were slain or captured, while 15,000 Christian galley-slaves
                    were released. At Constantinople apprehensions were even entertained of an
                    immediate attack on the part of the victors. The battle of Lepanto (October 7,
                    1571) was, as Ranke observes, like that of Actium, a decisive historic struggle
                    between West and East; and the ecstatic joy which it inspired was shared by all
                    Christian Europe. But though, on receiving the great news of a success which
                    seemed in its momentousness to surpass any of his father’s achievements, Philip
                    II. had vowed to carry on this Christian war, jealousy between the allies wasted
                    the immediate fruits of the victory, and the by no means remotely possible
                    consequences of an active Franco-Turkish alliance inclined the king of Spain to
                    keep his brother inactive in Sicily. Soon the ever vigilant suspicions of Philip
                    were aroused by information which he received— partly from the candid Don John
                    himself—as to the visions which (instigated by the inveterate papal habit of
                    giving away kingdoms before they had been conquered) suggested themselves to the
                    restless imagination of the hero of Lepanto. At one time Albania and the Morea
                    entreated him to reign over them, after he should have previously freed them
                    from the Turkish yoke; next, Rhodes besought the aid of his invincible arm for
                    the work of its liberation. Meanwhile, after the Turks had brought together
                    another fleet, he was unable to force them to accept another battle at Navarino
                    (September 1572); and soon afterwards Venice, by concluding a separate treaty of
                    peace with the sultan, put an end to the league which had been victorious at
                    Lepanto. Spain was by herself no match for the Turkish power; and 'though in
                    1573 Don John captured Tunis, it was speedily recaptured in the following
                    year.</p>
                <p>Although unable to obtain from his brother even so much as the title of an
                    infante of Spain, the ardent spirit of Don John had continued to indulge in wild
                    dreams of a kingdom to be erected by him for himself in those regions which he
                    had successfully disputed with the infidel; and, after suppressing a momentary
                    hankering after the crown of France which the death of Charles IX. had excited,
                    he had solicited the good offices of pope Gregory XIII. towards his
                    establishment as king of Tunis. The pope, however, had destined him for higher
                    things. As yet King Philip had shrunk from taking up the cause of Rome’s
                    unfortunate daughter, held captive in heretic England. Might not a share in the
                    throne of three northern kingdoms tempt Don John to become the hero of a second
                    and more rewardful crusade?</p>
                <p>In the midst of schemes and dreams such as these Don John was summoned by King
                    Philip to an office which might seem to bring him near to the accomplishment of
                    the most glorious of them all. He was appointed (in 1576) to the government of
                    the Netherlands, vacant by the death of Requesens. The administration of the
                    latter had not been intended to introduce any radical change into the system of
                    his predecessor Alva; his military operations had been only partially
                    successful; and the pacification of Ghent (October 1576), concluded since his
                    death, had greatly improved the prospects of William of Orange and the
                    insurrection. The magic of Don John’s name, and the loyal energy of which he had
                    given proof, were to recover what had been lost; and he was willing to undertake
                    a task the accomplishment of which might lead to higher tasks beyond. He was,
                    however, now brought into conflict with an adversary of a very different calibre
                    from his own. He showed himself willing to consent to the demand of the
                    dismissal of the Spanish troops from the Netherlands, hoping to be able to
                    employ them in a descent upon England. William of Orange, by warning Queen
                    Elizabeth of these designs, secured not only her goodwill, but the rarer proof
                    of it in the shape of a sum of money, and at home drew still tighter the
                    alliance established by the Ghent pacification. Hereupon Don John found himself
                    obliged to grant the perpetual edict (February 1577) which in accordance with
                    the pacification dismissed the Spanish troops designed by him for the conquest
                    of England, and held his entry into Brussels (May 1st) amidst popular
                    acclamations. In secret, however, he was counselling and preparing a renewal of
                    the war; and before the end of the summer he took Namur by a stratagem. The
                    answer was the proclamation of Orange as protector of Brabant, and <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n751/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0751-0718"/> the nomination as governor-general of the
                    archduke Matthias, under whom Orange continued to hold the actual supremacy,
                    while Don John’s control was almost entirely confined to the south-western part
                    of the Netherlands. He now (January 1578) declared war against the insurgent
                    provinces, and the dismissed Spanish troops were soon with other forces
                    reassembling under his standard. A large army brought from Lombardy by Alexander
                    Farnese, prince of Parma (Don John’s nephew), raised the Spanish forces to a
                    virtual equality in numbers with those of their opponents; and Farnese’s victory
                    of Gemblours (January 31, 1578) hopefully opened the campaign. It remained an
                    open question whether the aid of France (which appeared to be warranted by the
                    arrival with an army of the duke of Anjou, the “protector” of the liberties of
                    the Netherlands), together with the money of England and the men of the
                    Palatinate, would suffice to make the cause of freedom prevail against the
                    determination of Philip, the ambitious devotion of Don John, and the military
                    genius of Alexander Farnese. On the other hand, it seemed doubtful whether the
                    disunion among Philip’s adversaries would weaken them more than his parsimony
                    and suspicion vexed the soul and crippled the energies of his brother. Such was
                    the situation when Don John was removed by death. After having shortly before
                    escaped the dagger of an English assassin (a Catholic refugee, who had hoped by
                    the act to secure the pardon of the queen), Don John succumbed to a sudden
                    illness at Namur on October 1, 1578. An altogether unwarranted, but under the
                    circumstances far from inexplicable, suspicion accused King Philip of having by
                    poison brought about the death of a half-brother whose action his jealousy and
                    distrust of all the world except himself had thwarted after Gemblours as after
                    Lepanto. The settlement of the Netherlands, after whatever fashion Don John
                    might have accomplished it, was a harder task than any he ever executed; and the
                    subjection of heretic England to the authority of a Catholic queen seems to
                    posterity a dream more marvellous than were even the actual glories of Lepanto.
                    But his life, which spanned but little more than thirty-three years, was the
                    reverse of an empty or an ignoble one, and though it was full of imperfections
                    and disappointments, yet its enthusiasm shines forth even under the cold shade
                    spread over it by the fraternal jealousy of a Philip II.</p>
