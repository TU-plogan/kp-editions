                    October 1513. At first the regency was vested in his mother, but after her
                    marriage with the earl of Angus in 1514 the office was transferred by the
                    estates to the duke of Albany. The English forebore to follow up their victory
                    at Flodden, but the close connexion of Albany with France now aroused the
                    jealousyof Henry VIII., and Scotland was continually exposed to more or less
                    serious attacks from the English until Albany, to whose arrogant bearing and
                    French manners and habits not even the enmity against him of Henry could
                    reconcile the estates, finally in 1524 took his departure to the country of his
                    choice. Upon this James, through the scheming of Henry, was “erected” king in
                    the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, ruling the kingdom by the advice of his mother and
                    the lords in council. In 1526 James was persuaded to choose as his governor the
                    earl of Angus, who kept him in close confinement until May 1528, when he made
                    his escape from Falkland, and put such vigorous measures in execution against
                    Angus as compelled him to flee to England. In 1532 Angus, taking advantage of
                    the discontent in the south of Scotland caused by the king’s conduct towards the
                    Armstrongs, and of the distracted condition of the Highlands, aided an English
                    raid on the borders; but shortly afterwards negotiations for peace were begun,
                    and a treaty was finally signed in 1534. In January 1537 James was married to
                    Madeleine of France, but, she dying in July of the same year, he in June 1538
                    espoused Mary of Lorraine. Henry VIII. was by no means satisfied with the
                    influence he exercised in Scotch affairs, or the amount of deference he received
                    from his nephew; and, his jealousy receiving special provocation from the
                    interest taken by James in foreign politics, he in 1542 despatched an expedition
                    against Scotland, which failed from want of a commissariat. James determined to
                    make reprisals, but owing to the indecision of the nobles, who had no love of
                    the enterprise, his army was scattered at the rout of Solway Moss on the 25th
                    November. On the 14th December following James died at Falkland. His successor
                    was his daughter Mary, born seven days before his death. Though possessing a
                    weak constitution which was further impaired by his irregular manner of life,
                    James manifested great vigour and independence as a sovereign, both in
                    withstanding the machinations of his uncle and opposing the influence of the
                    nobles. The persecutions to which the Protestants were exposed during his reign
                    were, however, due to the excessive influence exercised by the ecclesiastics,
                    especially David Beaton, archbishop of St Andrews. The king’s habit of mingling
                    with the peasantry secured him a large amount of popularity, and has led many to
                    ascribe to him the authorship of three poems descriptive of scenes in lower
                    class life— <hi rend="italic">Christis Kirk on the Grene, The Gaberlunzie
                    Man,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Jolly Beggar.</hi> There is no proof that he
                    was the author of any of these poems, but from expressions in the poems of Sir
                    David Lyndsay, who was on terms of special intimacy with him, it would appear
                    that he occasionally wrote verses.</p>
