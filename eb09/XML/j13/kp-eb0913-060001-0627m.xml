                <p>AMONG the islands of the Indian archipelago Java is not the largest, being
                    surpassed in this regard by Borneo, New Guinea, Sumatra, and Celebes; but in
                    every other respect it is the most important of them all. It has passed through
                    the most remarkable vicissitudes, has been the scene of the most eventful
                    occurrences, and possesses the noblest memorials of bygone splendour. It
                    supports a larger population than all the other islands of the Indian Ocean
                    together, a population as dense indeed as that of the most populous of European
                    countries. In natural beauty it rivals the most favoured regions of the world.
                    Through the mildness of its climate and the industry of its people it possesses
                    a richer store of valuable productions than almost any country of equal extent
                    can boast: its rice-fields make it the granary of the East Indian islands, and
                    its c,offee and sugar plantations are a perpetual source of wealth to Holland,
                    the country which has the good fortune to claim its allegiance.<note

                <p>Java lies between 105° 10' and 114° 34' E. long., and between 5° 52' and 8° 46'
                    S. lat. Its greatest length— measured from Pepper Bay in the west to Banyuwangi
                    in the east—amounts to no less than 622 miles; its greatest breadth—from Cape
                    Bugel in Japara to the south coast of Jokjokarta—is only 121. The area is
                    estimated at 49,176 square miles, nearly four times that of Holland (12,731
                    square miles). Both physically and administratively the island of Madura,
                    separated from the main island by a narrow strait, must be taken along with
                    Java; and the same is more or less the case with a number of smaller
                    islands—Pulo Panitan or Princes’ Island, lying off the most western promontory,
                    the Thousand Islands, the Karimon-Djawa (Carimon Java) archipelago, about 50
                    miles to the north of Japara, Bawean (Bavean), a little further to the north of
                    Madura, the Sumanap islands to the north-east of Madura, and Deli, Tindjil, Nusa
                    Kambangan, Sempu, and Nusa Barung off the south coast. These all being included,
                    the area of what is officially known as Java and Madura amounts to 51,961 square
                    miles.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The orthography
                    of East Indian names is far from constant. Even in the same Dutch book Madura
                    and Madoera, Jokjakarta, Djok-jokarta, and Djokdjokarta are to be found. In the
                    present article the <hi rend="italic">Dj</hi> or <hi rend="italic">J</hi> is
                    usually given in the more English form of <hi rend="italic">J,</hi> the oe as

                <p>There is a striking difference between western and eastern Java in the main
                    features of relief. The western portion, exclusive of the northern alluvial
                    coast-land, is a compact mass of mountains culminating in volcanic peaks nowhere
                    interrupted by plains or lowland valleys. In the eastern and larger portion the
                    volcanoes rise in independent clusters, and the valleys between open out into
                    wide champaigns. Even in the east the number of volcanic eminences is
                    exceptionally large; and, if the whole island be taken into view, there is
                    scarcely any region of the world of equal extent which can boast of so many. The
                    following are those which are still in a state of activity :—Gedé (the most
                    western), Tangkuban Prahu, Guntur, Pepandayan, Telaga Bodas, Galung-gung,
                    Tjermé, the Slamat (sometimes called Gedé), Sendârâ, Sumbing, Merapi, Lawu,
                    Wilis (?), Kelut, Ardjunâ, Kawi (1), Tenger, Smeru or Semeru, Lamongan, Rawun,
                    and Idjen. The loftiest of them all is Semeru, with a height of 12,238 English
                    feet.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Junghuhn’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Java.</hi> Chronological lists of the eruptive and seismical
                    phenomena of the island, and indeed of all the Indian archipelago, are given
                    from time to time in the <hi rend="italic">Nat. Tijds. voor Ned. Ind.</hi> From
                    Dr Bergsma’s report in the volume for 1880 it appears that in 1878 there were
                    sixteen distinct earthquakes registered throughout the island. That both
                    volcanoes and earthquakes are not without pissent importance among the physical
                    agencies engaged in the new shaping of the land is shown by such facts as the
                    following:—in 1843, according to Junghuhn’s estimate, Mount Guntur flung forth
                    ashes and sand to the extent of 30 million tons; by the great eruption of Mount
                    Galung-gung in 1822, no fewer than 114 villages were laid waste and 4000 persons
                    destroyed; in 1867 an earthquake caused the death of 1000 people in the town of
                    Jokjokarta alone; in 1872 the eruption of Merapi (one of the most active of the
                    volcanoes) proved fatal to many of the inhabitants of Kaflu; and the damage to
                    be feared from the ashes thrown out by the same mountain interferes with the <pb

                    districts of Probolingo and Remaneh. In 1879 the Preanger Regencies were visited
                    by several severe shocks, and a number of persons were killed. Besides the
                    volcanoes themselves, there are a number of striking forms of volcanic activity
                    to be observed in the island, such as the so-called mud-volcano at Grobogan, the
                    gas-fountains or holy-fires of Melati Derat, and the Pakaraman or Guwa Upas
                    (Valley of Poison) in Banyumas on the Dieng mountains. Hot springs are
                    common.</p></note></p>

                <p>The central ridge, in which, with the single exception of Muriâ, all the volcanic
                    peaks are situated, contains a large number of other summits upwards of 6000
                    feet in height, and several—such as Wallet, Pangerangu, Merbabu, Gunong Butak,
                    G. Weliran, G. Argowulan, the Yang (Jang) mountains, G. Rαnte—rise beyond 9000
                    feet. On both the north and south sides the volcanic chain is flanked by ranges
                    composed of Tertiary rocks; these attain an elevation on the south frequently of
                    between 2000 and 4000 feet, and occasionally in the Preanger Regencies of 5000
                    or 6000 feet. To the northern flanking range belongs the whole of the island of
                    Madura, which has its highest point in Gunong Tambuko (1541 feet). The northern
                    versant of Java differs from the southern in the great development of its
                    alluvial border, which in one or two places widens out into considerable plains,
                    and from this it naturally results that the streams flowing into the Sea of Java
                    are both in length of course and volume of water more important than those that
                    fall into the Indian Ocean. Their number in both cases is very great; but none
                    even of the northern streams are navigable for vessels of burden, and only a <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> few for boats beyond the reach of the tide. They are
                    all more or less obstructed by mud or sandbanks at their mouths. In the Sunda
                    lands the river names are usually introduced by <hi rend="italic">Tji,</hi> the
                    Sunda word for river; the equivalent <hi rend="italic">Kali</hi> is prefixed
                    less frequently to the names in the Javanese portions of the island. The largest
                    and in some aspects the most useful of all the rivers is the Bengawan, or river
                    of Solo, so called from Solo, the popular name of the city of Surakarta. It is
                    in the residency of Surakarta that it takes its rise in the plain bounded by
                    Merapi on the W., by Lawu on the E., and by Gunong Kidul on the S., and it flows
                    through the residencies of Madiun, Reinbang, and Surabaya. Except for the last
                    three months of the dry season it is navigable for large boats, and during the
                    whole year for small ones. Next in magnitude to the Solo is the Brautas, called
                    in its lower part the Kalimas, and by Europeans the river of Surabaya Both
                    rivers debouch into the strait of Madura, and the rapid formation of alluvial
                    deposits in the neighbourhood of their mouths gives abundant proof of their
                    disintegrating agency. In 1818 the largest vessels were able to anchor in the
                    roadstead of Surabaya; by 1825 considerable caution had to be observed; and it
                    speedily became evident that the northern approach would soon be completely
                    closed. Between 1850 and 1854 the lower part of the Solo river was diverted into
                    a new channel, and a permanent fairway seemed to be secured. But the condition
                    of the strait has again been the object of solicitude, and two different schemes
                    have been under consideration for the removal of the lower course of the river
                    still further to the north. * All along the north coast of Java similar
                    accretions of land are taking place; and steam dredgers have to be kept at work
                    in all the important harbours.</p>
                <p>The endless disturbances produced in the original condition of the strata by the
                    continued activity of the volcanic forces render the task of the geologist
                    peculiarly difficult. The volcanic rocks for the most part appear to rest on
                    sedimentary rocks, and these in their turn are pretty certainly supported by
                    granite and syenite. That the sedimentary rocks should all (the modern alluvium
                    of course being excluded) be assigned to the Tertiary period was argued by
                    Junghuhn from the fact that in spite of their difference in composition and
                    character they all contain the same class of fossils; but a few striking
                    examples of fossils and formations that must belong to the diluvial division of
                    the Quarternary period have been pointed out by Staring and Verbeek. Throughout
                    the rocks remains of vertebrates are exceedingly scarce; but of invertebrates
                    there is a great profusion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    dispute.</p></note></p>
                <p>In keeping with its geological structure, Java appears in general to be in the

                <p>At Batavia, the only place where a long series of meteorological observations is
                    available, the greatest maximum temperature of the air between 1866 and 1878 was
                    96’08 Fahr., in November 1877, and the lowest minimum 66 02, in September of the
                    same year. The mean temperature during the same period was 78’69. Taking the
                    monthly means we find January 77’48, February 77'52, March 78'24, April 79’34,
                    May 79’59, June 78’83, July 78’25, August 79’14, September 79’35, October 79’50,
                    November 79’23, December 77’86. It is this long unbroken continuity of high
                    temperatures which proves trying to the European constitution, for the new-comer
                    seldom feels himself much oppressed by the heat. The maximum daily temperature
                    occurs in January, June, and July at 2 o’clock and in the other months at 1

                    lowest minimum 29’64 inches in December 1870. In the ten years 1866-1875 the
                    difference between the highest daily mean and the lowest was only 0’295 of an
                    inch.</p>
                <p>Java is situated in the region of the south-east trade wind, and that is the
                    prevailing direction of the wind during one half of the year, from April to
                    October. During the other half of the year a north-west or west wind (the
                    physical continuation of the north-east trade wind) blows with nearly equal
                    steadiness. The former period is known as the dry season or east monsoon, and
                    the latter as the rainy season or the west monsoon. The distinction between the
                    dry and the rainy seasons is most marked in the eastern portion of the island;
                    and indeed when we come as far west as Batavia it cannot be said that there is
                    any part of the year altogether free from rain. During the dry season the
                    well-known phenomenon of land and sea breezes is very distinctly exhibited;
                    during the rainy season, through obvious causes, the alternation becomes much
                    less regular.</p>

                <p>In a country of such bold and varied relief as Java, the rainfall naturally
                    differs very strikingly according to locality both in annual amount and in
                    distribution in time. In 1878, for example, the number of rainy days <hi

                    and Meteorological Observatory at Batavia</hi> (vol. i,, 1871; vol. iv.,
                    1879).</p></note><hi rend="italic">Vegetation.—</hi> The vegetation of Java is
                    rich and diversified. Few of the plants being deciduous, the island at all times
                    presents the same appearance as the most fertile temperate regions at the height
                    of summer. The villages and even the smaller towns are in great measure
                    concealed from view by the abundant and abiding verdure; and their position in
                    the landscape is to be recognized mainly by the different appearance presented
                    by their groves and orchards. The character of the vegetation as a matter of
                    course varies with the character of the soil; but at once more obvious and more
                    general are the modifications conditioned by increase of elevation. Junghuhn
                    divided the island into four botanical zones, and his division has been commonly
                    adopted by his successors. The first or tropical zone extends from the seaboard
                    to a height of 2000 feet; the second or that of moderate heat has its upper
                    limit at a height of about 4500 feet; the third or comparatively cool region
                    reaches a height of 7500 feet; and the fourth or coldest region comprises all
                    that lies above that elevation. It need hardly be added that the lines of
                    demarcation are far from rigid, and, if they were to follow the actual
                    appearance of certain definite vegetable forms, would ‘dip and rise at every
                    advance. It is at once evident also that from the structure of the island the
                    lowest zone has by far the most extensive area; the second indeed is only a
                    fiftieth of the first, and the third is only a five-thousandth. The lowest zone
                    is the region of the rice-fields and sugar plantations, of cocoa-nuts, cinnamon,
                    and cotton. According to their character the coasts are fringed with mangroves,
                    nipah, and other palm trees, and the kayu gabas <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Alstonia</hi><hi rend="italic">scholaris)</hi>; the ponds and lakelets are
                    covered with <hi rend="italic">Utricu-</hi><hi rend="italic">lamae</hi> and
                    lotus flowers; vast prairies are clothed with the silvery alang-alang grass,
                    broken by thickets of bamboos and patches of the taller eri grass and glagah.
                    The second zone is the region more especially of the coffee and the tea
                    plantations, of the areng or sugar palm, and of maize. In the forests there is a
                    great profusion of woody lianas, rotangs, and cissus varieties. In the third
                    zone, which consists mainly of the slopes of volcanic mountains, but also
                    comprises a few plateaus, there is little cultivation except in the Tenger
                    mountains, where the natives raise Indian corn, cabbage, and potatoes, and at
                    Simpungan</p>
                <p>(the highest village in Java, 6680 feet) on the Dieng plateau, where even tobacco
                    is most successfully cultivated. The fourth zone, so far as phanerogamous plants
                    are concerned, has a very restricted vegetation, somewhere about one hundred
                    species being known; but there is a corresponding abundance of cryptogams: fungi
                    are common, and mosses cover the ground and invest the trees. The whole flora of
                    this upper region bears a strong European cast.</p>
                <p>According to a writer in the <hi rend="italic">Tijdschrift van Nijverheid</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">Landbοuw,</hi> 1879, not less than
                    one-fourth to one-fifth of the area of Java is still covered with forest, in
                    spite of the fact that in various quarters reckless destruction has been allowed
                    to go on. The abundant moisture of the vegetation happily prevents the spread of
                    the fires by which the natives often clear the prairies or jungles. Extensive
                    tracts of virgin forest exist, more particularly in the south of the residencies
                    of Bantam, the Preanger Regencies, Banyumas, Pasuruan, Kediri, Probolingo,
                    Besuki, and Banyuwangi; and many of the principal mountains—G. Ayang, G. Tjermé,
                    G. Slamat, G. Wilis, G. Ardjunâ, G. Raon, &amp;c.—still preserve their natural
                    covering of luxuriant foliage. In the first zone the forests are largely
                    composed of <hi rend="italic">Magnoliaceae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anonaceae</hi>; but the loftiest trees are rather the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mimusops acuminata,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Spathodea gigantea,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Irina glabra,</hi> which reach a height of 120 feet. In the
                    second zone the first rank must be given to the rasamala <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Liguidambar Altingia),</hi> the trunks of which run straight up for 90 or 100
                    feet before they break into branches. The tree, however, is only found in the
                    Preanger Regencies and the contiguous portions of Buitenzorg. Among the other
                    trees more generally characteristic of the zone are the puspa <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Schima</hi><hi rend="italic">Noronhae),</hi> yielding fine, red, heavy timber,
                    the ki sapi <hi rend="italic">(Gordonia</hi><hi rend="italic">excelsa),</hi> the
                    gad ok <hi rend="italic">(Bischofia javanica),</hi> the bayur <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pterospermum Blumeanum),</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Epicharis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">densiflora.</hi> Throughout the greater part of both the lower
                    regions the banyan-tree and several closely allied forms are extremely
                    common.</p>
                <p>Hitherto comparatively little advantage has been taken of the Javanese wealth of
                    timber. If the native states and Madura be left out of account, all the woods
                    and forest, with the exception of such portions as have been formally disposed
                    of to private possessors, are considered as Government property, and are managed
                    under a new system introduced in 1874. By this the teak forests or plantations
                    are singled out for particular treatment. They exist in the residencies of
                    Tagal, Samarang, Japara, Surabaya, Madiun, Kediri, and are estimated to occupy
                    2300 square miles. The seaports where the timber trade is chiefly carried on are
                    Batavia, Samarang, Surabaya, and Gresik. The net profit realized by the
                    Government from the forest department was only £58,000 in 1879.</p>
                <p>Reforesting has been commenced in various places—more particularly on the
                    Sumbing, Sendârâ, Merbabu, and Unarang. The <hi rend="italic">Eucalyptus</hi><hi

                    largely employed by the Government for this purpose.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Zoology.—</hi> In respect of its fauna, Java differs from
                    Borneo, Sumatra, and the Malay peninsula far more than these differ among
                    themselves; and at the same time it shows close resemblances—not exhibited by
                    Borneo and Sumatra—to the Siamese peninsula and also to the Himalayas. No genus
                    and only five or six of the ninety species of Javanese mammals are confined to
                    the island; and of the two hundred and seventy species of land birds only forty
                    are peculiar. Thirteen genera of mammals, including the elephant, the tapir, and
                    the Malay bear, found in the rest of the Malay region, are altogether absent;
                    and twenty-five Malayan genera of birds—comprising jays, gapers, bee-eaters,

                <p>The Javanese rhinoceros, the largest of the mammals in the island, differs from
                    that of Sumatra in having only one horn instead of two. It ranges over the
                    highest mountains, and its regular paths— worn into deep channels—may be traced
                    up the steepest slopes and round the rims of even active volcanoes. Of wild
                    swine there are two species, <hi rend="italic">Sus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vittatus</hi> in the hot region and <hi rend="italic">Sus verrucosus</hi> in
                    the temperate. Both are extremely abundant, and their depredations are the cause
                    of much loss; in the residency of Japara, for instance, upwards of five thousand
                    have been killed in two months. Not much less than the rhinoceros is the banting
                    <hi rend="italic">or Bos sundaicus,</hi> to be found in all the uninhabited
                    districts between 2000 and 7000 feet oι elevation. The kidang or mintjac <hi

                    occurring singly or in pairs both in the mountains and in the coast districts;
                    the latter, living in herds of from fifty to one hundred in the grassy “opens,”
                    gives excellent sport to the native hunters. The kantjil <hi rend="italic"
                    >CΓragulus jaυanicus)</hi> is little bigger than a hare. The royal tiger—the
                    same species as that of India—is still frequent enough in the forests to make a
                    tiger-hunt a characteristic Javanese scene, and to permit the native princes to
                    exhibit at times a tiger and buffalo fight.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cheiroptera</hi> hold a prominent place in the fauna.
                    Remarkable especially for size is the kalong or flying-fox <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pteropus</hi><hi rend="italic">edulis),</hi> a fruit-eating bat, which may be
                    seen hanging during the day in black clusters asleep on the trees, and in the
                    evening hastening in dark flocks to its favourite feeding grounds in the forest.
                    The damage these do to the young cocoa-nut trees, the maize, and the sugar-palm
                    leads the native to snare and shoot them; and their flesh is good to eat.
                    Smaller kinds of bats are not less abundant,— perhaps the most common species
                    being the <hi rend="italic">Nycticejus TemminckH.</hi> In certain places they
                    congregate in myriads like seafowl on the cliffs, and their excrements produce
                    extensive guano deposits, which the natives of Surakarta and Madiun, for
                    example, utilize as sources of saltpetre. The house of Canneman, near Besuki, is
                    the chosen haunt of a monstrous colony which have successfully defied all
                    efforts made to expel them. The creature known to the Europeans as a flying cat,
                    and to the natives as the kubin, is the <hi rend="italic">Galeopithecus</hi><hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture,—</hi> In the eyes of a Javanese to lack rice is to
                    lack food. About the introduction of this divine cereal he tells strange
                    legends, considering it the offspring of the body of Dewie Srie. The priesthood
                    of this goddess is more influential often than that of the Prophet; at an autumn
                    festival the worshippers may be heard uttering the Mahometan Bismillah, and
                    following it up with the sevenfold repetition of her name. For a full harvest
                    the choice of a lucky day is of greater importance than the careful tillage of
                    the field; and to ensure a proper selection the Javanese must have the “windu,”
                    the year, the month, the day, the hour. In each of the eight years of the windu
                    a special method of ploughing, of sacrificing, praying, &amp;c., must be
                    employed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the first
                    year, for example, of the windu, <hi rend="italic">Alip,</hi> the work is begun
                    on Friday, and the first furrow is drawn from south to north in the middle of
                    the field. The sacrificial feast consists mainly of rice not cooked in steam <hi

                    an enlightened cultivator even of his one indispensable grain; and, though the
                    ancestral custom must in many cases be really the result of ancient experience,
                    the blindfold way in which it is applied results in very bad husbandry. The
                    cultivation of the rice appears at present to be often carried on at a dead
                    loss. The varieties of the cereal known to the Javanese are numerous; but they
                    are commonly grouped as <hi rend="italic">Oryza sativa,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >praecox,</hi><hi rend="italic">montana,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    and brought under imperfect or temporary tillage, or the tagal, which is
                    regularly subject year after year to the processes of husbandry.</p>
                <p>Some idea may be formed of the extent of agricultural activity in Java from the
                    following statement of the amount of land (in bouws,—the bouw or bahu being
                    about 1∣ acres) cultivated for their own use by the natives of Java and Madura,

                <p>In 1879, leaving out of view the native territories and the private estates, the
                    area under cultivation was 2,929,644 bouws. Of this aggregate, 1,504,052 bouws
                    were sawahs capable of irrigation, 813,153 sawahs dependent on the rains, 49,219
                    marsh-sawahs, and 563,220 tagal fields. The system of communal proprietorship
                    and annual redivision of the soil largely holds throughout Java, especially in
                    the case of the irrigated lands; in a large number of instances it has taken the
                    place of individual ownership within quite recent years, and in other instances
                    the opposite process has been carried through. There are villages where the
                    redistribution is repeated regularly every year, others where this is only done
                    as often as the number of legitimate share-takers is increased or diminished. In
                    some to prevent the excessive parcelling of the land a certain quota of the
                    claimants are kept in abeyance at each term of allotment. To the reclaimer of
                    virgin land belongs the ownership of the same. Details will be found in the

                    orchards in which their huts are embowered contain a great variety of fruits.
                    The cocoa-nut holds an increasingly important place,—the best of the many
                    varieties being the idjo; and the banana is even more common. For an account of

                <p>The Javanese possess buffaloes, ordinary cattle, horses, dogs, and cats. Attempts
                    made by the Government to introduce the ass (1841) and the camel (1843-45) were
                    not successful. The buffalo was probably introduced by the Hindus. The ordinary
                    cattle are of very mixed race; the Indian zebu having been crossed with the
                    banting and with European cattle of miscellaneous origin. The horses, though
                    small, are of excellent character, and their masters, according to their own
                    ideas, are extremely particular in regard to purity of race. Riding comes very
                    naturally to the Javanese; horse-races and tournays have been in vogue amongst
                    them from early times. The native sheep are of no value, for their wool, and the

                    but it was not till after 1721 that the yearly exports reached any considerable
                    amount. The aggregate quantity sold in the home market from 1711 to 1791 was
                    2,036,437 piculs (of 133 lb avoird.), and this must have represented nearly the
                    whole production of the island. By the beginning of the 19th century the annual
                    production was 120,000 piculs, and in spite of political interruptions this had
                    increased by 1825 to 268,000 piculs. After the introduction of the Van den Bosch
                    system a further augmentation was effected; and from the official reports it
                    appears that from 1840 to 1873 the amount has ranged from 769,000 to 1,234,000
                    piculs. During the ten years 1869-1878 the average annual produce of the
                    Government plantations was 878,000, that of the private planters 156,000 piculs.
                    In 1878 the actual quantity of Government coffee was 831,515 piculs, and it was
                    estimated that the total number of full grown plants in the island was
                    14,180,000. The collecting warehouses were 367.</p>
                <p>Next in importance to the coffee plant is the sugar cane. Between 1853 and 1857
                    the average production of Java was 1,652,112 piculs; between 1869 and 1873,
                    2,809,968; and between 1875 and 1880, 3,438,912; the corresponding numbers for
                    Brazil being 1,683,200, 2,176,000 and 2,110,256. The largest harvest in any
                    single year in Java during all that period was that of 1877, 3,721,984 piculs.
                    The cultivation of tea, commenced by Du Bus, lias also attained a considerable
                    development; in 1879 the production amounted to upwards of 5,700,000 lb. The
                    plantations are private enterprises on lands leased or granted as freehold by
                    the Government. Most of them are in Batavia (Depart. Buitenzorg) and the
                    Preanger Regencies. Cinchona is largely grown by the Government, and to some
                    extent by the private planters. In 1879 the Government had 1,678,670 trees; the
                    production was about 115,000 lb. Ten distinct varieties are in cultivation, <hi

                    preponderating. The tobacco plant is grown in nearly all the residencies, but
                    most extensively in Kediri and Besuki. The production for the foreign market
                    amounted in 1879 to 7,050,000 ft&gt;.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The cultivation of the great wealth-giving crops of Java has long been carried on
                    in the interest of the Government, the native peasantry being obliged to devote
                    so much of their soil and toil to satisfy the demands of their European masters.
                    The system by which, in this regard, the relations of the Government to the
                    native were for a long time determined is generally known as the “culture
                    system.” Introduced in 1830 by Van den Bosch, it continued in force till 1873,
                    and has not altogether disappeared even yet. As far back as 1856 modifications
                    of its arrangements were introduced by Duijmaer van Twist; and the position of
                    the native was further improved by Sloet van de Beele. The reforms were for a
                    time retarded by Governor Mijer; but in 1870, under the colonial minister Waal,
                    a new agrarian law was passed which permitted the cession of uncultivated ground
                    to Europeans on a lease of seventy-five years. The principal object of the
                    “culture system” was the coffee plant, and it is only gradually that the
                    restrictions of the older regulation have been relaxed. In 1872 a new regulation
                    was introduced into the Preanger Regencies; in 1875 it was extended to the rest
                    ôf the island with the exception of Pasuruan and the Tenger mountains; and in
                    1877 it was made applicable in Pasuruan likewise. By this new system the large
                    plantations at a distance from the abodes of the “culture” peasants are to be
                    replaced by smaller planta tions near the villages; no service is demanded from
                    those whose lands and gardens are below a definite minimum, and the people
                    cannot be called out for field work <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >masse</hi>; fifty coffee plants is the greatest number that any one can be
                    called on to plant in a year. The general scope of the newer legislation is to
                    leave as much as possible to private initiative, native and European, but it
                    will be a long time before the leading strings can be altogether dropped. In the
                    words of Mr Kesteren :—</p>
                <p>“The Javanese knows no freedom. His whole existence is ‘ regulationed. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> If he is bound to render ‘ culture ’-service, the
                    administration shows him to what department to apply himself, when and how he
                    must plant. If he is not bound to render ‘ culture ’-service, but has the
                    position of a so-called free agriculturist, tlje administration prescribes the
                    time and method of sowing and planting his land. If he wishes to fix his
                    habitation outside his village, the village chief may prevent him. If he has a
                    dwelling of his own, the administration decides for him what sort of materials
                    he must use for the roof. If lie has a hanging night lamp in his bamboo hut, he
                    must not hang it against the wall.”</p>
                <p>It is not in the coffee plantations only that his service is demanded by the
                    Government. In 1879 there were 2,030,136 persons subject to the corvée; and the
                    actual days of work required were 32,197,561, the greatest number of days which
                    can be exacted from any indivi dual being 52 per annum. To watch the Government
                    warehouses, to escort prisoners, to keep the roads and bridges in repair, to
                    give assistance to persons travelling in the public sendee, are some of the many
                    tasks which the native is called on to perform.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mechanic Arts.—</hi> In these the Javanese are in advance of
                    the other peoples of the archipelago. Of thirty different crafts practised among
                    them, the most important are those of the blacksmith or cutler, the carpenter,
                    the kris-sheath-maker, the coppersmith, the goldsmith, and the potter. Their
                    skill in the working of the metals is the more noteworthy as they have to import
                    the raw materials. The most esteemed product of the blacksmith’s skill is the
                    kris; every man and boy above the age of fourteen wears one at least as part of
                    his ordinary dress, and men of rank two and sometimes four. In the finishing and
                    adornment of the finer weapons no expense is spared; and ancient krises of good
                    workmanship sometimes fetch enormous prices.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The reader will find drawings of a great variety of kris

                    gold and silver work possesses considerable beauty, but there is nothing equal
                    to the filigree of Sumatra; the brass musical instruments are of exceptional
                    excellence. Both bricks and tiles are largely made, as well as a coarse unglazed
                    pottery similar to that of Hindustan; but all the finer wares are imported from
                    China. Cotton spinning, weaving, and dyeing are carried on for the most part as
                    purely domestic operations by the women. The usual mode of giving variety of
                    colour is by weaving in stripes with a succession of different-coloured yarns,
                    but another mode is to cover with melted wax or damar the part of the cloth not
                    intended to receive the dye. This process is naturally a slow one, and has to be
                    repeated according to the number of colours required. As a consequence the
                    “battiks,” as the cloths thus treated are called, are in request by the
                    wealthier classes. European imitations are easily detected, and do not pass
                    muster; but a more rapid process of battiking by means of hand stamps has begun
                    to be employed both by native and Chinese workers. For the most part quiet
                    colours are preferred. To the Javanese of the present day the ancient buildings
                    of the Hindu periods are the work of supernatural power. Except when employed by
                    his European master he seldom builds anything more substantial than a bamboo or
                    timber frame work; but in the details of such erections he exhibits both skill
                    and taste. When Europeans first came to the island they found native vessels of
                    large size well entitled to the name of ships; and, though shipbuilding proper
                    is now carried on only under the direction of Europeans, boat-building is a very
                    extensive native industry along the whole of the north coast—the boats sometimes
                    reaching a burden of 50 tons.</p>
                <p>The only one of the higher arts which the Javanese have carried to any degree of
                    perfection is music; and in regard to the value of their efforts in this
                    direction Europeans differ greatly. The orchestra <hi rend="italic"
                    >(gamelari)</hi> consists of wind, string, and percussion instruments, the
                    latter being in preponderancy to the other two. (Details on the instruments will
                    be found in Raffles, and a description of a performance in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tour du Monde,</hi> 1880. ) In connexion with this attention may be called to
                    the wayangs or puppet plays, in which grotesque figures of gilded leather are
                    moved by the performer, who recites the appropriate speeches, and as occasion
                    demands plays the part of chorus. At least one Javanese, Raden Saleh, has
                    attained eminence as a painter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The data for tracing the increase of the
                    population are far from satisfactory; and the returns even of the present time

                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In 1781 Radermacher estimated the population
                    of Java at 2,029,915 souls; in 1795 Nederburg gave it as at least three and a
                    half millions, and Daendels in 1808-1811 as over 3,77O,OOO. It was certainly not
                    on the side of excess that these estimates erred. About 1815 the first real
                    census of the population, carried out by Raffles, gave an aggregate of
                    4,615,270—Java 4,390,661, and Madura 224,609—of whom 4,499,250 were natives.

                    Indie,</hi> 1847), the total about 1845 was 9,542,045, of whom 9.373,989 were
                    natives. The only year since 1∙849 in which, according to the official returns,
                    there has been a decrease in the population is 1850, due to the famine and
                    pestilence that prevailed in Demak and Grobogan. There appears to be about the

                <p>The population has thus increased considerably since 1872, when the return showed
                    a total of 17,291,200. The most densely peopled districts (those occupied by the
                    Javanese proper) have a greater number of inhabitants to the square mile than

                    have in comparison a sparse population.</p>
                <p>The Government returns furnish the population of only the three largest towns. At
                    the close of 1878 Batavia (town and suburbs) contained 97,585 inhabitants, of
                    whom 4427 were Europeans, 23,466 Chinese, 68,822 natives, and 890 Arabs,
                    &amp;c.; the numbers for Samatang (total 79,443) were Europeans 2976, Chinese
                    7088, natives, 66,691, Arabs, &amp;c., 2688, and for Surabaya (total 118,824),
                    Europeans 4471, Chinese 6293, natives 106,599, Arabs, &amp;c., 1461. It thus
                    appears that iu respect of population Batavia is only second. The great bulk of
                    the population is distributed over the country in villages usually called by
                    Europeans dessas, from the Low Javanese word <hi rend="italic">désâ</hi> (High
                    Javanese <hi rend="italic">dusun).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    containing from 100 to 1000 families are exceptionally large), forms an
                    independent community; and no sooner does it attain to any considerable size
                    than it sends off a score of families or so to form a new dessa. Each lies in
                    the midst of its own area of cultivation. The general enceinte is formed by an
                    impervious hedge of bamboos 40 to 70 feet high. Within this lie the houses, each
                    with its own enclosure or garth, which, even when the fields are the communal
                    property, belongs to the individual householder. In the centre of the alun-alun
                    or forum there is usually a giant wariιιgin or tjariιιgin tree <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Urostigma benjaminunι),</hi> and on the west side stands the mosque. The

                    general type, but consists of several kampongs or villages. The houses in the
                    strictly Javanese districts are always built on the ground; in the Sunda lands
                    they are raised on piles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The principal local European authority is
                    known as the <hi rend="italic">resident,</hi> who exercises judicial, financial,
                    and administrative functions. As president of the council <hi rend="italic"
                    >(l.andraad')</hi> and judge of the residency court he deals both with civil and
                    with criminal cases; and he also acts as police magistrate in his more immediate
                    district. Each of the <hi rend="italic">assistant residents</hi> administers
                    under his supervision one of the territorial departments <hi rend="italic"
                    >(pfdeeliηgs)</hi> into which each residentship is divided. Next in rank is the
                    European secretary of the resident, who, as occasion demands, acts as the
                    resident’s substitute as president of the council, and performs a great variety
                    of duties as recorder, notary public, registrar, &lt;fcc. Subject to the
                    assistant resident is the controller. “It is his first duty to look after the
                    interests of the native population, and he may be considered as the link that
                    connects the European with the native functionaries.” His district is of so
                    limited an extent that he is able to make a personal inspection of every portion
                    of it once a month, and to become intimately acquainted with all the native
                    officials within its boundaries. There is almost nothing which can be considered
                    as affecting either the welfare of the population or the success of the
                    Government administration which lies beyond the scope of his supervision. At the
                    same time he is entrusted with a very small share of executive authority; his
                    function is to observe, to advise, to report. Under the perpetual guidance of
                    these residents, assistant residents, and controllers, a large part of the
                    administration of the country is carried on by the native functionaries. Of
                    these the highest is the <hi rend="italic">regent,</hi> whose rank and right of
                    precedence is superior even to that of all European officials below the
                    resident. Always belonging to one of the ancient noble families, he maintains
                    the state and retinue of an independent prince, with all the elaborate
                    environment of Oriental etiquette. He receives a large salary from the Dutch
                    Government, possesses, in virtue of his office, a landed estate, and exercises
                    large authority over the people of his regency. By the European officials also
                    he is treated with full respect and consideration. But, appointed by the
                    governor-general, he, as much as any ordinary official in the civil service,
                    holds his office by the good-will of the Dutch Government. Insubordination is
                    followed by dismissal; and dismissal involves the forfeiture of all the wealth
                    and prestige which he possessed as regent. The regent’s substitute is known as
                    <hi rend="italic">pattih.</hi> The several districts of the regency (there are
                    usually five or six) are administered by a <hi rend="italic">wedaηα
                    (wedono)</hi> or <hi rend="italic">demaηg∙,</hi> and secondary subdivisions by

                    (salaried). The wedânâ has also at his disposal a considerable number of

                    there that Daendels established his great entrenched camp, and it was there that
                    the battle was fought (in 1811) which placed Java in the hands of the British.
                    About 14 miles from Batavia lies <hi rend="italic">Tangerang,</hi> a small but
                    busy place, with several thousand Chinese among its inhabitants. In its vicinity

                <p>The Krawang residency is one of the least populous in the whole island. The great
                    post road does not enter the territory; the resident has less direct authority
                    over his district than is enjoyed by his official compeers, and has no assistant

                    character to Bandung, though the removal of the resident and his subordinates
                    has produced a certain decline in its importance. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tjitjalengka,</hi> in the very heart of the coffee districts, has developed
                    greatly since the new system was introduced in 1870, and is certain to make
                    further progress when the projected railways give it better communication with
                    Bandung and Batavia. <hi rend="italic">Sumedang</hi> is already a populous and
                    prosperous negârâ. The ancient settlement of this name lay in another part of
                    the regencies.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chcribon</hi> (Tjeribon) is one of the most important places in
                    Java, though the unhealthiness of the site has caused a number of the principal
                    Europeans to settle about 2 miles to the north at Tangkil. The church erected in
                    1842, the regent’s residence, large warehouses for coffee and salt, and a prison
                    are among the principal buildings. The native part of the town is to some extent
                    laid out in European style. The Chinese quarter, large and populous, possesses
                    the finest Chinese temple in Java. Cheribon is the residence of the descendants
                    of the old sultan of Cheribon. The palaces are not so extensive as those of
                    Surakarta and Jokjokarta. By the mud bank at its mouth, the Tjeribon (Shrimp
                    River) does more harm than good to the town. The harbour is only kept available
                    by constant dredging, but the roadstead is very good, all the year round. A
                    strange pleasure palace of Sultan Sepuh, frequently described by travellers,
                    lies about 2 miles from Cheribon near Sunya Raja. <hi rend="italic">Mundu,</hi>
                    a village 4 miles south-east of Cheribon, is remarkable as the only spot on the
                    north coast of Java which is visited by the <hi rend="italic">ikan prut</hi> or
                    belly fish, a species about as large as a cod, caught in thousands, and salted
                    by the local fishermen. <hi rend="italic">Indramayu</hi> lies on both sides of
                    the Tji Manuk, about 8 miles from the coast. It is mentioned as Dermayo in the
                    old Portuguese and Dutch travels. As a port for the rice of the district of
                    Indramayu, and for the coffee of the Preanger and Cheribon, the town seemed at
                    one time to have a great commercial future before it, but the roadstead was safe
                    only during the east monsoon. The river has a tendency to send its waters by the
                    channel of the Kali Rambatan, and a process of silting up is going on rapidly.
                    In 1876 the Government began the construction of works to prevent the change of
                    course.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tagal</hi> has long been one of the chief towns in
                    Java,—foreign commerce, and native trade, industry, and fisheries, being all
                    well developed. About 1845 Dr Bleekeι∙ estimated its population at 29,536, and,
                    if the growth of the town has been similar to that of the residency, the total
                    may now be set down as about 80,000. Since 1871 the harbour has been the object
                    of various improvements. The town is regularly and well built. The native
                    stonecutters, carpenters, dyers, and smiths of Tagal are particularly skilful.
                    <hi rend="italic">Pamalang</hi> is a thriving coast village, noteworthy for the
                    quality of the oysters. <hi rend="italic">Pekalongan</hi> (“abode of the
                    kalongs”) is, like Tagal, an important town. It posssesses a large mosque, a
                    Protestant church, a fort (now used as a prison and barracks), and a large
                    number of European houses. The Chinese ward consists of neat stone or brick
                    buildings. Dr Bleeker estimated the population at 15,000 in 1848; it must be now
                    considerably more. The name of Pekalongan is associated with the smoked ducks
                    prepared in the district. <hi rend="italic">Batang</hi> is only 5 miles
                    distant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Samarang</hi> lies on the Kali Ngaran near the centre of the
                    north coast. Round the market place are grouped the residences of the regent and
                    his substitute, the mosque, thé military hospital, the town-house (erected in
                    1854-1864), the Government warehouses, &amp;c. The hospital, formerly the palace
                    of the governor of the north-east coast, has accommodation for 550 European
                    patients. The town was formerly surrounded by a wall and ditch, but these were
                    removed in 1824, and it is now protected by a fort and a coast battery. The old
                    European portion of the town is almost the exact reproduction of a Dutch town,
                    without the slightest accommodation to the exigencies of the climate. A new
                    impulse was given to Samarang by the opening of the railway to Surakarta and
                    Jokjokarta (1873). As a seaport the place is unfortunately situated: the river
                    is long since silted up; the roads are insecure during the west monsoon; it was
                    only after many delays that in 1879 the artificial canal, commenced in 1858 as a
                    substitute for the river, became available; and in the opinion of the Government
                    commission of 1876 it would be useless to attempt the erection of works similar
                    to those of Batavia. <hi rend="italic">Demak,</hi> the chief town of a regency
                    famous in the ancient Javanese history, lies 13 miles north-east of Samarang.
                    The mosque, erected by the first sultan of Demak, was rebuilt in 1845, and only
                    a small part of the old structure has been preserved; but the tombs of several
                    of the sultans are to be seen near at hand. <hi rend="italic">Salatiga</hi>
                    (that is, “Three Stones,” with allusion to three temples now destroyed) was in
                    early times one of the regular resting-places for ambassadors proceeding from
                    the coast to the court of Mataram; and in the European history of Java its name
                    is associated with the peace of 1755 and the capitulation of 1811. It is the
                    headquarters of the only regiment of cavalry in the Dutch East Indian army.
                    Besides the garrison, the European population numbers some 400 or 500 persons.
                    About the same number of Europeans are settled at <hi rend="italic"

                    Van den Bosch intended to make the central point of the Javanese system of

                    its harbour is the best in the island. Since 1849 it has been the seat of
                    Government dockyards and arsenals; and there are also extensive barracks, a

                    Javanese proper, the Sundanese, and the Madurese. All three belong to the Malay
                    stock. Between Javanese and Sundanese the distinction is mainly due to the
                    influence of the Hindus on the former and the absence of this on the latter.
                    Between Javanese and Madurese the distinction—not so deeply wrought—is rather to
                    be ascribed to difference of natural environment. The Sundanese have best
                    retained the Malay type, both in physique and fashion of life. They occupy the
                    five residencies of Bantam, Batavia, Krawang, Cheribon, and the Preanger
                    Regencies. The limits of the Madurese area are not so easily given. Besides the
                    island of Madura, the residencies to the east of Surabaya and Kediri are largely
                    occupied by them. The residencies of Tagal, Pekalongan, Banyumas, Bagelen, Kadu,
                    Samarang, Japara, Surakarta, Jokjokarta, Rembang, Madiun, Kediri, and Surabaya
                    have an almost purely Javanese population. Professor Veth estimates the number
                    of the Sundanese at about 4,000,000, the Madurese at 1,600,000, and the Javanese
                    at 11,500,000. The Javanese are the most civilized of the three peoples.</p>
                <p>The colour of the skin in all three cases presents various shades of
                    yellowish-brown with a touch of olive-green; and it is observed that, owing
                    perhaps to the Hindu strain, the Javanese are generally darker than the
                    Sundanese. The eyes are always brown or black, the hair of the head black, long,
                    lank, and coarse. Neither breast nor limbs are provided with hair, and there is
                    hardly even the suggestion of a beard. In stature the Malay is usually less than
                    the European. The Sundanese is less than the Javanese proper, being seldom 5
                    feet in height; at the same time he is more stoutly built. The Madurese is as
                    tall as the Javanese, and as stout as the Sundanese. The eye is usually set
                    straight in the head in the Javanese and Madurese; athong the Sundanese it is
                    often oblique. The nose is generally flat and small, with wide nostrils; but
                    among the Javanese it not unfrequently becomes aquiline. The lips are thick but
                    well formed; the teeth are naturally white, but often filed and stained. The
                    cheek bones are well developed, more particularly with the Madurese. In
                    expressiveness of countenance the Javanese and Madurese are far in advance of
                    the Sundanese. The women are not so well made as the men, and among the lower
                    classes especially soon grow absolutely ugly. In the eyes of the Javanese a
                    golden yellow complexion is the perfection of female beauty :—“She shone bright
                    even in the dark” is the highest compliment of poetic adulation (compare
                    Raffles, <hi rend="italic">Java,</hi> vol. i. p. 92). To judge by their early
                    history, the Javanese must have been a warlike and vigorous people, with
                    somewhat of ferocity to boot. Àt present they are peaceable, docile, sober,
                    simple, and industrious. The practice of running amuck is of very rare
                    occurrence among them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Religion.—</hi> The Javanese are nominally Mahometans, as in
                    former times they were Buddhists and Brahmans; but in reality, not only such
                    exceptional groups as the Kalaugs of Surakarta and Jokjokarta and the Baduwis or
                    nomad tribes of Bantam, but the great mass of the people must be considered as
                    believers rather in the primitive animism of their ancestors, and in the essence
                    of their creed but little removed from their ruder brethren the Dayaks of Borneo
                    and the Battaks of Sumatra. Into the original web indeed they have from time to
                    time introduced fragments from every religious system with which they have come
                    into contact; and no attempt has been made to rationalize into even superficial
                    harmony the rudest of the resulting incongruities. The number of the spirits
                    (Hyang or Yang, and with honorific prefix Sanghyang) worshipped by the Javanese
                    is limitless. Every village has its patron spirit, whose presence was the
                    indispensable condition of its foundation; to his influence all the fortune,
                    good or bad, of the village is ascribed. Under a great shadowy tree stands an
                    altar on which the worshipper lays his offering of incense and flowers, uttering
                    meanwhile in broken Arabic the alien formula—“There is no God but God, and
                    Mahomet is his prophet.” To every field likewise belongs its special patron
                    spirit, to whom due reverence must be shown. Nor is protection the only office
                    of the Hyang. Mentik causes a particular disease in the rice; Sawan produces
                    convulsions in children: gout and rheumatism are ascribed to the influence of
                    Dengen; Ki or Kyai Belorong gives men wealth in exchange for their souls. Ratu
                    Loro Kidul is princess of the southern sea, and has her seat among the caves and
                    fiords of the southern coast. Within the region of her sway the Javanese will
                    not speak loud lest he disturb the repose of her subject spirits. Near Rongkob
                    in Jokjokarta, one of the places where edible nests are collected, the princess
                    has a temple which none may enter save the priest alone; and similar temples
                    exist in similar localities. The whole life of the Javanese, indeed, is
                    enveloped in a mesh of mystery; not the stars only and the heavens rain
                    influence, but from every object a spiritual emanation, invisible for the most
                    part, but potent and exhaustless, flows forth to him for blessing or for curse.
                    Even Mahometanism with its One God has done little more than increase the number
                    of supersensual beings to whom he prays. To Joseph he presents offerings that he
                    may obtain beautiful children, to Solomon for honour and rank, to Moses for
                    bravery, to Jesus for learning. The ritual of his religion—and his whole round
                    of life is part of his religion—is intricate almost beyond conception, and at
                    the same time rigid and precise. Everything must be done by rule and rubric; the
                    unwritten law handed down from father to son allows of no curtailment or
                    modification. Each individual class of offering must be prepared in its own
                    peculiar way; the rice, for example,—which is one of the chief sacrificial
                    substances,—must now be white, now red, now hard, now soft.</p>
                <p>As we ascend in the social scale we find the name of Mahometan more and more
                    applicable; and consequently in spite of the paganism of the populace the
                    influence of the Mahometan “priests” (this is their official title in Dutch) is
                    widespread and real. Great prestige attaches to the name of Mecca pilgrim. In
                    every considerable town there is a mosque. Compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Indian
                    Archipelago,</hi> vol. xii. p. 819.</p>
                <p>For the Christianizing of the Javanese very little has been done. In East Java
                    the chief mission stations are Modjo Warno (with a population of 2327 souls in
                    1879, inclusive of seven out-stations), Kediri (698), and Malang (700),
                    maintained by the Netherlands Missionary Society, and Japara maintained by the
                    Dutch Baptist Society. In West Java the Netherlands Mission Union has seven
                    stations—Tjandjur, Buitenzorg, Indramayu, Sukabumi, Sumedang, Madjalengka, and
                    Cheribon. At Depok, 18 miles from Batavia, the Batavian Missionary Society
                    established in 1878 a seminary for native preachers. The native church of Depok
                    was originated by Cornelis Chastelein, who left his estate to his slaves, whom
                    he liberated on condition of their embracing Christianity. Mr Brückner of
                    Samarang, appointed to Java in 1812 by the Netherlands Society, translated the
                    New Testament into Javanese, but the work was confiscated by the Government.
                    Gericke, an agent of the Netherlands Bible Society, was more fortunate; his
                    versions of both the Old and the New Testament, as well as his grammar and
                    dictionary (edited by Roorda, Amst., 1843, 1847), have seen more than one

                    intrusive Malay, Javanese has a full right to its name as the dominant speech of
                    the island. It is not one language, but two. The nobles speak to the commonalty
                    in the language of the commonalty, the commonalty to the nobles in the language
                    of the nobles; and according to clearly understood regulations of etiquette
                    every Javanese plays the part of nobleman or commoner to his interlocutor. The
                    aristocratic form is known as <hi rend="italic">Krama</hi> or court speech, the
                    popular as <hi rend="italic">Ngoko,</hi> or the “thou-”ing speech (Fr., <hi
                    rend="italic">tutoyant,</hi> Germ., <hi rend="italic">duzend)</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and between the two forms there is a sort of compromise,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Hadja</hi> or middle speech, employed by those who stand
                    to each other on an equal and friendly footing, or by those who feel little
                    constraint of etiquette. For every idea that can be expressed in the language
                    Krâmâ has one expression, Ngoko another, the two words being sometimes
                    completely different, sometimes only differing in the termination, the
                    beginning, or the middle. Thus every Javanese makes use of two languages, and,
                    what is more difficult, of two languages delicately differentiated from each
                    other. Javanese as now spoken is far from being the same as the language of the
                    old inscriptions and manuscripts. The latter (which is usually called Kawi,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tn full form tembung or basa
                    Kawi, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the “language of poems.”</p></note> though
                    some scholars insist on the name Old Javanese) was probably based on the
                    Javanese of Mâdjâkerto, while the Krâmâ of the present day finds its type in
                    that of Surakarta. It is easy to explain the existence of the Krâmâ and the
                    Ngoko. The Hindu conquerors of Java, in gradually adopting the speech of their
                    Malay subjects modified it to suit their own taste and sense of superiority; and
                    the subjects meanwhile continued to speak as they were wont. In its vocabulary
                    Javanese Krâmâ has a large number of words of Sanskrit origin; and in modern

                    modern Javanese it is a purely native poem; its kings and heroes find their
                    place in the native history ’-and serve as ancestors to their noble families.

                <p>In the literature of modern Javanese there exists a great variety of so-called
                    <hi rend="italic">babads</hi> or chronicles. It is sufficient to mention the
                    “history” of Baron Sakender, which appears to give an account— often hardly
                    recognizable—of the settlement of Europeans in Java (Cohen Stuart has published
                    text and translation; Professor Veth gives an analysis of the contents), and the

                    of the island to 1647 of the Javanese era. Even more numerous are the
                    puppet-plays which usually take their subjects from the Hindu legends or from
                    those relating to the kingdoms of Madjapahit and Padjadjaram (see, <hi

                    succeeded a Mahometan-Javanese literature consisting largely of translations or
                    imitations of Arabic originals; it comprises religious romances, moral
                    exhortations, and mystical treatises in great variety.</p>

                    the west of the right bank of the Prâgâ, which falls into the Indian Ocean. A
                    hill rising above the plain 154 feet afforded a ready site for the structure,
                    and the lava blocks with which the ground was strewn supplied abundance of
                    material. The accompanying view and ground plan will give some idea of the

                    hill at a height of 50 feet; 5 feet above this there is a second terrace, each
                    side 365 feet; 11 feet higher comes a third terrace of similar shape; and then
                    follow four other ramparts and four other terraces. The whole structure is
                    crowned by a cupola 52 feet in diameter, surrounded by sixteen smaller
                    bell-shaped cupolas. It is suggestive of the richness of the style to mention
                    that on the outside of the wall of the second enceinte there are one hundred and
                    four niches, each with its image of Buddha on a lotus throne hewn out of a
                    single block 5 feet high; and between the niches are sitting figures, man and
                    woman alternately. The inside of the same enceinte is even more richly adorned
                    with at least five hundred and sixty-eight bas reliefs, representing scenes in
                    the Buddha legend. Of the chronological date of the temple there is no certain
                    knowledge, but it contains evidence enough in itself to fix its position in the
                    historical movement of the Hindu creeds.</p>
                <p>“The mixture of Buddhism and Brahmanism is best seen,” says R. Friederich <hi

                    three upper and inner galleries of Boro Budur. In the first we see the history
                    of Çakyamuni from the annunciation of his descent from the heaven of Indra till
                    his transformation into Buddha, with some scenes of his life. The thirteen first
                    scenes in the second gallery likewise represent Buddha as a teacher with his
                    pupils; after that it would seem as if a concordat had been formed between the
                    different cults; we have first in three separate scenes Buddha, Vishnu (Batara
                    Guru), and Siva, all together, and other groups follow, Buddhistic and Sivaite
                    without distinction. It is only in the fourth gallery that we again find Buddha
                    dominant Already in the first gallery we also see Brahmanic divinities, Garonda
                    for example, but not in separate scenes. In my opinion the cupola is the
                    principal and the most ancient part of the temple of Boro Budor; it must have
                    been intended to serve as a daha-gopa (dagoba), <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a
                    place for the enshrining of relics. I do not as yet know of any other dagoba in
                    Java; but I should not be surprised at their discovery. The dagobas of Ceylon
                    have an exterior resemblance to the Boro Budur cupola; but I prefer to classify
                    it rather with the topes or stupas of Afghanistan.”</p>
                <p>The writer goes on to point out that the sculptures of the lower galleries are
                    not so carefully finished; and the lions and some other subjects on the outside
                    of the temple have never been completed. About 3 miles to the north-east of Bârâ
                    Budur, and probably belonging to the same period, stands another beautiful
                    temple—Tjandi Mendut or Mundut—on the left bank of the Ellâ before it joins the
                    Prâgâ. It was first discovered by Hartmann, the resident of Magelang, in 1834,
                    under the sand and ashes with which the Merapi volcano had covered it. See C. W.
                    Mieling’s <hi rend="italic">Jaυasche Oudheden,</hi> 1852 and 1856; and Colonel

                <p>On the Dieng plateau in Bagelen, mentioned as a holy mountain in the oldest known
                    Javanese inscription, there exists a remarkable group of temples—which has been
                    styled the Benares of Central Java. They stand 6500 feet above the sea; and
                    roads and stairways (locally known as Buddha’s roads) lead up from the lowlands
                    of Bagelen and Pekalongan. The stairway betλveen Lake Mendjer and Lake Tjebong
                    alone consisted of upwards of 4700 steps. A great subterranean channel served to
                    drain the plateau. The Tjandis are very numerous, the largest and most beautiful
                    being Tjandi Bimâ, but the best preserved the Ardjunâ group. The buildings are
                    unfortunately covered to about a third of their height. In the same residency as
                    Dieng are situated the temple caves of Kutâ Ardjâ discovered by Kinder in 1853.
                    They are distributed in four groups, and apparently from the linga symbol belong
                    to the worship of Siva. Near Râgâ Djampi (Banyuwangi) are the rains of the town
                    of Matjan Putιh—of astonishing extent, but for the most part only shapeless
                    mounds. The town walls were 12 feet high and 6 feet broad. A temple built of
                    white limestone is the chief ruin. It seems to belong to the late Siva period of
                    Javanese Hindu art. The much more famous city of Mâdjâpahit has left its ruins
                    not far from Mâdjâkerto, in Surabaya.</p>
                <p>Of the minor antiquities of Java the most valuable are the inscriptions on stone
                    and copper, though, owing to the variety of the characters which have been
                    employed, the task of deciphering and interpreting is peculiarly difficult. The
                    proposal of the Batavian Society in 1843 to issue a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corpus</hi> of Javanese inscriptions came to ,nought; of private investigators
                    the most successful are Friederich and Kern. The inscriptions of Batu Beragung
                    (1347) and Payer-rayung (1356), that on an image of Buddha now in the Berlin
                    Museum, that on a rock in the Dieng mountains discovered by Junghuhn, and that
                    preserved at Minto House, in Scotland, are considered of special importance. At
                    Sukuh and Tjeta, on the slope of Lawu, there is a peculiar series in a special
                    character deciphered by Van der Vlis. The famous Menang Kebau inscriptions,
                    being the work of Javanese settlers, belong rather to Java than Sumatra; but
                    Professor Kern has shown that, instead of being, as at. one time supposed, the
                    oldest epigraphic monument in the Archipelago, they really belong to the most
                    modern Hindu period <hi rend="italic">{cf.</hi> Cohen Stuart in <hi

                    It is not improbable that it was first applied either to Sumatra or to what was

                    being at once recognized. Jawa Dwipa, or “land of millet,” may have been the

                    pilgrim of the 4th or 5th century. The oldest form of the name in Arabic is
                    apparently Zâbej. The first epigraphic occurrence of Jawa is in an inscription
                    of 1343. In Marco Polo the name is the common appellation of all the Sunda
                    islands. The Jawa of Ibn Batuta is Sumatra; Java is his Mui Jawa <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The history of Java in its main outlines can be
                    very briefly given; in detail it is burdened with endless complications,
                    inconsistent accounts, and imaginative adornments. It is impossible to extract a
                    rational narrative from the earlier <hi rend="italic">babads</hi> or native
                    chronicles, and even the later are destitute of any satisfactory chronology. The
                    first great moment in the history is the ascendency of the Hindus, and that
                    breaks up into three periods, —a period of Buddhism, a period of aggressive
                    Sivaism, and a period of apparent compromise. Of the various Hindu states that
                    were established in the island, that of Madjapahit was the most widely dominant;
                    its tributaries were many, and it even extended its sway into other parts of the
                    archipelago.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The work

                    The second moment of the history is the invasion of Islam in the beginning of
                    the 15th century; and the third is the establishment of European and more
                    particularly of Dutch influence and authority in the island. In its general
                    features this last and most important section reads very much like the narrative
                    of the British subjugation of India. At the time when the Dutch East Indian
                    Company began to fix its trading factories on the coast towns, the chief native
                    state was Mataram, which had in the 16th century succeeded to the overlordship
                    possessed by the house of Demak—one of the states that rose after the fall of
                    Madjapahit. The “emperors of Java,” as the princes of Mataram are called in the
                    early accounts, had their capital at Karta-sura, now an almost deserted place, 6
                    miles west of Surakarta. At first and for long the company had only forts and
                    little fragments of territory at Jakatra (Batavia), &amp;c.; but in 1705 it
                    obtained definite possession of the Preanger by treaty with Mataram; and in 1745
                    its authority was extended over the whole north-east coast, from Cheribon to
                    Banyuwangi. In 1755 the kingdom of Mataram <pb break="no"

                    the European ascendency was rather strengthened than weakened; and the great
                    Java war (1825-30), in which Dipa Negârâ. made a last great struggle to maintain
                    the position of the native dynasty, resulted in the complete success of the
                    Dutch.</p>

                    vols., Haarlem, 1875-80. ’ lhe first volume tonsists of a general description of
                    the geography, flora, fauna, inhabitants, language, &amp;c.; the second gives a
                    history of the native states (leaving the growth of the Dutch power, already
                    treated in detail by De Jonge, as much as possible out of view); and the third
                    presents a topographical description of each of the residencies. The very
                    existence of such a work implies the previous existence of a vast literature on
                    its subject. Besides Junghuhn, Raffles, and others referred to above, and under
