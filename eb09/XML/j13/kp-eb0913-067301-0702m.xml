                    legend of a Jew doomed to wander until the day of judgment, for an insult
                    offered to Christ, is first mentioned by Roger of Wendover in the Chronicle
                    completed by Matthew Paris, who received the story from an Armenian bishop, who
                    visited England in the year 1228. As told in Matthew’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">Major,</hi> the legend runs that the wanderer’s
                    name was Cartaphilus, that he was doorkeeper of Pilate’s palace, and that as
                    Jesus was led out to be crucified he struck him on the neck, saying, “Go, Jesus,
                    go on faster; why dost thou linger <hi rend="italic">Ί</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >”</hi> Jesus replied, “I go, but thou shalt remain waiting till I return.” The
                    Armenian bishop, if his French servant and interpreter is to be trusted, said
                    that this wanderer had dined with him shortly before his leaving home, and that
                    he was now a penitent man and had been baptized by Ananias, who also baptized
                    Paul, under the name of Joseph. At the time of the crucifixion he was thirty
                    years of age; whenever he reaches the age of one hundred he becomes faint, and
                    when he becomes conscious again he is as young as when his doom was pronounced.
                    He never smiles, refuses all gifts, and narrates many ancient events to those
                    who come from far and near to listen. On the same authority rests the somewhat
                    later account by Philippe de Mousket in his <hi rend="italic">Chronique
                    rimée.</hi> The English chronicler states that the bishop’s statement was in
                    reply to a question whether he had seen or heard of one Joseph, said to have
                    been present at the crucifixion to be preserved in the world as a witness of
                    that event. It would appear, therefore, that there was already in existence a
                    legend of an undying Jew, although nothing was intimated of his insult to
                    Christ. The idea of wandering did not enter into the legend until a later
                    period, when persons pretending to be the undying Jew appeared in various parts
                    of Europe. Near the middle of the 16th century the legend appears in Germany,
                    brought there by a man who professed to be the “Ewige Jude” himself. He appeared
                    at Hamburg, in 1547, giving his name as Ahasuerus, and stating that he had been
                    a shoemaker in Jerusalem who would not suffer Christ to rest at his door when
                    fainting under the weight of the cross. He struck Jesus, and bade him move on.
                    Jesus said, “I will stand here and rest, but thou shalt go on until the last
                    day.” This story, however, also rests upon the authority of an irresponsible
                    reporter. It is attributed to Dr Paulus von Eizen, bishop of Schleswig, whose
                    long conversations with Ahasuerus are given, in a work by one Chrysostomus
                    Dudulaeus Westphalus,—probably a pseudonym. This was published some years after
                    the death of Paulus von Eizen, which occurred in 1598, and its aim is to make
                    the story as sensational as possible as a “warning.” This earliest known book on
                    the legend, published at Leipsic, 1602, professes to be derived from a previous
                    one :— <hi rend="italic">Strange Report of a Jew born at Jerusalem, who pretends
                    he was present at the crucifixion of Christ; newly printed at Leyden.</hi> Other
                    small works appeared somewhat later, as at “Augspurg, 1619,” and elsewhere, and
                    were continued throughout the 17th century, these containing rumours of the
                    Jew’s appearance in Hamburg, Dantzic, Naumburg, Lübeck, Brussels, Moscow, and
                    Madrid. Rudolph Botoreus, parliamentary advocate of Paris <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Comm. histor.,</hi> 1604), mentions contemptuously the rumours of the
                    appearance of this Jew in Germany, Spain, and Italy, and the popular credulity.
                    The most important account of any of these monomaniacs or pretenders is that
                    given of one in Paris (1644) by <hi rend="italic">The Turkish Spy</hi> (book
                    iii., letter i.). “One day I had the curiosity to discourse with him in several
                    languages; and I found him master of all those I could speak. I conversed with
                    him five or six hours together in Arabic.” “The common people are ready to adore
                    him; and the very fear of the multitude restrains the magistrates from offering
                    any violence to this impostor.” From a letter of Madame de Mazarin to Madame de
                    Bouillon, it appears that an individual appeared in England in the beginning of
                    the 18th century professing to have been an officer of rank in Jerusalem who for
                    an insult given to Jesus was doomed to live and wander. It is said that the
                    universities sent professors to cross-examine him, and that many were satisfied
                    of the truth of his story. Several pretenders of the kind appeared in England in
                    the last century. Brand remembered to have seen one going about the streets of
                    Newcastle muttering “Poor John alone.” It is difficult, however, to discover
                    whether in all these cases the rôle of the Wandering Jew was assumed or was
                    added to aged beggars by popular credulity.</p>
                <p>The names given to these wanderers are various. Cartaphilus is probably <hi
                    rend="italic">κάρτα φίλος,</hi> the “much beloved,” <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n703/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0703-0674"/> in allusion to St John, who was believed to
                    “tarry” until the coming of Christ. Joseph was perhaps caught from the legend of
                    Joseph of Arimathaea, who was said to have wandered into Britain in the year 63,
                    when his flowering •staff indicated the spot where Glastonbury abbey should be
                    built. <hi rend="italic">The Turkish Spy</hi> in Paris gives his name as Michob
                    Ader; Libavius <hi rend="italic">(Praxis</hi><hi rend="italic">Alchymiae)</hi>
                    as Butadaeus. In Brussels he was called Isaac Laquedem, a name believed by
                    Grasse to be the French <hi rend="italic">la</hi> combined with <hi
                    rend="italic">kedem,</hi> Heb. for “aforetime.” Mr Karl Blind has suggested that
                    his name in Germany, Ahasuerus, may have been formed out of a corruption of
                    As-Vidar, “god Vidar,”—the Teutonic deity who was to survive the destruction of
                    the world and conquer the wolf Fenris by thrusting his foot covered with an
                    enormous shoe down the monster’s throat <hi rend="italic">(Gentleman's
                    Magazine,</hi> July 1880). This ingenious suggestion would account for the
                    transformation of the wanderer between 1228, when the Armenian bishop described
                    him as Pilate’s doorkeeper, and 1547, when he claims to have been a shoemaker.
                    For a long time there were kept at Bern and also at Ulm enormous pairs of shoes
                    said to have been left by the Wandering Jew on his visits to those places.</p>
                <p>The legend of the Wandering Jew seems clearly related 'to a class of myths, found
                    in every part of the world, in •which certain saints or heroes are represented
                    as having never died. Many of these myths,—as those of King Arthur, Charlemagne,
                    Barbarossa, Tell,—are no doubt ethnically connected; but the corresponding myths
                    found among the Incas, and among various American tribes, may lead us to seek
                    for a common root of them all in human nature,—in the unwillingness of men to
                    believe that their heroes can be really dead. In a primitive race, which had not
                    yet conceived the idea of animistic immortality, the notion of a continued
                    existence in happy isles, valleys, or grottoes, would naturally arise. The
                    earliest instance of this earthly immortality would appear to be that of the
                    Persian Yima, king of the Golden Age, who, in the Zend-Avesta, “gathers around
                    him men and animals in flocks, and fills the earth with them, and after the
                    evils of winter had come over his territories leads a select number of the
                    beings of the good creation to a secluded spot, where they enjoy uninterrupted
                    happiness” (Haug’s <hi rend="italic">Essays,</hi> &amp;c., p. 277). In a
                    corresponding phase of development the Semitic races ascribed a similar
                    terrestrial immortality to Enoch, Elijah, and some others. The Arabs have very
                    particular accounts of the secret abodes of these; and there are indications
                    that in Eastern folklore Moses was believed to be sleeping in his unknown
                    sepulchre.</p>
                <p>By the action of religious dualism on this belief there arose evil counterparts
                    of the immortal heroes, who instead of dwelling in blissful retreats were doomed
                    to wander without finding even the repose of the grave. Of this class Cain was
                    the most conspicuous, and the Bedouin still feels his presence in the feverish
                    desert-winds (Cain-winds), as the Picardy peasant says of a destructive gale,
                    <hi rend="italic">C'est le juif</hi><hi rend="italic">errant</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">qui</hi><hi rend="italic">passe.</hi> Esau, Ishmael, and others
                    have been evil wanderers in the superstitions of various localities; but there
                    is one tradition of high antiquity which would appear to have especially
                    prepared the way for our legend. It is related by G. Weil <hi rend="italic">(The
                    Bible, the Koran, and the Talmud,</hi> p. 127) that, according to this
                    tradition, the golden calf was made by Al Samiri. Moses was about to put this
                    man to death when Allah declared he should be banished. “Ever since that time he
                    (Samiri) roams like a wild beast throughout the world; every one shuns him, and
                    purifies the ground on which his feet have stood; and he himself, whenever he
                    approaches men, exclaims, Touch me not !” There also arose a belief that this
                    monster dwelt with his progeny on a rocky island in the Arabian</p>
                <p>Gulf, from which emanated the plague (Sale, <hi rend="italic">Korane</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> xx</hi> ∙)∙</p>
                <p>These traditions were inherited by the folklore of Christendom. The mantle of
                    Enoch and Elijah, and other saintly sleepers, fell upon the seven supposed to be
                    slumbering in a cave near Ephesus, near to the slumbering St John, belief in
                    whose earthly immortality is mentioned in the New Testament (John xxi. 23). On
                    the other hand, the mantle of Cain and other evil wanderers would seem to have
                    fallen on Nero, who for some time after his death was believed by friend and foe
                    to be still living. At a later period, after Rome had been Christianized, the
                    idea of a perpetual enemy of the Messiah was temporarily detached from any one
                    man and personified as Antichrist, —a restless invisible spirit appointed by the
                    adversary to resist the rival kingdom. This more abstract conception was
                    prolific of evil wanderers. When, in course of the diffusion of Christianity
                    throughout Europe, its missionaries came in contact with popular beliefs in
                    deities which in many cases had been developed from traditional heroes and
                    warriors,—such as Odin, Waldemar, Vidar,—these imaginary potentates were
                    degraded into phantoms, demons; the brand of Cain was set on their names by
                    solemn anathema, and thenceforth all regions of space had their doomed
                    wanderers,—the Wild Huntsman in the air, the Flying Dutchman on the sea, and
                    various forestphantasms like the Gros Veneur of Fontainebleau and Diedrich of
                    Bern on the earth. The Jewish race, however, was the one race which did not
                    yield to Christianity; its special identification with Antichrist was therefore
                    inevitable. Many superstitions affecting them had long been accumulating. There
                    was a belief that the seven whistlers —plovers or sometimes wild geese—were Jews
                    that had been transformed because they had assisted in the crucifixion of
                    Christ, and to see or hear those birds was regarded as ominous of disaster. The
                    Witch Sabbaths were so called because the Jews were supposed to assemble at
                    them. Their wealth was believed to be obtained from Satan. There was also a
                    belief that they carried about plagues. This idea may partly have been derived
                    from the tradition of Samiri and his island, already mentioned, but possibly
                    derived some confirmation from the actual results of crowding the Jews into the
                    confined and neglected quarters of cities, in disregard of sanitary laws. From
                    innumerable sources like these gathered the cloud of fanaticism which sent its
                    thunderbolts upon the Jewish people. The legend of the Wandering Jew, when it
                    was pieced together, represented precisely the popular belief that this race,
                    having betrayed its supernatural mission, had received a supernatural doom. The
                    legendary figure was invested with the fatal associations of most of the demons
                    which Christianity had degraded. He passed in the storm, presided at orgies,
                    diffused diseases, instigated revolutions, burned cities. He was not only
                    associated with European demons but with those of the Jewish race also. There
                    was a wild fable about Judas,—that he had fulfilled a fearful dream of his
                    mother before his birth, living, despite her throwing him into the sea, to “kill
                    his father and sell his God,”—which reappears in our legend. Judas was said to
                    have become page to Pilate, as Cartaphilus was his doorkeeper. Death refused to
                    touch Judas until his doom had been fulfilled, as it spared the Wandering Jew.
                    In the familiar legend of the discovery of the True Cross, the Jew who, after
                    torture, points out its place of concealment to Helena is named Judas; and M.
                    Magnin has plausibly suggested that the story of the Wandering Jew grew up in
                    connexion with the True Cross legend. As Cain was a prototype of Judas, so was
                    Judas of such doomed wanderers as Malchus in Italy and Ahasuerus in Germany. M.
                    Gaston Paris believes the legend of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n704/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0704-0675"/> Malchus to be the earlier. He was said to have
                    struck Jesus with an iron bar, and to have been condemned to walk until
                    judgment-day around a subterranean column, against which he often dashes his
                    head in the vain hope of death.</p>
                <p>The respect shown by peasants to persons pretending to bo the Wandering Jew was
                    such as might have been expected for Cain with a mark upon his brow defending
                    him from the hand of man. Such a mark was indeed supposed to be on the Wandering
                    Jew’s forehead. Xemola says it was a red cross concealed by a black bandage, on
                    which account the Inquisition vainly tried to find him. While persecuting actual
                    Jews, the peasantry had some compassion for this imaginary one, and in some
                    parts of Germany two harrows were sometimes left in the field, set up together
                    with teeth downward, it being believed that so the wanderer might obtain a
                    night’s rest.</p>
                <p>The Wandering Jew has been a favourite subject of poetry and romance. Goethe <hi
                    rend="italic">{Dichtung und Wahrheit,</hi> xv.) has given the scheme of a
                    dramatic poem on the theme which he had contemplated. It has been dealt with by
                    C. F. D. Schubart, <hi rend="italic">Der ewige Jude,</hi> 1787; A. W. Schlegel,

                    have written lyrical poems on the subject. Shelley evokes the Wandering Jew six
                    times, notably in his <hi rend="italic">Queen Mali.</hi> In 1812 a comedy based
                    on the legend by Craignez was performed in Paris. Klingemann’s tragedy <hi
                    rend="italic">Ahasuerus</hi> (1827) was successful as a play. Eugene Sue’s
                    romance (1844), which stimulated popular interest in the legend, has also been
                    often acted. Several German novels have been founded on the legend, the most
                    important being those of Franz Horn, Th. Oelckers, and F. Laun. In England,
