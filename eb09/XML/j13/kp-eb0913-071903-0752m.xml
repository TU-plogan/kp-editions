                    (1709-1784), one of the most eminent English writers of the 18th century, was
                    the son of Michael Johnson, who was, at the beginning of that century, a
                    magistrate of Lichfield, and a bookseller of great note in the midland counties.
                    Michael’s abilities and attainments seem to have been considerable. He was so
                    well acquainted with the contents of the volumes which he exposed to sale that
                    the country rectors of Staffordshire and Worcestershire thought him an oracle on
                    points of learning. Between him and the clergy, indeed, there was a strong
                    religious and political sympathy. He was a zealous churchman, and, though he had
                    qualified himself for municipal office by taking the oaths to the sovereigns in
                    possession, was to the last a Jacobite in heart. At his house, a house which is
                    still pointed out to every traveller who visits Lichfield, Samuel was born on
                    the 18th of September 1709. In the child the physical, intellectual, and moral
                    peculiarities which afterwards distinguished the man were plainly discernible:
                    great muscular strength accompanied by much awkwardness and many infirmities;
                    great quickness of parts, with a morbid propensity to sloth and procrastination;
                    a kind and generous heart, with a gloomy and irritable temper. He had inherited
                    from his ancestors a scrofulous taint, which it was beyond the power of medicine
                    to remove. His parents were weak enough to believe that the royal touch was a
                    specific for this malady. In his third year he was taken up to London, inspected
                    by the court surgeon, prayed over by the court chaplains, and stroked and
                    presented with a piece of gold by Queen Anne. One of his earliest recollections
                    was that of a stately lady in a diamond stomacher and a long black hood. Her
                    hand was applied in vain. The boy’s features, which were originally noble and
                    not irregular, were distorted by his malady. His checks were deeply scarred. He
                    lost for a time the sight of one eye; and he saw but very imperfectly with the
                    other. But the force of his mind overcame every impediment. Indolent as he was,
                    he acquired knowledge with such ease and rapidity that at every school to which
                    he was sent he was soon the best scholar. From sixteen to eighteen he resided at
                    home, and was left to his own devices. He learned much at this time, though his
                    studies were without guidance and without plan. He ransacked his father’s
                    shelves, dipped into a multitude of books, read what was interesting, and passed
                    over what was dull. An ordinary lad would have acquired little or no useful
                    knowledge in such a way; but much that was dull to ordinary lads was interesting
                    to Samuel He read little Greek; for his proficiency in that language was not
                    such that he could take much pleasure in the masters of Attic poetry and
                    eloquence. But he had left school a good Latinist, and he soon acquired, in the
                    large and miscellaneous library of which he now had the command, an extensive
                    knowledge of Latin literature. That Augustan delicacy of taste which is the
                    boast of the great public schools of England he never possessed. But he was
                    early familiar with some classical writers who were quite unknown to the best
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n753/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0753-0720"/> scholars in the sixth form at Eton. He was
                    peculiarly attracted by the works of the great restorers of learning. Once,
                    while searching for some apples, he found a huge folio volume of Petrarch’s
                    works. The name excited his curiosity, and he eagerly devoured hundreds of
                    pages. Indeed, the diction and versification of his own Latin compositions show
                    that he had paid at least as much attention to modern copies from the antique as
                    to the original models.</p>
                <p>While he was thus irregularly educating himself, his family was sinking into
                    hopeless poverty. Old Michael Johnson was much better qualified to pore upon
                    books, and to talk about them, than to trade in them. His business declined; his
                    debts increased; it was with difficulty that the daily expenses of his household
                    were defrayed. It was out of his power to support his son at either university;
                    but a wealthy neighbour offered assistance; and, in reliance on promises which
                    proved to be of very little value, Samuel was entered at Pembroke College,
                    Oxford. When the young scholar presented himself to the rulers of that society,
                    they were amazed not more by his ungainly figure and eccentric manners than by
                    the quantity of extensive and curious information which he had picked up during
                    many months of desultory but not unprofitable study. On the first day of his
                    residence he surprised his teachers by quoting Macrobius; and one of the most
                    learned among them declared that he had never known a freshman of equal
                    attainments.</p>
                <p>At Oxford Johnson resided during about three years. He was poor, even to
                    raggedness; and his appearance excited a mirth and a pity which were equally
                    intolerable to his haughty spirit. He was driven from the quadrangle of Christ
                    Church by the sneering looks which the members of that aristöcratical society
                    cast at the holes in his shoes. Some charitable person placed a new pair at his
                    door; but he spurned them away in a fury. Distress made him, not servile, but
                    reckless and ungovernable. No opulent gentleman commoner, panting for
                    one-and-twenty, could have treated the academical authorities with more gross
                    disrespect. The needy scholar was generally to be seen under the gate of
                    Pembroke, a gate now adorned with his effigy, haranguing a circle of lads, over
                    whom, in spite of his tattered gown and dirty linen, his wit and audacity gave
                    him an undisputed ascendency. In every mutiny against the discipline of the
                    college he was the ringleader. Much was pardoned, however, to a youth so highly
                    distinguished by abilities and acquirements. He had early made himself known by
                    turning Pope’s Messiah into Latin verse. The style and rhythm, indeed, were not
                    exactly Virgilian; but the translation found many admirers, and was read with
                    pleasure by Pope himself.</p>
                <p>The time drew near at which Johnson would, in the ordinary course of things, have
                    become a bachelor of arts; but he was at the end of his resources. Those
                    promises of support on which he had relied had not been kept. His family could
                    do nothing for him. His debts to Oxford tradesmen were small indeed, yet larger
                    than he could pay. In the autumn of 1731 he was under the necessity of quitting
                    the university without a degree. In the following winter his father died. The
                    old man left but a pittance; and of that pittance almost the whole was
                    appropriated to the support of his widow. The property to which Samuel succeeded
                    amounted to no more than twenty pounds.</p>
                <p>His life, during the thirty years which followed, was one hard struggle with
                    poverty. The misery of that struggle needed no aggravation, but was aggravated
                    by the sufferings of an unsound body and an unsound mind. Before the young man
                    left the university, his hereditary malady had broken forth in a singularly
                    cruel form. He had become an incurable hypochondriac. He said long after that he
                    had been mad all his life, or at least not perfectly sane; and, in truth,
                    eccentricities less strange than his have often been thought ground sufficient
                    for absolving felons, and for setting aside wills. His grimaces, his gestures,
                    his mutterings, sometimes diverted and sometimes terrified people who did not
                    know him. At a dinner table he would, in a fit of absence, stoop down and twitch
                    off a lady’s shoe. He would amaze a drawing-room by suddenly ejaculating a
                    clause of the Lord’s Prayer. He would conceive an unintelligible aversion to a
                    particular alley, and perform a great circuit rather than see the hateful place.
                    He would set his heart on touching every post in the streets through which he
                    walked. If by any chance he missed a post, he would go back a hundred yards and
                    repair the omission. Under the influence of his disease, his senses became
                    morbidly torpid, and his imagination morbidly active. At one time he would stand
                    poring on the town clock without being able to tell the hour. At another he
                    would distinctly hear his mother, who was many miles off, calling him by his
                    name. But this was not the worst. A deep melancholy took possession of him, and
                    gave a dark tinge to all his views of human nature and of human destiny. Such
                    wretchedness as he endured has driven many men to shoot themselves or drown
                    themselves. But he was under no temptation to commit suicide. He was sick of
                    life; but he was afraid of death; and he shuddered at every sight or sound which
                    reminded him of the inevitable hour. In religion he found but little comfort
                    during his long and frequent fits of dejection; for his religion partook of his
                    own character. The light from heaven shone on him indeed, but not in a direct
                    line, or with its own pure splendour. The rays had to struggle through a
                    disturbing medium; they reached him refracted, dulled, and discoloured by the
                    thick gloom which had settled on his soul, and, though they might be
                    sufficiently clear to guide him, were too dim to cheer him.</p>
                <p>With such infirmities of body and of mind, this celebrated man was left, at
                    two-and-twenty, to fight his way through the world. He remained during about
                    five years in the midland counties. At Lichfield, his birthplace and his early
                    home, he had inherited some friends and acquired others. He was kindly noticed
                    by Henry Hervey, a gay officer of noble family, who happened to be quartered
                    there. Gilbert Walmesley, registrar of the ecclesiastical court of the diocese,
                    a man of distinguished parts, learning, and knowledge of the world, did himself
                    honour by patronizing the young adventurer, whose repulsive person, unpolished
                    manners, and squalid garb moved many of the petty aristocracy of the
                    neighbourhood to laughter or to disgust. At Lichfield, however, Johnson could
                    find no way of earning a livelihood. He became usher of a grammar school in
                    Leicestershire; he resided as a humble companion in the house of a country
                    gentleman; but a life of dependence was insupportable to his haughty spirit. He
                    repaired to Birmingham, and there earned a few guineas by literary drudgery. In
                    that town he printed a translation, little noticed at the time, and long
                    forgotten, of a Latin book about Abyssinia. He then put forth proposals for
                    publishing by subscription the poems of Politian, with notes containing a
                    history of modern Latin verse; but subscriptions did not come in, and the volume
                    never appeared.</p>
                <p>While leading this vagrant and miserable life, Johnson fell in love. The object
                    of his passion was Mrs Elizabeth Porter, a widow who had children as old as
                    himself. To ordinary spectators the lady appeared to be a short, fat, coarse
                    woman, painted half an inch thick, dressed in gaudy colours, and fond of
                    exhibiting provincial airs and graces which were not exactly those of the
                    Queensberrys and Lepels. To Johnson, however, whose passions were strong, whose
                    eyesight was too weak to distinguish cerise <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0754-0721"/> from natural bloom, and who had seldom or never
                    been in the same room with a woman of real fashion, his Titty, as he called her,
                    was the most beautiful, graceful, and accomplished of her sex. That his
                    admiration was unfeigned cannot be doubted; for she was as poor as himself. She
                    accepted, with a readiness which did her little honour, the addresses of a
                    suitor who might have been her son. The marriage, however, in spite of
                    occasional wranglings, proved happier than might have been expected. The lover
                    continued to be under the illusions of the wedding-day till the lady died in her
                    sixty-fourth year. On her monument he placed an inscription extolling the charms
                    of her person and of her manners; and when, long after her decease, he had
                    occasion to mention her, he exclaimed with a tenderness half ludicrous half
                    pathetic, “Pretty creature !”</p>
                <p>His marriage made it necessary for him to exert himself more strenuously than he
                    had hitherto done. He took a house in the neighbourhood of his native town, and
                    advertized for pupils. But eighteen months passed away, and only three pupils
                    came to his academy. Indeed, his appearance was so strange, and his temper so
                    violent, that his schoolroom must have resembled an ogre’s den. Nor was the
                    tawdry painted grandmother whom he called his Titty well qualified to make
                    provision for the comfort of young gentlemen. David Garrick, who was one of the
                    pupils, used, many years later, to throw the best company of London into
                    convulsions of laughter by mimicking the endearments of this extraordinary
                    pair.</p>
                <p>At length Johnson, in the twenty-eighth year of his age, determined to seek his
                    fortune in the capital as a literary adventurer. He set out with a few guineas,
                    three acts of the tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Irene</hi> in manuscript, and two
                    or three letters of introduction from his friend Walmesley. Never since
                    literature became a calling in England had it been a less gainful calling than
                    at the time when Johnson took up his residence in London. In the preceding
                    generation a writer of eminent merit was sure to be munificently rewarded by the
                    Government. The least that he could expect was a pension or a sinecure place;
                    and, if he showed any aptitude for politics, he might hope to be a member of
                    parliament, a lord of the treasury, an ambassador, a secretary of state. It
                    would be easy, on the other hand, to name several writers of the 19th century of
                    whom the least successful has received forty thousand pounds from the
                    booksellers. But Johnson entered on his vocation in the most dreary part of the
                    dreary interval which separated two ages of prosperity. Literature had ceased to
                    flourish under the patronage of the great, and had not begun to flourish under
                    the patronage of the public. One man of letters, indeed, Pope, had acquired by
                    his pen what was then considered as a handsome fortune, and lived on a footing
                    of equality with nobles and ministers of state. But this was a solitary
                    exception. Even an author whose reputation was established, and whose works were
                    popular—such an author as Thomson, whose <hi rend="italic">Seasons</hi> were in
                    every library, such an author as Fielding, whose <hi rend="italic">Pasquin</hi>
                    had. had a greater run than any drama since <hi rend="italic">The Beggar's
                    Opera—</hi> was sometimes glad to obtain, by pawning his best coat, the means of
                    dining on tripe at a cookshop underground, where he could wipe his hands, after
                    his greasy meal, on the back of a Newfoundland dog. It is easy, therefore, to
                    imagine what humiliations and privations must have awaited the novice who had
                    still to earn a name. One of the publishers to whom Johnson applied for
                    employment measured with a scornful eye that athletic though uncouth frame, and
                    exclaimed, “You had better get a porter’s knot, and carry trunks.” Nor was the
                    advice bad, for a porter was likely to be as plentifully fed, and as comfortably
                    lodged, as a poet.</p>
                <p>Some time appears to have elapsed before Johnson was able to form any literary
                    connexion from which he could expect more than bread for the day which was
                    passing over him. He never forgot the generosity with which Hervey, who was now
                    residing in London, relieved his wants during this time of trial. “Harry
                    Hervey,” said the old philosopher many years later, “was a vicious man; but he
                    was very kind to me. If you call a dog Hervey, 1 shall love him.” At Hervey’s
                    table Johnson sometimes enjoyed feasts which were made more agreeable by
                    contrast. But in general he dined, and thought that he dined well, on
                    sixpennyworth of meat and a pennyworth of bread at an alehouse near Drury
                    Lane.</p>
                <p>The effect of the privations and sufferings which he endured at this time was
                    discernible to the last in his temper and his deportment. His manners had never
                    been courtly. They now became almost savage. Being frequently under the
                    necessity of wearing shabby coats and dirty shirts, he became a confirmed
                    sloven. Being often very hungry when he sat down to his meals, he contracted a
                    habit of eating with ravenous greediness. Even to the end of his life, and even
                    at the tables of the great, the sight of food affected him as it affects wild
                    beasts and birds of prey. His taste in cookery, formed in subterranean
                    ordinaries and <hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">la mode</hi> beefshops,
                    was far from delicate. Whenever he was so fortunate as to have near him a hare
                    that had been kept too long, or a meat pie made with rancid butter, he gorged
                    himself with such violence that his veins swelled and the moisture broke out on
                    his forehead. The affronts which his poverty emboldened stupid and low-minded
                    men to offer to him would have broken a mean spirit into sycophancy, but made
                    him rude even to ferocity. Unhappily the insolence which, while it was
                    defensive, was, pardonable, and in some sense respectable, accompanied him into
                    societies where he was treated with courtesy and kindness. He was repeatedly
                    provoked into striking those who had taken liberties with him. All the
                    sufferers, however, were wise enough to abstain from talking about their
                    beatings, except Osborne, the most rapacious and brutal of booksellers, who
                    proclaimed everywhere that he had been knocked down by the huge fellow whom he
                    had hired to puff the Harleian Library.</p>
                <p>About a year after Johnson had begun to reside in London he was fortunate enough
                    to obtain regular employment from Cave, an enterprising and intelligent
                    bookseller, who was proprietor and editor of the <hi rend="italic">Gentleman's
                    Magazine.</hi> That journal, just entering on the ninth year of its long
                    existence, was the only periodical work in the kingdom which then had what would
                    now be called a large circulation. It was, indeed, the chief source of
                    parliamentary intelligence. It was not then safe, even during a recess, to
                    publish an account of the proceedings of either House without some disguise.
                    Cave, however, ventured to entertain his readers with what he called “Reports of
                    the Debates of the Senate of Lilliput.” France was Blefuscu; London was
                    Mildendo; pounds were sprugs; the duke of Newcastle was the Nardac secretary of
                    state; Lord Hardwicke was the Hurgo Hickrad; and William Pulteney was Wingul
                    Pulnub. To write the speeches was, during several years, the business of
                    Johnson. He was generally furnished with notes, meagre indeed, and inaccurate,
                    of what had been said; but sometimes he had to find arguments and eloquence both
                    for the ministry and for the opposition. He was himself a Tory, not from
                    rational conviction—for his serious opinion was that one form of government was
                    just as good or as bad as another—but from mere passion, such as inflamed the
                    Capulets against the Montagues, or the Blues of the Roman circus against the
                    Greens. In his infancy he had heard so much talk about the villanies of the
                    Whigs, and the dangers of the church, that he had become a furious partisan when
                    he could scarcely speak. Before he was three he had insisted on being taken to
                    hoar <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n755/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0755-0722"/> Sacheverel preach at Lichfield cathedral, and had
                    listened to the sermon with as much respect, and probably with as much
                    intelligence, as any Staffordshire squire in the congregation. The work which
                    had been begun in the nursery had been completed by the university. Oxford, when
                    Johnson resided there, was the most Jacobitical place in England; and Pembroke
                    was one of the most Jacobitical colleges in Oxford. The prejudices which he
                    brought up to London were scarcely less absurd than those of his own Tom
                    Tempest. Charles II. and James II. were two of the best kings that ever reigned.
                    Laud, a poor creature who never did, said, or wrote any thing indicating more
                    than the ordinary capacity of an old woman, was a prodigy of parts and learning
                    over whose tomb Art and Genius still continued to weep. Hampden deserved no more
                    honourable name than that of “the zealot of rebellion.” Even the ship money,
                    condemned not less decidedly by Falkland and Clarendon than by the bitterest
                    Roundheads, Johnson would not pronounce to have been an unconstitutional impost.
                    Under a Government the mildest that had ever been known in the world, under a
                    Government which allowed to the people an unprecedented liberty of speech and
                    action, he fancied that he was a slave; he assailed the ministry with obloquy
                    which refuted itself, and regretted the lost freedom and happiness of those
                    golden days in which a writer who had taken but one-tenth part of the licence
                    allowed to him would have been pilloried, mangled with the shears, whipped at
                    the cart’s tail, and flung into a noisome dungeon to die. He hated dissenters
                    and stock-jobbers, the excise and the army, septennial parliaments, and
                    Continental connexions. He long had an aversion to the Scotch, an aversion of
                    which he could not remember the commencement, but which, he owned, had probably
                    originated in his abhorrence of the conduct of the nation during the Great
                    Rebellion. It is easy to guess in what manner debates on great party questions
                    were likely to be reported by a man whose judgment was so much disordered by
                    party spirit. A show of fairness was indeed necessary to the prosperity of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Magazine.</hi> But Johnson long afterwards owned that, though
                    he had saved appearances, he had taken care that the Whig dogs should not have
                    the best of it; and, in fact, every passage which has lived, every passage which
                    bears the marks of his higher faculties, is put into the mouth of some member of
                    the opposition.</p>
                <p>A few weeks after Johnson had entered on these obscure labours, he published a
                    work which at once placed him high among the writers of his age. It is probable
                    that what he had suffered during his first year in London had often reminded him
                    of some parts of that noble poem in which Juvenal had described the misery and
                    degradation of a needy man of letters, lodged among the pigeons’ nests in the
                    tottering garrets which overhung the streets of Rome. Pope’s admirable
                    imitations of Horace’s <hi rend="italic">Satires</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epistles</hi> had recently appeared, were in every hand, and were by many
                    readers thought superior to the originals. What Pope had done for Horace,
                    Johnson aspired to do for Juvenal. The enterprise was bold, and yet judicious.
                    For between Johnson and Juvenal there was much in common, much more certainly
                    than between Pope and Horace.</p>
                <p>Johnson’s <hi rend="italic">London</hi> appeared without his name in May 1738. He
                    received only ten guineas for this stately and vigorous poem; but the sale was
                    rapid, and the success complete. A second edition was required within a week.
                    Those small critics who are always desirous to lower established reputations ran
                    about proclaiming that · the anonymous satirist was superior to Pope in Pope’s
                    own peculiar department of literature. It ought to be remembered, to the honour
                    of Pope, that he joined heartily in the applause with which the appearance of a
                    rival genius was welcomed. He made inquiries about the author of <hi
                    rend="italic">London.</hi> Such a man, he said, could not long be concealed. The
                    name was soon discovered; and Pope, with great kindness, exerted himself to
                    obtain an academical degree and the mastership of a grammar school for the poor
                    young poet. The attempt failed, and Johnson remained a bookseller’s hack.</p>
                <p>It does not appear that these two men, the most eminent writer of the generation
                    which was going out, and the most eminent writer of the generation which was
                    coming in, ever saw each other. They lived in very different circles, one
                    surrounded by dukes and earls, the other by starving pamphleteers and
                    indexmakers. Among Johnson’s associates at this time may be mentioned Boyse,
                    who, when his shirts were pledged, scrawled Latin verses sitting up in bed with
                    his arms through two holes in his blanket, who composed very respectable sacred
                    poetry when he was sober, and who was at last run over by a hackney coach when
                    he was drunk; Hoole, surnamed the metaphysical tailor, who, instead of attending
                    to his measures, used to trace geometrical diagrams on the board where he sat
                    cross-legged; and the penitent impostor, George Psalmanazar, who, after poring
                    all day, in a humble lodging, on the folios of Jewish rabbis and Christian
                    fathers, indulged himself at night with literary and theological conversation at
                    an alehouse in the city. But the most remarkable of the persons with whom at
                    this time Johnson consorted was Richard Savage, an earl’s son, a shoemaker’s
                    apprentice, who had seen life in all its forms, who had feasted among blue
                    ribands in Saint James’s Square, and had lain with fifty pounds weight of irons
                    on his legs in the condemned ward of Newgate. This man had, after many
                    vicissitudes of fortune, sunk at last into abject and hopeless poverty. His pen
                    had failed him. His patrons had been taken away by death, or estranged by the
                    riotous profusion with which he squandered their bounty, and the ungrateful
                    insolence with which he rejected their advice. He now lived by begging. He dined
                    on venison and champagne whenever he had been so fortunate as to borrow a
                    guinea. If his questing had been unsuccessful, he appeased the rage of hunger
                    with some scraps of broken meat, and lay down to rest under the piazza of Covent
                    Garden in warm weather, and, in cold weather, as near as he could get to the
                    furnace of a glass house. Yet, in his misery, he was still an agreeable
                    companion. He had an inexhaustible store of anecdotes about that gay and
                    brilliant world from which he was now an outcast. He had observed the great men
                    of both parties in hours of careless relaxation, had seen the leaders of
                    opposition without the mask of patriotism, and had heard the prime minister roar
                    with laughter and tell stories not over-decent. During some months Savage lived
                    in the closest familiarity with Johnson; and then the friends parted, not
                    without tears. Johnson remained in London to drudge for Cave. Savage went to the
                    west of England, lived there as he had lived everywhere, and in 1743 died,
                    penniless and heartbroken, in Bristol jail.</p>
                <p>Soon after his death, while the public curiosity was strongly excited about his
                    extraordinary character and his not less extraordinary adventures, a life of him
                    appeared widely different from the catchpenny lives of eminent men which were
                    then a staple article of manufacture in Grub Street. The style was indeed
                    deficient in ease and variety; and the writer was evidently too partial to the
                    Latin element of our language. But the little work, with all its faults, was a
                    masterpiece. No finer specimen of literary biography existed in any language,
                    living or dead; and a discerning critic might have confidently predicted that
                    the author was destined to be the founder of a new school of English
                    eloquence.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Life of Savage</hi> was anonymous; but it was well known in
                    literary circles that Johnson was the writer.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n756/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0756-0723"/>
                <p>During the three years which followed, he produced no important work; but he was
                    not, and indeed could not be, idle. The fame of his abilities and learning
                    continued to grow. Warburton pronounced him a man of parts and genius; and the
                    praise of Warburton was then no light thing. Such was Johnson’s reputation that,
                    in 1747, several eminent booksellers combined to employ him in the arduous work
                    of preparing a <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of the English Language,</hi> in two
                    folio volumes. The sum which they agreed to pay him was only fifteen hundred
                    guineas; and out of this sum he had to pay several poor men of letters who
                    assisted him in the humbler parts of his task.</p>
                <p>The prospectus of the <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi> he addressed to the earl
                    of Chesterfield. Chesterfield had long been celebrated for the politeness of his
                    manners, the brilliancy of his wit, and the delicacy of his taste. He was
                    acknowledged to be the finest speaker in the House of Lords. He had recently
                    governed Ireland, at a momentous conjuncture, with eminent firmness, wisdom, and
                    humanity; and he had since become secretary of state. He received Johnson’s
                    homage with the most winning affability, and requited it with a few guineas,
                    bestowed doubtless in a very graceful manner, but was by no means desirous to
                    see all his carpets blackened with the London mud, and his soups and wines
                    thrown to right and left over the gowns of fine ladies and the waistcoats of
                    fine gentlemen, by an absent, awkward scholar, who gave strange starts and
                    uttered strange growls, who dressed like a scarecrow, and ate like a cormorant.
                    During some time Johnson continued to call on his patron, but, after being
                    repeatedly told by the porter that his lordship was not at home, took the hint,
                    and ceased to present himself at the inhospitable door.</p>
                <p>Johnson had flattered himself that he should have completed his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionary</hi> by the end of 1750; but it was not till 1755 that he at length
                    gave his huge volumes to the world. During the seven years which he passed in
                    the drudgery of penning definitions and marking quotations for transcription, he
                    sought for relaxation in literary labour of a more agreeable kind. In 1749 he
                    published the <hi rend="italic">Vanity of Human Wishes,</hi> an excellent
                    imitation of the tenth satire of Juvenal. It is in truth not easy to say whether
                    the palm belongs to the ancient or to the modern poet. The couplets in which the
                    fall of Wolsey is described, though lofty and sonorous, are feeble when compared
                    with the wonderful lines which bring before us all Rome in tumult on the day of
                    the fall of Sejanus, the laurels on the doorposts, the white bull stalking
                    towards the Capitol, the statues rolling down from their pedestals, the
                    flatterers of the disgraced minister running to see him dragged with a hook
                    through the streets, and to have a kick at his carcase before it is hurled into
                    the Tiber. It must be owned too that in the concluding passage the Christian
                    moralist has not made the most of his advantages, and has fallen decidedly short
                    of the sublimity of his pagan model. On the other hand, Juvenal’s Hannibal must
                    yield to Johnson’s Charles; and Johnson’s vigorous and pathetic enumeration of
                    the miseries of a literary life must be allowed to be superior to Juvenal’s
                    lamentation over the fate of Demosthenes and Cicero. For the copyright of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Vanity of Human Wishes</hi> Johnson received only fifteen
                    guineas.</p>
                <p>A few days after the publication of this poem, his tragedy, begun many years
                    before, was brought on the stage. His pupil, David Garrick, had in 1741 made his
                    appearance on a humble stage in Goodman’s Fields, had at once risen to the first
                    place among actors, and was now, after several years of almost uninterrupted
                    success, manager of Drury Lane Theatre. The relation between him and his old
                    preceptor was of a very singular kind. They repelled each other strongly, and
                    yet attracted each other strongly. Nature had made them of very different clay;
                    and circumstances had fully brought out the natural peculiarities of both.
                    Sudden prosperity had turned Garrick’s head. Continued adversity had soured
                    Johnson’s temper. Johnson saw with more envy than , became so great a man the
                    villa, the plate, the china, the Brussels carpet, which the little mimic had got
                    by repeating, with grimaces and gesticulations, what wiser men had written; and
                    the exquisitely sensitive vanity of Garrick was galled by the thought that,
                    while all the rest of the world was applauding him, he could obtain from one
                    morose cynic, whose opinion it was impossible to despise, scarcely any
                    compliment not acidulated with scorn. Yet the two Lichfield men had so many
                    early recollections in common, and sympathized with each other on so many points
                    on which they sympathized with nobody else in the vast population of the
                    capital, that, though the master was often provoked by the monkey-like
                    impertinence of the pupil, and the pupil by the bearish rudeness of the master,
                    they remained friends till they were parted by death. Garrick now brought <hi
                    rend="italic">Irene</hi> out, with alterations sufficient to displease the
                    author, yet not sufficient to make the piece pleasing to the audience. The
                    public, however, listened, with little emotion, but with much civility, to five
                    acts of monotonous declamation. After nine representations the play was
                    withdrawn. It is, indeed, altogether unsuited to the stage, and, even when
                    perused in the closet, will be found hardly worthy of the author. He had not the
                    slightest notion of what blank verse should be. A change in the last syllable of
                    every other line would make the versification of the <hi rend="italic">Vanity of
                    Human Wishes</hi> closely resemble the versification of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Irene.</hi> The poet, however, cleared, by his benefit nights, and by the sale
                    of the copyright of his tragedy, about three hundred pounds, then a great sum in
                    his estimation.</p>
                <p>About a year after the representation of <hi rend="italic">Irene,</hi> he began
                    to publish a series of short essays on morals, manners, and literature. This
                    species of composition had been brought into fashion by the success of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tatler,</hi> and by the still more brilliant success of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Spectator.</hi> A crowd of small writers had vainly attempted to
                    rival Addison. The <hi rend="italic">Lay Monastery,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Censor,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Freethinker,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plain Dealer,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Champion,</hi> and other works of the
                    same kind had had their short day. None of them had obtained a permanent place
                    in our literature; and they are now to be found only in the libraries of the
                    curious. At length Johnson undertook the adventure in which so many aspirants
                    had failed. In the thirty-sixth year after the appearance of the last number of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> appeared the first number of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rambler.</hi> From March 1750 to March 1752 this paper continued
                    to come out every Tuesday and Saturday.</p>
                <p>From the first the <hi rend="italic">Rambler</hi> was enthusiastically admired by
                    a few eminent men. Richardson, when only five numbers had appeared, pronounced
                    it equal if not superior to the <hi rend="italic">Spectator.</hi> Young and
                    Hartley expressed their approbation not less warmly. Bubb Dodington, among whose
                    many faults indifference to the claims of genius and learning cannot be
                    reckoned, solicited the acquaintance of the writer. In consequence probably of
                    the good offices of Dodington, who was then the confidential adviser of Prince
                    Frederick, two of his royal highness’s gentlemen carried a gracious message to
                    the printing office, and ordered seven copies for Leicester House. But these
                    overtures seem to have been very coldly received. Johnson had had enough of the
                    patronage of the great to last him all his life, and was not disposed to haunt
                    any other door as he had haunted the door of Chesterfield.</p>
                <p>By the public the <hi rend="italic">Rambler</hi> was at first very coldly
                    received. Though the price of a number was only twopence<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0757-0724"/>, the sale did not amount to five hundred. The
                    profits were therefore very small. But as soon as the flying leaves were
                    collected and reprinted they became popular. The author lived to see thirteen
                    thousand copies spread over England alone. Separate editions were published for
                    the Scotch and Irish markets. A large party pronounced the style perfect, so
                    absolutely perfect that in some essays it would be impossible for the writer
                    himself to alter a single word for the better. Another party, not less numerous,
                    vehemently accused him of having corrupted the purity of the English tongue. The
                    best critics admitted that his diction was too monotonous, too obviously
                    artificial, and now and then turgid even to absurdity. But they did justice to
                    the acuteness of his observations on morals and manners, to the constant
                    precision and frequent brilliancy of his language, to the weighty and
                    magnificent eloquence of many serious passages, and to the solemn yet pleasing
                    humour of some of the lighter papers. On the question of precedence between
                    Addison and Johnson, a question which, seventy years ago, was much disputed,
                    posterity has pronounced a decision from which there is no appeal. Sir Roger,
                    his chaplain, and his butler, Will Wimble and Will Honeycomb, the “Vision of
                    Mirza,” the “Journal of the Retired Citizen,” the “Everlasting Club,” the
                    “Dunmow Flitch,” the “Loves of Hilpah and Shalum,” the “Visit to the Exchange,”
                    and the “Visit to the Abbey” are known to everybody. But many men and women,
                    even of highly cultivated minds, are unacquainted with Squire Blaster and Mrs
                    Busy, Quisquilius and Venustulus, the “Allegory of Wit and Learning,” the
                    “Chronicle of the Revolutions of a Garret,” and the sad fate of Aningait and
                    Ajut.</p>
                <p>The last <hi rend="italic">Rambler</hi> was written in a sad and gloomy hour. Mrs
                    Johnson had been given over by the physicians. Three days later she died. She
                    left her husband almost brokenhearted. Many people had been surprised to see a
                    man of his genius and learning stooping to every drudgery, and denying himself
                    almost every comfort, for the purpose of supplying a silly, affected old woman
                    with superfluities, which she accepted with but little gratitude. But all his
                    affection had been concentrated on her. He had neither brother nor sister,
                    neither son nor daughter. To him she was beautiful as the Gunnings, and witty as
                    Lady Mary. Her opinion of his writings was more important to him than the voice
                    of the pit of Drury Lane Theatre, or the judgment of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monthly Review.</hi> The chief support which had sustained him through the most
                    arduous labour of his life was the hope that she would enjoy the fame and the
                    profit which he anticipated from his <hi rend="italic">Dictionary.</hi> She was
                    gone; and in that vast labyrinth of streets, peopled by eight hundred thousand
                    human beings, he was alone. Yet it was necessary for him to set himself, as he
                    expressed it, doggedly to work. After three more laborious years, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dictionary</hi> was at length complete.</p>
                <p>It had been generally supposed that this great work would be dedicated to the
                    eloquent and accomplished nobleman to whom the prospectus had been addressed. He
                    well knew the value of such a compliment; and therefore, when the day of
                    publication drew near, he exerted himself to soothe, by a show of zealous and at
                    the same time of delicate and judicious kindness, the pride which he had so
                    cruelly wounded. Since the <hi rend="italic">Ramblers</hi> had ceased to appear,
                    the town had been entertained by a journal called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >World,</hi> to which many men of high rank and fashion contributed. In two
                    successive numbers of the <hi rend="italic">World,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionary</hi> was, to use the modern phrase, puffed with wonderful skill. The
                    writings of Johnson were warmly praised. It was proposed that he should be
                    invested with the authority of a dictator, nay, of a pope, over our language,
                    and that his decisions about the meaning and the spelling of words should be
                    received as final. His two folios, it was said, would of course be bought by
                    everybody who could afford to buy them. It was soon known that these papers were
                    written by Chesterfield. But the just resentment of Johnson was not to be so
                    appeased. In a letter written with singular energy and dignity of thought and
                    language, he repelled the tardy advances of his patron. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionary</hi> came forth without a dedication. In the preface the author
                    truly declared that he owed nothing to the great, and described the difficulties
                    with which he had been left to struggle so forcibly and pathetically that the
                    ablest and most malevolent of all the enemies of his fame, Horne Tooke, never
                    could read that passage without tears.</p>
                <p>The public, on this occasion, did Johnson full justice, and something more than
                    justice. The best lexicographer may well be content if his productions are
                    received by the world with cold esteem. But Johnson’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionary</hi> was hailed with an enthusiasm such as no similar work has ever
                    excited. It was indeed the first dictionary which could be read with pleasure.
                    The definitions show so much acuteness of thought and command of language, and
                    the passages quoted from poets, divines, and philosophers are so skilfully
                    selected, that a leisure hour may always be very agreeably spent in turning over
                    the pages. The faults of the book resolve themselves, for the most part, into
                    one great fault. Johnson was a wretched etymologist. He knew little or nothing
                    of any Teutonic language except English, which indeed, as he wrote it, was
                    scarcely a Teutonic language; and thus he was absolutely at the mercy of Junius
                    and Skinner.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Dictionary,</hi> though it raised Johnson’s fame, added
                    nothing to his pecuniary means. The fifteen hundred guineas which the
                    booksellers had agreed to pay him had been advanced and spent before the last
                    sheets issued from the press. It is painful to relate that twice in the course
                    of the year which followed the publication of this great work he was arrested
                    and carried to spunging-houses, and that he was twice indebted for his liberty
                    to his excellent friend Richardson. It was still necessary for the man who had
                    been formally saluted by the highest authority as dictator of the English
                    language to supply his wants by constant toil. He abridged his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionary.</hi> He proposed to bring out an edition of Shakespeare by
                    subscription, and many subscribers sent in their names and laid down their
                    money; but he soon found the task so little to his taste that he turned to more
                    attractive employments. He contributed many papers to a new monthly journal,
                    which was called the <hi rend="italic">Literary Magazine.</hi> Few of these
                    papers have much interest; but among them was the very best thing that he ever
                    wrote, a masterpiece both of reasoning and of satirical pleasantry, the review
                    of Jenyns’s <hi rend="italic">Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of
                    Evil.</hi></p>
                <p>In the spring of 1758 Johnson put forth the first of a series of essays, entitled
                    the <hi rend="italic">Idler.</hi> During two years these essays continued to
                    appear weekly. They were eagerly read, widely circulated, and indeed impudently
                    pirated, while they were still in the original form, and had a large sale when
                    collected into volumes. The <hi rend="italic">Idler</hi> may be described as a
                    second part of the <hi rend="italic">Rambler,</hi> somewhat livelier and
                    somewhat weaker than the first part.</p>
                <p>While Johnson was busied with his <hi rend="italic">Idlers,</hi> his mother, who
                    had accomplished her ninetieth year, died at Lichfield. It was long since he had
                    seen her, but he had not failed to contribute largely out of his small means to
                    her comfort. In order to defray the charges of her funeral, and to pay some
                    debts which she had left, he wrote a little book in a single week, and sent off
                    the sheets to the press without reading them over. A hundred pounds were paid
                    him for the copyright, and the purchasers had great cause to be pleased with
                    their bargain, for the book was <hi rend="italic">Rasselαs.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n758/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0758-0725"/>
                <p>The success of <hi rend="italic">Rasselas</hi> was great, though such ladies as
                    Miss Lydia Languish must have been grievously disappointed when they found that
                    the new volume from the circulating library was little more than a dissertation
                    on the author’s favourite theme, the “vanity of human wishes;” that the prince
                    of Abyssinia was without a mistress, and the princess without a lover; and that
                    the story set the hero and the heroine down exactly where it had taken them up.
                    The style was the subject of much eager controversy. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monthly Review</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Critical Review</hi> took
                    different sides. Many readers pronounced the writer a pompous pedant, who would
                    never use a word of two syllables where it was possible to use a word of six,
                    and who could not make a waiting woman relate her adventures without balancing
                    every noun with another noun, and every epithet with another epithet. Another
                    party, not less zealous, cited with delight numerous passages in which weighty
                    meaning was expressed with accuracy and illustrated with splendour. And both the
                    censure and the praise were merited.</p>
                <p>About the plan of <hi rend="italic">Rasselas</hi> little was said by the critics;
                    and yet the faults of the plan might seem to invite severe criticism. Johnson
                    has frequently blamed Shakespeare for neglecting the proprieties of time and
                    place, and for ascribing to one age or nation the manners and opinions of
                    another. Yet Shakespeare has not sinned in this way more greviously than
                    Johnson. Rasselas and Imlac, Nekayah and Pekuah, are evidently meant to be
                    Abyssinians of the 18th century; for the Europe which Imlac describes is the
                    Europe of the 18th century, and the inmates of the Happy Valley talk familiarly
                    of that law of gravitation which Newton discovered, and which was not fully
                    received even at Cambridge till the 18th century. What a real company of
                    Abyssinians would have been may be learned from Bruce’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Travels.</hi> But Johnson, not content with turning filthy savages, ignorant of
                    their letters, and gorged with raw steaks cut from living cows, into
                    philosophers as eloquent and enlightened as himself or his friend Burke, and
                    into ladies as highly accomplished as Mrs Lennox or Mrs Sheridan, transferred
                    the whole domestic system of England to Egypt. Into a land of harems, a land of
                    polygamy, a land where women are married without ever being seen, he introduced
                    the flirtations and jealousies of our ball-rooms. In a land where there is
                    boundless liberty of divorce, wedlock is described as the indissoluble compact.
                    “A youth and maiden meeting by chance, or brought together by artifice, exchange
                    glances, reciprocate civilities, go home, and dream of each other. Such,” says
                    Rasselas, “is the common process of marriage.” Such it may have been, and may
                    still be, in London, but assuredly not at Cairo. A writer who was guilty of such
                    improprieties had little right to blame the poet who made Hector quote
                    Aristotle, and represented Julio Romano as flourishing in the days of the oracle
                    of Delphi.</p>
                <p>By such exertions as have been described Johnson supported himself till the year
                    1762. In that year a great change in his circumstances took place. He had from a
                    child been an enemy of the reigning dynasty. His Jacobite prejudices had been
                    exhibited with little disguise both in his works and in his conversation. Even
                    in his massy and elaborate <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi> he had, with a
                    strange want of taste and judgment, inserted bitter and contumelious reflexions
                    on the Whig party. The excise, which was a favourite resource of Whig
                    financiers, he had designated as a hateful tax. He had railed against the
                    commissioners of excise in language so coarse that they had seriously thought of
                    prosecuting him. He had with difficulty been prevented from holding up the lord
                    privy seal by name as an example of the meaning of the word “renegade.” A
                    pension he had defined as pay given to a state hireling to betray his country; a
                    pensioner as a slave of state hired by a stipend to obey a master. It seemed
                    unlikely that the author of these definitions would himself be pensioned. But
                    that was a time of wonders. George III. had ascended the throne, and had, in the
                    course of a few months, disgusted many of the old friends, and conciliated many
                    of the old enemies of his house. The city was becoming mutinous; Oxford was
                    becoming loyal. Cavendishes and Bentincks were murmuring; Somersets and Wyndhams
                    were hastening to kiss hands. The head of the treasury was now Lord Bute, who
                    was a Tory, and could have no objection to Johnson’s Toryism. Bute wished to be
                    thought a patron of men of letters; and Johnson was one of the most eminent and
                    one of the most needy men of letters in Europe. A pension of three hundred a
                    year was graciously offered, and with very little hesitation accepted.</p>
                <p>This event produced a change in Johnson’s whole way of life. For the first time
                    since his boyhood he no longer felt the daily goad urging him to the daily toil.
                    He was at liberty, after thirty years of anxiety and drudgery, to indulge his
                    constitutional indolence, to lie in bed till two in the afternoon, and to sit up
                    talking till four in the morning, without fearing either the printer’s devil or
                    the sheriff’s officer.</p>
                <p>One laborious task indeed he had bound himself to perform. He had received large
                    subscriptions for his promised edition of Shakespeare; he had lived on those
                    subscriptions during some years: and he could not without disgrace omit to
                    perform his part of the contract. His friends repeatedly exhorted him to make an
                    effort, and he repeatedly resolved to do so. But, notwithstanding their
                    exhortations and his resolutions, month followed month, year followed year, and
                    nothing was done. He prayed fervently against his idleness; he determined, as
                    often as he received the sacrament, that he would no longer doze away and trifle
                    away his time; but the spell under which he lay resisted prayer and sacrament.
                    His private notes at this time are made up of self-reproaches. “My indolence,”
                    he wrote on Easter eve in 1764, “has sunk into grosser sluggishness. A kind of
                    strange oblivion has overspread me, so that I know not what has become of the
                    last year.” Easter 1765 came, and found him still in the same state. “My time,”
                    he wrote, “has been unprofitably spent, and seems as a dream that has left
                    nothing behind. My memory grows confused, and I know not how the days pass over
                    me.” Happily for his honour, the charm which held him captive was at length
                    broken by no gentle or friendly hand. He had been weak enough to pay serious
                    attention to a story about a ghost which haunted a house in Cock Lane, and had
                    actually gone himself, with some of his friends, at one in the morning, to St
                    John’s Church, Clerkenwell, in the hope of receiving a communication from the
                    perturbed spirit. But the spirit, though adjured with all solemnity, remained
                    obstinately silent; and it soon appeared that a naughty girl of eleven had been
                    amusing herself by making fools of so many philosophers. Churchill, who,
                    confident in his powers, drunk with popularity, and burning with party spirit,
                    was looking for some man of established fame and Tory politics to insult,
                    celebrated the Cock Lane ghost in three cantos, nicknamed Johnson Pomposo, asked
                    where the book was which had been so long promised and so liberally paid for,
                    and directly accused the great moralist of cheating. This terrible word proved
                    effectual, and in October 1765 appeared, after a delay of nine years, the new
                    edition of Shakespeare.</p>
                <p>This publication saved Johnson’s character for honesty, but added nothing to the
                    fame of his abilities and learning. The preface, though it contains some good
                    passages, is not in his best manner. The most valuable notes are those in <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n759/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0759-0726"/> which he had an opportunity of showing how
                    attentively he had during many years observed human life and human nature. The
                    best specimen is the note on the character of Polonius. Nothing so good is to be
                    found even in Wilhelm Meister’s admirable examination of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hamlet.</hi> But here praise must end. It would be difficult to name a more
                    slovenly, a more worthless edition of any great classic. The reader may turn
                    over play after play without finding one happy conjectural emendation, or one
                    ingenious and satisfactory explanation of a passage which had baffled preceding
                    commentators. Johnson had, in his prospectus, told the world that he was
                    peculiarly fitted for the task which he had undertaken, because he had, as a
                    lexicographer, been under the necessity of taking a wider view of the English
                    language than any of his predecessors. That his knowledge of our literature was
                    extensive is indisputable. But, unfortunately, he had altogether neglected that
                    very part of our literature with which it is especially desirable that an editor
                    of Shakespeare should be conversant. It is dangerous to assert a negative. Yet
                    little will be risked by the assertion that in the two folio volumes of the <hi
                    rend="italic">English Dictionary</hi> there is not a single passage quoted from
                    any dramatist of the Elizabethan age, except Shakespeare and Ben Jonson. Even
                    from Ben the quotations are few. Johnson might easily in a few months have made
                    himself well acquainted with every old play that was extant. But it never seems
                    to have occurred to him that this was a necessary preparation for the work which
                    he had undertaken. He would doubtless have admitted that it would be the height
                    of absurdity in a man who was not familiar with the works of Aeschylus and
                    Euripides to publish an edition of Sophocles. Yet he ventured to publish an
                    edition of Shakespeare, without having ever in his life, as far as can be
                    discovered, read a single scene of Massinger, Ford, Dekker, Webster, Marlow,
                    Beaumont, or Fletcher. His detractors were noisy and scurrilous. Those who most
                    loved and honoured him had little to say in praise of the manner in which he had
                    discharged the duty of a commentator. He had, however, acquitted himself of a
                    debt which had long lain heavy on his conscience, and he sank back into the
                    repose from which the sting of satire had roused him. He long continued to live
                    upon the fame which he had already won. He was honoured by the university of
                    Oxford with a doctor’s degree, by the Royal Academy with a professorship, and by
                    the king with an interview, in which his Majesty most graciously expressed a
                    hope that so excellent a writer would not cease to write. In the interval,
                    however, between 1765 and 1775 Johnson published only two or three political
                    tracts, the longest of which he could have produced in forty-eight hours, if he
                    had worked as he worked on the <hi rend="italic">Life oj Savage</hi> and on <hi
                    rend="italic">Rasselas.</hi></p>
                <p>But, though his pen was now idle, his tongue was active. The influence exercised
                    by his conversation, directly upon those with whom he lived, and indirectly on
                    the whole literary world, was altogether without a parallel. His colloquial
                    talents were indeed of the highest order. He had strong sense, quick
                    discernment, wit, humour, immense knowledge of literature and of life, and an
                    infinite store of curious anecdotes. As respected style, he spoke far better
                    than he wrote. Every sentence which dropped from his lips was as correct in
                    structure as the most nicely balanced period of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rambler.</hi> But in his talk there were no pompous triads, and little more
                    than a fair proportion of words in <hi rend="italic">-osity</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">-ation.</hi> All was simplicity, ease, and vigour. He uttered his
                    short, weighty, and pointed sentences with a power of voice, and a justness and
                    energy of emphasis, of which the effect was rather increased than diminished by
                    the rollings of his huge form, and by the asthmatic gaspings and puffings in
                    which the peals of his eloquence generally ended. Nor did the laziness which
                    made him unwilling to sit down to his desk prevent him from giving instruction
                    or entertainment orally. To discuss questions of taste, of learning, of
                    casuistry, in language so exact and so forcible that it might have been printed
                    without the alteration of a word, was to him no exertion, but a pleasure. He
                    loved, as he said, to fold his legs and have his talk out. He was ready to
                    bestow the overflowings of his full mind on anybody who would start a subject,
                    on a fellow-passenger in a stage coach, or on the person who sat at the same
                    table with him in an eating-house. But his conversation was nowhere so brilliant
                    and striking as when he was surrounded by a few friends, whose abilities and
                    knowledge enabled them, as he once expressed it, to send him back every ball
                    that he threw. Some of these, in 1764, formed themselves into a club, which
                    gradually became a formidable power in the commonwealth of letters. The verdicts
                    pronounced by this conclave on new books were speedily known over all London,
                    and were sufficient to sell off a whole edition in a day, or to condemn the
                    sheets to the service of the trunkmaker and the pastrycook. Nor shall we think
                    this strange when we consider what great and various talents and acquirements
                    met in the little fraternity. Goldsmith was the representative of poetry and
                    light literature, Reynolds of the arts, Burke of political eloquence and
                    political philosophy. There, too, were Gibbon the greatest historian and Jones
                    the greatest linguist of the age. Garrick brought to the meetings his
                    inexhaustible pleasantry, his incomparable mimicry, and his consummate knowledge
                    of stage effect. Among the most constant attendants were two high-born and
                    high-bred gentlemen, closely bound together by friendship, but of widely
                    different characters and habits,—Bennet Langton, distinguished by his skill in
                    Greek literature, by the orthodoxy of his opinions, and by the sanctity of his
                    life, and Topham Beauclerk, renowned for his amours, his knowledge of the gay
                    world, his fastidious taste, and his sarcastic wit. To predominate over such a
                    society was not easy. Yet even over such a society Johnson predominated. Burke
                    might indeed have disputed the supremacy to which others were under the
                    necessity of submitting. But Burke, though not generally a very patient
                    listener, was content to take the second part when Johnson was present; and the
                    club itself, consisting of so many eminent men, is to this day popularly
                    designated as Johnson’s club.</p>
                <p>Among the members of this celebrated body was one to whom it has owed the greater
                    part of its celebrity, yet who was regarded with little respect by his brethren,
                    and had not without difficulty obtained a seat among them. This was James
                    Boswell, a young Scotch lawyer, heir to an honourable name and a fair estate.
                    That he was a coxcomb and a bore, weak, vain, pushing, curious, garrulous, was
                    .obvious to all who were acquainted with him. That he could not reason, that he
                    had no wit, no humour, no eloquence, is apparent from his writings. And yet his
                    writings are read beyond the Mississippi, and under the Southern Cross, and are
                    likely to be read as long as the English exists either as a living or as a dead
                    language. Nature had made him a slave and an idolater. His mind resembled those
                    creepers which the botanists call parasites, and which can subsist only by
                    clinging round the stems and imbibing the juices of stronger plants. He must
                    have fastened himself on somebody. He might have fastened himself on Wilkes, and
                    have become the <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> fiercest patriot in the Bill of
                    Rights Society. He might have fastened himself on Whitfield, and have become the
                    loudest fieldpreacher among the Calvinistic Methodists. In a happy hour he
                    fastened himself on Johnson. The pair might seem ill-matched. For Johnson had
                    early been prejudiced <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n760/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0760-0727"/> against Boswell’s country. To a man of Johnson’s
                    strong understanding and irritable temper, the silly egotism and adulation of
                    Boswell must have been as teasing as the constant buzz of a fly. Johnson hated
                    to be questioned; and Boswell was eternally catechizing him on all kinds of
                    subjects, and sometimes propounded such questions as, “What would you do, sir,
                    if you were locked up in a tower with a baby I” Johnson was a water drinker and
                    Boswell was a winebibber, and indeed little better than an habitual sot. It was
                    impossible that there should be perfect harmony between two such companions.
                    Indeed, the great man was sometimes provoked into fits of passion, in which he
                    said things which the small man, during a few hours, seriously resented. Every
                    quarrel, however, was soon made up. During twenty years the disciple continued
                    to worship the master; the master continued to scold the disciple, to sneer at
                    him, and to love him. The two friends ordinarily resided at a great distance
                    from each other. Boswell practised in the Parliament House of Edinburgh, and
                    could pay only occasional visits to London. During those visits his chief
                    business was to watch Johnson, to discover all Johnson’s habits, to turn the
                    conversation to subjects about which Johnson was likely to say something
                    remarkable, and to fill quarto notebooks with minutes of what Johnson had said.
                    In this way were gathered the materials out of which was afterwards constructed
                    the most interesting biographical work in the world.</p>
                <p>Soon after the club began to exist, Johnson formed a connexion less important
                    indeed to his fame, but much more important to his happiness, than his connexion
                    with Boswell. Henry Thrale, one of the most opulent brewers in the kingdom, a
                    man of sound and cultivated understanding, rigid principles, and liberal spirit,
                    was married to one of those clever, kind-hearted, engaging, vain, pert young
                    women, who are perpetually doing or saying what is not exactly right, but who,
                    do or say what they may, are always agreeable. In 1765 the Thrales became
                    acquainted with Johnson, and the acquaintance ripened fast into friendship. They
                    were astonished and delighted by the brilliancy of his conversation. They were
                    flattered by finding that a man so widely celebrated preferred their house to
                    any other in London. Even the peculiarities which seemed to unfit him for
                    civilized society, his gesticulations, his rollings, his puffings, his
                    mutterings, the strange way in which he put on his clothes, the ravenous
                    eagerness with which he devoured his dinner, his fits of melancholy, his fits of
                    anger, his frequent rudeness, his occasional ferocity, increased the interest
                    which his new associates took in him. For these things were the cruel marks left
                    behind by a life which had been one long conflict with disease and with
                    adversity. In a vulgar hack writer such oddities would have excited only
                    disgust. But in a man of genius, learning, and virtue their effect was to add
                    pity to admiration and esteem. Johnson soon had an apartment at the brewery in
                    Southwark, and a still more pleasant apartment at the villa of his friends on
                    Streatham Common. A large part of every year he passed in those abodes, abodes
                    which must have seemed magnificent and luxurious indeed, when compared with the
                    dens in which he had generally been lodged. But his chief pleasures were derived
                    from what the astronomer of his Abyssinian tale called “the endearing elegance
                    of female friendship.” Mrs Thrale rallied him, soothed him, coaxed him, and, if
                    she sometimes provoked him by her flippancy, made ample amends by listening to
                    his reproofs with angelic sweetness of temper. When he was diseased in body and
                    in mind, she was the most tender of nurses. No comfort that wealth could
                    purchase, no contrivance that womanly ingenuity, set to work by womanly
                    compassion, could devise, was wanting to his sick room. He requited her kindness
                    by an affection pure as the affection of a father, yet delicately tinged with a
                    gallantry which, though awkward, must have been more flattering than the
                    attentions of a crowd of the fools who gloried in the names, now obsolete, of
                    Buck and Maccaroni. It would seem that a full half of Johnson’s life during
                    about sixteen years was passed under the roof of the Thrales. He accompanied the
                    family sometimes to Bath, and sometimes to Brighton, once to Wales and once to
                    Paris. But he had at the same time a house in one of the narrow and gloomy
                    courts on the north of Fleet Street. In the garrets was his library, a large and
                    miscellaneous collection of books, falling to pieces and begrimed with dust. On
                    a lower floor he sometimes, but very rarely, regaled a friend with a plain
                    dinner—a veal pie, or a leg of ]amb and spinach, and a rice pudding. Nor was the
                    dwelling uninhabited during his long absences. It was the home of the most
                    extraordinary assemblage of inmates that ever was brought together. At the head
                    of the establishment Johnson had placed an old lady named Williams, whose chief
                    recommendations were her blindness and her poverty. But, in spite of her murmurs
                    and reproaches, he gave an asylum to another lady who was as poor as herself,
                    Mrs Desmoulins, whose family he had known many years before in Staffordshire.
                    Room was found for the daughter of Mrs Desmoulins, and for another destitute
                    damsel, who was generally addressed as Miss Carmichael, but whom her ^generous
                    host called Polly. An old quack doctor named Levett, who bled and. dosed
                    coal-heavers and hackney coachmen, and received for fees crusts of bread, bits
                    of bacon, glasses of gin, and sometimes a little copper, completed this strange
                    menagerie. All these poor creatures were at constant war with each other, and
                    with Johnson’s negro servant Frank. Sometimes, indeed, they transferred their
                    hostilities from the servant to the master, complained that a better table was
                    not kept for them, and railed or maundered till their benefactor was glad to
                    make his escape to Streatham, or to the Mitre Tavern. And yet he, who was
                    generally the haughtiest and most irritable of mankind, who was but too prompt
                    to resent anything which looked like a slight on the part of a purse-proud
                    bookseller, or of a noble and powerful patron, bore patiently from mendicants,
                    who, but for his bounty, must have gone to the workhouse, insults more provoking
                    than those for which he had knocked down Osborne and bidden defiance to
                    Chesterfield. Year after year Mrs Williams and Mrs Desmoulins, Polly and Levett,
                    continued to torment him and to live upon him.</p>
                <p>The course of life which has been described was interrupted in Johnson’s
                    sixty-fourth year by an important event. He had early read an account of the
                    Hebrides, and had been much interested by learning that there was so near him a
                    land peopled by a race which was still as rude and simple as in the Middle Ages.
                    A wish to become intimately acquainted with a state of society so utterly unlike
                    all that he had ever seen frequently crossed his mind. But it is not probable
                    that his curiosity would have overcome his habitual sluggishness, and his love
                    of the smoke, the mud, and the cries of London, had not Boswell importuned him
                    to attempt the adventure, and offered to be his squire. At length, in August
                    1773, Johnson crossed the Highland line, and plunged courageously into what was
                    then considered, by most Englishmen, as a dreary and perilous wilderness. After
                    wandering about two months through the Celtic region, sometimes in rude boats
                    which did not protect him from the rain, and sometimes on small shaggy ponys
                    which could hardly bear his weight, he returned to his old haunts with a mind
                    full of new images and new theories. During the following year he employed
                    himself in recording his adventures. About the beginning of 1775 his <hi
                    rend="italic">Journey to the Hebrides</hi> was published, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n761/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0761-0728"/> was, during some weeks, the chief subject of
                    conversation in all circles in which any attention was paid to literature. The
                    book is still read with pleasure. The narrative is entertaining; the
                    speculations, whether sound or unsound, are always ingenious; and the style,
                    though too stiff and pompous, is somewhat easier and more graceful than that of
                    his early writings. His prejudice against the Scotch had at length become little
                    more than matter of jest; and whatever remained of the old feeling had been
                    effectually removed by the kind and respectful hospitality with which he had
                    been received in every part of Scotland. It was, of course, not to be expected
                    that an Oxonian Tory should praise the Presbyterian polity and ritual, or that
                    an eye accustomed to the hedgerows and parks of England should not be struck by
                    the bareness of Berwickshire and East Lothian. But even in censure Johnson’s
                    tone is not unfriendly. The most enlightened Scotchmen, with Lord Mansfield at
                    their head, were well pleased. But some foolish and ignorant Scotchmen were
                    moved to anger by a little unpalatable truth which was mingled with much eulogy,
                    and assailed him whom they chose to consider as the enemy of their country with
                    libels much more dishonourable to their country than anything that he had ever
                    said or written. They published paragraphs in the newspapers, articles in the
                    magazines, sixpenny pamphlets, five-shilling books. One scribbler abused Johnson
                    for being blear-eyed, another for being a pensioner; a third informed the world
                    that one of the doctor’s uncles had been convicted of felony in Scotland, and
                    had found that there was in that country one tree capable of supporting the
                    weight of an Englishman. Macpherson, whose <hi rend="italic">Fingal</hi> had
                    been proved in the <hi rend="italic">Journey</hi> to be an impudent forgery,
                    threatened to take vengeance with a cane. The only effect of this threat was
                    that Johnson reiterated the charge of forgery in the most contemptuous terms,
                    and walked about, during some time, with a cudgel, which, if the impostor had
                    not been too wise to encounter it, would assuredly have descended upon him, to
                    borrow the sublime language of his own epic poem, “like a hammer on the red son
                    of the furnace.”</p>
                <p>Of other assailants Johnson took no notice whatever. He had early resolved never
                    to be drawn into controversy; and he adhered to his resolution with a
                    steadfastness which is the more extraordinary because he was, both
                    intellectually and morally, of the stuff of which controversialists are made. In
                    conversation he was a singularly eager, acute, and pertinacious disputant. When
                    at a loss for good reasons, he had recourse to sophistry; and jvhen heated by
                    altercation, he made unsparing use of sarcasm and invective. But when he took
                    his pen in his hand, his whole character seemed to be changed. A hundred bad
                    writers misrepresented him and reviled him; but not one of the hundred could
                    boast of having been thought by him worthy of a refutation, or even of a retort.
                    The Kenricks, Campbells, MacNicols, and Hendersons did their best to annoy him,
                    in the hope that he would give them importance by answering them. But the reader
                    will in vain search his works for any allusion to Kenrick or Campbell, to
                    MacNicol or Henderson. One Scotchman, bent on vindicating the fame of Scotch
                    learning, defied him to the combat in a detestable Latin hexameter—</p>
                <p>“Maxime, si tu vis, cupio contendere tecum.”</p>
                <p>But Johnson took no notice of the challenge. He had learned, both from his own
                    observation and from literary history, in which he was deeply read, that the
                    place of books in the public estimation is fixed, not by what is written about
                    them, but by what is written in them, and that an author whose works are likely
                    to live is very unwise if he stoops to wrangle with detractors whose works are
                    certain to die. He always maintained that fame was a shuttlecock which could be
                    kept up only by being beaten back as well as beaten forward, and which would
                    soon fall if there were only one battledore. No saying was oftener in his mouth
                    than that fine apophthegm of Bentley, that no man was ever written down but by
                    himself.</p>
                <p>Unhappily, a few months after the appearance of the <hi rend="italic">Journey to
                    the Hebrides,</hi> Johnson did what none of his envious assailants could have
                    done, and to a certain extent succeeded in writing himself down. The disputes
                    between England and her American colonies had reached a point at which no
                    amicable adjustment was possible. Civil war was evidently impending; and the
                    ministers seem to have thought that the eloquence of Johnson might with
                    advantage be employed to inflame the nation against the opposition here, and
                    against the rebels beyond the Atlantic. He had already written two or three
                    tracts in defence of the foreign and domestic policy of the Government; and
                    those tracts, though hardly worthy of him, were much superior to the crowd of
                    pamphlets which lay on the counters of Almon and Stockdale. But his <hi
                    rend="italic">Taxation No Tyranny</hi> was a pitiable failure. The very title
                    was a silly phrase, which can have been recommended to his choice by nothing but
                    a jingling alliteration which he ought to have despised. The arguments were such
                    as boys use in debating societies. The pleasantry was as awkward as the gambols
                    of a hippopotamus. Even Boswell was forced to own that in this unfortunate piece
                    he could detect no trace of his master’s powers. The general opinion was that
                    the strong faculties which had produced the <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Rambler</hi> were beginning to feel the effect of time
                    and of disease, and that the old man would best consult his credit by writing no
                    more.</p>
                <p>But this was a great mistake. Johnson had failed, not because his mind was less
                    vigorous than when he wrote <hi rend="italic">liasselas</hi> in the evenings of
                    a week, but because he had foolishly chosen, or suffered others to choose for
                    him, a subject such as he would at no time have been competent to treat. He was
                    in no sense a statesman. He never willingly read or thought or talked about
                    affairs of state. He loved biography, literary history, the history of manners;
                    but political history was positively distasteful to him. The question at issue
                    between the colonies and the mother country was a question about which he had
                    really nothing to say. He failed, therefore, as the greatest men must fail when
                    they attempt to do that for which they are unfit,—as Burke would have failed if
                    Burke had tried to write comedies like those of Sheridan, as Reynolds would have
                    failed if Reynolds had tried to paint landscapes like those of Wilson. Happily,
                    Johnson soon had an opportunity of proving most signally that his failure was
                    not to be ascribed to intellectual decay.</p>
                <p>On Easter eve 1777 some persons, deputed by a meeting which consisted of forty of
                    the first booksellers in London, called upon him. Though he had some scruples
                    about doing business at that season, he received his visitors with much
                    civility. They came to inform him that a new edition of the English poets, from
                    Cowley downwards, was in contemplation, and to ask him to furnish short
                    biographical prefaces. He readily undertook the task, a task for which he was
                    pre-eminently qualified. His knowledge of the literary history of England since
                    the Restoration was unrivalled. That knowledge he had derived partly from books,
                    and partly from sources which had long been closed: from old Grub Street
                    traditions; from the talk of forgotten poetasters and pamphleteers, who had long
                    been lying in parish vaults; from the recollections of such men as Gilbert
                    Walmesley, who had conversed with the wits of Button, Cibber, who had mutilated
                    the plays of two generations of dramatists, Orrery, who had been admitted to the
                    society of Swift, and Savage, who had rendered services of no very honourable
                    kind to Pope. The biographer therefore <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n762/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0762-0729"/> sat down to his task with a mind full of matter.
                    He had at first intended to give only a paragraph to every minor poet, and only
                    four or five pages to the greatest name. But the flood of anecdote and criticism
                    overflowed the narrow channel. The work, which was originally meant to consist
                    only of a few sheets, swelled into ten volumes, small volumes, it is true, and
                    not closely printed. The first four appeared in 1779, the remaining six in
                    1781.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Lives of the Poets</hi> are, on the whole, the best of
                    Johnson’s works. The narratives are as entertaining as any novel. The remarks on
                    life and on human nature are eminently shrewd and profound. The criticisms are
                    often excellent, and, even when grossly and provokingly unjust, well deserve to
                    be studied. For, however erroneous they may be, they are never silly. They are
                    the judgments of a mind trammelled by prejudice and deficient in sensibility,
                    but vigorous and acute. They therefore generally contain a portion of valuable
                    truth which deserves to be separated from the alloy; and, at the very worst,
                    they mean something, a praise to which much of what is called criticism in our
                    time has no pretensions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Savage's Life</hi> Johnson reprinted nearly as it had appeared
                    in 1744. Whoever, after reading that life, will turn to the other lives will be
                    struck by the difference of style. Since Johnson had been at ease in his
                    circumstances he had written little and had talked much. When therefore he,
                    after the lapse of years, resumed his pen, the mannerism which he had contracted
                    while he was in the constant habit of elaborate composition was less perceptible
                    than formerly, and his diction frequently had a colloquial ease which it had
                    formerly wanted. The improvement may be discerned by a skilful critic in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journey to the Hebrides,</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">Lives
                    of the Poets</hi> is so obvious that it cannot escape the notice of the most
                    careless reader.</p>
                <p>Among the <hi rend="italic">Lives</hi> the best are perhaps those of Cowley,
                    Dryden, and Pope. The very worst is, beyond all doubt, that of Gray.</p>
                <p>This great work at once became popular. There was, indeed, much just and much
                    unjust censure; but even those who were loudest in blame were attracted by the
                    book in spite of themselves. Malone computed the gains of the publishers at five
                    or six thousand pounds. But the writer was very poorly remunerated. Intending at
                    first to write very short prefaces, he had stipulated for only two hundred
                    guineas. The booksellers, when they saw how far his performance had surpassed
                    his promise, added only another hundred. Indeed Johnson, though he did not
                    despise or affect to despise money, and though his strong sense and long
                    experience ought to have qualified him to protect his own interests, seems to
                    have been singularly unskilful and unlucky in his literary bargains. He was
                    generally reputed the first English writer of his time. Yet several writers of
                    his time sold their copyrights for sums such as he never ventured to ask. To
                    give a single instance, Robertson received four thousand five hundred pounds for
                    the <hi rend="italic">History of Charles V.',</hi> and it is no disrespect to
                    the memory of Robertson to say that the <hi rend="italic">History of Charles
                    V.</hi> is both a less valuable and a less amusing book than the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lives of the Poets.</hi></p>
                <p>Johnson was now in his seventy-second year. The infirmities of age were coming
                    fast upon him. That inevitable event of which he never thought without horror
                    was brought near to him; and his whole life was darkened by the shadow of death.
                    He had often to pay the cruel price of longevity. Every year he lost what could
                    never be replaced. The strange dependants to whom he had given shelter, and to
                    whom, in spite of their faults, he was strongly attached by habit, dropped off
                    one by one; and, in the silence of his home, he regretted even the noise of
                    their scolding matches. The kind and generous Thrale was no more; and it would
                    have been well if his wife had been laid beside him. But she survived to be the
                    laughingstock of those who had envied her, and to draw from the eyes of the old
                    man who had loved her beyond anything in the world tears far more bitter than he
                    would have shed over her grave. With some estimable and many agreeable
                    qualities, she was not made to be independent. The control of a mind more
                    steadfast than her own was necessary to her respectability. While she was
                    restrained by her husband, a man of sense and firmness, indulgent to her taste
                    in trifles, but always the undisputed master of his house, her worst offences
                    had been impertinent jokes, white lies, and short fits of pettishness ending in
                    sunny good humour. But he was gone; and she was left an opulent widow of forty,
                    with strong sensibility, volatile fancy, and slender judgment. She soon fell in
                    love with a musicmaster from Brescia, in whom nobody but herself could discover
                    anything to admire. Her pride, and perhaps some better feelings, struggled hard
                    against this degrading passion. But the struggle irritated her nerves, soured
                    her temper, and at length endangered her health. Conscious that her choice was
                    one which Johnson could not approve, she became desirous to escape from his
                    inspection. Her manner towards him changed. She was sometimes cold and sometimes
                    petulant. She did not conceal her joy when he left Streatham; she never pressed
                    him to return; and, if he came unbidden, she received him in a manner which
                    convinced him that he was no longer a welcome guest. He took the very
                    intelligible hints which she gave. He read for the last time a chapter of the
                    Greek Testament in the library which had been formed by himself. In a solemn and
                    tender prayer he commended the house and its inmates to the Divine protection,
                    and, with emotions which choked his voice and convulsed his powerful frame, left
                    for ever that beloved home for the gloomy and desolate house behind Fleet
                    Street, where the few and evil days which still remained to him were to run out.
                    Here, in June 1783, he had a paralytic stroke, from which, however, he
                    recovered, and which does not appear to have at all impaired his intellectual
                    faculties. But other maladies came thick upon him. His asthma tormented him day
                    and night. Dropsical symptoms made their appearance. While sinking under a
                    complication of diseases, he heard that the woman whose friendship had been the
                    chief happiness of sixteen years of his life had married an Italian fiddler,
                    that all London was crying shame upon her, and that the newspapers and magazines
                    were filled with allusions to the Ephesian matron and the two pictures in
                    Hamlet. He vehemently said that he would try to forget her existence. He never
                    uttered her name. Every memorial of her which met his eye he flung into the
                    fire. She meanwhile fled from the laughter and hisses of her countrymen and
                    countrywomen to a land where she was unknown, hastened across Mount Cenis, and
                    learned, while passing a merry Christmas of concerts and lemonade parties at
                    Milan, that the great man with whose name hers is inseparably associated had
                    ceased to exist.</p>
                <p>He had, in spite of much mental and much bodily affliction, clung vehemently to
                    life. The feeling described in that fine but gloomy paper which closes the
                    series of his <hi rend="italic">Idlers</hi> seemed to grow stronger in him as
                    his last hour drew near. He fancied that he should be able to draw his breath
                    more easily in a southern climate, and would probably have set out for Rome and
                    Naples but for his fear of the expense of the journey. That expense, indeed, he
                    had the means of defraying; for he had laid up about two thousand pounds, the
                    fruit of labours which had made the fortune of several publishers. But he was
                    unwilling to break in upon this hoard, and he seems to have wished even to keep
                    its existence a secret. Some of his friends <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n763/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0763-0730"/> hoped that the Government might be induced to
                    increase his pension to six hundred pounds a year, but this hope was
                    disappointed, and he resolved to stand one English winter more. That winter was
                    his last. His legs grew weaker; his breath grew shorter; the fatal water
                    gathered fast, in spite of incisions which he, courageous against pain but timid
                    against death, urged his surgeons to make deeper and deeper. Though the tender
                    care which had mitigated his sufferings during months of sickness at Streatham
                    was withdrawn, he was not left desolate. The ablest physicians and surgeons
                    attended him, and refused to accept fees from him. Burke parted from him with
                    deep emotion. Windham sat much in the sick room, arranged the pillows, and sent
                    his own servant to watch at night by the bed. Frances Burney, whom the old man
                    had cherished with fatherly kindness, stood weeping at the door; while Langton,
                    whose piety eminently qualified him to be an adviser and comforter at such a
                    time, received the last pressure of his friend’s hand within. When at length the
                    moment, dreaded through so many years, came close, the dark cloud passed away
                    from Johnson’s mind. His temper became unusually patient and gentle; he ceased
                    to think with terror of death, and of that which lies beyond death; and he spoke
                    much of the mercy of God, and of the propitiation of Christ. In this serene
                    frame of mind he died on the 13th of December 1784. He was laid, a week later,
                    in Westminster Abbey, among the eminent men of whom he had been the
                    historian,—Cowley and Denham, Dryden and Congreve, Gay, Prior, and Addison.</p>
                <p>Since his death the popularity of his works—the <hi rend="italic">Lives of the
                    Poets,</hi> and perhaps the <hi rend="italic">Vanity of Human Wishes,</hi>
                    excepted—has greatly diminished. His <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi> has been
                    altered by editors till it can scarcely be called his. An allusion to his <hi
                    rend="italic">Rambler</hi> or his <hi rend="italic">Idler</hi> is not readily
                    apprehended in literary circles. The fame even of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rasselas</hi> has grown somewhat dim. But, though the celebrity of the writings
                    may have declined, the celebrity of the writer, strange to say, is as great as
                    ever. Boswell’s book has done for him more than the best of his own books could
                    do. The memory of other authors is kept alive by their works. But the memory of
                    Johnson keeps many of his works alive. The old philosopher is still among us in
                    the brown coat with the metal buttons and the shirt which ought to be at wash,
                    blinking, puffing, rolling his head, drumming with his fingers, tearing his meat
                    like a tiger, and swallowing his tea in oceans. No human being who has been more
                    than seventy years in the grave is so well known to us. And it is but just to
                    say that our intimate acquaintance with what he would, himself have called the
                    anfractuosities of his intellect and of his temper serves only to strengthen our
                    conviction that he was both a great and a good man. <hi rend="smallcaps"
