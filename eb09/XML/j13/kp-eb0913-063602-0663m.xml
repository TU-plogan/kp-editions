                <p>The history of Jerusalem exploration dates from the year 1833, when Bonomi,
                    Catherwood, and Arundale succeeded in obtaining admission into the Haram (HarAm)
                    enclosure and made the first survey of its buildings. In 1838 and 1852 the city
                    was visited by the famous American traveller Dr Robinson, and his bold
                    impeachment of the traditional topography, while raising a storm of controversy,
                    laid the foundation of a truer understanding of the antiquities of Jerusalem. In
                    1849 Jerusalem was surveyed by Lieutenants Aldrich and Symonds of the Royal
                    Engineers, and maps by Vandevelde, Thrupp, Barclay, and others were subsequently
                    published. All these earlier attempts were, however, superseded in 1866 by the
                    ordnance survey executed by Captain (now Colonel) Wilson, R.E., whose plans of
                    the city and its environs, and of the Haram •enclosure and other public
                    buildings are the standard authorities on which all subsequent work has been
                    based. During the years 1867-70 excavations of a most adventurous description
                    were carried on by Captain (now Colonel) Warren, R.E. The results, especially in
                    the vicinity of the Haram, were of primary importance, and many stoutly
                    •contested theories have now succumbed to the testimony of the spade. During
                    1872-75 some further explorations were carried on by Lieutenant Conder, R.E.,
                    while for many years a most valuable series of observations of the levels of the
                    rock beneath the rubbish on which the modern city •stands has been carried out
                    by Mr C. Schick, architect.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See Zimmermann’s <hi rend="italic">Karten und Pläne zur Top. d. alt.

                    >Quark Stat. ofP.E.F.,</hi> 1880, p. 82.</p></note></p>
                <p>The present account of the city is based on the results which have thus been
                    obtained by actual exploration; but, although so much has been done during the
                    last fifteen years to clear up disputed questions, much still remains to be
                    accomplished.</p>
                <p>The geographical situation of Jerusalem has now been determined by trigonometry
                    to be 31° 46' 45'' N. lat. and 35° 13' 25" E. long, of Greenwich (taken at the
                    dome of the Holy Sepulchre church). The city stands at the extremity of a
                    plateau which shelves down in a south-east direction from the watershed ridge of
                    Judaea, which is here somewhat contorted. About a mile north of the town the
                    ridge coming from the north is deflected towards the west at an elevation
                    averaging 2600 feet above the Mediterranean, and thus passes clear of the city
                    on its west side. From this ridge at the point of deflexion an important spur
                    with steep and rugged eastern slopes runs out southeast for miles, and thence
                    southwards for 1¾ miles more. The spur culminates in two principal summits, the
                    most northerly 2725 feet above the sea, the second (now crowned with a village
                    and a minaret) 2650 feet above the same level; and there is a third summit or
                    knoll on the south terminating the spur and rising to an elevation of 2410 feet.
                    To this chain (but more especially to the central summit with the minaret on it,
                    now called <hi rend="italic">Jebel</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> Tôt)</hi> the name Olivet applies. The plateau between this chain
                    and the watershed ridge is drained by two flat open valley heads which form a
                    junction about ∣ mile north of the north-east angle of the modern city, and
                    become a deep ravine with sides steep and in places precipitous, running
                    immediately beneath and west of Olivet for a distance of 1∣ miles from the
                    junction to a well called <hi rend="italic">Bîr Byûb,</hi> where the bed is 1979
                    feet above the Mediterranean and 430 feet below the termination of the Olivet
                    chain. This valley is the “brook” <hi rend="italic">lrιahal</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">fiumara)</hi> Kidron, bounding the site of Jerusalem on the east.
                    A second valley (W. er Rabâby) has its head in a shallow depression north-west
                    of the city close to the watershed, whence it first runs south for about ⅜ mile,
                    and then—rapidly deepening and flanked by low precipices—trends east for another
                    ∣ mile, joining the Kidron in an open plot close to the Bîr Eyûb above noticed.
                    The second valley thus flanking Jerusalem on the west and south encloses an area
                    half a mile wide and rudely quadrangular,—the seat of the city itself whether
                    ancient or modern.</p>
                <p>The site thus generally described—a natural fortress standing on spurs of hill
                    surrounded on three sides by valleys 300 to 400 feet deep—is but imperfectly
                    supplied with water. Only one spring exists anywhere near the city, namely, that
                    in the Kidron valley, about 700 yards above the junction with the western
                    ravine, now called the “spring with steps” <hi rend="italic">(Urnrn ed
                    Derejj,</hi> or the “Virgin’s spring.” The vicinity of Jerusalem consists of
                    strata of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n664/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0664-0637"/> the Eocene and Chalk formations, having a general
                    dip down from the watershed of about 10° E.S.E, The action of denudation has
                    left patches of the various strata, but generally speaking the oldest are on the
                    west. The upper part of the Olivet chain consists of a soft white limestone,
                    with fossils and flint bands belonging to the Upper Chalk: beneath this
                    are—first, a hard silicious chalk, with flint bands; secondly, a soft white
                    limestone, much used in the ancient buildings of the city; thirdly, a hard
                    chalk, often pink and white in colour, and then known as Sta. Croce marble. The
                    underlying beds belonging to the period of the Greensand are not visible, the
                    lowest strata in the Kidron precipices belonging to the Lower Chalk·epoch.</p>
                <p>The actual position of the city at various times has differed but little in
                    comparison with other capitals. The outline of the small spurs concerning which
                    so many famous controversies have arisen is now much obscured by the
                    accumulation of rubbish, which has been increasing ever since the time of
                    Nehemiah (Neh. iv. 10). There is an average depth of from 30 to 40 feet of this
                    debris throughout the town, and the foundations of the modern houses often stand
                    upon it. In the valleys there is a depth of 70 feet, and east of the temple in
                    one place shafts were sunk 120 feet before the rock was reached. The natural
                    features of the ground, although unaltered and traceable to a practised eye, are
                    thus less sharply accentuated than in the ancient period of the city’s history.
                    As, however, we have now more than two hundred and fifty actual observations of
                    the rock levels in an area of 210 acres, there is no difficulty in recovering
                    the general features of the ancient natural site of the town.</p>
                <p>The quadrangle included between the two outer valleys above described is again
                    split up by a valley, the Tyropoeon of Josephus, which divides the plateau into
                    two main spurs, —that on the east being the temple hill, that on the west the
                    seat of the upper city. The Tyropoeon is both shallower and broader than the
                    boundary ravines already noticed, its depth averaging only from 100 to 150 feet
                    below the crests of the ridges. Its real head is immediately outside the present
                    Damascus gate and the north wall of the modern city, whence it runs with a
                    curved course southwards to join the Kidron just above the junction with the
                    western boundary valley, a distance of about 1600 yards. There is, however, a
                    second affluent or head of the central valley on the west side of its main
                    course—a kind of dell or theatre-shaped depression extending westwards for more
                    than 300 yards, and measuring not quite 200 yards north and south. Thus, while
                    the eastern ridge is unbroken, the western is divided into two summits joined by
                    a narrow saddle which separates the head of the broad central valley just
                    described from the upper part of the western boundary valley.</p>
                <p>Of the two western hill tops, that towards the south is the largest and most
                    lofty. It has a trapezoid shape, and terminates on all sides in steep slopes,
                    which are in places precipitous, and it is only joined to the watershed by the
                    connecting saddle, which is scarcely 50 yards in width. This high southern hill
                    measures 2000 feet north and south by about 1300 feet east and west. The highest
                    part is towards the west, where the level of the flat broad summit is about 2520
                    feet above the Mediterranean. The smaller northern knoll or hill top, bounded on
                    the east by the great central valley of Jerusalem, on the south by the
                    theatre-shaped valley which separates it from the high southern hill, and on the
                    west by a small subsidiary depression running north, rises to a summit not more
                    than 2490 feet in elevation, or 30 feet below the flat top of the larger
                    southern hill.</p>
                <p>The eastern ridge, on which the temple stood, has a height towards the north of
                    about 2500 feet; it then becomes narrower, and is artificially divided by a deep
                    rock-cut trench running east and west. Its original form within the temple
                    enclosure was that of a rounded top with a steep western slope and a more gentle
                    gradient on the east, the level of the ridge falling from 2460 to 2300 feet in a
                    length of about 500 yards. The end of this ridge is formed by a tongue of ground
                    between the Kidron and the shallow central valley, falling rapidly in 400 yards
                    to a level only 50 feet above the valley beds.</p>
                <p>The identity of the present Haram (or sanctuary) with the ancient temple
                    enclosure is undisputed, the only question which has arisen being whether the
                    boundary walls now existing coincide with the outer ramparts of Herod’s temple
                    enclosure. The Haram is a quadrangle containing 35 acres, the interior surface
                    roughly levelled, partly by filling up with earth the portions where the rock is
                    lowest, partly by means of vaulted substructures of various ages. The most
                    important results of Captain Warren’s excavations were those connected with the
                    exploration of the rampart walls, which measure 1601 feet on the west, 922 on
                    south, 1530 on east, and 1042 feet on north, the south-west angle being 90° and
                    the south-east 92° 30'. The height of the wall varies from 30 to 170 feet. On
                    the west, on the south, and on the east for probably 1090 feet from the
                    south-east corner, the masonry is all of one style, the stones being of great
                    size with a marginal draft,—the imperfect finish of the faces in some of the
                    lower courses apparently showing that the foundation-stones were never visible
                    above the surface. The north part of the east wall consists, however, of masonry
                    differing somewhat from the rest, the finish being rougher and the stone of
                    inferior quality. It was found that this wall is continued for some distance
                    beyond the north-east corner of the present area. The present north wall is of
                    quite a different kind of masonry, and appears to be much more recent, the
                    substructures immediately inside being only as old as the 12th century. The
                    north-west angle is formed by a projecting scarped block of rock measuring 350
                    feet east and west and 50 feet north and south, the height <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n665/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0665-0638"/> above the interior court being about 30 feet. On
                    this scarp the modern barracks stand, and a fosse 60 feet deep and 165 feet wide
                    is still traceable outside the rock on the north. A valley bed 100 feet below
                    the level of the Haram court ran across the north-east portion of the area into
                    the Kidron; and south of this the remains of a scarp running east and west have
                    been discovered, but are not as yet -completely explored. The prolongation of
                    this scarp eastwards cuts the east wall of the Haram at the point 1090 feet from
                    the south angle, at which the change in the character of the masonry above
                    explained probably occurs. The evidence thus obtained seems to indicate that an
                    area of about 7∣ acres has been added to the ancient enclosure on the north-east
                    to give it the present quadrangular form, and the rougher masonry on the east
                    appears to have belonged to the city wall constructed by Agrippa and not to the
                    older wall of Herod’s temple.</p>
                <p>At the south-west angle of the Haram enclosure are the remains of an ancient arch
                    (Robinson’s arch), 42 feet span, belonging to a bridge across the Tyropoeon, the
                    west pier of which Captain Warren discovered, as well as the fallen voussoirs,
                    lying on a pavement 40 feet beneath the surface, while under the pavement 20
                    feet lower was found the voussoir of a former bridge on the same site <hi
                    rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Jos., <hi rend="italic">B. J.,</hi> i. 7, 2). At the
                    south-east angle of the enclosure Captain Warren found beneath the surface
                    remains of an ancient wall of finely drafted masonry abutting on the east
                    rampart of the Haram, and here some unexplained marks or letters in red paint
                    were discovered on the lower stones. The buried wall runs southward for 250
                    yards at a height of 70 feet, and is held to be part of the wall of Ophel. The
                    base of a great projecting tower was also laid bare, and identified by the
                    discoverer with the tower of Neh. iii. 25. Another noticeable discovery was the
                    fact that an ancient aqueduct is intersected by the west Haram wall, which must
                    consequently be more recent than the rock tunnel thus destroyed.</p>
                <p>The facts thus ascertained allow of the identification of the great walls still
                    standing with those which supported the outer cloisters of the temple enclosure
                    in the time of Herod’s reconstruction of the edifice. The original area of
                    Solomon’s temple enclosure was doubled by Herod <hi rend="italic">(B. J^.,</hi>
                    i. 21, 1), who took away the ancient foundations and made a quadrangle extending
                    from the fortress of Antonia to the royal cloister, to which a great bridge led
                    from the upper city <hi rend="italic">(B. J^.,</hi> vi. 6, 2), while the eastern
                    limit was formed by the Kidron ravine, the Ophel wall joining the plateau of the
                    temple at the south-east angle <hi rend="italic">(Ant.,</hi> xvMl, <hi
                    rend="italic">5; B. J.,</hi> V. 4, 2).</p>
                <p>The scarped rock at the north-west angle of the Haram, with its outer fosse
                    dividing the temple hill from Bezetha, answers exactly to the description by
                    Josephus of the tower of Antonia <hi rend="italic">(B. J.,</hi> v. 5, 8) and
                    thus serves to identify the north-west angle of the ancient enclosure with the
                    corresponding angle of the modem Haram. The correspondence of the south-west
                    angles of the two areas is established by the discovery of the great bridge, and
                    that of the southeast angles of the same by the exploration of the Ophel wall.
                    The northern boundary of Herod’s temple probably coincided with the scarp
                    already described, 1090 feet north of the south-east angle. The area was thus,
                    roughly speaking, a quadrangle of 1000 feet side, from which the citadel of
                    Antonia, as described by Josephus, projected on the north-west (c∕ <hi

                <p>The natural water-supply of Jerusalem is from the Virgin’s spring already
                    noticed, which comes out from beneath the Ophel ridge in a rocky cave extending
                    12 feet from the face of the hill, and reached by flights of twentyeight steps.
                    The water flows with an intermittent action, rising from beneath the lowest
                    steps, at intervals varying, according to the season and the rainfall, from a
                    few hours to one or even two days.</p>
                <p>From this spring a rock-cut tunnel 1708 feet in length leads through the Ophel
                    ridge to the Pool of Siloam (now <hi rend="italic">Birlcet Silvvan),</hi> which
                    is a rock-cut reservoir with masonry retaining-walls measuring 52 feet by 18
                    feet, having a rock-cut channel leading away from it to a larger pool formed by
                    damming up the flat valley bed with a thick •wall of masonry close to the

                    discovered by Captain Warren. The water of Siloam was originally sweet, but has
                    been fouled and made bitter since the 12th century. From the reservoir it runs

                    course appears on the map; the second from the same locality probably fed the
                    Birket Mamilla, but is now lost; the third from the north collected surface
                    drainage and led to the temple enclosure underground, a distance of 2000 feet
                    only. The great reservoirs in this enclosure, about thirty in number, were
                    capable of holding a total supply of 10 million gallons of water. (c. R. <hi

                <p>Up to the time of David the strong fortress of Jerusalem remained in the hands of
                    the ancient Canaanite inhabitants who were known as Jebusites.<note

                    and the older records use the name Jerusalem, it is not safe to regard Jebus as
                    the earliest name of the city. The reference to Jerusalem in Judg. i. 7 seems to
                    be an interpolation, and Josh. XV. 63, Judg. i. 21 to refer to the time after
                    David.</p></note></p>
                <p>The city was deemed impregnable, but its conquest was one of the first exploits
                    of David, when he became king of all Israel, and had need of a capital that
                    should serve as a base for his military operations and a centre of union for
                    Judah and Israel Lying on the frontier line between his own tribe of Judah and
                    the difficult country of Benjamin, which had been the centre of the struggle
                    with the Philistines since the fall of Shiloh, Jerusalem was admirably adapted
                    for these purposes. The Jebusites were not expelled, but continued to live side
                    by side with the Hebrews (Josh. xv. 63; Judg. i. 21; 2 Sam. xxiv. 18; <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n666/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0666-0639"/> Zech. ix. 7). David himself occupied “the
                    mountain fortress (<hi rend="superscript"> fl</hi> 1V9) of Zion,” which was
                    strengthened by new walls and received the name of the city of David. Here a
                    palace was built by Tyrian architects, and the new capital was consecrated by
                    the removal to it of the ark.</p>
                <p>The site of the city of David forms the fundamental question of Jerusalem
                    topography. The current traditional view (but not that of the most ancient
                    tradition even in the Christian church) makes Zion the southern eminence of the
                    western hill, and places David’s fortress there. More recently Messrs Warren and
                    Conder have contended that the city of David is identical with the Aera of
                    Josephus, and place the latter on the northern summit of the vzestern hill,
                    between the two branches of the Tyropceon (see below). A third view places the
                    city of David on the southern part of the Temple hill; and this opinion is not
                    only conformed to the oldest post-Biblical tradition (1 Maccabees, Jerome,
                    &amp;c.), in which Zion certainly means the Temple hill, but is the only view
                    that does justice to the language of the Old Testament.</p>
                <p>It is necessary at the outset to clear away the popular idea that the capital of
                    David was already a great town, occupying a site comparable in extent with that
                    of the later city. Certainly if all the Levites and sacred ministers mentioned
                    in Chronicles were actually assembled at Zion in David’s time, we might conclude
                    that the town was already a capital on a grand scale. But the Chronicler
                    constantly carries back later institutions into primitive times, and the early
                    history, which alone can be viewed as a safe guide, gives quite another picture.
                    Zion was merely one of the “mountain fortresses” found all over Palestine as
                    places of refuge in time of invasion, and was garrisoned by a handful of
                    mercenaries (the <hi rend="italic">Cibborim).</hi> The whole levy of Israel in
                    David’s time was but 30,000 men (2 Sam. vi. 1; comp, the 40,000 of Judg. v. 8),
                    and before the development of trade among the Hebrews Jerusalem had not the
                    natural conditions for the growth of a great city. In the first instance the
                    town doubtless consisted mainly of the court and its dependants, with the
                    Jebusite population, who must have been predominantly agricultural and limited
                    in number by the limitation of their territory. Now it is quite incredible that
                    the Temple hill was ever excluded from Zion. Throughout the Old Testament Zion
                    appears as the holy mountain, the seat of the sanctuary. It is true at the same
                    time that Zion and the site of Jerusalem are interchangeable ideas in Hebrew
                    literature; but this only proves that the mountain of the sanctuary was
                    essentially the mountain on which the city stood.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The explanatory note of an editor in 1 Kings
                    viii. 1, “the city of David, which is Zion,” cannot be strained to mean that the
                    removal of the ark from the city of David to the temple was its removal from the
                    mountain of Zion to another hill.</p></note> Further, it is clear from 1 Kings
                    viii. 1 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> 2 Sam. xxiv. 18, that the temple stood above
                    the city of David, as elsewhere in Hebrew holy places the sanctuary crowned the
                    hill on whose slopes the town stood. Moreover, the graves of the kings, which
                    were certainly in the city of David, encroached on the temple enclosure (Ezek.
                    xliii. 7, 8), which indeed at the time of the captivity was closely built up <hi
                    rend="italic">(ibid.),</hi> and stood in the middle of the city (Ezek. xi. 23).
                    Again, Micah iv. 8 identifies the ancient “tower of the flock,” the original
                    seat of the kingdom at Jerusalem, with “Ophel of the daughter of Zion.” But
                    Ophel is one of the few topographical names that can be traced down to the time
                    of Josephus, whose description shows that it lιy to the south-east of the
                    temple. Still more precise is the determination given by references to the one
                    fountain of Jerusalem, which, as we have seen, springs out under the temple hill
                    on the east. According to Neh. iii. 15, xii. 37, the city of David was reached
                    by a stair in the vicinity of the fountain gate and the pool of Siloah.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The fountain gate is the gate
                    beside Siloah, which is itself called the fountain (1r7jγ⅛) by Josephus <hi
                    rend="italic">{B. J.,</hi> v. 4, 1).</p></note> This ascent led up above David’s
                    palace to the water gate, where in Nehemiah’s time there was an open space in
                    front of the temple (comp. Neh. viii. 1, 16 with Ezra x. 9). Thus we see that
                    David’s palace lay between the temple and the pool of Siloahor King’s pool (Neh.
                    ii. 14). These notices are the more important because the water system connected
                    with the Virgin’s spring forms almost the only quite certain part of Jerusalem’s
                    topography. The spring itself is Gihon, which from its name must have been a
                    true spring, while 2 Chron. xxxiii. 14 teaches us to look for it in the Kidron
                    valley (Sm). The subterranean conduit which still exists had for its object to
                    conduct the water inside the city, and appears to be that constructed by
                    Hezekiah (2 Kings XX. 20). In Isa. xxii. 8, 11 we read of a lower pool and an
                    old pool (no doubt identical with the upper pool, Isa. vii. 3; 2 Kings xviii.
                    17), whose waters-were collected in the time of Hezekiah, under apprehension of
                    siege, in a reservoir between the two walls. From this passage, compared with
                    Neh. iii. 15, we gather that Hezekiah’s pool was protected by an outer line of
                    fortification, and here lay the gate of the two walls (2 Kings xxv. 4), with the
                    royal gardens beside them. The supplementary notices of the conduit and the
                    outer wall, given in Chronicles, have not the weight of contemporary history,
                    but they show the writer to have still possessed the same tradition as to the
                    place of the city of David, for he describes its outer wall as running along the
                    Kidron valley west of Gihon <hi rend="italic">{i.e.,</hi> so as to leave the
                    fountain outside, 2 Chron. xxxiii. 14; comp, xxxii, 3, 4), and tells us that
                    Hezekiah’s conduit brought the water of Gihon in a westerly direction to the
                    city of David (chap, xxxii. 30).</p>
                <p>According to the Bible, then, the city of David lay on the southern part of the
                    hill which his son crowned with the temple.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The statements of Josephus as to the topography of the city
                    of David and Solomon are of no independent value. He possessed no sources except
                    the Old Testament.</p></note> The chief feature in the fortifications was a
                    tower named Millo, perhaps on the site of the modern barracks, protecting the
                    approach to Zion from the north. The town had but little splendour. The king
                    occupied a wooden palace, the work of foreign craftsmen, and the ark still dwelt
                    in curtains. Under Solomon, who had the true Oriental passion for building and
                    luxury, and squandered enormous sums on his court, great improvements were made,
                    especially by the erection of the twin palaces “the house of Jehovah and the
                    house of the king,” constructed of stonework strengthened by string courses of
                    wooden beams in the still familiar style of Arabian building. The palace, which
                    took nearly twice as long to erect as the temple, consisted of a great complex
                    of buildings and porticos, including the porch of judgment, an armoury, and the
                    palace of the queen.</p>
                <p>The site of the palace has been variously assigned by topographers. But it lay

                    and all the indications given in the Old Testament lead us to place it quite
                    close to the temple, with which its porticos seem to have been connected (2
                    Kings xvi. 18; xxiii. 11). Wellhausen indeed, from an examination of 1 Kings
                    vi., vii., has made it probable that the royal buildings lay within the outer
                    court of the temple (Well.-Bleek, <hi rend="italic">Einl.,</hi> p. 232). The
                    clearest details are connected with a court of the palace called the prison
                    court (Jer. xxxii. 2), where there was a gate called the prison gate, and a
                    great projecting tower (Neh. iii 25-27). This part of the building must have
                    been close to the temple, for it was at the prison sate that the second choir in
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n667/mode/1up"

                    house of God,” meeting the other choir, which ascended from Siloah by the stair
                    above David’s house and reached the temple at the water gate. It appears further
                    from Neh. iii. 27 that the fortifications of the prison were adjacent to Ophel,
                    so that the palace seems to have stood about the south-east corner of the temple

                    that Solomon’s palace stood on the western hill, and was connected with the

                    in the original, and seems to rest on a false reading in Chronicles. In Ezek.

                <p>After the division of the kingdoms Jerusalem was shorn of its political glory.
                    The city itself was taken by Shishak in the reign of Rehoboam, and lost the
                    riches accumulated by Solomon. The great houses of Omri and Jehu quite
                    overshadowed the kingdom of Judah, which forgot its weakness in the reign of
                    Amaziah only to receive signal chastisement from Jehoash, who took Jerusalem,
                    and partly levelled the walls (2 Kings xiv.). The decline and fall of Samaria
                    raised the relative importance of the southern capital; the writings of the
                    prophets show that wealth had accumulated and luxury increased, and so we find
                    King Jotham adding an upper gate in the northern or higher court of the temple
                    (2 Kings xv. 35; Jer. xxxvi. 10; Ezek. ix. 2), while Hezekiah, as we have
                    already seen, laboured for the improvement of the water supply, and so rendered
                    the city more capable to resist siege. The later history in Chronicles adds
                    details of fortifications erected by Uzziah and Manasseh, which probably express
                    the oral tradition current in the author’s day. In the later days of the
                    monarchy Jerusalem had so far increased that we read of a second town or quarter
                    (2 Kings xxii. 14; Zeph. i. 10, Heb.; comp. Neh. iii. 9). There was also a
                    trading quarter called the Maktesh, inhabited by Canaanites or Tyrians (Zeph. i.
                    11), who still formed a large part of the mercantile population after the exile
                    (Neh. xiii.; Zech. xiv. 21). Maktesh means <hi rend="italic">mortar,</hi> so
                    that we must suppose the traders to have lived in a hollow valley, perhaps the
                    upper part of the Tyropoeon. But the main part of the town was still grouped
                    round the temple plateau, from which steep streets ran down the slope of the
                    hill (Lam. iv. 1), the houses rising tier above tier, so that the roof tops
                    commanded a view of the environs (Isa. xxii.). According to Eastern custom the
                    handicrafts— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the bakers, Jer. xxxvii. 21—had their
                    own streets or bazaars.</p>
                <p>For the compass of the walls of Jerusalem at the time of its capture by
                    Nebuchadnezzar the chief document is the account of the restoration of the
                    fortifications by Nehemiah, who followed the old line, and speaks of the various
                    gates and towers by their old names. His description presents many difficulties,
                    the most intelligible part being that which deals with the eastern wall, from
                    Siloah and. the fountain gate to the point where the temple and the palace
                    joined one another. The western boundary of the city is particularly obscure,
                    and its position must be mainly determined by reference to the “valley gate”
                    (Neh. ii. 13; iii. 13). The valley <hi rend="italic">(gaf)</hi> is used as a
                    proper name, and is no doubt identical with the valley <hi rend="italic"
                    >(gayj</hi> of the son of Hinnom, the Kidron valley being always called <hi
                    rend="italic">nahal i.e.,</hi> fiumara. The common opinion makes this <hi
                    rend="italic">gay</hi> the valley to the west of modern Jerusalem (Wâdy er
                    Rabâby), in which case the valley gate must necessarily have occupied much the
                    same position as the modern Jaffa gate, and the whole of the later upper city on
                    the south-west hill must already have been included within the walls. This view,
                    however, is far from indisputable. A thousand cubits south of the valley gate
                    was the dung gate, the gate before which the rubbish heaps of the city lay. This
                    on the common theory must have been about the south-west corner of the hill,
                    near the present Protestant school. Between this point and the fountain gate in
                    the vicinity of the pool of Siloah is nearly half a mile in a straight line, and
                    the intervening wall must have been much longer if it followed the natural line
                    of defence. Yet Nehemiah gives no account of this section of the ramparts (Neh.
                    iii. 14, 15). His record seems to imply that the fountain gate was near the dung
                    gate; and similarly in chap. xii. the procession which went southward to the
                    dung gate is immediately afterwards found at the fountain gate. It is hardly
                    possible that so important a part of the circuit should be twice omitted, and in
                    fact the vast lacuna disappears at once if we suppose that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gay</hi> is the Tyropoeon, and that the upper city of Josephus on the
                    south-west hill was not enclosed in the circuit of Nehemiah’s walls. In that
                    case the valley gate lay on the Tyropoeon, somewhere near the south-east angle
                    of the Haram area, and the wall ran southward along the east side of the valley,
                    till at the pool of Siloah an outwork was thrown out to protect the water
                    supply.</p>
                <p>Besides simplifying the topographical difficulties of Neh. iii., this view has
                    several other advantages. On the received view the Tyropoeon is nowhere
                    mentioned in Scripture, though it lay in the heart of the city. This difficulty
                    is removed by the view above suggested, and the third valley (W. er Rabâby)
                    appears to be quite out of relation to the circuit of the Biblical Jerusalem, so
                    that one does not look for much mention of it. Again, we have seen that the
                    Canaanite quarter of the city lay in a hollow—presumably in the Tyropoeon, and
                    it is very natural that the seat of Canaanite worship in the valley of Hinnom
                    should be in the vicinity of this quarter. Once more, by placingthe valley gate
                    quite near the temple, we understand how it was in this neighbourhood that the
                    sacred procession in Neh. xii. began its course. Even at a much later date the
                    Temple hill was the real stronghold of Jerusalem, which Judas and his successors
                    were concerned to fortify with walls. It would have been folly in Nehemiah to
                    enclose a much vaster and less defensible circuit when the inhabitants were so
                    few that it was necessary to draft one-tenth of the whole people into the
                    capital (Neh. xi. 1).</p>
                <p>The course of the wall north of the valley gate must still have skirted the base
                    of the Temple hill east of the Tyropoeon. It is not improbable that the Maktesh
                    or Canaanite trading quarter lay outside the fortifications, a bazaar beyond the
                    gate being a common feature in Eastern towns.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In fact at the siege of Titus the wool and
                    clothes market and the brassworkers’ bazaar still lay in much the same quarter,
                    in the new city, outside the old line of fortification, though within the second
                    wall <hi rend="italic">{B. J.,</hi> V. 8, 1).</p></note> From the tower of
                    furnaces or ovens the “broad wall” ran to the point where in the Persian time
                    the governor of the Syrian provinces had his throne. The throne would stand in
                    an open place by a gateway, and comparison of Neh. iii. 7 with xii. 39 shows
                    that the gate must have been that of Ephraim, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the
                    gate of the main road leading to the north, which then as now must almost of
                    necessity have followed the upper course of the Tyropoeon, and so would skirt
                    the walls for some distance before entering.the city. In fact there were 400
                    cubits between the gate of Ephraim and the corner gate (2 Kings xiv. 13). The
                    corner gate is also named the first gate (Zech, xiv. 10), and so is probably
                    identical with the old gate of Nehemiah. For obvious engineering reasons the
                    eminence at the north-west of the Haram area must always have been a principal
                    point in the fortifications, and here the old gate may very well be placed. It
                    is indeed very likely that this was the site of the ancient bastion of Millo.
                    From the corner gate the north line of the wall ran by the fish gate to the
                    towers of Meah and Hananeel, the latter of which appears in Zech., <hi
                    rend="italic">lοc. cit.</hi>, as the opposite extremity of the city from the
                    royal wine vats in the gardens by Siloah, while in Jer. xxxi. 38 the line
                    between it and the corner gate is named as the natural direction of extension
                    for the city. The tower, therefore, must have stood very near the north-east
                    corner of the wall, but not so far east as the angle of the Haram area, which is
                    here built out, disguising the natural line of the hill side. From Zech., <hi
                    rend="italic">lοc. cti.,</hi> we see that the Benjamin gate was at the east end
                    of the north wall. There was a road into Benjamite territory over the Kidron (1
                    Kings ii. 37), and to this there was a natural descent by a small valley now
                    nearly obliterated, having its head a little south of the Birket Israil. Here
                    too is the direct way to Anathoth, which was through the Benjamin gate (Jer.
                    xxxvii. 13). In Nehemiah’s record the sheep gate seems to have the same
                    position. From the angle near the tower of Hananeel and the Benjamin gate the
                    line of the hill run southwards, trending to the east. At the extreme east
                    point, beyond the present line of wall, and a little south of the modem <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n668/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0668-0641"/> golden gate, must be placed the horse gate (Jer.
                    xxxi. 40). South of this again came the fortifications of Ophel and the upper
                    palace, and from this point the enceinte swept round to the pool of Siloah. The
                    lower wall of Manasseh in 2 Chrom xxxiii. 14 is described as an outwork in the
                    Kidron valley extending all along the eastern side of the town and round the
                    north-east corner.</p>
                <p>The long blank in the history of the Jews which follows the time of Nehemiah
                    makes it impossible to trace the progress of Jerusalem in any detail. Under the
                    Persian empire the Jews enjoyed little prosperity. Alexander spared the city,
                    but in 320 its walls were rased by Ptolemy I. (Appian, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Syr.,</hi> 50). A period of comparative prosperity followed, culminating in the
                    high priesthood of Simon II. (219-199 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), who
                    repaired the temple and strengthened its defences and fortified the city. The
                    walls were again destroyed and the city burned by the army of Antiochus
                    Epiphanes in 168 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> When Judas Maccabaeus
                    reconsecrated the temple (165) he also fortified the holy mountain of Zion (the
                    Temple hill) with wall and towers. Once more rased by the Greeks, the walls of
                    the city were renewed with hewn stone by Jonathan.</p>
                <p>It is plain froml Macc. iv. 60, vi. 7, x. 11, that up to this time the fortified
                    city was still identical with the Temple hill; but a new topographical problem
                    is raised by what is related of the citadel (Akra) erected by Epiphanes to
                    dominate the town. The Akra is identified by the author with the city of David.
                    It continued to be held by the Greeks after the town was fortified by the
                    Maccabees, and indeed was ultimately reduced by the erection of a special wall
                    cutting off the Greek garrison from access to the city and market (xii. 36). The
                    natural inference from all this is that the Greek citadel lay oη the Temple
                    hill, and presumably on the site of the later Antonia. That hill is certainly
                    the Zion of 1 Macc.; and the city of David, with which the Akra is identified,
                    had always meant the fortress of Zion. The same result seems to follow from the
                    language of Josephus. When Josephus lived Jerusalem was almost a new town. Under
                    the Maccabees, and again under Herod, the prosperity of the Jews was greater
                    than at any previous time. The sanctuary was a centre of pilgrimage from the
                    most distant lands, and the sovereigns of Jerusalem had an empire greater than
                    any of the kings after Solomon. The growth of the city must have been enormous,
                    and the great buildings of Herod and his successors had wholly changed its
                    aspect, especially in the quarter of the temple and on the ιvestern hill where
                    the royal palace stood. These changes were very apt to mislead an Uncritical
                    writer with regard to the ancient topography, and in fact Josephus falls into a
                    radical blunder by assuming that the fortress of David belonged to the upper
                    city, like the royal castle of his own day,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A perpetuation of this blunder gives the current name Tower
                    of David to the Herodian tower, probably Phasael, which still stands by the
                    Jaffa gate. On this tower compare a paper by Schick in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zeitschr. d.</hi><hi rend="italic">Deut. Palästina· Vereins,</hi> vol.

                    of Jerusalem as he himself saw it he gives a vivid description <hi rend="italic"
                    >{B. J.,</hi> v. 4, 1). The city stood on two hills divided by the Tyropoeon
                    valley, into which the houses descended tier beneath tier. The higher western
                    hill was called the upper market, the lower hill across the Tyropoeon was the
                    citadel hill, and was called indifferently the Akra or the lower city. That this
                    Akra included the ridge south of the temple is clear from several marks: the
                    hill was <hi rend="italic">aμφiκυρτos,</hi> “hog-backed”; it was cut off by
                    ravines on the outer side, and had a continuous approach to the temple, which
                    stood on the higher ground; finally, it extended to Siloah at the mouth of the
                    Tyropoeon.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    has lost the true tradition as to the city of David, he furnishes additional
                    proof that the citadel hill, still identified with it by the author of 1 Macc.,
                    was no other than the eastern hill.</p>
                <p>A different view of the Akra was maintained by Robinson, and has been elaborated

                    i.</p></note> in connexion with recent better observations as to the two heads
                    of the Tyropoeon valley. It is maintained that the Akra was a knoll, west of the
                    Temple hill and north of the traditional Zion, between the two heads of the
                    Tyropoeon. To gain any show of plausibility for this view it is necessary to lay
                    great weight on a statement of Josephus that the Temple hill was once a third
                    eminence lower than the Akra, and divided from it by a broad ravine, and that
                    Simon after taking the Akra destroyed the citadel and laboured for three years
                    to reduce its site below the level of the temple plateau and fill up the
                    intervening hollow <hi rend="italic">{B. J.,</hi> v. 4; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ant.,</hi> xiii. 6, 6). This story is pro bably exaggerated, for according to
                    the early and trustworthy evidence of 1 Macc. xiii. the Akra was not destroyed,
                    but only purged, and strengthened by additional fortifications on the sacred
                    mountain. And in any case we know that the Akra was opposite the temple, and
                    that in the time of Josephus there was no longer a ravine between, whereas the
                    city opposite the temple to the west was still cut off by the deep Tyropoeon <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ank,</hi> xv. 11, 5), except where a bridge led to the palace on
                    the western hill. Nor is it possible that the western head of the Tyropoeon can
                    be the deep ravine which, according to Josephus, separated the upper and lower
                    city, for that head is the theatre-shaped basin described in <hi rend="italic">A
                    nt.,</hi> xv. 11, 5 as facing the temple across the ravine.</p>
                <p>Under the Hasrnonean dynasty we meet with the first unambiguous evidence that the
                    city had extended to the loftier western hill, where a new palace was erected
                    overlooking the temple <hi rend="italic">{Ant.,</hi> xx. 8, 11). This continued
                    to be the royal quarter, and was raised to great splendour by Herod, who covered
                    a vast extent of ground with his palace, its courts and pleasure grounds. The
                    palace of Herod embraced two edifices transcending the temple in magnificence,
                    and the three enormous adjoining towers, Hippicus, Phasael, and Mariamne, made
                    the upper city the »strongest part of Jerusalem. Here also in Herod’s days stood
                    the xystus or gymnasium, beneath the Hasrnonean palace, where a bridge spanned
                    the Tyropoeon. The bridge already existed under the later Hasmoneans, when the
                    new quarter had as yet minor importance and the Temple hill was still the only
                    citadel. Here the warlike high priest Hyrcanus usually dwelt in the castle
                    (Βάρις, ΠΎη) which Herod afterwards converted into the fortress of Antonia in
                    the north-west corner of the enceinte of the temple <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Ant,,</hi> XV. 11, 4; <hi rend="italic">Β. J.,</hi> v. 5, 8). Antonia had the
                    form of a square keep, with loftier towers rising pinnacle-like at the corners.
                    It commanded the temple and therefore the whole lower city, and by its two
                    staircases the Roman soldiers descended into the porticoes of the temple to keep
                    order among the worshippers (comp. Acts xxi. 35).</p>
                <p>When Pompey besieged the Temple hill in 65 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the
                    bridge was broken down, and the Tyropoeon afforded a complete defence on the
                    west. His assault was made from the north, where there was a strong wall with
                    towers and a deep fosse which was with difficulty filled up to permit the
                    advance of his siege train. This fosse must be identified with the rock-cut
                    trench north of the Haram area, and from Josephus’s description seems to have
                    been still the northern limit of the town. The walls destroyed by Pompey were
                    restored by Antipater, and ten years later yielded, after an obstinate
                    resistance, to Herod and the Romans (37 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.).</hi> The
                    Baris, occupied by Antigonus, was not surrendered till the temple and the rest
                    of the city had been carried by storm, and we now read of two walls which had to
                    be reduced successively.</p>
                <p>The most important buildings erected by Herod have already been alluded to, and
                    his reconstruction of the temple will be considered under that heading. But the
                    walls of the city as they existed at the time of the siege by Titus must still
                    be described. They were three in number. The first wall consisted of a rampart
                    to the north of Herod’s palace, connecting Hippicus in the citadel of the upper
                    city with the western porch of the temple, and of another line skirting the face
                    of the western hill from Hippicus southward, thence curving round beyond Siloah,
                    and joining the eastern wall of the temple enclosure at Ophel. Several traces of
                    this wall still exist. The second wall, connecting a point in the northern line
                    of the first wall with Antonia, enclosed the new town or trading quarter.
                    Outside both these walls, on the hill side sloping southwards towards the
                    temple, a suburb called Bezetha had grown up, which Agrippa I. in the time of
                    Claudius Caesar began to protect with a third wall conceived on a gigantic
                    scale, but never altogether finished. The precise compass of this wall, which
                    began at Hippicus and rejoined the first wall in the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0669-0642"/> Kidron valley, has been much disputed,—the great
                    tower of Psephinus, which stood on very high ground, and formed its north-west
                    angle, being supposed by some to have stood near the modern castle of Goliath
                    (Kasr JMùd), while others place it as far north as the Russian cathedral. The
                    measurements by which it has been proposed to decide the northern limits of
                    Jerusalem are the distance of 3 stadia from the city to the tomb of Queen Helena
                    of Adiabene (commonly identified with the Tombs of the Kings, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kubur</hi><hi rend="italic">es</hi><hi rend="italic">Salutin'),</hi> and the
                    circuit of 33 stadia assigned by Josephus to the whole city. These measurements
                    would seem to imply that the ancient city stretched further north than the
                    modern walls, but they can hardly claim to be taken as mathematically accurate;
                    the estimates of the compass of the city vary, and Eusebius places it at 27
                    stadia. This again would imply a line closely coincident with the north wall of
                    the modern town, agreeing with the remains of ancient scarping still visible,
                    and with the express statement of Josephus that the line of the third wall
                    passed through the royal caves, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the catacombs, or
                    the cotton grotto and grotto of Jeremiah, which are separated by a kind of fosse
                    cut through the live rock, and manifestly forming part of the old wall

                    successively carried the third and second walls. They then occupied Antonia,
                    which was levelled to facilitate the approach of the forpes for the attack on
                    the temple stronghold. The temple was opened by fire rather than force, and, the
                    Jewish leaders having retired to the upper city, the lower town from the temple
                    to Siloah was burned by the Romans. The capture of the upper city was effected
                    by a regular approach with mounds and battering rams (September 70 A.D.), and
                    even then the huge citadel of Herod could only have yielded to famine had it not
                    been abandoned by the Jewish leaders in a vain attempt at escape. Its three
                    great towers, with a portion of the western wall, were left as a memorial, and
                    of this group the so-called tower of David (Phasael) still stands.</p>
                <p>The rebuilding of Jerusalem by Hadrian seems to have been originally conceived in
                    a spirit friendly to the Jews, and there is even some evidence that the
                    restoration of the temple was contemplated or commenced. After the great revolt,
                    however, Aelia Capitolina was transformed into a purely pagan town with seven
                    quarters and many buildings of heathen fashion.<note anchored="true"

                    Christianity and the rise of the practice of pilgrimage gave a new importance to
                    the city of the crucifixion and resurrection, and in the time of Constantine the
                    discovery of the Holy Sepulchre arid the erection of the magnificent church of
                    the Anastasis (dedicated 336 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> again made
                    Jerusalem a great religious centre. In the pagan reaction under Julian an
                    attempt was made to rebuild the temple, but was frustrated by an outburst of
                    fire from the foundations (362). The unfortunate empress Eudocia spent her last
                    years at Jerusalem <hi rend="italic">(c.</hi> 350-360), repaired the walls,
                    built the church of St Stephen, founded monasteries and hospitals, and enriched
                    the churches. The next great builder was Justinian, part of whose splendid
                    church of St Mary perhaps still remains in or to the east of the mosque El-Aksa.
                    In 614 Jerusalem was taken by Chosroes, and the churches and sepulchre were
                    burned, but the patriarch Modestus restored them as soon as the Persians
                    retired. In 637 Jerusalem capitulated to the caliph Omar, who gave directions
                    for the erection of a place of worship on the site of the “remotest shrine,” <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the temple, to which Mahomet, according to Kor. xvii.
                    1, was transported from Mecca in his famous night journey. From this verse the
                    oreat sanctuary of Jerusalem received the name El-</p>
                <p>Aksa, now generally confined to the building at the south end of the Haram. The
                    original mosque as described by Arculphus (670) was a rude edifice of wood
                    capable of containing 3000 worshippers; but soon after the sanctuary was
                    reconstructed in a style of great magnificence by the caliph‘Abd el Malik, whose
                    date (72 <hi rend="smallcaps">a. h.</hi> =691 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> is
                    still read on a Cufic inscription on the Dome of the Rock, though the name of
                    the caliph seems to have been changed to that of El-Mamün, who restored the
                    buildings after a great earthquake, which, according to Mokaddasy left nothing
                    standing except the part around the <hi rend="italic">mihrdb</hi> or niche
                    indicating the direction of Mecca. In their present condition the buildings of
                    the sanctuary show features of very various styles from the Byzantine downwards.
                    The architectural problems which they suggest are closely connected with
                    controversies as to the topography of the temple and the true site of the Holy
                    Sepulchre, both of which subjects will be more conveniently discussed under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Temple.</hi> Apart from the question of the holy sites, the
                    later topography of Jerusalem presents no feature that need detain us, and the
                    subsequent fortunes of the city belong to the general history of Palestine and
                    the crusades. (w. <hi rend="smallcaps">r.</hi> s.)</p>

                <p>It appears probable that the crusading wall ran just outside the present one on
                    the north-west side of the town—the remains of mediaeval masonry existing all
                    along this line, In 1192 Saladin fortified the same quarter with a second wall
                    and a fosse, and, as remains of an interior wall are still traceable at the
                    ruined tower called <hi rend="italic">Kat at Jalud,</hi> it appears that the two
                    ramparts must have run about 60 yards apart on this side of the town. Dismantled
                    in 1219 and restored again in 1229, the fortifications were again destroyed in
                    1239, and the present walls were built in 1542 by Suleimân the Magnificent, as
                    witnessed by inscriptions over the present Jaffa and other gates. The following
                    is a conspectus of the gates at different times in consecutive order; —</p>

                <p>The walls of the modern city enclose an area of 210 acres, the greater part

                    plots of ground near the ramparts not occupied by buildings. The houses are of
                    stone, with flat stone roofs having small domes supported on arches in the
                    middle, and the aspect of the city is specially colourless and stony. The

                    There are now four quarters:—that of the Moslems (including the Haram) on the

                    rising in the centre and the Aksa mosque extending to the southern wall, while
                    between these two buildings are the tall cypresses which surround the fountain
                    <hi rend="italic">El Kcιs.</hi> Arcades with pointed arches stand on the flights
                    of steps leading to the platform surrounding the Dome of the Rock, and three
                    minarets rise from the west and north walls, while the great eastern rampart is
                    unbroken save by the projecting tower of the Golden gate. In the Jewish quarter
                    two large synagogues with domes—one painted green—are conspicuous, while the
                    church and convent of St James is the special feature of the Armenian quarter.
                    Close to the Jaffa gate rise the square tower of David and a minaret within the
                    citadel, while immediately east of this fortress stands the Protestant English
                    church and the large palace of the Anglo-German Protestant bishop. North-east of
                    these are seen the two domes of the rotunda and choir of the Holy Sepulchre, and
                    immediately south of them the minaret of Omar’s mosque on the site of the great
                    hospital of St John. The modern Latin cathedral and patriarchate appear behind
                    the Holy Sepulchre church, while the highest ground outside the city on the
                    north-west is occupied by the Russian cathedral, hospice, and consulate, only
                    completed in 1866.</p>
                <p>The country round the city is barren and stony. Olive groves exist on the north,
                    and the white slopes of Olivet are dotted with the trees whence it is named.
                    Vineyards also exist on the west, but since the destruction of the fruit trees
                    by Titus <hi rend="italic">(B. J.,</hi> v. 3, 2) the vicinity of Jerusalem seems
                    always to have presented a sterile appearance.</p>
                <p>The number of churches and monasteries in the modem city, without counting many
                    crusading chapels now either in ruins or else converted into mosques, is very
                    large. There are 18 monasteries of the Greek Orthodox sect, 8 Catholic (or
                    Latin), including the patriarchate, 3 Armenian, 2 Coptic, 1 Syrian, 1 Armenian
                    Catholic, 1 Greek Catholic, and 1 Abyssinian. The Protestant institutions,
                    including schools, &lt;fcc., number 14 in all. In the Jewish quarter there are
                    no less than 14 synagoguesand 2 schools. There are also many charitable
                    institutions in and near the city, of which the principal are Rothschild’s
                    hospital near the south wall, founded in 1855, and Sir Moses Montefiore’s
                    alms-houses, west of the great reservoir called <hi rend="italic">Birkel</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">es</hi><hi rend="italic">Sultan.</hi> In the centre of the city
                    excavations have been car <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛d on by the German
                    Government (to whom the site was given by the sultan) in the grounds of the
                    crusading convent of Sta. Maria Magna (now called <hi rend="italic">El
                    Mumstan)</hi> immediately east of the hospital of St John; a Lutheran chapel is
                    now established in the ruins. The Moslem buildings of the city date principally
                    from the 13th, 14th, and 15 th centuries, and some of the ancient Moslem schools
                    near the Haram are remarkably solid structures. There are two barracks, one on
                    the scarped rock (Antonia) north of the Haram, the other in the citadel on the
                    south-west. The <hi rend="italic">serai</hi> or court-house is near the former.
                    All the European powers are represented by resident consuls, and every
                    nationality has some kind of hospice or hotel for the reception of pilgrims. The
                    market-places have remained unchanged from very early times, the upper or
                    vegetable market being in the upper city opposite the tower of David, and the
                    bazaars or lower markets in the valley north of David Street. The money-changers
                    occupy the site of the old exchange of the 12th century (first established by
                    Charlemagne) in the western portion of David Street.</p>
                <p>Jerusalem under the Turks is the capital of southern Palestine (about 2000
                    -square miles), and the seat of a <hi rend="italic">rnutasarrif</hi> under the
                    <hi rend="italic">waly</hi> of Syria. The <hi rend="italic">mejlis</hi> or town
                    council consists of 8 members :—4 Moslem, 3 Christian, 1 Jewish, the latter
                    being the chief rabbi of the Sephardim. The export trade of the city consists
                    chiefly of oil, corn, sesame, cotton (of poor quality), and soap, also of
                    rosaries, crucifixes, and cameos, carved in olive wood and mother of pearl. The
                    imports in 1871 amounted to £72,000, including cotton, wool, hardware, timber,
                    silk, and glass from England and Austria; wines and spirits from France; and
                    £3500 value of flour from Russia. Rice is imported in coasting vessels from
                    Egypt; wine, spirits, dried fish, &amp;c., from Cyprus and the Greek islands;
                    carpets and shawls are brought by the Moslem and Christian pilgrims. There are
                    also a few potteries in the city.</p>
                <p>The present cemeteries of Jerusalem are six in number. The Moslem inhabitants
                    bury immediately outside the east wall of the Haram, especially beside and north
                    of the Golden gate, while a second Moslem cemetery exists on the knoll of
                    Jeremiah’s grotto, and a third (on the site of the old <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carnarium</hi><hi rend="italic">Leonis)</hi> is close to the Mamilla pool west
                    of the city. The Christians have cemeteries on the south-west of the brow of
                    Sion, and the Jews are buried on Olivet opposite the temple, excepting the
                    Karaites who have a cemetery on the south-east part of Sion.</p>
                <p>The remains of an old Christian cemetery, including tombs belonging to the old
                    church of St Sion, are found in the southern boundary valley, and there are a
                    few sepulchres of crusading date near the north-east corner of Jerusalem on the
                    outside. Of the ancient Jewish tombs the most striking are that known as the
                    Tombs of the Kings, and the monument called Absalom’s tomb on the east of the
                    Kidron valley, which is perhaps the tomb of Alexander Jannaeus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(B. J.,</hi> v. 7, 2).</p>
                <p>The climate of Jerusalem is healthy in comparison with that of the plains beneath
                    it. A fresh sea breeze blows throughout the day in summer, and the average daily
                    maximum temperature is 86° F. August is the hottest month, but in May the
                    prevalence of dry east winds is specially trying. The autumn months are very
                    unhealthy. In winter there are occasionally heavy falls of snow, whioh lies on
                    the hills for several days. The waters of the <hi rend="italic">Bîr Eyûb</hi>
                    overflow annually through a hole in the ground near the well, and a running
                    stream then flows for many days down the Kidron valley. This overflow is a cause
                    of rejoicing to the inhabitants, who make it a holiday occasion. The annual
                    rainfall averages about 18 inches. Tears of drought occasionally occur, when the
                    inhabitants of the city suffer much from want of water. The repair of the
                    aqueduct from Bethlehem and of the large reservoirs in the city would, however,
                    be sufficient to ensure a plentiful supply. The present supply is obtained
                    principally from cisterns under the houses. Slight shocks of earthquake are
                    occasionally experienced (as for instance in 1874), and appear to have been
                    specially prevalent in the 8th and 11th centuries (c∕. Zech, xiv, 5).</p>
                <p>The population of Jerusalem, stated in 1838 at about 11,000, has increased
                    rapidly of late years, owing to a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n673/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0673-0644"/> great increase in the Jewish population, which
                    has risen in that time from 3000 to over 10,000 souls. According to a consular
                    estimate in 1872, the population was as follows, the total agreeing very closely
                    with an independent estimate by Frère Lievin the Franciscan :—Jews (Sephardim,
                    4600; Ashkenazim, 6000), 10,600; Moslems, 5000; Christians, 5300; total,
                    20,900.</p>
                <p>At Easter this population is increased by about 5000 pilgrims, who crowd the
                    narrow streets until they are almost impassable. Throughout the year there are
                    generally about 100 pilgrims in the Russian hospice. The number of Jews is said
                    to be increasing at the rate of 1200 to 1500 souls per annum, chiefly though
                    fresh arrivals from Russia and Poland. A building-club has been established and
                    130 houses erected in four years by the Jews, outside the walls. Along the Jaffa
                    road many country villas have also been erected of late by European residents as
                    summer abodes.</p>
                <p>A very large majority of the Christians in Jerusalem are either priests, monks,
                    or nuns. The majority belong to the Greek Orthodox church (about 2800 souls).
                    The Greek patriarch has a province including all Palestine, with ten bishops,
                    viz., of Nazareth, Acre, Kerak, Tabor, Bethlehem, Lydda, Gaza, Nablus, Es Salt,
                    and Sebastieh, the last five being residents in Jerusalem. The Russian cathedral
                    is presided over by an archimandrite with two assistant priests and a
                    deacon.</p>
                <p>The Latins in Palestine are not numerous, the country villages when Christian
                    belonging generally to the Greek church. The Latin priests and monks are
                    principally Jesuits and Franciscans. The number of Latins in Jerusalem is about
                    1500. Their churches are the cathedral of St Saviour, close to the patriarchate
                    on the west, and the chapel of the Flagellation. They have established also many
                    useful institutions, including a boys’ school for 150 and a girls’ school for
                    100 pupils.</p>
                <p>The number of Armenian and Greek Catholics together does not exceed 50 souls. The
                    orthodox Armenians are the richest sect in the city, numbering about 500. Great
                    numbers of Armenian pilgrims visit the city, and their hospice (for 2000) is the
                    largest in Jerusalem. Their principal church is that of St James on Sion. The
                    Protestants (about 300) belong to the English Church and the Lutheran. The
                    bishopric was established by England and Prussia in 1841. The mission to the
                    Jews was established in 1824, and supports a hospital and church with resident
                    chaplain and parsonage, a boys’ school, and other institutions. There are also
                    several German institutions, including a girls’ school and an orphanage outside
                    the walls. The remaining Christian sects, Copts, Syrians, and Abyssinians,
                    number only about 200 souls. For the Jews in Jerusalem see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Jews,</hi> page 686 of the present volume.</p>
                <p>The streets of Jerusalem at Easter present a strange spectacle from the numerous
                    national costumes seen together. The European tourist, the Turkish nizam, the
                    hooded Armenian, the long-haired Greek monk, are mingled with the native
                    peasants in yellow turbans and striped mantles, with Armenian pilgrims wearing
                    broad red sashes, Jews in Oriental costume or with the fur cap and lovelocks of
                    the Pharisee, Russians in knee boots and padded robes, and native ladies in
                    white mantles with black face veils. The architecture of the city, Oriental,
                    Gothic, Byzantine, or Italian, tells the same story—that Jerusalem has been for
                    eighteen centuries a holy city in the eyes of Jew, Christian, and Moslem alike,
                    and the religious centre of half the world. (c. R. c.)</p>
