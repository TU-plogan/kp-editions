                    Jehovah” (2 Kings xxii. 8). This conjecture, indeed, is not a very probable one,
                    for Hilkiah the high priest was of the house of Eleazar (1 Chron. ii. 13), and
                    Anathoth, where Jeremiah’s family lived, was occupied by priests of the line of
                    Ithamar (1 Kings ii. 26). It is certain, however, that the prophet was treated
                    by priests and officials with a consideration which seems to argue that he had
                    high connexions. Jeremiah was still young when he was called to the prophetic
                    career (i. 6); the year is stated by himself (i. 2, xxv. 3) to have been the
                    13th of Josiah (629 or 627 B,c.). This was before the memorable “discovery” of
                    the Torah, but the year immediately following that in which Josiah “began to
                    purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places and the images of Asherah” (2
                    Chron. xxxiv. 3). As yet, it appeared as if Judah was enjoying the peace
                    promised to faithful worshippers of Jehovah; but the punishment of the sins of
                    Manasseh was not to be long delayed. The battle of Megiddo (609 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> which cost Josiah his life, and that of Carchemish
                    (605 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> which determined the Babylonian
                    predominance to the west of the Euphrates, were the heralds of a fatal turn in
                    the fortunes of the kingdom of Judah. Jeremiah (the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0654-0627"/> Phocion of Judaea) saw this, and at once foretold
                    the vast extension of Nebuchadnezzar’s power. For the most part, his ministry
                    was exercised in the capital, though from xi. 21 it may perhaps be inferred that
                    he prophesied for some little time in his native place. It was during the reign
                    of Jehoiakim that he went through that baptism of complicated suffering which
                    has made him in a very high and true sense a type of One greater than he. King
                    and people, priests and (official) prophets, were all against him, or at least
                    the number of his supporters was too small to counterbalance the opposition.
                    Only on one occasion, when accused of a capital crime as having “prophesied
                    against this city,” the “princes,” supported by “certain of the elders” and “the
                    people,” were successful in quashing the accusation, and setting the prophet
                    free. At a later time Jeremiah incurred a still greater danger, though he was
                    providentially saved from the hands of his persecutors. In the fourth year of
                    Jehoiakim (which, it is important to remember, was the first of Nebuchadnezzar)
                    Jeremiah was commanded to write down “all the words that I have spoken unto thee
                    against Israel, and against Judah, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> and against
                    all the nations . . . from the days of Josiah even unto this day” (xxxvi. 2).
                    The interpretation of this passage, clear as it seems at first sight, is by no
                    means easy. “First of all, an historically accurate reproduction of the
                    prophecies would not have suited Jeremiah’s object, which was not historical but
                    practical; he desired to give a salutary shock to the people, by bringing before
                    them the fatal consequences of their evil deeds. And next, it appears from ver.
                    29 that the purport of the roll which the king burned was that the king of
                    Babylon should ‘ come and destroy this land,’ whereas it is clear that Jeremiah
                    had uttered many other important declarations in the course of his already long
                    ministry.” The most probable view is that of Grätz, viz., that the roll simply
                    contained chap, xxv., which is in fact (omitting the interpolations in vers. 12,
                    26) entirely concerned with the invasion of Nebuchadnezzar and its consequences,
                    and which expressly claims to have been written in the fourth year of Jehoiakim.
                    “Is not <hi rend="italic">this</hi> the prophecy which Jeremiah dictated to
                    Baruch, and is not ver. 2 a loose, inaccurate statement due to a later editor?
                    That the prophetic as well as the historical books have passed through various
                    phases (without detriment to their religious value) is becoming more and more
                    evident. The 7th and 8th chapters of Isaiah, and the 37th and 38th of the same
                    book, have demonstrably been brought into their present shape by an editor; is
                    it not highly reasonable to conjecture that these narrative chapters of Jeremiah
                    have, to a greater or less extent, passed through a similar process?” The
                    “princes,” on this as on the former occasion (chap, xxvi.), were disposed to be
                    friendly to Jeremiah and his secretary; but for some reason they felt themselves
                    bound (as they did not feel themselves bound before) to refer the matter to the
                    king. Jehoiakim was enraged at the contents of the prophetic roll, cut it in
                    pieces, and threw them into the fire. This time Jeremiah escaped; but under the
                    weak-minded Zedekiah he was more than once imprisoned (chaps, xxxii., xxxiii.,
                    xxxvii., xxxviii.). It is remarkable that, in the tension of feeling, the
                    “princes,” who were formerly friendly to Jeremiah, now took up an attitude of
                    decided hostility to him. At last they had him consigned to a miry dungeon, and
                    it was the king who interfered for his relief, though he remained a prisoner
                    till the fall of Jerusalem. Nebuchadnezzar, who had doubtless heard of
                    Jeremiah’s constant recommendations of submission, gave him the choice either of
                    going to Babylon or of remaining in the country (chaps, xxxviii., xxxiχ.). He
                    chose the latter, and resided with Gedaliah, the native governor, at Mizpah. On
                    the murder of Gedaliah he was carried to Egypt against his will (chaps.
                    xl.-xliii.), where he predicted the approaching conquest and desolation of the
                    Nile valley. A legendary tradition states that he suffered death by stoning.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Character and Literary Style.—</hi> It is interesting to
                    compare Jeremiah with Isaiah. The earlier prophet had advantages which were
                    denied to the latter; he lived at a period of comparative national prosperity,
                    and his moral and intellectual gifts were of a stronger and more striking order.
                    But Jeremiah has this noteworthy point in his favour that he overcame the
                    natural shrinking of a somewhat feminine character, and showed himself able, in
                    a strength not his own, to resist impediments which even Isaiah would have found
                    terribly great. “When,” as Ewald says, “the truth and the spirit of Jehovah call
                    him or the resisting world provokes him to the contest, he then knows nothing of
                    diffidence and fear, nothing of tenderness and pliability, he contends before
                    the eyes of all with the most decisive energy against every false prophet who
                    misleads the people (xxviii. G sy., xxix. 15 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> 24 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.)</hi>; if the truth has not been proclaimed with due
                    faithfulness to the king, he goes still, as Isaiah did in his day, without
                    hesitancy, to the royal palace (xxii. 1-19, xxxiv. 2-7); and, although himself
                    of a priestly family, he speaks from the very first with special emphasis
                    against the growing degeneracy of the priests (i. 18, ii. 26, iv. 9), and is
                    never weary of speaking against every kind of arbitrariness wherever and in
                    whatever form it is found (xxxiv. 8-22, xxxvii. 14 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> y</hi><hi rend="italic">)T</hi> Another point of
                    contrast is well worth noticing. Only five years after Jeremiah’s first
                    appearance as a prophet that great reform took place which was associated with
                    the “discovery” of the Deuteronomio Torah. It is a highly probable conjecture
                    (comp. chap, xi.) that Jeremiah was at the outset an ardent preacher of the
                    contents of this great book; at any rate, his memory became surcharged with the
                    ideas and even the phrases of Deuteronomy. The consequences of the reforming
                    endeavours of what may be called the Deuteronomic party were both good and evil.
                    The centralization of religion, and the emphasis laid on the moral duties, were
                    steps of the highest importance. “But inasmuch as a sacred book was as such for
                    the first time looked upon with greater reverence as a state authority, there
                    arose thus early a kind of book-science with its pedantic pride and erroneous
                    learned endeavours to interpret and apply the Scriptures; whilst at the same
                    time there arose also a new kind of hypocrisy and idolatry of the letter,
                    through the new protection which the state gave to the religion of the book
                    acknowledged by the law. Thus scholastic wisdom came into conflict with genuine
                    prophecy” (Ewald, <hi rend="italic">The Prophets,</hi> iii. 63, 64). But
                    something more than this was the result. “Hear ye the words of this covenant,”
                    was the address with which Jeremiah began his Deuteronomic preaching; but, as
                    time went on, a deeper view of the covenant forceci itself upon his mature mind,
                    and the expression which it has found in xxxi. 31-34 is one of the passages
                    which best deserve to be called “the gospel before Christ.” It is sad that
                    Jeremiah could not always keep his spirit under the calming influence of these
                    high thoughts. No book of the Old Testament, except the Book of Job and the
                    Psalms, contains so much which is difficult to reconcile with the character of a
                    self-denying servant of Jehovah. Such expressions as those in xi. 20, xv. 15,
                    and especially xviii. 21-23, contrast powerfully with Luke xxiii. 34, and show
                    that the typical character of Jeremiah is not absolutely complete.</p>
                <p>No wonder if Jeremiah’s style is feeble compared with that of the “royal prophet”
                    Isaiah,—if he gladly leans on older prophets, and copies or imitates more than a
                    bolder genius would have permitted. His utterance is interrupted by sobs, and he
                    is without the energy to soar to poetic <pb break="no"

                    of prophecy,” and Ewald even remarks (with some exuberance, perhaps) that he has
                    “great wealth of new figures with great delicacy of description, a literary
                    facility that readily adapts itself to the most different subjects, .... and
                    with all this an unadorned simplicity which is very unlike the greater
                    artificiality of his contemporary Habakkuk.”</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Dates of the Prophecies.—</hi> According to Bleek, the
                    following prophecies belong in all probability to the reign of Josiah, (a) ii.
                    1-iii. 5, (δ) iii. 6-vi. 30 (expressly referred to this period), (c) vii. 1-ix.
                    25, (&lt;7) xi. 1-17. Dated prophecies meet us again in the time of Jehoiakim.
                    Chap, xxvi., according to its own statement, arose in the beginning of his
                    reign; and it is held by some that chap, vii. gives the same prophecy as xxvi.
                    2-6, only in a fuller form. The prophecy against Egypt in xlvi. 2-12, and the
                    prophecy of the vast extension of the Babylonian power in chap, xxv., are both
                    dated in the fourth year of Jehoiakim (the latter is evidently not free from
                    interpolations). To the same eventful year, according to most scholars, belongs
                    the writing of all Jeremiah’s prophecies in the roll which was read before
                    Jehoiakim; but we have already seen reason to doubt the soundness of this view.
                    At any rate, chap. XXXV. belongs to this period, as the superscription and the
                    contents combine to show. Bleek also refers several other prophecies to the
                    reign of Jehoiakim, <hi rend="italic">e.g., (a)</hi> xvi. 1-xvii. 18, (δ) xvii.
                    19-27, (c) xiv., xv., (d) xviii., (e) xi. 18-xii. 17. To the short reign of
                    Jehoiachin, or to the last period of Jehoiakim’s, we may refer x. 17-23, and
                    perhaps chap, xiii., with its account of a strange symbolical action connected
                    with the Euphrates or more probably (Hitzig) Ephrath, 7.e., Bethlehem.
                    Zedekiah’s reign is much more fully represented in the prophecies; see chaps,

                    xxvii. all critics agree that for “Jehoiakim” we should substitute, with the

                    chaps. 1., li. A little later in the same reign we may place chaps, xix., xx.,
                    which describe some remarkable scenes in Jeremiah’s history. Later still, at the
                    beginning of the siege of Jerusalem, fall xxxiv. 1-7, chap, xxi., and the group
                    of chapters beginning at chap, xxxii., the important prophecies in chaps, xxx.,
                    xxxi., also perhaps belong to this period; and of course chap, xxxvii. and the
                    two following chapters.</p>
                <p>It should be mentioned here that there are some portions of the book the
                    Jeremianic authorship of which has been entirely or in part denied, (a) Chap. x.
                    1-16 was written, according to Movers, Hitzig, Graf, Knobel, and Naegelsbach by
                    a prophet of the captivity—Movers and Hitzig say, by the author of Isaiah
                    xl.-lxvi. (δ) Chaps, xxx.-xx∑⅛i., according to Movers and Hitzig, have been
                    brought into their present shape by the author of Isa. xl.-lxvi., though the
                    basis is Jeremianic. (c) Chaps. 1., li., which Bleek assigns to the fourth year
                    of Zedekiah, was according to Movers and Hitzig brought into its present form by
                    a captivity prophet, working on a Jeremianic basis, while Ewald and Knobel hold
                    it to have been entirely written at the close of the captivity. (&lt;Z) Chap.
                    lii. evidently forms the close of a history of the kings of Judah, and no doubt
                    of the history followed very closely by the editor of the Books of Kings.</p>
                <p>We cannot here enter fully into this subject. But something may be said on chaps.
                    1., li.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Compare a paper
                    by Budde in <hi rend="italic">Jαhrb, f. D. Τheοl.,</hi> 1879.</p></note> It is
                    open to grave doubt whether Jeremiah wrote these chapters. That he composed a
                    prophecy against Babylon may be granted, and that he gave it to Seraiah with the
                    charge described in li. 61—64; but it does not follow that the present prophecy
                    on Babylon was the one referred to in ver. 60. There are special reasons for the
                    opposite view, and they are analogous to these which lead so many students to
                    doubt the Isaianic origin of Isa. xl.-lxvi. For example,—(1) the author of the
                    latter prophecy (or the greater part thereof) writes as if he were living at the
                    close of the Babylonian exile. So does the author of Jer. 1., li. See chap. li.
                    verses 33, 6 and 45, 11 and 28, 20-23. (2) Although the above statement is
                    literally true of most of Isa. xl.-lxvi., yet there are some passages which are
                    much more suggestive of a Palestinian than of a Babylonian origin (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Isaiah).</hi> Precisely so in Jer. 1., li., at least according
                    to one prevalent interpretation of 1. 5, li. 50 (which are thought to imply a
                    residence in Jerusalem), 1. 28, li. 11, 35, 51 (suggestive, perhaps, of the
                    continuance of Jerusalem and the temple), 1. 17, li. 34 (implying, as some
                    think, that Nebuchadnezzar is still alive). Still there is so much doubt
                    respecting the soundness of the inferences that it is hardly safe to rely too
                    confidently upon them. The case of Jer. 1., li. is therefore in so far rather
                    less favourable to Jeremiah’s authorship than that of Isa. xl.-lxvi. is to that
                    of Isaiah. (3) Amongst much that is new and strange in the style and phraseology
                    of Isa. xl.-lxvi., there is not a little that reminds one forcibly of the old
                    Isaiah. Similarly with Jer. 1., li. “Every impartial judge,” says Kuenen, “must
                    admit that the number of parallel passages is very large, and that the author of
                    chaps. 1., li. agrees with no one more than with Jeremiah.” For instance, the
                    formula, “Thus saith Jehovah Sabaoth, the God of Israel” (1. 18, li. 33) also
                    occurs in vii. 3, ix. 15, and some twenty-six other passages; comp, also 1. 3
                    with ix. 9; 1. 5 with xxxii. 40; 1. 7 with ii. 3, xiv. 18, xvii. 13.</p>
                <p>The probability would therefore appear to be that, whatever solution we adopt for
                    the literary problems of Isa. xl.-lxvi., an analogous solution must be adopted
                    for Jer. 1., li. The whole question is so large, and connects itself with so
                    many other problems, that the present writer declines to pronounce upon it here.
                    Only it should be observed— (1) that both subject and tone remind us of Isa.
                    xl.-lxvi., and the kindred prophecies scattered about in the first part of the
                    Book of Isaiah, and more especially of Isa. xiii. and the closely related
                    prophecy, Isa. xxxiv.; (2) that these two chapters, Jer. 1. and li., present
                    some striking points of contact with Ezekiel, who, though contemporary with
                    Jeremiah, was still a late contemporary, and allusions to whom (since Ezekiel
                    was a literary rather than an oratorical prophet) imply that his prophetic book
                    was already in circulation—in other words, suggest a date well on in the exile
                    for the prophet who alludes to him; (3) that, though there are many Jeremianic
                    allusions in Jer. 1., li., there are also several passages copied almost
                    verbally from prophecies of Jeremiah and applied to Babylon and its assailants
                    (it seems difficult to believe' that Jeremiah should have been so economical of
                    his literary work). It deserves to be added (4) that, though Jeremiah is a great
                    student of the earlier prophetic writings, and makes numerous allusions to them
                    (see especially chaps, xlvi.-xlix.), nothing approaching to the mosaic work in
                    Jer. 1., li. can be pointed to in the undoubted prophecies of Jeremiah. In fact,
                    the author of these chapters has borrowed almost the whole of their contents
                    from other prophets,—his own property, so to speak, being too insignificant to
                    be worth mentioning.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The Massoretic Text and the Septuagiηt Version.—</hi> The
                    Alexandrian version presents an unusually large amount of variation from the
                    received Hebrew text. Even in the order of the prophecies there is one
                    remarkable discrepancy, viz., in the series of prophecies against foreign
                    nations (chaps, xxv. 15-xlv. become in the LXX. chaps, xxxii,-li., the series of
                    prophecies in question being transposed); and there is no doubt an approach to
                    the truth in the LXX. arrangement. More important are the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n656/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0656-0629"/> differences of reading. “The LXX. has very few
                    additions, and these only single words or syllables; on the contrary, there are
                    many omissions of words, sentences, verses, and whole passages (altogether about
                    2700 words are wanting, or the eighth part of the Massoretic text); also
                    alterations of passages, sometimes not without influence on the sense” (Bleek);
                    and these discrepancies are of extremely early date, for the state of the Greek
                    text was already noticed by Origen <hi rend="italic">(Zp. ad Afric.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> p. 56, Migne). Three principal explanations have
                    been offered :—(1) the error of copyists (Jerome, Grabe); (2) negligence and
                    caprice on the part of the Greek translators (Spohn, Naegelsbach, Wichelhaus,
                    Keil, Graf); (3) the existence of various (or at least two) recensions of the
                    Hebrew, the recension used by LXX. being nearer to the original text than that
                    of the Massorets (J. D. Michaelis, Movers, Hitzig, Bleek). A better view is that
                    adopted by Ewald, Schrader, and Kuenen, according to which the Massoretic text
                    is on the whole the best; but the Greek version, in spite of the manifold errors
                    and caprices of the translator, sometimes approaches more nearly to the original
                    than the Massoretic text. ’</p>
