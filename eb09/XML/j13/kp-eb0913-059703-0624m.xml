                    of the entire population of the Punjab and half that of the Râj put states. They
                    are also widely spread through Sind, Baluchistan, and the North-Western
                    Provinces. Their traditions indicate an immigration from Ghazni or Kandahar, but
                    writers of authority have identified them with the ancient Getae,<note

                    reason to believe them a degraded tribe of Râjputs, whose Scythic origin has
                    also been maintained. Dr Trumpp,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of the Indus, and their language strongly favours this view. The Jâtaki, or Jât
                    vernacular, retained by them with singular tenacity, is a variety of Sindhi, and
                    a pure Sanskrit tongue, exhibiting unusually early grammatical forms. Hindu
                    legends point to a prehistoric occupation of the Indus valley by this people,
                    and at the time of the Mahometan conquest of Sind (712 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.)</hi> they, with a cognate tribe called Meds, constituted the bulk of the
                    population. They enlisted under the banners of Mohammed Kâsim, but at a later
                    date offered a vigorous resistance to the Arab invaders. In 836 they were
                    overthrown by Amran, who imposed on them a tribute of dogs, and used their arms
                    to vanquish the Meds. In 1025, however, they had gathered audacity, not only to
                    invade Mansura, and compel the abjuration of the Mussulman emir, but to attack
                    the victorious army of Mahmxid, laden with the spoil of Somnath. Chastisement
                    duly ensued: a formidable flotilla, collected at Miïltân, shattered in thousands
                    the comparatively defenceless Jât boats on the Indus, and annihilated their
                    national pretensions. In recent times the valour of the race showed itself in
                    the two sieges of Bhartpur, the seat of a Jât dynasty, in 1805 and 1826, and has
                    long been conspicuous in the military qualities of the Sikhs. They are a
                    migratory stock. We hear of early Jât settlements on the shores of the Persian
                    Gulf; there was in the 9th century a Jât quarter in Antioch; and a colony
                    established in the Chaldaean marshes defied during twenty-four years the power
                    of the caliphs, and was finally vanquished and deported to the Cilician frontier
                    in 834. The Jâts are now mainly agriculturists and cattle breeders, rearing with
                    extraordinary skill and care large flocks of camels, in the Mekran and the
                    desert tracts of Sind. In their settlements on the Gauges and Jumna, extending
                    as far east as Bareilly, they are divided into two great clans, the Dhe and the
                    Hele; while in the Punjab there are said to be one hundred different tribes.
                    Their religion varies with locality. East of the Râvi they profess a modified
                    Brahmanism, discarding the restrictions of caste; in the Punjab they have
                    largely embraced Sikh tenets; while in Sind and Baluchistan they are Mahometans.
                    They are in general a harmless, industrious people, preserving in songs and
                    legends the memory of better times. Under favourable conditions, however, old
                    predatory habits revive, and their wandering instinct leads them, in the guise
                    of itinerant traders, far into Central Asia. Indeed, there is plausible though
                    not conclusive evidence that the Gipsies owned them as progenitors.<note

                    extremely dark; they have good teeth, and large beards, sometimes stained with
                    indigo. Their inferiority of social position, however, to some extent betrays
                    itself in their aspect, and tends to be perpetuated by their intellectual
                    apathy.</p>
