                    from September 1791 to June 1792. Having in the following winter begun the study
                    of law at Edinburgh University, he became a member of the Speculative Society,
                    in the debates of which he measured himself not disdvantageously with Scott,
                    Brougham, Francis Horner, the marquis of Lansdowne, Lord Kinnaird, and
                    others.</p>
                <p>He was admitted to the bar on December 18, 1794, but, having abandoned the Tory
                    principles in which he had been educated, he of course found his father’s
                    connexion of little advantage to him; indeed the adoption of Whig-politics was
                    at this time almost a complete obstacle to legal success. His failure to obtain
                    sufficient professional employment led him to the conception of a variety of
                    schemes of “literary eminence,” none of which were put into execution; and more
                    than one attempt to obtain an <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n644/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0644-0617"/> office which would secure him the advantage of a
                    small but fixed salary likewise proved abortive. To the proposal made by-Sydney
                    Smith in Jeffrey’s house to a company of young men, none of whom had yet
                    achieved fame or occupied any professional position of importance, that they
                    should start a review, Jeffrey was accordingly prepared to give a favourable
                    reception; and, the scheme being received with acclamation, the result was the
                    appearance on the 10th October 1802 of the first number of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Edinburgh Review.</hi> At the outset the <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> was not
                    under the charge of any special editor. The first three numbers were, however,
                    practically edited by Sydney Smith, and on his leaving for England the work
                    devolved chiefly on Jeffrey, who, after an arrangement with Constable the
                    publisher, was appointed editor at a fixed salary. Most of those associated in
                    the undertaking were Whigs in their political convictions; but, although the
                    general bias of the <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> was towards social and
                    political reforms, it was so little of a party organ that for a time it numbered
                    Sir Walter Scott among its contributors; and no distinct emphasis was given to
                    its political leanings until the publication in 1808 of an article on the work
                    of Don Pedro Ce vallos on the <hi rend="italic">French Usurpation of Spain,</hi>
                    which led shortly afterwards to the appearance of the rival <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quarterly.</hi> According to Lord Cockburn the effect of the first number of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> was “electrical,” and it is not
                    difficult to understand why it should have been so, for, if its learning was far
                    from being so omniscient as was then imagined, and if much of its speculation
                    was superficial and rambling, and its literary criticisms greatly deficient in
                    true subtilty and discernment, it certainly did not err on the side either of
                    modesty or of dulness. Indeed, not only were its opinions generally expressed in
                    telling and forcible language, but the clever vivacity and wit as well as the
                    external glitter and brilliancy of many of the articles, and their easy and
                    jaunty air, were fitted to produce an imposing impression of latent resources of
                    many-sided talent and comprehensive erudition. The novelty, moreover, of such a
                    voluminous and elaborate periodical, the anonymousness of its contributions, and
                    the fact that it devoted its pages chiefly to extended criticisms— often by no
                    means flattering or complimentary—of living authors, were all elements in its
                    success. Of course, on the other hand, allowance must be made for its early
                    deficiencies, not only on account of the literary inexperience of the writers,
                    but from the fact that it was itself practically a hitherto untried experiment
                    in literature. Its improvement as regards substantiality of matter and
                    genuineness and depth of learning was very marked as soon as its success
                    permitted Jeffrey to enlist in its service a staff of writers who had generally
                    made a special study of the particular subjects on which they wrote, and who,
                    instead of contenting themselves with a <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> summary and
                    an interspersed criticism of the works they reviewed, made them the occasion of
                    an independent and original contribution, often having only a very remote
                    connexion with the works which suggested it. Whatever deductions also it may be
                    necessary to make in distinguishing between the merits of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Review</hi> and its reputation, its influence both as a literary and as a
                    political organ has much exceeded that of any other English periodical, and its
                    relation to the social, political, and literary history of England during the
                    first half of the present century has been of no small importance. The period of
                    Jeffrey’s editorship extended to about twenty-six years, having ceased with the
                    ninety-eighth number, published in June 1829. The <hi rend="italic">Macvey
                    Naj)ier Corresj)ondence</hi> gives some indication of what must have been the
                    delicacy and difficulty of his task, and enables us to appreciate more
                    intelligently the panegyric of his biographer in regard to the literary skill
                    and practical discernment which gathered together such a brilliant galaxy of
                    talent, the suave firmness and wise prudence which controlled and utilized to
                    such advantage their several idiosyncracies, and the tact and cleverness which
                    arranged and adjusted their varied lights with such correct appreciation of
                    harmonious unity.</p>
                <p>Jeffrey’s own contributions, according to a list which has the sanction of his
                    authority, numbered two hundred, all except six being written before his
                    resignation of the editorship, and two immediately subsequent to this. A
                    selection from these contributions was published in 1843 in four volumes. The
                    composition of eight <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> articles in a year is not an
                    excessive literary task, but the subjects on which Jeffrey elected to give his
                    opinion were very multifarious, and he wrote with great rapidity, at odd moments
                    of leisure, and with little special preparation. Although also he possessed a
                    considerable accumulation of accurate information on a great variety of
                    subjects, and had disciplined his taste by a wide and catholic acquaintance with
                    English literature, he had given no thorough and systematic attention to any
                    particular branch of study. Great fluency and ease of diction, considerable
                    command of illustration, a certain superficial warmth of imagination and moral
                    sentiment, a natural tendency towards mockery and ridicule, and a sharp eye to
                    discover any oddity or peculiarity of style or violation of the accepted canons
                    of good taste, were what lent to his criticisms the kind of pungency and
                    effectiveness they possessed. It must, moreover, be added that, if he failed
                    egregiously in the appreciation of the highest kinds of excellence both in style
                    and in thought, the blemishes and defects which occupied so much of his
                    attention, and which he magnified and distorted, had generally a real existence.
                    Notwithstanding, however, his keen practical judgment and his liberal
                    tendencies, both his political and his literary prognostications were generally
                    falsified by the result. He never showed any proper comprehension of principles,
                    or power of detecting and estimating latent'forces either in politics or in
                    matters strictly intellectual and moral; and certain of the higher spheres of
                    reflexion and imagination, as for example, that of the “Lake Poets,” his unhappy
                    mistakes in regard to whom have earned for him such unenviable fame, were
                    utterly remote from his understanding and sympathy. Had an adequate share of his
                    attention been concentrated on some special branch of literature, had his
                    fluency been held in check by a more thorough acquaintance with the subjects
                    which engaged his interest, his regard for immediate impressiveness not been
                    exaggerated by the influence of his professional duties, his artistic sense,
                    which was keen and true so far as it went, not been mutilated and deteriorated
                    by untoward circumstances, he would undoubtedly have earned for himself a high
                    place among the writers of his epoch. As it is, his reputation is now
                    unsubstantial and shadowy, and he is remembered chiefly from his accidental and
                    not always gratifying and desirable relation to others who have gained an
                    independent fame.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the increasing success of the <hi rend="italic">Review,</hi>
                    Jeffrey always continued to look to the bar as the chief field of his ambition,
                    and indeed he soon experienced that his literary reputation was a help and not
                    an obstruction to professional advancement. Probably one reason of this was that
                    his literary talents were supplemented by a personal character of the highest
                    integrity and honour, and by fine social gifts rooted in true geniality and
                    kindness, and adorned with an agreeable pleasantry and wit never tainted with
                    the venom of bitterness. As an advocate his sharpness and rapidity of insight
                    gave him a formidable advantage in the detection of the weaknesses of a witness
                    and the vulnerable points of his opponent’s case, while he grouped his own
                    arguments with an admirable eye to effect, especially excelling in eloquent
                    closing appeals to a jury, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n645/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0645-0618"/> more particularly when an opportunity presented
                    itself for the introduction of the pathetic element. Probably but for his rapid
                    utterance and affected accent, his weak physique, and his too copious command of
                    language, he might have attained to the highest rank as an orator. Jeffrey was
                    twice, in 1820 and 1822, elected lord rector of the university of Glasgow. In
                    1829 he was chosen dean of the faculty of advocates. On the Whigs obtaining
                    office in 1831, he became lord advocate, and entered parliament as member for
                    the Perth burghs. After the passing of the Reform Act, in the framing of which
                    measure he had the principal charge so far as it related to Scotland, he was
                    returned for Edinburgh; but his parliamentary career, which, though not so
                    brilliantly successful as some expected, had won him high general esteem, was
                    terminated by his elevation to the judicial bench as Lord Jeffrey in May 1834.
                    He died at Edinburgh 26th June 1850.</p>
