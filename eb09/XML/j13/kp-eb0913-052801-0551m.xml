                    naturally led to conclude that the new letter was intentionally formed by some
                    one who wished to have a special symbol to denote the palatal consonant <hi
                    rend="italic">y,</hi> into which <hi rend="italic">i</hi> readily passes, just
                    as <hi rend="italic">w</hi> denotes the labial consonant into which <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> passes. For the symbol is a new one. It is not found in the
                    Latin alphabet, in which I was employed alike for the vowel and consonant—though
                    sometimes the I was doubled for the consonant. So far, however, as we can see, J
                    in its origin was nothing but a fancy of the scribes. In 15th century English
                    MSS. the z-symbol was drawn a little below the line to denote J, and by degrees
                    this was curled slightly to the left. Again in writing numbers such as vii,
                    viii, it was usual to write uij, uiij, &amp;c. This was imitated in early
                    printing, and hence arose <hi rend="italic">j,</hi> the earliest regularly
                    curled form. At the same time we find only I in capitals, not J—a modern letter
                    made to correspond with little <hi rend="italic">j.</hi> This at least seems to
                    have been the history of the symbol in England, and possibly the French history
                    is similar.</p>
                <p>It follows from this that the value of J ought to have been in all languages, not
                    that which it has with us, nor yet that which it has in France, but that which
                    it has in Germany, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in “Jahr,” our “year,”—which is
                    retained by us in the borrowed Hebrew word “Hallelujah.” But generally in
                    English J denotes the sound which is best represented by <hi rend="italic"
                    >dzh</hi>; in this compound <hi rend="italic">zh</hi> represents the French
                    J-sound: the difference between the two may be well seen by comparing the
                    English “John” with French “Jean” (Engl. J = <hi rend="italic">dzh,</hi> Fr. J =
                    <hi rend="italic">zhj.</hi> J, however, is not the only symbol which we employ
                    to represent this sound; we also use G in “gem,” “gin,” and GE at the end of
                    words such as “edge,” hedge,” “wedge,” “knowledge,” “singe”; while the 2Λ-s0und
                    (which is the sonant corresponding to the surd <hi rend="italic">βh</hi> in
                    “shall,” “wish,” &amp;c.) is never represented with us by J, but by numerous
                    other letters, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in roιψe (a word borrowed from the
                    French), pleasure, division, azure. See A. J. Ellis, <hi rend="italic">Early
                    English Pronunciation,</hi> c. vi.</p>
                <p>The way in which this c‰7z-sound arose seems to have been as follows. In
                    mediaeval Latin an inorganic &lt;7-sdund was produced before a
                    y-sound,—sometimes when medial, as in “ma-d-ius” for “maius,” sometimes initial,
                    as in “diacere” for “iacere.” This arose from a careless pronunciation of the
                    palatal <hi rend="italic">y.</hi> That sound has been liable to obscuration in
                    many languages—notably in Greek, in which a δ was developed before it to a very
                    remarkable degree; see Curtius, <hi rend="italic">Grundzüge,</hi> book iii. D.
                    iii. A simple example may be seen in the particle <hi rend="italic">8η,</hi>
                    which is identical with German “jä” our “yea the sound of the word was
                    originally yä; then in Greek a <hi rend="italic">d</hi> sprang up before the <hi
                    rend="italic">y,</hi> producing <hi rend="italic">dyä</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and finally the <hi rend="italic">y</hi> was expelled altogether,
                    leaving the <hi rend="italic">d-</hi> sound alone. Sometimes a double sound was
                    produced (denoted by the symbol z) as in <hi rend="italic">ζηpiα</hi> for
                    (&lt;7)yam-ia or tλπtξω for <hi rend="italic">ikπι8-yo;</hi> here the sound may
                    have been <hi rend="italic">dzh,</hi> but was more probably <hi rend="italic"
                    >dz;</hi> be this as it may, the change in Greek, which produced a great effect
                    upon the language, may help us to understand how the <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    sprang up in late Latin, and how the compound sound <hi rend="italic">dzh</hi>
                    was perpetuated in Italian—but there represented by <hi rend="italic">gi,</hi>
                    as in “giacere,” “Giacomo,” &amp;c.—and in Old French, in which language it
                    passed at a later time into the modern z7z-sound described above. But it was
                    introduced into England from France with its original value in French words. The
                    sound, however, had already existed in England in words of Teutonic origin, the
                    class already mentioned ending in <hi rend="italic">ge;</hi> “edge” was
                    originally spelt “ecg,” and was doubtless sounded as we now sound “egg”; but the
                    final «/-sound had been palatized, though probably not before the 13th century.
                    These are the two sources of the cZzΛ-sound in England, and it is noteworthy
                    that the sound when final has never been spelt withy, as though a consciousness
                    of the difference of origin in these cases lingered on in the language. A
                    parallel change (but much more common) has taken place in the Z&gt;sound: this
                    passed into a c½-sound in very many words and not merely at the end, but also at
                    the beginning as in “chill,” “child/’ “church,” &amp;c., and this c7z-sound is
                    not the simple palatal <hi rend="italic">eh,</hi> but <hi rend="italic"
                    >tsh,</hi> which therefore bears exactly the same relation to <hi rend="italic"
                    >k</hi> as <hi rend="italic">dzh</hi> (our y) bears to <hi rend="italic"
                    >g.</hi></p>
                <p>It appears then that the symbol J ceased to have its proper signification in
                    English by connexion with that of another compound sound borrowed from the
                    French. Meanwhile another symbol Y was being prepared to do the work of J. G at
                    the beginning of a word was often weakened into the y-sound: thus “&lt;?enew”
                    (comp. German “genug ”) became “ynow,” our “enough.” Then the old English form
                    of <hi rend="italic">g</hi> (that is, 3) was used to express this y-sound, and
                    out of it the symbol <hi rend="italic">y</hi> was gradually developed, while the
                    French form <hi rend="italic">(g</hi> or nearly so) was kept for the momentary
                    sound.</p>
                <p>In Spanish the symbol J denotes the momentary sound corresponding to <hi
                    rend="italic">y,—</hi> that is, the palatal denoted by <hi rend="italic">ch</hi>
                    in German, and heard also in Scotland, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in
                    “loch.”</p>
