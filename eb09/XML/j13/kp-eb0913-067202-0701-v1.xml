                    used there in pre-Roman times. Barrows of the Bronze Age have yielded beads,
                    buttons, rings, armlets, and other personal ornaments of jet. The early supply
                    was probably obtained from the Yorkshire coast, near Whitby—a locality which
                    still yields the finest varieties. The Whitby jet occurs in isolated masses, of
                    irregular shape, but frequently more or less lenticular, imbedded in bituminous
                    shales near the base of the Upper Lias. The particular horizon of the jet-rock
                    is known to geologists as the zone of <hi rend="italic">Ammonites</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">serpentinus.</hi> Opinion is divided as to the exact nature
                    and origin of the jet: some regard it as a variety of lignite, others as a kind
                    of cannel coal, and others again as a hardened form of bitumen. There is little
                    doubt that the jet has in all cases resulted from the decay of organic matter.
                    Microscopic sections of jet frequently reveal a ligneous structure, in most
                    cases of coniferous type. It has been suggested that masses of wood brought down
                    by a river have drifted out to sea, where, becoming water-logged, they have sunk
                    and have gradually been covered with a deposit of fine black mud, beneath which
                    the decay has slowly proceeded! Possibly bituminous matter may have been
                    distilled from this decaying vegetation, and deposited between the layers of
                    shale in its neighbourhood. Drops of liquid bitumen are frequently found in the
                    fossils of the jet-rock, and inflammable gas, derived from the bituminous
                    shales, is not uncommon in the jet-mines. Moreover, scales of fish and other
                    fossils of the jet-rock are frequently converted into jet, the bituminous matter
                    having replaced the original tissues. When jet is heated, it betrays its
                    bituminous character by burning with a dense pungent smoke, which was formerly
                    reputed to possess powerful medicinal virtues. At present the material is used
                    only for trivial ornaments, principally for mourning jewellery. To obtain jet,
                    the shale is systematically mined not only at its outcrop in the cliffs but in
                    the inland dales of the Cleveland district. It is now rare to find washed jet
                    upon the sea-shore, but formerly a considerable quantity was thus obtained. The
                    best hard jet is exceedingly tough, and may be readily carved or turned on the
                    lathe, while its compact texture allows it to receive a high polish. The final
                    polish is given by means of rouge, which produces a beautiful velvety surface.
                    The softer kinds, not capable of being freely worked, are known as bastard jet.
                    From the estuarine beds of the Lower Oolites of Yorkshire, a soft jet is
                    obtained; but, though occasionally used for ornamental purposes, it is far
                    inferior to the true Whitby jet. Spanish jet has been largely imported into
                    Whitby, but is deficient in hardness and lustre. Cannel coal from Scotland is
                    occasionally used in the place of jet; and it is not uncommon for brooches to be
                    made of a carving of Whitby jet set in a plain polished rim of either Spanish
                    jet or cannel</p>
