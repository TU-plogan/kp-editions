                    Sophronius Hieronymus),</hi> was born at Strido (modern Strigaul), a town on the
                    border of Dalmatia fronting Pannonia, destroyed by the Goths in 377 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Some authorities, following Prosper’s chronicle, give
                    330 or 331 as the date of his birth, but from certain passages in his writings
                    it is more probable that he was not born till 340. or 342. He says, for example,
                    that he was a boy learning grammar when Julian died; but Julian died in 363, and
                    Jerome would scarcely call himself a boy if he had been thirty-three years old.
                    What is known of Jerome has mostly been recovered from his own writings, for he
                    was a gossiping sort of man, and biographers have only to string together
                    extracts from his epistles and prologues to get a very good account of his life.
                    His parents were Christians, orthodox though living among people mostly Arians,
                    and wealthy. He was at first educated at home, Bonosus, a life-long friend,
                    sharing his boyish studies, and was afterwards sent to Rome to perfect his
                    education. Donatus, whose Latin grammar was to be the plague of generations of
                    mediaeval school-boys from St Andrews to Prague till Corderius and the
                    Reformation drove it out, taught him grammar and explained the Latin poets.
                    Victorinus taught him rhetoric. He attended the law-courts, and listened to the
                    Roman advocates pleading in the Forum. He went to the schools of philosophy, and
                    heard lectures on Plato, Diogenes, Clitomachus, and Carneades; the conjunction
                    of names shows how philosophy had become a dead tradition. His Sundays were
                    spent in the catacombs in discovering graves of the martyrs and deciphering
                    inscriptions. Pope Liberius baptized him in 360; three years later the news of
                    the death of the emperor Julian the Apostate came to Rome, and Christians felt
                    relieved from a great dread.</p>
                <p>When his student days were over Jerome returned to Strido, but did not stay there
                    long. His character was formed. He was a scholar, with a scholar’s tastes and
                    cravings for knowledge, easily excited, bent on scholarly discoveries. From
                    Strido he went to Aquileia, where he formed some friendships among the monks of
                    the large monastery there, the most notable being his acquaintance with Rutinus,
                    with whom he was destined to quarrel bitterly over the question of Origen’s
                    orthodoxy and worth as a commentator; for Jerome was a man who always sacrificed
                    a friend to an opinion, and when he changed sides in a controversy expected his
                    acquaintances to follow him. From Aquileia he went to Gaul, visiting in turn the
                    principal places in that country, from Narbonne and Toulouse in the south to
                    Treves on the north-east frontier. He stayed some time at Treves studying and
                    observing, and it was there that he first began to think seriously upon divine
                    things. From Treves he returned to Strido, and from Strido to Aquileia. He
                    settled down to literary work in Aquileia, and composed there his first original
                    tract, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Muliere septies percussa,</hi>
                    in the form of a letter to his friend Innocentius. Some quarrel, no one knows
                    what, caused him to leave Aquileia suddenly; and with some companions,
                    Innocentius, Evagrius, and Heliodorus being among them, he started for a long
                    tour in the East. The epistle to Rufinus (3d in Vallarsi’s enumeration) tells us
                    the route. They went through Thrace, visiting Athens, Bithynia, Galatia, Pontus,
                    Cappadocia, and Cilicia, to Antioch, Jerome observing and making notes as they
                    went. He was interested in the theological disputes and schisms in Galatia, in
                    the two languages spoken in Cilicia, &amp;c. At Antioch the party remained some
                    time. Innocentius died of a fever, and Jerome was dangerously ill. This illness
                    brought him face to face with death; he experienced conversion, and resolved to
                    renounce whatever kept him back from God. His greatest temptation was the study
                    of the literature of pagan Rome. In his dreams God reproached him with caring
                    more to be a Ciceronian than a Christian. He disliked the uncouth style of the
                    Scriptures. “O Lord,” he prayed, “Thou knowest that whenever I have and study
                    secular MSS. I deny Thee,” and he made a resolve henceforth to devote his
                    scholarship to the Holy Scripture. “David was to be henceforth his Simonides,
                    Pindar, and Alcaeus, his Flaccus, Catullus, and Severus.” Fortified by these
                    resolves he betook himself to a hermit life in the wastes of Chalcis. Chalcis
                    was the Thebaid or the Marseilles of Syria. Great numbers of monks, each in
                    solitary cell, spent lonely lives, scorched by the sun, ill-clad and scantily
                    fed, pondering on portions of Scripture or copying MSS. to serve as objects of
                    meditation. Jerome at once set himself to such scholarly work as the place
                    afforded. He discovered and copied MSS., and began to study Hebrew. There also
                    he wrote the life of St Paul of Thebes, probably an imaginary tale embodying the
                    facts of the monkish life around him. Just then the Meletian schism, which had
                    to do with the relation of the orthodox to Arian bishops and to those baptized
                    by Arians, distressed the church at Antioch, and Jerome as usual eagerly joined
                    the fray. Here as elsewhere he had but one rule to guide him in matters of
                    doctrine and discipline,—the practice of Rome and the West; for it is singular
                    to see how Jerome, who is daringly original in points of scholarly criticism,
                    was simply a ruthless partisan in all other matters; and, having discovered what
                    was the Western practice, he set tongue and pen to work with his usual
                    bitterness <hi rend="italic">(^Altercatio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Luciferiani</hi><hi rend="italic">et Orthodoxi).</hi> From Antioch he went to
                    Constantinople, where he met with the great eastern scholar and theologian
                    Gregory of Nazianzus, and with his aid tried to perfect himself in Greek. The
                    result of his studies there was the translation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clιronicon</hi> of Eusebius, with a continuation,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Comp. Schoene’s critical edition (Berlin,
                    1866, 1875).</p></note> of twenty-eight homilies of Origen on Jeremiah and
                    Ezekiel, and of nine homilies of Origen on the Visions of Isaiah.</p>
                <p>In 381 Meletius died, and Pope Damasus interfered in the dispute at Antioch,
                    hoping to end it. Jerome was called to Rome in 382 to give help in the matter,
                    and was made secretary during the investigation. His work brought him into
                    intercourse with this great pontiff, who soon saw what he could best do, and how
                    his vast scholarship might be made of use to the church. Damasus suggested to
                    him to revise the existing Latin translation of the Bible; and to this task he
                    henceforth devoted his great abilities (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Bible).</hi> At
                    Rome were published the Gospels (with a dedication to Pope Damasus, an
                    explanatory introduction, and the canons of Eusebius), the rest of the New
                    Testament, and the version of the Psalms from the LXX. text, known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Psalterium Pomanum,</hi> which was followed in 385 by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Psalt.</hi><hi rend="italic">Gallicanum,</hi> based on the
                    Hexaplar Greek text. These scholarly labours, however, did not take up his whole
                    time, and it was almost impossible for Jerome to be long anywhere without
                    getting into a dispute. He was a zealous defender of that monastic life which
                    was beginning to take such a large place in the church of the 4th century, and
                    he found enthusiastic disciples among the Roman ladies. A number of widows and
                    maidens met together in the house of Marcella to study the Scriptures with him;
                    he taught them Hebrew, and preached the virtues of the celibate life. His
                    arguments and exhortations may be gathered from many of his epistles and from
                    his tract <hi rend="italic">Adversus Helvidium,</hi> in which he defends the
                    perpetual virginity of the Virgin Mary <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n658/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0658-0631"/> against Helvidius, who maintained that Mary bore
                    children to Joseph. His influence over these ladies alarmed their relations, and
                    excited the suspicions of the regular priesthood and of the populace, but while
                    Pope Damasus lived Jerome remained secure. Damasus died, however, in 384, and
                    was succeeded by Siricius, who did not show much friendship for Jerome. He found
                    it expedient to leave Rome and set out for the East in 385. His letters
                    (especially Ep. 45) are full of outcries against his enemies and of indignant
                    protestations that he had done nothing unbecoming a Christian, that he had taken
                    no money, nor gifts great nor small, that he had no delight in silken attire,
                    sparkling gems, or gold ornaments, that no matron moved him unless by penitence
                    and fasting, &amp;c. His route is given in the third book <hi rend="italic">In
                    Pufηum∙,</hi> he went by Rhegium and Cyprus, where he was entertained by Bishop
                    Epiphanius, to Antioch. There he was joined by two wealthy Roman ladies, Paula,
                    a widow, and Eustochium her daughter, one of Jerome’s Hebrew students. They came
                    accompanied by a band of Roman maidens vowed to live a celibate life in a
                    nunnery in Palestine. Accompanied by these ladies Jerome made the tour of
                    Palestine, carefully noting with a scholar’s keenness the various places
                    mentioned in Holy Scripture. The results of this journey may be traced in his
                    translation with emendations of the book of Eusebius on the situation and names
                    of Hebrew places, written probably three years afterwards, when he had settled
                    down at Bethlehem. From Palestine Jerome and his companions went to Egypt,
                    remaining some time in Alexandria; and they visited the convents in the Nitrian
                    desert. Jerome’s mind was evidently full of anxiety about his translation of the
                    Old Testament, for we find him in his letters recording the conversations he had
                    with learned men about disputed readings and doubtful renderings; Didymus of
                    Alexandria appears to have been most useful. When they returned to Palestine
                    they all settled at Bethlehem, where Paula built four monasteries, three for
                    nuns and one for monks. She was at the head of the nunneries until her death in
                    404, when Eustochium succeeded her; Jerome presided over the fourth monastery.
                    In this monastery at Bethlehem Jerome did most of his literary work and,
                    throwing aside his unfinished plan of a translation from Origen’s Hexaplar text,
                    translated the Old Testament directly from the Hebrew, with the aid of Jewish
                    scholars. He mentions a rabbi from Lydda, a rabbi from Tiberias, and above all
                    Rabbi Ben Anina, who came to him by night secretly for fear of the Jews. Jerome
                    was not familiar enough with Hebrew to be able to dispense with such assistance,
                    and he makes the synagogue responsible for the accuracy of his version: “Let him
                    who would challenge aught in this translation,” he says, “ask the Jews.” The
                    result of all this labour was the Latin translation of the Scriptures which, in
                    spite of much opposition from the more conservative party in the church,
                    afterwards became the Vulgate or authorized version; but the Vulgate as we have
                    it now is not exactly Jerome’s Vulgate, for it suffered a good deal from changes
                    made under the influence of the older translations; the text became very corrupt
                    during the Middle Ages, and in particular all the Apocrypha, except Tobit and
                    Judith, which Jerome translated from the Chaldee, were added from the older
                    versions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>Notwithstanding the labour involved in translating the Scriptures, Jerome found
                    time to do a great deal of literary work, and also to indulge in violent
                    controversy. Earlier in life he had a great admiration for Origen, and
                    translated many of his works, and this lasted after he had settled at</p>
                <p>Bethlehem, for he translated in 389 Origen’s homilies on Luke; but he came to
                    change his opinion and wrote violently against the admirers of the great

                    concealment for nearly two years. He returned to Bethlehem in 418, and after a
                    lingering illness died on September 30, 420.</p>
                <p>By far the best edition of Jerome’s works is that of Vallarsi (Verona, 1734-42),
