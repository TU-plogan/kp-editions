                    or, as the name is frequently written according to its actual Albanian
                    pronunciation, <hi rend="smallcaps">Yanina,</hi> a town of European Turkey in
                    southern Albania, or—to retain the ancient designation—Epirus. The position of
                    Janina is strikingly picturesque. At the foot of the grey limestone mass of
                    Mount Mitzekeli (1500 ft.), which forms part of the fine range of hills running
                    north from the Gulf of Arta, there lies a valley (the Hellopia of antiquity)
                    partly occupied by a lake; and on the slopes of a slight eminence, stretching
                    down to the western shore, stands this town of St John. It has greatly declined
                    from the state of barbaric prosperity which it enjoyed in the beginning of this
                    century, when it was the seat of Ali Pasha, estimated to have from 30,000 to
                    50,000 inhabitants. The fortress—Demir-Kule or Iron Castle, which like the
                    principal seraglio was built on a promontory jutting down into the lake—is now
                    in ruins. But the town still possesses fourteen mosques, each embosomed by a
                    cluster of trees, and there are also seven churches, two synagogues, a Greek
                    college, a library, and a hospital. As the centre of a vilayet it contains a
                    governor’s residence (rebuilt in 1870). Sayades (opposite Corfu) and Arta are
                    the places through which it receives its imports. A considerable activity in
                    trade and industry is maintained by the Greek population, the rich gold and
                    silver embroidery for which the town has long been famous being still one of the
                    notable articles in its bazaar. According to M. Moreau, the French consul <hi
                        rend="italic">(BuU. de la Soc. de G.eogr.,</hi> Faris, 1876), Janina
                    contained 16,230 inhabitants in 1875, of whom 4136 were Mahometans, 8989
                    Christians, and 3105 Jews. Synvet <hi rend="italic">(Les</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    1878) reckons the Greeks alone at 14,362 (the island on the lake being
                    included). The vilayet of Janina, previous to the cessions made to Greece in
                    1881, comprised the sandjaks of Janina, Argyrocastro, Berat (Avlona), Prevesa,
                    and Thessaly, and the sandjak contains the districts of Janina (town and
                    country), Aidwat, Prevena, Cognitza, Metzovo, and Philates. The lake (perhaps to
                    be identified with the Pambotus of antiquity) is 6 miles long, and has an
                    extreme breadth of 3 miles. In time of flood it is united with the smaller lake
                    of Labchistas, which lies to the north. According to Guido Cora’s investigations
                    in 1878, the greatest depth does not exceed 32 feet. There are no affluents of
                    any considerable size, and the only outlets are underground passages or
                    katavothra extending for many miles through the calcareous rocks.</p>
                <p>The theory supported by Leake (ΛWΛenι <hi rend="italic">Greece)</hi> that the
                    citadel of Janina is to be identified with Dodona, is now generally surrendered
                    in favour of the claims of a more southern site. As Anna Comnena, in describing
                    the capture of the town (τα <hi rend="italic">'∖οαvvιvα)</hi> by Bohemond in
                    1082, speaks of the walls as being dilapidated, it may be supposed that the
                    place existed before the 11th century. It is mentioned from time to time in the
                    Byzantine annals, and on the establishment of the lordship of Epirus by Michael
                    Angelus Comnenas Ducas, it became his capital. During the 14th century it was
                    frequently attacked by the Albanians; but it was still in possession of the
                    successors of Michael when the forces of Sultan Amurath appeared before it in
                    1430 (ς∕ ’. Hahn, <hi rend="italic">Alban.</hi><hi rend="italic">Studien,</hi>
                    pp. 319-322). Since 1431 it has continued under Turkish rule. In modern times it
                    became famous as the seat of the tyrant Ali (1788-1822). See <hi
