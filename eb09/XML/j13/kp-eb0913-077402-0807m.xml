                    more or less aromatic odour, inhabiting the whole of the cold and temperate
                    northern hemisphere, but attaining their maximum development in the temperate
                    zone in North America and Europe. The leaves are usually articulated at the
                    base, spreading, sharp-pointed, and needle-like in form, destitute of
                    oil-glands, and arranged in alternating whorls of three; but in some the leaves
                    are minute and scale-like, closely adhering to the branches, the apex only free,
                    and furnished with an oil-gland on the back. Sometimes the same plant produces
                    both kinds of leaves on different branches, or the young plants produce acicular
                    leaves, while those of the older plants are squamiform. The male and female
                    flowers are usually produced on separate plants; the occurrence of both on the
                    same plant is rare. The male flowers are developed at the ends of short lateral
                    branches, are rounded or oblong in form, and consist of several antheriferous
                    scales in two or three rows, each scale bearing three or six almost spherical
                    pollen-sacks on its under side. The female flower is a small bud-like cone
                    situated at the apex of a small branch, and consists of two or three whorls of
                    two or three scales. The scales of the upper or middle series each produce one
                    lateral ovule. The mature cone is fleshy, with the succulent scales fused
                    together and forming the fruit-like structure known to the older botanists as
                    the galbulus, or berry of the juniper. The berries are red or purple in colour,
                    varying in size from that of a pea to a nut. They differ considerably from the
                    cones of other members of the order <hi rend="italic">Coniferae,</hi> to which
                    the junipers belong. The seeds are usually three in number, sometimes fewer (1),
                    rarely more (8), and have the surface near the middle or base marked with large
                    glands containing oil. The genus occurs in a fossil state, four species having
                    been described from rocks of Tertiary age.</p>
                <p>Bentham and Hooker divide the genus into three sections, viz., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sabina, Oxycedrus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Caryocedrus.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Juniperus</hi><hi rend="italic">Sabina</hi> is the savin, an
                    irregularly spreading much-branched shrub with scale-like glandular leaves, and
                    emitting a disagreeable odour when bruised. The flesh and dried tops of savin
                    are official in the British and United States pharmacopoeias. The plant is
                    poisonous, acting as a powerful local and general stimulant, diaphoretic,
                    emmenagogue and anthelmintic; it is employed both internally and externally. <hi
                    rend="italic">Juniperus</hi><hi rend="italic">bermudiana,</hi> a tree about 40
                    or 50 feet in height, yields a fragrant red wood, which was used for the
                    manufacture of “cedar” pencils. The tree is now very scarce in Bermuda, and the
                    “red cedar,” <hi rend="italic">Juniperus</hi><hi rend="italic">virginiana,</hi>
                    of North America is employed instead for pencils and cigar boxes. The red cedar
                    is abundant in some parts of the United States, and in Virginia is a tree 50
                    feet in height. It is very widely distributed from the great lakes to Florida
                    and round the Gulf of Mexico, and extends as far west as the Rocky Mountains.
                    The wood is applied to many uses in the United States. The fine red fragrant
                    heart-wood takes a high polish, and is much used in cabinet work and inlaying,
                    but the small size of the planks prevents its more extended use. The tops of the
                    young branches are official in the United States pharmacopoeia. The galls
                    produced at the ends of the branches have also been used in medicine, and the
                    wood yields cedar-camphor and oil of cedar wood.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Juniperus</hi><hi rend="italic">communis,</hi> the common
                    juniper, and several other species, belong to the section <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oxycedrus.</hi> The common juniper is a very widely distributed plant,
                    occurring in the whole of northern Europe, central and northern Asia to
                    Kamchatka, and North America. It grows at considerable elevations in southern
                    Europe, in the Alps, Apennines, Pyrenees, and Sierra Nevada (4000 to 9000 feet).
                    It also grows in Asia Minor, Persia, and at great elevations on the Himalayas.
                    In former times the juniper seems to have been a very well known plant, the name
                    occurring almost unaltered in many languages. The dialectical names, chiefly in
                    European languages, have been collected by Prince L. L. Bonaparte, and published
                    in <hi rend="italic">The Academy</hi> (July 17, 1880, No. 428, p. 45). The
                    common juniper is official in the British pharmacopoeia and in that of the
                    United States, yielding the oil of juniper, a powerful diuretic, distilled from
                    the unripe fruits. The wood is very aromatic, and is used for ornamental
                    purposes. In Lapland the bark is made into ropes. The fruits are used for
                    flavouring gin (a name derived from <hi rend="italic">juniper,</hi> through the
                    French <hi rend="italic">genièvre)</hi>; and in some parts of France a kind of
                    beer called <hi rend="italic">Genêvrette</hi> was made from them by the
                    peasants. <hi rend="italic">Juniperus</hi><hi rend="italic">Oxycedrus,</hi> from
                    the Mediterranean district and Madeira, yields cedar oil which is official in

                    Minor. The fruits are large and edible; they are known in the East by the name
