                <p>THE Christian religion, besides its natural and spiritual elements, has also an
                    historical element. It believes that, in accordance with a Divine purpose,
                    prophesied at the very dawn of human life, God was manifest in the flesh in the
                    man Christ Jesus. The actual life of Jesus on earth is but the central part of a
                    scheme which, in the belief of Christians, extends through all the ages. Our
                    present object is merely to furnish a brief sketch of that life as it appears in
                    the full light of history, without entering into the numberless collateral
                    questions which it offers for consideration, a task which in these limits is
                    obviously impossible.</p>
                <p>I. The word Jesus is the form assumed in Latin by the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iesous,</hi> which is the transliterated form of the Hebrew Jehoshua, Jeshua,
                    or Joshua, meaning “Jehovah is salvation.” In one or other of its forms the name
                    is found in many passages of the Old Testament. It was not, however, borne by
                    any person who rose to historic eminence between the days of Joshua the son of
                    Nun and the high priest Joshua who was the colleague of Zerubbabel at the return
                    from the exile. The prominent position held by Joshua in the later prophetic
                    books seems to have made the name popular. We find frequent traces of it after
                    the exile.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Jos., <hi

                    indignation among patriotic Jews, many of the bearers of the name preferred to

                    name Jesus with the same root (Euseb., <hi rend="italic">Dem. Evang.,</hi>

                    also “Jesus,” although it may have disappeared from the chief manuscripts,
                    partly from feelings of reverence, partly from the mistaken fancy of Origen that
                    we find no sinner among all those who had borne the name.<note anchored="true"

                    the name, though common, was meant to be deeply significant of the work for
                    which Jesus was born into the world—namely, to save His people from their sins;
                    and for this reason, in the account of the Annunciation, as given by St Luke (i.
                    31), His mother is expressly bidden to call her babe by this name.<note

                <p>On the other hand, the word Christ was not originally a name but a title.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Non proprium nomen est, sed
                    nuncupatio potestatis et regni,” Lactant., <hi rend="italic">Div. Iηst.,</hi>
                    iv. 7.</p></note> In the Gospels we scarcely ever read of Christ, but always of
                    <hi rend="italic">“the</hi> Christ.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The only exceptions are Matt. i. 1, 18, Mark i. 1, John i.
                    17 (which are all in the headings and prefaces), and John xvii. 3, where we find
                    “Jesus Christ.” The only other passages in which the article is omitted before
                    “Christ” in the Gospels are Mark ix. 41, Luke ii. 11, xxiii. 2, John ix. 22.
                    Thus Matt. ii. 4 is “where <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Christ should be born”;
                    Matt. xi. 2 is “John hearing in prison the works of <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
                    Christ,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Messianic works; and Matt, xxii. 42 is
                    “what think ye of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Messiah ?”</p></note> It was only
                    after the resurrection that the title gradually passed into a name, and “Jesus
                    Christ,” or later still “Christ Jesus,” becomes one designation. The Greek word
                    means “anointed,” and is a translation of the Hebrew “Messiah.” The coming
                    Deliverer for whom the Jews had yearned for so many centuries was spoken of as
                    the “anointed one,” with special reference to the prophecies of Isaiah (lxi. 1)
                    and Daniel (ix. 24-26), which again referred backward to the language of the
                    Psalms (ii. 2, xx. 6, xlv. 7). The anointing of Jesus was the special outpouring
                    of the Holy Spirit upon Him, not only throughout His life (Acts x. 38), but
                    specially at His baptism (John i. 32). Unction was the recognized mode of
                    consecrating any one to the offices of priest (Ex. xxix. 29; Lev. iv. 3) and
                    king (1 Sam. x. 1, ∑xiv. 6); and prophets were supposed to be anointed by God’s
                    grace for the fulfilment of their task (Isa. lxi. 1). The Messiah combined in
                    His office the threefold dignity. He was a prophet to reveal (John vi. 14; Matt,
                    xiii. 57; Luke xiii. 33, xxiv. 19), a king to reign and to judge (Luke xxiii. 2;
                    Acts xvii. 7; 1 Cor. XV. 24; Rev. xv. 3), and a high priest to offer up the
                    sacrifice of Himself (Heb. ii. 17 and <hi rend="italic">passim).</hi></p>
                <p>Since these, however, were distinctively J ewish conceptions, it was natural that
                    they should be but little understood by the Greeks and Romans. The word
                    “anointed” conveyed to them no sacred conceptions, and it was restamped <hi
                    rend="italic">(surfrappe)</hi> by them into accordance with their own notions.
                    They fancied that the real name of the founder of the new religion must be <hi
                    rend="italic">Chrestzιs</hi> or “excellent,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>There is a possible allusion to the similar sound of the two
                    words in 1 Pet. ii. 3, <hi rend="italic">oτι χρηστi&gt;s</hi><hi rend="italic">δ
                    Κύριοί.</hi></p></note> and they constantly spoke of the Christians as
                    “Chrestians.” Suetonius says that the Jews were expelled from Rome by Claudius
                    because they were raising seditions at the constant instigation of “Chrestus”;
                    and he cared so little to inform himself on the subject that he made no
                    distinction between Jews and Christians, and seems to have imagined that
                    “Chrestus” was some leader of sedition then living at Rome.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Romans did not fully learn to

                    wise objected to the mistaken designation. “If you call us Christians,” said
                    Tertullian, “you bear witness to the name of our master; if you call us ‘

                <p>II. The designation of “the Christ” given to Jesus shows that His followers saw
                    in Him the long-promised Messiah of Judaism; and the rapidity with which the
                    title developed into a name proves the strength and permanence of this
                    conviction. And this much at least is conceded by all, that Jesus more than
                    fulfilled the conditions for which the Jews had hoped in the Deliverer of whom
                    so many prophets had spoken, and that He fulfilled them in a manner
                    transcendently wider, deeper, and more permanent than even the prophets had
                    fully foreseen. Even the most advanced sceptic cannot deny that by His life and
                    teaching He has altered the entire current of human history, and raised the
                    standard of human morality. He was, says Renan, “the individual who had made the
                    species take the greatest step towards the divine.”<note anchored="true"

                    457.</p></note> But as His life was passed and His work accomplished, not in a
                    corner,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Acts xxvi.
                    26.</p></note> but on the open stage and under the full light of a civilized
                    epoch, it becomes a matter of great importance to estimate the value of the
                    sources from which our knowledge of His life is derived. Those sources are (1)
                    heathen, (2) Jewish, and (3) Christian.</p>
                <p>1. The knowledge derivable from heathen sources, if much smaller than we could
                    have desired, or <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> expected, is not smaller than
                    is fully accounted for in the •simple and unsophisticated narratives preserved
                    for us by the evangelists and apostles. They show us that Christianity began
                    from the most humble origin, and was regarded by the whole non-Christian
                    world—alike Jewish and pagan— with unconcealed hatred, largely mingled with a
                    contempt which ultimately passed into terror and exasperation. They faithfully
                    record for us the obscure position, the extreme poverty, the persecuted lives,
                    the unlearned training of the apostles, and the disdain to which they were on
                    all sides subjected. The silence of contemporary Gentile and Jewish writers,
                    which would be otherwise inexplicable, finds its undesigned explanation in the
                    New Testament itself, which never attempts to conceal the contemptuous
                    indignation of the Jewish aristocracy, and the lordly indifference of the higher
                    Gentile authorities.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, from heathen writers we do not learn a single <hi rend="italic"
                    >new</hi> fact respecting Jesus Christ, while yet all that they do tell us, even
                    when expressed in language of calumny and abhorrence, proves the historical
                    reality of the facts which the Gospels record. If it be true that Napoleon once
                    asked Herder whether Jesus ever lived at all, such a passing phase of
                    incredulity is so perfectly unreasonable that it has long been abandoned even by
                    the most destructive critics. Whether there ever existed any authentic census
                    tables of Quirinius, or any official report of Pilate to the emperor Tiberius or
                    not,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A writing called
                    “the Acts of Pilate” existed in the 2d century (Justin, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apol.,</hi> i. 35), and long continued to be used in heathen schools to warn
                    boys against the belief of the Christians (Euseb., <hi rend="italic">H. E.,</hi>
                    i. 9, ix. 5).</p></note> Tacitus tells us with perfect accuracy that the founder
                    of Christianity had been put to death in the reign of Tiberius by the procurator
                    Pontius Pilate, and that his religion, which Tacitus calls a “deadly
                    superstition,” “though crushed for a time, burst forth again, not only
                    throughout Judaea, in which it sprung up, but even in Rome, the common reservoir
                    for all the streams of wickedness and infamy.” He further tells us that Nero
                    diverted from himself the odium of the burning of Rome by charging the crime
                    upon the Christians; and, though he implies that their fate was not undeserved
                    because of their universal misanthropy, he yet honestly admits that they were
                    not guilty of this crime of incendiarism, on pretence of which they were
                    subjected to the most awful forms of martyrdom.<note anchored="true"

                    confounded the Christians with the Jews, only regarding them as being Jews whose
                    belief was more than usually abject. How little information could be expected
                    from this eminent historian appears from the credulity with which he accepted

                    contemporary Suetonius evidently held the same opinions. He seems to regard Nero
                    as a public benefactor because he punished the Christians, “a class of men of a
                    strange and pestilent superstition.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the belief which, like his contemporaries, he regarded as a perverse and
                    extravagant superstition. We learn also from this celebrated letter that nothing
                    could shake the allegiance of Christians to Christ, and that they were
                    accustomed to meet early in the morning to celebrate Him as God with hymns of

                    the second century. We only know this by the quotations and refutation of
                    Origen, but it furnishes us with indisputable testimony that in his day the
                    facts of the Gospels from first to last were current in the exact form in which
                    we now possess them (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Celsus).</hi> Thus, from the
                    scanty notices of heathens even, we can derive a confirmation of the main
                    external facts in the life of Christ :—His miracles, His parables, His
                    crucifixion, His claim to divine honour, the devotion, innocence, heroic
                    constancy, and mutual affection of His followers, and the progressive victories
                    won by His religion in despite of overwhelming opposition alike physical and

                    emperor Caius, and that in his book on the contemplative life he is describing
                    not the life of the Essenes and Therapeutae, but those of the Christian church
                    in Alexandria founded by St Mark<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    valueless. It is extremely probable that Philo had scarcely heard either of
                    Christ or of the Christians.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Philo only mentions a single visit which he paid to
                    Jerusalem (in a fragment <hi rend="italic">ap.</hi> Euseb., <hi rend="italic"

                    40 A.D., but at that period Christianity had hardly emerged into the recognition
                    claimed by prominent historical phenomena. The writings of Philo are valuable,
                    not for any light which they throw on the gospel histories, but for the evidence
                    which they afford of prevalent modes of thought and phraseology, in which some
                    even of the apostles shared. When, however, we turn to Josephus, we find in his
                    writings, as now extant, no less than three allusions to events in the gospel
                    history. Jt cannot be decided with certainty whether two of these passages are
                    genuine as they now stand, but modern opinion tends to the view that in each of
                    the actual allusions to Jesus there is a genuine basis with later Christian
                    interpolations. The passage in which he speaks of the preaching and execution of
                    John the Baptist is not disputed,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> xviii. 5, 2.</p></note>
                    and it is very important as showing that Josephus must have been perfectly well
                    acquainted with the facts of Christ’s life, and that he has passed them over, in
                    his usual unscrupulous way, with a reticence due only to dislike or perplexity.
                    For in speaking of St John’s preaching he deliberately, and it must be feared
                    dishonestly, excludes the Messianic element from which it derived its main power
                    and significance. In another passage he mentions with strong disapproval the
                    judicial murder by the younger Annas of James the Just, “the brother of Jesus,
                    called the Christ.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    with by Christian interpolators who wished to make it a more emphatic testimony
                    in favour of Christ, but in its present form its genuineness is undisputed.<note

                    Respecting the third passage, in which Josephus speaks directly of Jesus, the
                    only question is whether it be partly or entirely spurious. Placing in brackets
                    the words which are undoubtedly interpolated, it runs as follows :—</p>

                    is the reading in Euseb., i. 11; and, if the passage be genuine at all, there
                    can be no doubt that this is the true reading.</p></note> Jesus, a wise man [if
                    indeed He may be called a man, for He was a worker of miracles, a teacher of
                    such men as receive the truth with joy], and He drew to himself many Jews [and
                    many also of the Greeks. This was the Christ]. And when at the instigation of
                    our chief men Pilate condemned Him to the cross, those who had first loved Him
                    did not fall away. [For He appeared to them alive again on the third day,
                    according as the holy prophets had declared this and countless other marvels of
                    Him.] To this day the sect of Christians, called after Him, still exists.”<note

                <p>That Josephus wrote the whole passage as it now stands no sane critic can
                    believe. Vespasian, not Jesus, was the Messiah of the “ambiguous oracle” of that
                    apostate Jew.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Jos., <hi

                    are, however, two reasons which are alone sufficient to prove that the whole
                    passage is spurious,—one that it was unknown to Origen and the earlier fathers,
                    the other that its place in the text is uncertain. It is now found after the
                    historian’s notices of Pilate, but the remarks of Eusebius show that in his time
                    it was found before them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Josephus preserved a politic silence respecting Christ and the Christians,
                    confining himself to remote allusions; and this was quite possible, because he
                    was writing mainly for Greeks and Romans who were profoundly ignorant of the
                    whole subject. That Josephus knew a great deal more than he chose to say is
                    evident. There is reason to suspect that his account of his own juvenile
                    precocity before the leading teachers of his nation is borrowed from the
                    Gospels,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Vit.,</hi> 2.</p></note> and that his account of his shipwreck on
                    the journey to Rome is not un coloured by the facts of St Paul’s shipwreck about
                    that very time.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Vit.,</hi> 3.</p></note> But the most striking indication of his
                    hostile reticence is found in the chapter of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antiquities</hi> which follows the supposed allusion to Jesus.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi>

                    manner to drag in a disgusting story of a trick played by the priests of Isis on
                    a Roman lady; and no one who is acquainted with the Jewish calumnies about the
                    incarnation can doubt that in this story we have an oblique and malignant
                    anticipation of the falsehood which ultimately took form in the Talmud and the
                    anti-Christian writings of the later Jews.</p>
                <p>From other Jewish sources not a single fact about Jesus can be gleaned. In the

                    and the Christians characterized by intense hatred. He is usually spoken of
                    indirectly as “that man,” “the Nazarene,” “the fool,” “Absalom,” “the hung,”
                    “the son of Stada,” “the son of Pandera.” Many allusions to Him are veiled in
                    cryptographs of which the key is in the possession of but few. All the grossest

                    !), and that He was crucified at Lydda, because no one, during forty days, came

                    and claiming divine honour, is, even in these sources, laid to His charge. And
                    thus even from pagan and Jewish enemies we derive all that we want and all that
                    we could expect in the recognition of the historic personality of Christ, and of

                    is to set forth by contrast the immeasurable superiority of the canonical
                    Gospels, by showing us what these also might have been if they had been the
                    products of human invention. But it is not the Gospels alone on which we have to
                    depend. We have four works of which the authenticity has never even been
                    assailed by any serious writer, namely, St Paul’s four epistles to the
                    Galatians, Romans, and Corinthians. These may truly be regarded as a fifth
                    Gospel, of which the testimony is all the more valuable because it is undesigned
                    and incidental. It is also earlier than that of any Gospel, and is the testimony
                    of one whose personality stands forth with absolute clearness in the light of
                    history. Further than this, it is the testimony of a man of commanding
                    intellect, and of the highest Jewish culture, who, after the death of Christ,
                    was converted from the most bitter hostility to the most intense devotion, and
                    who bears his witness within twenty-five years of the events respecting which he
                    speaks. And yet, if we had the epistles of St Paul alone, we could find a
                    contemporary testimony to almost every single fact of primary importance in the
                    life of Christ,—His birth of the seed of David, His poverty, His Messiahship,
                    His moral teaching, His proclamation of the kingdom of God, His calling of the

                    testimony of the other epistles, we have further testimonies to almost every

                    in the Revelation of St John.</p>
                <p>It is, however, from the Gospels that our fullest light is derived. They are not,
                    and do not profess to be, full biographies written for the gratification of
                    curiosity, but they preserve for us all that is necessary to explain the origin
                    of Christianity in the life of its Founder. In the first three Gospels, called
                    Synoptic, we have sketches of the life and teaching of Christ of which the
                    latest was probably written within forty years of the crucifixion. No one has
                    ever denied that the representation of Christ in these three Gospels is
                    essentially the same. The view of Him presented in the Fourth Gospel, which was
                    not published till towards the close of the 1st century, is more subjective. It
                    is the spiritual Gospel, the Gospel for the church, and even those critics who
                    deny its Johannine authorship admit its value as a very ancient document written
                    by a Jewish Christian of extraordinary genius who had access to the most
                    valuable sources of contemporary information.</p>
                <p>III. Since, then, it may be regarded as a truth for which the close
                    investigations of historical criticism have only secured more universal
                    admission that the life of. Jesus was a life of which the main outlines are
                    historically certain, we must now glance at its chronology and duration.</p>
                <p>It must be admitted that we cannot demonstrate the exact year of the nativity,
                    but critics of all schools are verging more and more towards the acceptance of 4
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> as the probable year of Christ’s birth. Our
                    present era was fixed (525 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> by a learned
                    Scythian, Dionysius Exiguus, who was an abbot at Rome, and died about 550; but
                    it is now admitted to be erroneous by at least four years. Many methods have
                    been adopted to arrive at the true date; but all attempts to fix it by the
                    enrolment of Quirinius, the order of the Jewish courses of priests, the
                    consulships mentioned by Tertullian, and the extremely remarkable astronomical
                    conjunction of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn in Pisces in the spring of A.u.c.

                    two data which furnish us with an approximation to the accurate date. One of
                    these is the death of Herod the Great. Josephus tells us that he died
                    thirty-seven years after he had been declared king by the Romans.<note

                    Now on this point the data of the evangelists have been disturbed by a prevalent
                    early tradition that Christ’s public ministry only lasted one year, and by
                    another tradition that Jesus did not die till the age of fifty. The first of
                    these notions is a mistaken inference drawn by Clement of Alexandria,<note

                    a mistaken inference from John viii. 57. That both views are mistakes appears
                    from the positive testimony of St Luke that Jesus was about thirty years old
                    when he began His ministry, and from the clear indications given by St John (ii.
                    13, vi. 4, xi. 55) that there were at least three passovers during the public
                    ministry. On other grounds it is probable that there was one passover during the
                    ministry which our Lord did not attend; and if so, we see the'grounds for the
                    ancient tradition that His public preaching lasted upwards of three years, and
                    that Jesus died at the age of thirty-three.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    probable that the crucifixion took place at the passover of March 30 <hi

                <p>IV. The circumstances of the nativity are only related by St Matthew and St Luke,
                    and by each of them in a manner so absolutely independent that facts known to
                    the one may have been unknown to the other. There is no difficulty in
                    reconciling their fragmentary intimations if we suppose that Nazareth was the
                    native place of Joseph and Mary, and that there the coming nativity was
                    announced to the Virgin, but that the exigences of the enrolment undertaken by
                    Quirinius for imperial purposes required Joseph to register his name at
                    Bethlehem, the native town of David, from whom both he and, probably, his
                    espoused wife were descended.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The descent of Mary from David is implied in the New

                    asserted by Justin Martyr and Irenaeus.</p></note></p>

                    >b.c.,</hi> the difficulties which have been raised about the registration

                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> objections which have but little weight against
                    testimony. The Jews clung to their genealogies and tribal relations, and in
                    consequence of the settled habits of Oriental life most families would be
                    naturally resident at their native place. The inconvenience to those who were
                    not resident would be but slight in comparison with the danger of exciting
                    tumults by needlessly forcing the Roman methods of registration on a reluctant
                    people. The smallness of Palestine, and the regular custom of attending a yearly
                    passover, λvould tend to minimize any inconvenience; and, if the attendance of
                    Mary was not obligatory (which is uncertain), nothing is more natural than that
                    at such a time of trial and danger she should have accompanied the only person
                    who could protect her. Those who charge St Luke with a gross chronological error
                    in antedating by ten years the registration of Quirinius should remember that in
                    <hi rend="italic">every</hi> other instance in which his statements have been

                    the fact is not distinctly mentioned by any ancient author—was twice legate of
                    Syria, viz., A.π.c. 750-753 and again A.τr.c. 760-765. Neither the sneers nor
                    the attacks of critics have in the slightest degree shaken this probability;
                    and, since Justin Martyr appeals to the census table of Quirinius, and

                    Quirinius during his first term of office as legate of Syria, and completed
                    during his second.</p>
                <p>V. It is not of course our object to narrate or even to touch upon all the events
                    and teachings which occupy the four Gospels, but only to glance at their general
                    bearing. The life of Jesus naturally falls into five epochs :—(1) the infancy
                    and childhood; (2) the youth and early manhood; (3) the public ministry,
                    including (4) the closing scenes and crucifixion, and (5) the resurrection and
                    ascension. These epochs are well marked in the Gospels.</p>
                <p>1. The two who alone preserve for us any details of the infancy and childhood are
                    St Matthew and St Luke, and they relate four events. Of these the circumcision
                    and the presentation in the temple present no difficulties. The circumcision, at
                    which the name was always publicly given, took place on the eighth day after the
                    birth, and was performed in the presence of the nearest friends. It illustrated
                    the truths that Christ was “born under the law” which he came “not to destroy
                    but to fulfil.” Thirty-three days after the circumcision was the purification in
                    the temple, and St Luke tells us how the aged Simeon and Anna welcomed the
                    infant Saviour with words of prophecy. The third event, the visit of the Magi,
                    is known as the Epiphany or manifestation of Christ to the Gentiles.</p>
                <p>It rests on the sole authority of St Matthew, but there is no feature in his
                    account which is out of keeping with known events and possibilities. The Magi,
                    Persian or Chaldaean astrologers, were a class extremely common at that epoch,
                    and under different names are repeatedly mentioned by the contemporary

                    expectations in those days, which especially affected the East, but which has

                <p>The sequel of the story—Herod’s jealousy and the massacre of the innocents—has
                    been mainly doubted because it is not mentioned in Josephus. But there must have
                    been hundreds of events of that day of which the Jewish historian has taken no
                    notice, though they were far more sanguinary than the murder of a handful of
                    infants in a little village. The act corresponds to the jealousy and cruelty
                    which were the master passions of the Idumaean usurper, and, if Josephus here
                    follows Nicolaus of Damascus, we may be quite sure that he would not have
                    mentioned a fact so damaging to the character of his patron. There are, however,
                    two allusions in Josephus, which, if they do not specifically indicate this
                    event, yet may well allude to it, or at least show how consonant it was with
                    Herod’s impulses.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Jos.,

                    and xvii. 2, 4, where he speaks of a clamour of “the mothers (comp. Matt. ii.
                    18) of those who had been slain by him.”</p></note> Further, Macrobius speaks of
                    “the boys under two years of age (comp. Matt. ii. 16) whom Herod ordered to be
                    slain in Syria,” and, although he confuses this with the sentence upon Herod’s
                    sons, of whom Antipater was executed within five days of Herod’s death, his
                    words may well point to the murder of the children of Bethlehem.<note

                    other histories, it meets with unexpected confirmations of its possibility from
                    many quarters. That Joseph should have fled with Mary and the child into Egypt
                    was exactly what would have been done by every Jew similarly circumstanced.
                    Three days journey, as far as the Wady Rhinocolura, would have placed the
                    fugitives beyond the reach of Herod’s jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>The sojourn of the holy family in Egypt was probably very short, nor indeed would
                    there have been any temptation to stay a day longer than was necessary. Joseph’s
                    first intention was to return to Bethlehem when the news that Herod the Great
                    was dead seemed to open the prospect of happier times. But when he was met on
                    the way by the intelligence that Judaea had fallen by his father’s will to the
                    share of the cruel Archelaus<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>St Matthew uses the word <hi rend="italic">βaσιKsbει,</hi>
                    and Archelaus, having been saluted “king” by the army, actually did wear that
                    title for a short time after his father’s death (Jos., <hi rend="italic">B.

                    himself so near to the palace of that jealous tyrant, and “retired” <hi
                    rend="italic">(avcχωpησw)</hi> to the mountain seclusion of remote and despised
                    Nazareth. How deep was the impression which these events had made on the memory
                    of the people, and how little likely it was that a contemporary evangelist could
                    fall into a mistake about them, is shown by the fact, which has only recently
                    been noticed, that fully thirty years afterwards Jesus made the events which
                    happened at the succession of Archelaus even in minute particulars the
                    groundwork of a striking parable.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    type="authorial"><p>Luke ii. 52.</p></note> We further learn that He was not
                    subjected to the training of any of the rabbinic schools. He had never learned
                    that complicated system of oral tradition which was known by the Jews as
                    “letters.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mark vi. 2;
                    John vi. 42, vii. 15.</p></note> It is doubtful whether the schools which
                    afterwards became common existed at this early period in country villages.
                    Schools for infants are said to have been first founded by the son of Gamaliel,
                    but possibly by this time the custom had begun of employing the scribes and
                    lower officers of the synagogue <hi rend="italic">(chazzanîm)</hi> to teach the
                    boys of each village. We can trace proofs that Jesus was wonderfully familiar
                    with the sights and sounds of nature, as well as with the habits of men of all
                    classes, for He drew His illustrations in abundance from both sources. It is
                    also certain that He knew both Greek and Aramaic, which were at that time
                    universally spoken throughout Palestine; and there are slight indications that
                    He was acquainted with Latin and with Hebrew, though the latter had now become a
                    dead and learned language. We also find that He was acquainted with the then by
                    no means common art of writing. It is certain that in His home He must, like
                    other Jewish children, have learned first the Shema' (Deut. vi. 4), then the
                    Hallel (Psalms cxiv. to cxviii.), and then the Scriptures generally, to all
                    parts of which, and especially to the Psalms and prophetic books, He constantly
                    referred. The certainty that He never passed through the ordinary training of
                    the learned classes nullifies the suggestion that any part of His wisdom was
                    borrowed from such writers as Philo and such rabbis as Hillel and Shammai. His
                    methods and His whole moral conception difler fundamentally from those of the
                    Alexandrian philosopher and the Jerusalem Pharisees. His teachers, humanly
                    speaking, were the books of God,—the books of Scripture, of nature, and of
                    life,—and the voice of God within His soul.</p>
                <p>At the age of twelve a Jewish boy was held to have finished the elementary stages
                    of his education, and became a “son of the law.” At this age He was presented by
                    His father in the synagogue, began to wear the phylacteries, learnt a trade for
                    His own support, and “advanced,” as the Jews phrased it, from the study of the
                    Scriptures to <pb break="no"

                    took Jesus for the first time to Jerusalem, and there occurred the memorable
                    incident of the temporary loss of Him by His mother and Joseph, and their
                    discovery of Him in the Temple seated among the doctors, “both hearing, and
                    asking them questions.” His answer to the astonished inquiry “Why dost thou
                    treat us thus?” was, “Why is it that ye looked for me ?”; “Did ye not know that
                    I must be in my Father’s house?”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    anything of which the world has had any experience during all the former or
                    subsequent ages. The evangelists record no further particulars of these early

                <p>Of the remaining life of Jesus during the period between this visit to Jerusalem

                    years of youth and opening manhood were spent, not only in the obscurity of a

                    attempt to break by unauthorized inventions the deep silence of those long
                    unknown years in which He consecrated the common lot of toil and poverty, and
                    thereby showed the inherent dignity of manhood and the intrinsic sacredness of
                    human life.</p>
                <p>3. Before entering on the third epoch of the life of Jesus,—the baptism and
                    public ministry,—we must pause for a moment to touch on the political and
                    religious aspect of the world during the brief period of His Messianic
                    activity.</p>
                <p>Politically the world was passing through a bad epoch. Rome under the emperors,
                    as she attained the zenith of her apparent power and splendour, sank almost to
                    the nadir of her real degradation. The genius of Julius Caesar, the astute
                    policy of Augustus, could not delay the everdeepening degeneracy which revealed
                    itself in its worst colours in the reign of Tiberius. The condition of the Roman
                    world during the later years of Tiberius, when he was hiding at Capreae, the
                    infamies of his sanguinary lust, was that condition of terror and despair which
                    Tacitus has portrayed with such unequalled power. The words in which he
                    describes the characteristics of a somewhat later period apply also to this; it
                    was “rich in disasters, terrible in battles, rent by seditions, savage even in
                    its peace.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tac., <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> i. 2.</p></note> The murder of princes, the outbreaks
                    of rebellion and civil war, the prevalence of alarming rumours, the decimation
                    of the noblest families by means of spies and informers, the conflagrations of
                    temples and cities, the oppression of provinces by the greed and cruelty of
                    legates and procurators, the horrible degradation of private morals, the awful
                    tragedies of impurity and bloodshed which were enacted in various courts, the
                    multiplications of banishments, even the terror of famines, storms, and
                    earthquakes, combined to render the early years of the Christian era a period of
                    gloom and anguish throughout large portions of the Roman empire. Judaea was the
                    scene of special miseries, because it groaned under the ruthless and hypocritic
                    tyranny of Idumaean usurpers.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile the religious condition of the world and of the nation was no less
                    unsatisfactory. Throughout the Roman empire the belief in the popular mythology
                    had died away, and, while a few of the noblest spirits took refuge in the hard
                    and despairing dogmas of Stoicism, the mass of the people was plunged in
                    practical atheism or abject superstition. Such religion as there was among the
                    people usually took the form of Egyptian and Phrygian worships, which were often
                    connected with the vilest immorality. In Judaea the dominant religion consisted
                    in scrupulous devotion to the petty external ordinances of the oral law.</p>
                <p>Thus at the epoch of Christ’s birth the heathen world had sunk into practical
                    atheism, and the Jewish world was deeply corroded by formalism and hypocrisy. In
                    the heathen world religion had almost ceased to exist; in the Jewish world it
                    was tainted at its source.</p>
                <p>It was no doubt due to the darkness of the religious and political horizon, and
                    to the sense of despair and weariness which was prevalent in the hearts alike of
                    Jews and Gentiles, that the Messianic hope, fostered by generations of prophets,
                    gained a powerful hold on the hearts of all sincere Israelites, and even found
                    its expression in secular literature. Virgil, Tacitus, and Suetonius, no less
                    than Josephus, show that the thoughts of the civilized world were turned to the
                    East in expectation of some great deliverer. But the character of their hope was
                    utterly mistaken. Overlooking the prophetic passages which told of a suffering
                    Messiah, a servant of Jehovah, who should bear the sorrows of His people, the
                    Jews were anticipating the advent of some temporal sovereign who would rule
                    their enemies with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like a potter’s
                    vessel, while He raised Israel to the summit of earthly prosperity and
                    luxury.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Bartolocci,

                    Josephus to pretend that he found a fulfilment of the Messianic prophecies in
                    the elevation to the empire of Vespasian, the bourgeois soldier who had crushed
                    his country under the iron heel of the Roman legionaries.</p>
                <p>At this time of extreme trouble and expectation the Baptist began his preaching.
                    It was confessedly preparatory. The coming of the Messiah was always declared to
                    depend on the “righteousness” of the nation, that is—in ordinary Jewish
                    phraseology—their rigid observance of the Mosaic law. But John saw that what was
                    needful was morality, not legalism, and his cry “Repent ye, for the kingdom of
                    heaven is at hand,” was explained to each of the great classes which applied to
                    him for advice by practical directions as to their daily duties. John created an
                    intense though transitory impression by his dress and appearance, which recalled
                    the memory of ancient prophets, and specially of Elijah, and still more by the
                    burning sincerity and reality of a style of teaching which presented so strong a
                    contrast to the ordinary teaching of the scribes. He adopted the rigid seclusion
                    and asceticism of the Essenes, and his language rang with denunciations clothed
                    in the imagery of the desert. Refusing all the titles which the people wished to
                    force upon him, he described himself as “a voice of one crying in the
                    wilderness,” and announced the coming of one greater than himself, who would
                    found <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n692/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0692-0663"/> the kingdom which he only announced. The
                    submission to the simple rite of baptism, a rite already familiar to the Jews in
                    the admission of proselytes, was the only sign of the acceptance of his mission
                    which he required; and the multitudes were so deeply moved by his preaching that
                    they thronged to be baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins. It was in
                    order to receive this baptism, and to ratify the mission of the great
                    forerunner, that Jesus left the deep provincial seclusion in which He had
                    hitherto lived. The stainless personality of his Kinsman overawed the bold and
                    mighty spirit of the desert preacher. He shrank from baptizing one in whom he at
                    once recognized that “royalty of inward happiness,” and purity of sinless life,
                    which he could not himself claim. Jesus, however, though He had no sins to
                    confess, bade John to baptize Him, “for thus it becometh us,” He said, “to
                    fulfil all righteousness.” He received the baptism, as a representative of the
                    people whom He came to save, as a beautiful symbol of moral purification, and as
                    the fit inauguration of a ministry which came not to destroy the law but to
                    fulfil. And during the baptism John saw the overshadowing radiance and heard the
                    voice from heaven which revealed to him that the promised Messiah had now come,
                    and that this Messiah was the Son of God.</p>
                <p>After this great crisis, which finally closed the private period of the life of
                    Jesus, He was “driven” by the spirit into the wilderness for His mysterious
                    temptation. The details of what occurred could of course only have been derived
                    from what He Himself made known to His apostles. What is clear is that in that
                    region of Quarantania, in the desert of Jericho, He was divinely strengthened
                    for this mission by victoriously wrestling with every suggestion of the powers
                    of evil which could have altered the character of His work. Although this was
                    not His only temptation<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Luke iv. 13; John vii. 4; Heb. ii. 10, 18, iv. 15.</p></note>, it was
                    evidently the most deadly. The first temptation appealed subtly and powerfully
                    to the exhaustion of His physical nature; the second to spiritual pride, as it
                    would have been manifested by an unwarranted challenge of the providence of God;
                    the third to unhallowed personal ambition. In the two greatest temptations of
                    His life— in the wilderness and at Gethsemane—He was tempted both positively and
                    negatively,—positively by allurements to a lower line of action, and negatively
                    by the seductive pleas which would have drawn Him aside from the path of
                    suffering. But He won the perfect victory because temptation never passed into
                    even the thought of sin, but was so wrestled with and overcome that it made no
                    determining impression upon His heart.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>After this victory over the power of evil, Jesus returned to the fords of Jordan.
                    It will not of course be possible or needful to dwell on the narratives of His
                    ministry in all their details; but, since these narratives are confessedly
                    fragmentary, we shall endeavour to furnish from the four Gospels in rapid
                    outline a sketch of the general events of His ministry before touching upon its
                    eternal significance. The events described in the Gospels are often grouped
                    together by subjective considerations, and it was the evident object of St John
                    to dwell preponderantly on the Judaean ministry, and on those discourses which
                    brought out the deeper and more mysterious side of the being of Christ, while
                    the Synoptists chiefly describe the work in Galilee, and preserve what may be
                    called the more exoteric discourses. The combination of these disintegrated
                    records into one harmonious and consecutive whole is a task which can never be
                    accomplished with absolute certainty; but it is possible, without a single
                    arbitrary conjecture, to construct a continuous narrative which shall simply
                    follow the indication of our authorities without doing violence to them in any
                    instance. In this scheme the ministry of Christ falls into the following epochs
                    :—(1) the early scenes <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> narrated by St John alone,
                    until the beginning of the public preaching in Galilee; (2) the Galilaean
                    ministry till the murder of the Baptist; (3) the period of decided opposition;
                    (4) the period of flight and peril until the final farewell to Galilee; (5) from
                    the great journey to Jerusalem till the retirement to Ephraim; (6) from this
                    retirement to the Passover; (7) the last supper, passion, trial, and
                    crucifixion; (8) the resurrection and ascension.</p>
                <p>(1) The scenes of the first period are related by St John with a beauty and
                    simplicity which can only be called idyllic. He tells us how the Baptist, on the
                    banks of the Jordan, saw Jesus pass by, and exclaimed, in language of deep
                    significance, “Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world !”
                    Whether the prominent thought in the Baptist’s mind was the paschal lamb, or the
                    lamb of morning and evening sacrifice, or the lamb which Isaiah and Jeremiah had
                    used as an emblem of patient and suffering innocence, it is clear that in the
                    spirit of prophecy he saw in Jesus one who was predestined to a life of sorrows
                    which should be for the salvation of the world. The next day the Baptist
                    repeated the same emphatic testimony in the presence of two Galilaean youths, St
                    Andrew and St John, who were so deeply impressed by it that they followed Jesus,
                    saw Him in the place where He was then dwelling, and became His first disciples.
                    Andrew then brought to Jesus his brother Simon, who also recognized in Him the
                    promised Messiah. Three days afterwards Jesus called Philip, another young
                    fisherman of Galilee, who in his turn brought to Jesus his friend Nathanael, the
                    guileless Israelite who is known in the Gospels as Bartholomew, or the son of
                    Tholmai. Accompanied by these pure and warmhearted young men, and also by His
                    mother, Jesus was a guest at the simple wedding feast of Cana in Galilee, at
                    which He first displayed His possession of supernatural power by turning the
                    water into wine. Then, after a brief stay at Capernaum, He went to the Passover
                    at Jerusalem. His first visit to the temple as a recognized teacher was
                    signalized by an authoritative Messianic act. He cleansed the temple of its mean
                    and desecrating traffic, although neither priests nor Pharisees nor the Roman
                    authorities had ever taken a step in that direction. When His right to act thus
                    was challenged, He answered in mysterious words, of which the meaning was not
                    thoroughly understood till long afterwards, “Destroy this temple, and in three
                    days I will raise it up ”—speaking of the spiritual temple of His body.<note

                    words created so deep an impression that after being distorted both in form and
                    meaning they formed one of the chief charges against Him at His trial. Even at
                    this early phase of His work Jesus touched the heart and won the secret
                    allegiance of Nicodemus, with whom He held at night the memorable discourse on
                    the new birth. But He was met from the first by such signs of opposition that He
                    went with His disciples into Judaea, and there allowed them to baptize. The work
                    of the Baptist was not yet over, and, until it was, Jesus both permitted the
                    disciples to adopt the symbol of purification which had been used by His
                    forerunner, and Himself similarly preached “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is
                    at hand.” Some Jew<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mere
                    ’Ιουδαίου is the true reading in John iii. 25.</p></note> raised a discussion
                    with the disciples of John about purification, and they in their perplexity and
                    jealousy applied to their great master with the complaint that his ministry was
                    being eclipsed by that of Him whom he had baptized beyond Jordan. John, with
                    noble self-suppression, pointed out that he must <pb break="no"

                    he was thrown into prison by Herod Antipas. In consequence of this event Jesus
                    withdrew into Galilee. He chose the route through Samaria, and it was to a poor
                    frail woman by Jacob’s well that He seems first to have distinctly revealed His
                    Messiahship. His acceptance of the invitation of the Samaritans to stay a few
                    days with them was a rebuke to the spirit of fanatical hatred and exclusiveness,
                    which in that day so filled the minds of His countrymen that they regarded any
                    intercourse with Samaritans as involving pollution.</p>
                <p>(2) Although Jesus was aware that a prophet is often least known in his own
                    country and among his own kindred, He made His way, preaching as He went in
                    various synagogues, direct to Nazareth.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Luke iv. 15.</p></note> There, in the synagogue, He read
                    aloud part of Isaiah lxi,, and amid deep silence applied it to Himself. But He
                    had not proceeded far when the spell of His divine teaching was broken by the
                    pride and ignorance of the Naz Irenes, who began to murmur among themselves
                    about His humble birth and occupation, and to demand that He should do some deed
                    of power among them. It was on His reminding them that Elijah and Elisha had
                    wrought their miracles of healing upon strangers that they rose in fury, and
                    dragged Him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built. Something,
                    however, in the majesty of His bearing seems to have created in their minds a
                    supernatural awe, so that, as on later occasions, He was able “to pass through
                    the midst of them, and go on His way.” To the place of His birth He seems never
                    to have returned.</p>
                <p>From this time His home, so far as He could in any sense be said to have a home,
                    was at the bright little city of Capernaum on the shores of the Sea of Galilee,
                    to which, perhaps in consequence of the churlishness of the Nazarenes, His
                    mother and brethren also migrated. At this point begins the period of His
                    brightest activity, the year which was in a pre-eminent sense “the acceptable
                    year of the Lord.” The scene of that ministry was mainly the beautiful and
                    populous plain of Gennesaret through which passed “the way of the sea,” the
                    great caravan road which led to Damascus. It was the manufacturing district of
                    Palestine, thronged by men of all nationalities, and therefore pre-eminently
                    suited for the proclamation of the kingdom. At the same time it was a scene of
                    infinite charm, and the opportunities of sailing from place to place, and of
                    earning a livelihood, which were afforded by the inland lake, rendered it
                    specially appropriate. On the way to Capernaum Jesus healed by His word the son
                    of the courtier of Herod,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Not improbably Chuza, Herod’s steward, whose wife Joanna was one of the

                    house. Much of the brief story of the Gospels is made up of the records of
                    single days which stood out with marked prominence. One such day was the first
                    Sabbath at Capernaum. Christ began with a sermon in the synagogue, during which
                    He wrought one of His great exorcisms on a raving demoniac who was present in
                    the audienc ∙. Retiring to the house of Peter, He healed Peter’s mother-in-law
                    of a fever, and at sunset, when the Sabbath ended, wrought many cures upon a
                    multitude of sufferers. The fame of this day rang even to Syria, and, finding
                    that even temporary seclusion was now impossible, Jesus went from village to
                    village preaching the kingdom of God.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Three such circuits in Galilee are faintly traceable; but it

                    publican was the next to “leave all” and follow Christ. The choice of the full
                    number of twelve to be apostles took place just before the sermon on the mount,
                    and nothing can more decisively show the wisdom and insight of Jesus than the
                    fact that among the twelve were characters so opposite as a zealot and a
                    publican. Judas, the “man of Kerioth,” was probably the only Judaean in the
                    little band of Galilaeans. The great discourse known as the Sermon on the Mount
                    was delivered primarily to the disciples, but was intended also for the
                    multitude. The hill by the Galilaean lake<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    tone of the sermon, with its vivid illustrations and divine idealism, produced a
                    very deep and wide impression. The inauguration of the doctrine was followed by
                    deeds of mercy and power. From this time He was constantly surrounded by
                    thronging multitudes, and was constantly appealed to for miracles of compassion.
                    We are told in quick succession of the healing of a leper by a touch, of the
                    centurion’s servant by a word, and the raising from the dead of the widow’s son
                    at Nain; and so incessant was His activity that His mother and His brethren
                    began to be alarmed. Soon after the miracle at Nain He received the deputation
                    from John the Baptist, then in his gloomy prison at Machaerus, to ask whether He
                    were indeed the Messiah. He bade the messengers take back no other answer than
                    the works which they had witnessed or heard, and pre-eminent among them was the
                    preaching the gospel to the poor. It was after their departure that He
                    pronounced the unequalled eulogy on John as the greatest of the prophets, while
                    yet “the least in the kingdom of heaven” was, in spiritual privileges, greater
                    than He. It was in this discourse that He contrasted the glad and natural
                    geniality of His own example —as one who came “eating and drinking ”—with the
                    asceticism and gloom of the Baptist. He never refused the invitations even of
                    the Pharisees, and it was at the banquet of a Pharisee named Simon that He
                    accepted the pathetic devotion of the “woman that was a sinner” (whom Christian
                    tradition persistently identifies with Mary of Magdala), and rebuked the haughty
                    and untender formalism of His host. His life during this period, as He wandered
                    about Gennesaret and its vicinity, preaching to rejoicing crowds, was a life of
                    poverty, toil, and simplicity, but it was also a life of exalted joy from the
                    rapturous gratitude of the people and the faith which enabled Him to work many
                    deeds of mercy among them. Of one episode of the period many details are
                    preserved. After one of the missionary tours in Galilee, Jesus, finding Himself
                    surrounded by a vast throng, began for the first time to preach to them in those
                    parables which were the most characteristic form of His subsequent teaching, and
                    which had the additional advantage of testing the moral and spiritual qualities
                    of His hearers. He began with the parable of the sower, and this method of
                    instruction naturally stimulated to such an extent the eagerness of His hearers
                    that He was kept teaching till evening came. A second ill-judged attempt of His
                    mother and brethren to control His proceedings probably combined with the sense
                    of deep weariness<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0694-0665"/> to create a desire for brief rest and retirement,
                    and He urged His disciples to a hasty departure to the lonelier eastern shores
                    of the lake. During the sail of about 6 miles there rose one of the violent
                    sudden storms to which the Sea of Galilee is specially liable. He was sleeping
                    on the leather cushion of the steersman the deep sleep of fatigue, which not
                    even the waves now dashing into the boat could disturb. The disciples woke Him
                    in wild alarm, and the calm majesty with which He hushed the storm made an
                    indelible impression on their minds. No sooner had they landed on the other side
                    than they were met by a naked and raving maniac, whose dwelling was in the tombs
                    which are still visible on the neighbouring hillsides. Jesus healed him, and (as
                    we are told in a narrative which evidently touches on things entirely beyond our
                    cognizance) suffered the demons to enter into a herd of swine hard by, which
                    immediately rushed violently over a steep place into the sea. The semi-heathen
                    inhabitants of the district, alarmed by His presence, and vexed at the loss of
                    their swine, entreated Him to depart out of their coasts. He granted their evil
                    petition, but left the healed demoniac to lead them to a better frame of mind.
                    The people on the other side recognized the sail of His returning vessel, and
                    were waiting in multitudes to meet Him. While preaching to them in a house at
                    Capernaum, the friends of a paralytic, who had been unable to get near Him for
                    the press, let down the sick man through the roof in front of Him, and He healed
                    him, exciting some murmurs from the Scribes, who had already begun to watch Him
                    with suspicion, by first using the formula “Thy sins are forgiven thee.” From
                    the house He adjourned to the shore, and after another brief time of teaching
                    there went to the farewell feast which Matthew gave to the “publicans and
                    sinners” who had been his friends. The Pharisees, afraid as yet to find fault
                    with Him directly, asked the disciples in great displeasure why their Master ate
                    with publicans and sinners, whose very touch they regarded as a pollution. The
                    answer of Jesus was given in the memorable quotation, to which He more than once
                    referred, “Go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy and not
                    sacrifice.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hos. vi.

                    pointing out to them that the glad initiation of the marriage feast of the

                    on an old garment. It seems to have been immediately after the banquet that He
                    received the heartrending appeal of Jairus that He would come and heal his
                    little daughter. On the way He healed the woman with the issue who secretly
                    touched the fringe of His garment.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>An interesting indication that he observed even the minute

                    the time He reached the house of Jairus the little maid was dead, and His three
                    most chosen disciples —Peter, James, and John—were alone admitted with the
                    father and mother to witness this second instance in which He recalled the dead
                    to life.</p>
                <p>It was probably at this point of the ministry that there occurred the visit to
                    that unnamed feast at Jerusalem,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>John V. 1.</p></note> which was almost certainly the Feast
                    of Purim. Perhaps with a view to this absence from Galilee He sent out the
                    twelve, two and two, to preach and perform works of mercy in His name, sending
                    them “like lambs among wolves,” and bidding them set the example of the most
                    absolute contentment and simplicity. During His visit to Jerusalem, where—as we
                    learn from St John, whose facts are incidentally confirmed by allusions in the
                    Synoptists—He had many friends and followers, He healed the impotent man at the
                    Pool of Bethesda, and excited the bitter enmity of the Jews by deliberately
                    ignoring the exaggerated minutiae of the traditional law which made them regard
                    it as a heinous crime to carry even the smallest burden on the Sabbath. The
                    simple command to the healed man to take up the mat on which he lay and walk
                    aroused the Jews to fury; and from that incident, as St John expressly tells us,
                    the overt persecution of Jesus began.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>John V. 16.</p></note> He seems to have been summoned before
                    some committee of the Sanhedrin, but on this occasion they did not dare to
                    punish His violation of their traditions, and on the contrary had to listen in
                    unavailing wrath, not only to His irresistible defence of what He had done on
                    the Sabbath, but to Divine claims which they declared to be blasphemy. They did
                    not dare to touch Him, knowing His power with the people, but from that day the
                    leading authorities of Jerusalem seem to have determined on His death, and their
                    hostility was so bitter and persistent that He left Jerusalem without waiting
                    for the approaching Passover.</p>
                <p>(3) It was from this moment that the period of determined opposition began.
                    Hitherto the local Pharisees and Scribes of Galilee might disapprove and murmur,
                    but they had not dared to set themselves in distinct and public antagonism
                    against Him. They were now encouraged to do so by the fact that the leading
                    authorities of the capital had repudiated His claims. The high priests and
                    Pharisees even sent some of their number to act as spies upon His words and
                    actions, and see how they might contrive occasions for His ruin. He returned to
                    Galilee with the full knowledge that His human day was beginning to fade into
                    evening, and that the sentence of violent death hung over Him. It was at this
                    solemn time that the murder of John thrilled men’s hearts with horror. Jesus
                    retired with the disciples to a desert plain near the town at the northern end
                    of the lake known as Bethsaida Julias, which was in the dominion of the milder
                    Philip, and beyond the jurisdiction of the blood-stained Antipas. Even to this
                    retirement, however, the multitude followed Him, and here it was that, moved
                    with deep compassion, He fed the five thousand with five barley loaves and two
                    small fishes. Then urging the departure of His disciples by boat to Capernaum,
                    He dismissed the multitude in the gathering dusk, and at last fled from
                    thence<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>K (Vulg. ) <hi
                    rend="italic">φfiyeι,</hi> John vi. 22.</p></note> to the top of a neighbouring
                    hill where He spent the night in prayer. During the night a terrible storm
                    arose, and He came to His disciples walking upon the sea, and rescued St Peter
                    as with a half faith he endeavoured to meet Him on the water. The next day at
                    Capernaum He uttered that memorable discourse about Himself as the bread of
                    life, and the necessity of “eating the flesh of the Son of Man and drinking His
                    blood,” which was expressly designed to dissipate idle chiliastic and material
                    delusions, and to test the sincerity of a spiritual faith. The discourse created
                    deep discontent, and from that time many forsook Him. He even foresaw that one
                    of His chosen apostles was “a devil”; but Peter spoke the conviction of the rest
                    in the noble words, “Lord, to whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal
                    life.”</p>
                <p>But henceforth opposition became more marked and more fearless. It had already
                    been stirred up in the hearts of all Jewish formalists by His claiming to
                    forgive sins, by His disapproval of asceticism, by His intercourse with
                    publicans and sinners. It gathered force from His consistent depreciation of the
                    petty traditional superstitions which had degraded the Sabbath from a delight
                    and a blessing into a mere fetish of servitude. When the incident at Bethesda
                    had attracted the notice of the Sanhedrin, the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n695/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0695-0666"/> Pharisaic spies from Jerusalem especially watched
                    His Sabbath proceedings. Again and again their hatred was kindled on this point.
                    Now they indignantly challenged the conduct of the hungry disciples for plucking
                    ears of corn and rubbing them in their hands on the Sabbath day; on another
                    occasion they attacked Him for healing on the Sabbath day the man with the
                    withered hand, and later on for healing the bowed woman, and the blind man at
                    Jerusalem. On each of these occasions He exposed with irresistible demonstration
                    their inconsistency and hypocrisy, but thereby only deepened their anger against
                    Him. On other occasions He came into violent collision with their whole system
                    of traditional ceremonialism by pouring contempt on their superfluous and
                    meaningless ablutions, by showing how comparatively meaningless was their
                    scrupulosity about clean and unclean meats, and generally by denouncing the
                    spirit which had led them to place the cumbrous pettinesses of their oral law
                    above the word of God and the inmost spirit of all true religion. The rage of
                    His Pharisaic opponents culminated on one day of open and final rupture between
                    Himself and the spies of the Sanhedrin. Finding Him standing in silent prayer,
                    the disciples had asked Him to teach them to pray, and in reply He had taught
                    them “the Lord’s prayer,” and told them, in such accents as man had never heard
                    before, about the fatherhood of God, and the consequent efficacy of prayer.
                    Shortly afterwards He had wrought one of His most marvellous cures upon a poor
                    wretch who was at once blind, dumb, and mad. The Pharisees felt bound to check
                    the astonished admiration which this act had once more excited, and with
                    impotent and stupid malignity had tried to teach their followers that He cast
                    out devils by Beelzebub the prince of the devils. This blasphemous folly had
                    drawn down upon their heads words of rebuke more intense and stern than they had
                    ever heard. Such words, addressed to men accustomed to unbounded admiration as
                    infallible teachers, aroused them to the deadliest hostility, and they soon
                    found a weapon of annoyance and injury by demanding on every possible occasion
                    that “sign from heaven” which Jesus always refused to give. Their exacerbation
                    seems to have alarmed His mother and brethren into the third of their ill-timed
                    interferences, which Jesus had once more to check by declaring that the day had
                    now come on which human relationships were as nothing compared to the spiritual.
                    The time for the mid-day meal had now arrived, and Jesus accepted, though it
                    seems to have been given in no good spirit, the invitation of a Pharisee to
                    break bread in his house. On entering He at once sat down at table, since it was
                    but a brief and trivial meal, perhaps of bread and fruits, and the multitude
                    were waiting outside to hear the word of God. Instantly He recognized that He
                    was alone in the midst of enemies, and, moved to deep indignation by their
                    hypocrisy and baseness, He delivered a terrible denunciation of the whole system
                    and religion of the legalists and Pharisees. The feast broke up in confusion,
                    and the guests began to surround Jesus with vehement, taunting, and threatening
                    demonstrations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Luke xi.
                    53.</p></note> Passing from amongst them He found the multitude actually
                    treading on each other in their haste and eagerness, and perhaps it was to their
                    presence that He owed His safety. He preached to them a sermon, characterized
                    throughout by the deep emotions by which His spirit had been agitated, of which
                    the main topic was the awful peril of hypocrisy and greed; and then—as though
                    some solemn agony had passed over His spirit—He warned them of the signs of the
                    times, and of the awful consequences of rejecting His teaching.</p>
                <p>(4) With that day of conflict ended the second and darker stage of His work in
                    Galilee. The remainder of His life was mainly passed in flight, in peril, and in
                    concealment, only broken by brief occasional appearances in Galilee and
                    Jerusalem. He departed from Capernaum, and went into the heathen region of Tyre
                    and Sidon. But few particulars of this period are recorded. Somewhere in those
                    regions He tested the strong faith of the Syro-Phcenician woman, and healed her
                    demoniac daughter. From Tyre and Sidon He wandered southwards again, keeping
                    mainly to the eastward and less inhabited region, only now and then healing a
                    sufferer, but gradually attracting crowds once more. Somewhere on the Peraean
                    side of the lake He fed the four thousand. After this period of wandering and
                    absence He once more sailed to Magdala, but was met immediately by the ominous
                    conjunction of Herodians and Pharisees with their hostile demand for a sign.
                    Turning away from them, He uttered His last sad farewell and prophecy to the
                    cities in which He had laboured, and once more journeyed northwards. During this
                    journey they came near to Caesarea Philippi, and, after standing in silent
                    prayer, He asked His disciples “Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?” The
                    sorrowful confession had to be made that, though they recognized Him as a
                    prophet, they had not recognized Him as the Messiah. Then came the momentous
                    question, which was to test how much of His task was accomplished in the hearts
                    of those apostles whose training had now for some time been His principal work,
                    “But whom say ye that I am ?” Then it was that Peter won the immortal glory of
                    giving that which has thenceforth been the answer of all the Christian world,
                    “Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God.” That answer is the
                    inauguration, in human convictions, of Christianity and of Christendom; and it
                    was rewarded by the promise of the power of the keys, and the power to bind and
                    loose, and the foundation of the Christian church upon a rock. Whatever may be
                    the difficulties of the passage, we see that Jesus meant to confer on His church
                    the teaching power of which the key was the symbol, the power of legislative
                    action indicated by binding and loosing, and the prophetic insight on which
                    depended the ability to absolve in God’s name. But to obviate all delusions He
                    at once revealed to them the dark abyss of suffering down which He had first to
                    tread; and, as though to prove how little claim His words gave to sacerdotal
                    usurpations, He proceeded to rebuke in the sternest words the presumption of
                    Peter, who ventured to set aside His predictions as to His coming sufferings and
                    death. It was six days after this that He took the three most chosen apostles
                    with Him up the snowy slopes of Hermon, where they witnessed the
                    transfiguration, as though to strengthen their faith in the dark hours to come.
                    On descending the hill, He healed the demoniac boy whom the apostles had vainly
                    tried to help, and built on this exorcism the lesson of faith which He was never
                    weary of inculcating on His followers. Having now reached the northern limit of
                    the Holy Land, He turned His footsteps southwards by the most secluded paths,
                    omitting no opportunity to train the apostles, now teaching them humility by the
                    example of a little child, and now warning them by significant parables of the
                    need of self-sacrifice and of the spirit of forgiveness.</p>
                <p>(5) At the ensuing Feast of Tabernacles we find Him once more at Jerusalem, where
                    He appeared suddenly in the temple. St John records His teachings, drawn from
                    the various incidents of the feast, and also the divided opinions of the people,
                    and the almost unanimous opposition of the ruling classes. This visit to the
                    Holy City was marked by the incident of the woman taken in adultery, in which He
                    showed such sovereign wisdom and tenderness, and by the Sabbatarian disputes
                    which arose from the healing of the blind man. On one occasion Jesus had to
                    leave the temple amid a burst of fury in which the Jews threatened <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n696/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0696-0667"/> to stone Him, and when He left Jerusalem it was
                    under the direct ban of excommunication. Under these circumstances He returned
                    for one more brief visit to Galilee. The news which He received of the murder of
                    some Galilaeans in the temple by Pilate, and of Herod’s designs against His
                    safety, show how surrounded by perils was His human life. But He now calmly
                    ended His work in Galilee by the mission of seventy disciples to prepare for His
                    great last journey southwards. His words of farewell to the cities which had
                    rejected Him were full of sadness and solemnity, as He started from the land
                    which had refused His mission to the city in which He was to be crucified.</p>
                <p>We now enter on the last great phase of His work, the incidents of His final
                    journey and the close of His ministry. First He was refused shelter by the rude
                    villagers of En-gannim, and had to change his route. Next cam⅞ the healing of
                    the ten lepers, of whom but one showed gratitude, and he was a Samaritan. The
                    Sabbath healings of the bowed woman and of the man with the dropsy are the two
                    chief miracles of the journey, during which He also delivered many most
                    memorable discourses, and some of His divinest parables—such as those of the
                    good Samaritan and the prodigal son. So we trace His steps to the house of
                    Martha and Mary at Bethany, and to Jerusalem, which He visited at the Feast of
                    the Dedication. His appearance in the temple was always the signal for the
                    fiercest opposition of Sadducees and Pharisees, who watched with jealousy and
                    hatred the eagerness of the multitude to hear Him. After serious conflicts He
                    retired to the other Bethany, beyond Jordan. Among the few recorded incidents of
                    His stay in Peraea are the attempts to entangle Him with Herod and the Jewish
                    schools by questions about divorce, the beautiful scene of blessing the little
                    children, and the discourse about riches on the occasion of the test which He
                    applied to the rich young ruler who “made the great refusal.” The death of
                    Lazarus summoned Him to Bethany, and the most signal miracle which He there
                    wrought by raising Lazarus from the dead excited such notice that the Sanhedrin
                    now met under the presidency of Caiaphas, and came* to the deliberate conclusion
                    that they must put Him to death, lest the populace should raise tumults on His
                    behalf which might precipitate the final intervention of Rome in the affairs of
                    their nation. But, as His time was not yet come, Jesus avoided the peril of
                    public arrest or private assassination by retiring to an obscure village called
                    Ephraim, on the edge of the wilderness.</p>
                <p>(6) He did not leave Ephraim till He could join the great caravan of Galilaean
                    pilgrims with whom He could proceed in safety to His last passover. His
                    apostles, both from His own warnings and from the visible grandeur of His
                    transfiguration of self-sacrifice, were well aware that a crisis of His career
                    had now arrived; and nothing can show more clearly the mistaken character of
                    their Messianic hopes than the fact that, though He now distinctly told them the
                    crowning horror that He should be crucified, the sons of Zebedee came with their
                    mother Salome to beg for places at His right hand and His left in His kingdom.
                    Jesus made their ambitious request a theme for rich and solemn teachings on the
                    beatitude of suffering for the cause of God and man. As they approached Jericho,
                    accompanied by excited multitudes, He healed the blind Bartimaeus, and in
                    Jericho He excited the murmurs of the crowd by accepting the hospitality of the
                    publican Zacchaeus. On the road between Jericho and Bethany He delivered the
                    parable of the pounds. He arrived at Bethany probably on Friday, Nisan 8, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a,u.c.</hi> 783 (March 31, 30 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi>
                    six days before the passover, and before the sunset had begun the Sabbath hours.
                    The Sabbath was spent in quiet. In the evening Martha and Mary gave him a
                    banquet in the house of Simon the leper, at which Mary, in her devotion and
                    gratitude, broke the alabaster of precious ointment over His head and feet, and
                    so awoke the deadly avarice of Judas that he seems on that very evening to have
                    communed with the Jewish priests for the paltry blood-money of thirty pieces of
                    silver (less than £4) for which he was willing to betray Him. On the morning of
                    Palm Sunday Jesus made His triumphant entry into Jerusalem amid the palm-waving
                    throngs, who shouted “Hosanna to the son of David,” and at the point of the road
                    where the city first bursts upon the view He paused to weep over it and prophesy
                    its doom. After once more cleansing the temple, and protecting from the anger of
                    the priests and Pharisees the children who still shouted Hosanna, He spoke to
                    Philip about the Greeks, (probably from Edessa) who wished to see Him, and,
                    strengthened by a voice from heaven, spent the rest of the day in teaching. At
                    evening He retired for safety with the twelve outside the city walls in the
                    direction of Bethany. On the Monday morning, as He went to Jerusalem, He
                    pronounced the symbolic doom upon the fig-tree which had only leaves. On
                    entering the temple He was met by a formidable deputation of priests, scribes,
                    and rabbis, who demanded “by what authority He was acting,” —a question which He
                    declined to answer until they proved their right to ask it, by giving a definite
                    opinion respecting the baptism of John. Their confession of inability to do this
                    was so marked a proof of their incompetence to claim the function of religious
                    teachers, that He refused to meet their challenge. The day may be called “a day
                    of parables,” for during His teaching He spoke the parables of the two sons, the
                    rebellious husbandmen, the builders and the corner stone, and the marriage of
                    the king’s son. These parables were so obviously aimed at the hypocrisy,
                    malevolence, and presumption of the Jewish authorities that fear alone
                    restrained them from immediately seizing Him. At evening He again retired from
                    the city. The next day, the Tuesday in Passion week, may be called the day of
                    temptations, for it was marked by three deliberate attempts to undermine His
                    authority by involving Him in some difficulty either with the rulers or the
                    people. In the morning walk to Jerusalem He taught to His disciples a lesson of
                    faith from the withered fig-tree. In the temple He was first met by the plot of
                    the Herodians and Pharisees to embroil Him either with the Romans or the
                    populace by a question as to the lawfulness of paying tribute, then by a piece
                    of poor casuistry on the part of the Sadducees concerning the resurrection, then
                    by the question of a Scribe as to the great commandment of the law. In each
                    instance the divine and ready wisdom of His answers not only entirely defeated
                    the stratagems of the Sanhedrists, but showed His immeasurable superiority to
                    them in knowledge and insight. Then, to prove how easily He might have turned
                    the tables on them, had He desired their humiliation, He exposed their complete
                    ignorance respecting the very subject on which they claimed the fullest
                    knowledge by reducing them to a confession of their inability to explain why
                    David in the spirit had given the name of Lord to the Messiah who was to be his
                    son. And then, knowing that the time had come when their degradation of religion
                    into a mere tyranny and semblance should be set forth, He delivered the terrible
                    denunciation which, with its eightfold “Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees,
                    hypocrites,” was intended to leave them utterly inexcusable. The Jewish
                    authorities felt that this was a final rupture, that they must now, at all
                    costs, bring about His immediate death.</p>
                <p>Before He left the temple for ever He taught the lesson of true charity as
                    illustrated by the widow’s mite, and then went and sat on the green slopes of
                    the Mount of Olives. There He pronounced to His disciples that great
                    eschatological discourse which was suggested by their admiration of the temnle.

                    Bethany, perhaps at the very time that Judas was arranging with the priests the
                    final details of His betrayal and arrest. The Wednesday was spent in deep
                    retirement at Bethany, and not a single word or incident is recorded on that
                    day. On the Thursday morning He woke never to sleep again.</p>
                <p>(7) On the evening of Thursday Jesus went with His disciples to Jerusalem to keep
                    that quasi-paschal feast at which He instituted the sacrament of the Eucharist.
                    Even then the apostles had jealousies about precedence, and it was to cure them
                    of their fatal tendency to selfish pride and ambition that He washed the
                    disciples’ feet. During the supper He first indicated to John, and through him
                    to Peter, that He knew who the traitor was. He clearly told them that this was
                    the last meal which He should eat with them, and bade them henceforth “eat bread
                    and drink wine” in sacramental memory of Him. It was after Judas had gone forth
                    into the night that He began those last discourses preserved for us by St John
                    alone, which are so “rarely mixed of sadness and joys, and studded with
                    mysteries as with emeralds.” There is a matchless beauty and tenderness in the
                    records of His gentle words of warning and help to Peter, Thomas, Philip, and
                    Jude, and of that familiar intercourse with his dearest followers, whose sinking
                    spirits He sustained by the promise of the Comforter. Then they sang a hymn,
                    probably the Psalm known to the Jews as the Great Hallel, and in the darkness
                    walked to the olive garden of Gethsemane, where Jesus passed through His hour of
                    mysterious agony and passion, while even His most beloved apostles could not
                    watch with Him. Then torches suddenly flashed upon the night as the traitor,
                    accompanied by priests and their servants, and Levites of the temple guard, and
                    Roman soldiers, made their way across the valley of the Kidron to the slope of
                    Olivet on which the garden lay. There Judas betrayed Him with a kiss; and, in
                    spite of the supernatural awe which His presence inspired even into His enemies,
                    He resigned Himself into their hands, rebuked the rash blow of Peter, and by one
                    last act of mercy healed the slight wound of Malchus. “Then all His disciples
                    forsook Him and fled.”</p>
                <p>(a) He was taken first to the astute and aged Annas, who was regarded as high
                    priest <hi rend="italic">de jure,</hi> though not <hi rend="italic">de
                    facto.</hi> From this time forward it was the priestly party—the Sadducees, not
                    the Pharisees—who were almost exclusively responsible for His death. On His
                    refusal to plead before this disorderly midnight tribunal, He was struck on the
                    mouth; and, failing to extort anything from Him, Annas sent Him bound across the
                    courtyard to his son-i∏Jaw Caiaphas, the <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> high
                    priest.</p>
                <p>(∕3) It was still night, and here took place the second irregular and illegal
                    trial, before His worst enemies among the priests and Sadducees. The false
                    witnesses who endeavoured to convict Him of having threatened to destroy the
                    temple failed, and He preserved unbroken silence until Caiaphas adjured PIim by
                    the living God to telΓ them whether He was the Messiah, the Son of God. In
                    answer to this appeal He said “I am,” and told them that they should see His
                    returnhereafter in the clouds. Then Caiaphas rent his robes with the'cry of
                    blasphemy, and tlιis committee of the Sanhedrin declared Him “guilty of
                    death.”</p>
                <p>(γ) After this second examination Jesus was remanded to the guardroom until break
                    of day, before which time the whole Sanhedrin could not meet. As He was led past
                    the brazier in the courtyard, His one glance broke into penitence the heart of
                    His backsliding apostle, who had just denied Him with oaths. As He waited, He
                    was insulted by the coarse derision and brutal violence of the priestly menials.
                    When the Sanhedrin met, they once more entirely failed to fix any charge upon
                    Him, until He renewed in their presence His claim to be the Son of God. He was
                    then formally condemned to death, and underwent a second derision at the hands
                    of the assembled elders. It was after this condemnation that remorse seized the
                    dark soul of Judas. He flung down the blood-money before his tempters, and with
                    an agonized confession of guilt rushed out to his terrible suicide.</p>
                <p>At this period the Jews had lost all legal right to put any one to death, and
                    they were further anxious to avoid personal responsibility, and danger of
                    vengeance from the followers of Jesus, by handing Him over for execution to the
                    Roman procurator. Accordingly they led Him bound to Pilate in imposing
                    procession. They were, however, mistaken in supposing that Pilate would crucify
                    Jesus at their bare word without seeing whether He was guilty; and, as they
                    could not enter the Herodian palace, in ∖γhich the Gentile ruler lived, without
                    pollution, which would have prevented them from partaking in the passover that
                    evening, Pilate went out to them. In every line of the brief colloquy which
                    ensued we trace the haughty contempt of the Roman, and the burning hatred of the
                    Jews. Failing to arrive at any definite charge, Pilate questioned Jesus alone
                    inside the praetorium, and after a brief examination came out to the Jews with
                    the declaration of complete acquittal.</p>
                <p>In the wild clamour which ensued he caught the word Galilee, and, understanding
                    that Jesus had chiefly taught in Galilee, eagerly seized the opportunity of
                    getting rid of the matter by sending Him to Herod. But before Herod as before
                    Pilate Jesus retained His majestic silence, and, unable to condemn Him, Herod
                    contented himself with arraying Him in a white festive robe, setting Him at
                    nought with his myrmidons, and sending Him back with a second practical
                    acquittal to the procurator.</p>
                <p>Then, in three stages, began the third and most agonizing phase of the public
                    trial. Pilate, seated on his bema upon the marble pavement, declared that, as
                    His innocence was now certain, He would merely scourge and dismiss Him. It was a
                    disgraceful proposal, due partly to his desire to save the life of one whom he
                    saw to be innocent, but dictated by fear of a new riot. Further than this, the
                    warning of his wife, and the awful majesty of the sufferer, had created a strong
                    presentiment in Pilate’s mind. But his actions were practically controlled by
                    the past guilt which made him tremble at the thought of the complaints which
                    Jews, Samaritans, and Galilaeans could alike prefer against him. He did not
                    therefore venture to refuse the cry of the mob—hounded on as they were by the
                    priests and Sanhedrists—for the passover boon of having a prisoner liberated to
                    them;. and he vainly tried to induce them to ask for the liberation of Jesus.
                    They demanded the rebel and murderer Bar Abbas, and began to shout for the
                    crucifixion of Jesus. Bar Abbas was set free, and Jesus underwent the horrible
                    Roman scourging, which was followed by the ruthless mockery of the soldiers, who
                    arrayed Him in an old crimson robe and placed a crown of thorns on His head, and
                    a reed in his hand as a sceptre, and so paid Him mock homage as a king of the
                    Jews.</p>
                <p>When He came forth after this hour of agony, Pilate made one more appeal to their
                    compassion in the words “Behold the man !” and on hearing that He claimed to be
                    “a Son of God ”—for since the charge of treason had broken down, the priests now
                    substituted for it a charge of blasphemy—he became still more alarmed, and once
                    more questioned Jesus in a private interview. For some time Jesus would not
                    speak. When He did, it was to say that He regarded Pilate as less guilty than
                    the Jews. As Pilate led Him forth, and saw Him stand before that shameful
                    yelling multitude in His majesty of solemn woe, he broke forth into the
                    involuntary exclamation, “Behold your King !” That word raised among the
                    multitude some <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n698/mode/1up"

                    after publicly washing his hands, in token that he was innocent of this death,
                    pronounced the fatal order for His crucifixion.</p>
                <p>Jesus was then clad in His own garments and led forth with two robbers to be
                    crucified. As He was unable to bear the weight of His cross, Simon of Cyrene was
                    impressed for that service. On His way Jesus gently consoled the weeping
                    daughters of Jerusalem, and, when they reached the fatal spot of Golgotha, He
                    refused the stupefying potion which was offered to Him, and prayed for His
                    murderers even as they drove the nails through His hands. Pilate managed to
                    insult the Jews by putting over the cross the title “The King of the Jews,” in
                    three languages, which thus in the presence of the vast passover multitude
                    testified to the truth. On the cross Jesus hung for three hours in agony. The
                    soldiers parted His garments, and cast lots for His seamless robe. The mob, the
                    priests, even the crucified malefactors, joined in taunting Him. But He answered
                    not. After His prayer for His murderers He only spoke to promise paradise to the
                    penitent robber; to assign His mother to the care of the beloved disciple; to ’
                    quote in the lowest depth of His agony the first words of the 22d Psalm; to give
                    vent to the sole expression of physical anguish which He uttered, “I thirst”; to
                    commend His spirit into His Father’s hands; and lastly, in the one victorious
                    word T∈τ∈λeσταt, “it is finished,” to end His work on earth. The bearing of
                    Jesus on the cross, together with the circumstances which accompanied the
                    crucifixion—the darkness, earthquake, and rending of the temple veil—produced a
                    deep impression even on the mind of the heathen centurion. They so powerfully
                    affected the multitude that they returned to Jerusalem wailing and beating on
                    their breasts, at once with a feeling of guilt and a presentiment of future
                    retribution.</p>
                <p>(8) At evening the soldiers despatched the two crucified robbers by breaking
                    their legs, in order that their bodies might be removed before the passover. But
                    they found Jesus already dead, and the certainty of His death was assured by one
                    of the soldiers driving his spear into the region of the heart, whence came out
                    blood and water. As very little time was left before the sunset marked the
                    beginning of the Sabbath, and rendered labour impossible, the body of Jesus was
                    hastily buried by Nicodemus and by Joseph of Arimathaea, who had obtained the
                    requisite permission. They wrapped it in fine linen and spices, and laid it in
                    the rockhewn garden-grave of Joseph, rolling a great stone to the aperture,
                    which was further guarded by soldiers sent by the Jews to prevent its re'moval
                    for purposes of fraud. This was on Friday evening. Very early on the morning of
                    Sunday, while it was yet dark, the two Marys were met at the sepulchre by a
                    vision of angels which announced His resurrection. Of that resurrection, in
                    spite of their original doubts and misgivings, the whole body of the disciples
                    became unalterably convinced, and on their unalterable conviction, and the
                    subsequent witness of history to the blessed truth of their doctrines, has
                    rested in·great measure the belief of the Christian church. Uniting the
                    contemporary testimony of St Paul, who must have been in personal communication
                    with many of the five hundred witnesses to whose evidence he appeals, with those
                    of the Gospels, we find ten recorded appearances :—(1) to Mary Magdalene (John
                    xx. 17); (2) to other women (Matt, xxviii. 9, 10); (3) to Peter (Luke xxiv. 34;
                    1 Cor. xv. 5); (4) to the two disciples on their way to Emmaus (Luke xxiv.
                    13-32); (5) to the ten apostles. All these appearances occurred on the first
                    Easter day. On the following Sunday Jesus appeared (G) to the eleven apostles,
                    Thomas having been absent on the previous occasion. He further appeared (7) to
                    seven apostles by the Sea of Galilee (John xxi. 1-24); (8) to more than five
                    hundred at once on a mountain in Galilee; (9) to James (1 Cor. xv. 3, 8); and
                    (10) at the ascension. These appearances continued for forty days. On the last
                    occasion Jesus led His disciples towards Bethany, gave them His last command,
                    blessed them, and as He blessed them passed away, and “a cloud received Him out
                    of their sight.”</p>
                <p>VΓ. Such, in briefest outline, are the main recorded events of the life of Jesus
                    Christ on earth. It only remains to say a few words concerning His person and
                    His work, regarded here in their historical rather than in their theological
                    aspect.</p>
                <p>As regards His person, Christians who accept the New Testament as the record of
                    inspired teaching, and who believe it to be evidenced, not only by inward and
                    supernatural revelation, but also by the subsequent history of the church and
                    the world, believe that Jesus Christ was (in the words of what is probably a
                    very ancient Christian hymn quoted by St Paul) the only begotten Son of God,
                    “manifest in the flesh, justified by the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto
                    the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory” <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tim. iii. 16.</p></note> and
                    as a part of this belief they hold that, just as Adam the first man was not born
                    but created, so the second Adam, who came to redeem our nature, was not born by
                    ordinary generation but was “incarnate by the Holy Ghost of the Virgin Mary.”
                    But even those who do not accept this faith see in Jesus a unique and sinless
                    personality, one with whom no other human being can even distantly be compared,
                    either in His character, His teaching, or the results which He accomplished by
                    His brief ministry. He taught but for three years, and not continuously even
                    during them. He accepted the most ordinary customs of the teachers of His day.
                    He wore no broad phylacteries like the Pharisees; He was not emaciated with
                    asceticism like the Essenes; He preached the kingdom of God, not, as John had
                    done, between the gloomy precipices of the wilderness, but from the homely
                    platform of the synagogue, to give the Midrash when the Torah had been
                    read.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Itausrath, <hi

                    should be paid to all the recognized rulers, whether heathen or Jewish, and even
                    to the religious teachers of the nation; He was obedient to the Mosaic law; His
                    followers were “unlearned and ignorant men” chosen from the humblest of the
                    people. Yet He has, as a simple matter of fact, altered the whole current of the
                    stream of history; He closed all the history of the past, and inaugurated all
                    the history of the future, and all the most brilliant and civilized nations of
                    the world worship Him as God. Kant testifies to His ideal perfection.<note

                <p>The transcendent power of His personality, which is betokened in such expressions
                    as those quoted above, is due, not only to His devotion and self-sacrifice, but
                    to His absolute sinlessness. This constitutes the unique character of His
                    individuality. He alone of mankind has claimed to be sinless, and has had the
                    claim granted by unanimous consent both in His lifetime and in subsequent ages.
                    He alone among men has never even been assailed by the breath of moral calumny,
                    and never even in His most sacred utterances and prayers betrayed the faintest
                    consciousness of any evil as present in His soul. He therefore alone has
                    furnished mankind with à perfect ideal; and, though no saint has ever even
                    distantly attained to the perfectness of that ideal, yet those who have done so
                    in greatest measure have always said that they have done so solely by the aid of
                    His grace, and the imitation of His example.</p>
                <p>Nor was His teaching less unique than His personality. It was marked by a tone of
                    sovereign authority; “Ye have heard that it was said—but I say unto you.” In
                    this it was the very opposite to the teaching of His own day and of centuries
                    afterwards, which relied exclusively upon precedent. It was also marked by
                    absolute originality. The test of its originality is the world’s acceptance of
                    it as specifically His. Isolated fragments of it may be compared with truths
                    uttered by others; but it stands alone in its breadth and in its power, in its
                    absence of narrow exclusiveness and scholastic system and abstract speculation.
                    It was fresh, simple, natural, abounding in illustrations at once the most
                    beautiful and the most intelligible, drawn from all the common sights and sounds
                    of nature, and all the daily incidents and objects of social and domestic life.
                    It flowed forth without reserve to all and on every fitting occasion,—on the
                    road, on the hillside, on the lake, or by the lonely well, or at the banquet
                    whether of the Pharisee or the publican. Expressed in the form of parables, it
                    has seized the imagination of mankind with a force and tenacity which is not
                    distantly approached even by the sacred writers, and even when not directly
                    parabolic it was so full of picturesqueness and directness that there is not one
                    recorded sentence of it which has not been treasured up in the memory of
                    mankind. His utterances not only rival and surpass all that preceded and all
                    that has followed them, but “they complement all beginnings.” Sometimes they
                    consist of short suggestive sayings (gnomes), full of depth, yet free from all
                    affectation or obscurity,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    make even what is most mysterious and spiritual humanly perceptible, throwing
                    over it the glamour both of poetry and. of a longing presentiment, and
                    incessantly enticing man towards something yet higher. There is never in them a
                    lurking fallacy nor a superfluous word, but all is “vivacity, nature,
                    intelligibility, directly enlightening grace,” intended only to convince and to
                    save. And while such was the incompar able form of His teaching, its force was
                    even more remarkable. It is all centred in the two great truths of the
                    Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man; from the former springs every
                    truth of theology, from the latter every application of morals. Judaism had sunk
                    into a religion of hatreds; the one message of Jesus was love. In this He
                    differs even from John the Baptist and the prophets. “Their emblem is the
                    storms, His the sun.”</p>
                <p>Once more,—as regards, the work of Jesus, the Christian believer contemplates it
                    in that aspect in which it is presented by St Paul as a work of atonement, the
                    redemption of a guilty race;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    done before or since. His doctrine purified the world from the loathly
                    degradation of lust and luxury into which society had fallen. By convincing men
                    of the inherent dignity of manhood, He added to the value of human life. He made
                    holiness a common possession. Heathen morality had reached its loftiest point in
                    the Stoic philosophy; but Stoicism was scornful, ineffectual, despairing, and
                    Christ gave a moral system infinitely more perfect, more hopeful, and more
                    tender to all mankind. To Him is alone due the Christian significance of such
                    words as charity, humility, and humanity. He first taught the sacredness of the
                    body as a temple of the Holy Ghost. He has inspired the aims of the noblest
                    culture, while at the same time He has restored the souls of men, and made the
                    care of the moral and spiritual being the supreme end of life. The gradual
                    emancipation of the world from the tyrannies of sensuality, cruelty, and serfdom
                    has been won step after step from His principles. The supremacy of the
                    spiritual, the solidarity of nations, the universality of God’s love, the
                    essential equality of all men in His sight, are but a few of the great and
                    fruitful conceptions which have sprung directly from His teaching, and which
                    still have an unexhausted force, to bring about, in ever-increasing measure, the
                    amelioration of the world.</p>
                <p>VII. It only remains to touch on the growth and progress of Christian doctrine
                    relative to the Person of Christ. It would have been impossible for the
                    Christian world to have drawn from the teaching of the apostles and evangelists
                    any other conclusion respecting Jesus than that He was more than man,—that He
                    was “God manifest in the flesh.” The Gospels spoke of His incarnation, His
                    sinlessness, His miraculous power, His claims far loftier than would have been
                    possible to simple man, His fearless conjunction of His own name with that of
                    the Eternal Creator. Alike the Gospels and the Epistles testify to His
                    pre-existence (Johni. 15, vi. 52, viii. 58), His eternal existence (1 Pet. iii.
                    18-20; Phil. ii. 6, 7; Rev. i. 11), His part in the creation of the world (Heb.
                    i. 11), His miracles of power; and they speak of Him in terms incompatible with
                    simple humanity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Col.

                    Christian, who accepted as divine revelations the writings of St John and of St
                    Paul, could possibly suppose that the Saviour, in whom he was taught to trust,
                    and into whose name he was baptized, was a mere human being like himself. And
                    yet, that Jesus was perfectly <hi rend="italic">human,</hi> as well as divine,
                    they could not for a single moment doubt. He was born of a woman. He grew like
                    other children. He suffered hunger, and thirst, and weariness, and pain, and
                    wounds, and death. He had flesh and bones like all other men, and passed through
                    the stages of life as others do. And His soul was a human soul no less than His
                    body was a human body, for He increased gradually in wisdom no less than in
                    stature; and felt sorrow and sympathy, and was*subject to temptation, and was
                    liable to the common emotions of our mortal nature.</p>
                <p>With these facts the earliest teachers of the church were content. When they had
                    asserted that Christ was both human and divine, “born and unborn, God in flesh,
                    life in death, born of Mary and born of God” (Iren., <hi rend="italic">Ep. ad
                    Ephes.,</hi> 7), they entered into no speculations respecting the mode and
                    definition of that union of natures. But such reticence soon became impossible.
                    The, doctrine of a God-man was openly assailed or secretly undermined by twofold

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0700-0671"/> forms of heresy—partly by Jewish Ebionites,
                    partly by Gentile Docetae. The Ebionites, the Nazarenes, the followers of
                    Artemon, the Alogi, and many sects allied to them in their main principle,
                    denied the tπιe divinity of Christ. In the opposite direction many of the
                    Gnostic sects entirely explained away His humanity, either with the Basilidians
                    supposing that He only became divine at His baptism, or holding with the
                    Valentiniane that Mary was only the channel by which He entered the world. To
                    both these conflicting fancies the orthodox fathers opposed the simple statement
                    of St John that “the Logos became flesh.” But, as was natural, their opinions
                    were as yet vague and even in some instances erroneous. Thus Justin Martyr
                    thought that in Christ the Logos took the place of the human intelligence <hi
                    rend="italic">{Apol. min.,</hi> ch. x.). Clement of Alexandria thought that the
                    human needs and sufferings were only apparent, or by way of “accommodation” <hi
                    rend="italic">{Paed.,</hi> i. 5, p. 112; <hi rend="italic">Strom.,</hi> vi. 9,
                    p. 775, ed. Sylb.). Origen had clearer views, and was the first to use the term
                    God-man <hi rend="italic">{θeavθpωπos),</hi> as well as to guard against the
                    double error of excluding the Logos from Christ, or of confounding the Logos
                    with the existence of the human Christ <hi rend="italic">{Hom. in Bzek.</hi>
                    iii. 3; <hi rend="italic">C. Cels.,</hi> iii. 29). It is, however, important to
                    observe that the existence of technical errors of theology in the modes of
                    expressing this doctrine adopted by the Ante-Nicene fathers was freely admitted,
                    and was not regarded as formal heresy. Their individual insight was not
                    sufficient to enable them to arrive at those careful scholastic definitions to
                    which the church was only guided by the collective wisdom of oecumenical
                    councils after periods of long and painful conflict. The remarks of St Jerome on
                    the real orthodoxy of the early fathers are both charitable and explicit. “It
                    may be,” he says, ‘ ‘ that they erred in simplicity, and that they wrote in
                    another sense, or that their writings were gradually corrupted by unskilful
                    transcribers; and, certainly, before Arius like ‘ the destruction that wasteth
                    at noonday ’ was born in Alexandria, they made statements incautiously which are
                    open to the misinterpretations of the perverse.” We find a remarkable
                    illustration of the extent to which the terminology was as yet unsettled in the
                    fact that the council at Antioch which condemned Paul of Samosata in 269 also
                    condemned the expression <hi rend="italic">homoousios</hi> ( “consubstantial ”),
                    which a century afterwards became the very watchword of Nicene orthodoxy.<note

                <p>By the 3d century the Ebionizing heresies were practically dead, but the Docetic
                    were still flourishing in various forms. Two sects had arisen; one was that of
                    the Patripassians, who so completely obliterated all real distinction between
                    the first and second person of the Trinity as to lay themselves open to the
                    charge of teaching that the Supreme Father had been crucified. Thus Praxeas
                    taught that the same God is at once the Father and Son. Noetus of Smyrna, when
                    banished from Ephesus, taught these notions at Rome, and even the Popes
                    Zephyrinus and Callistus seem to have been imbued with them. Sabellius, a
                    presbyter of Ptolemais, elaborated these opinions into a system in which Father,
                    Son, and Holy Spirit were only three modes of manifestation, three <hi
                    rend="italic">names,</hi> three <hi rend="italic">aspects</hi> of the divine
                    monad revealing itself under three different forms (Greg. Nyss., <hi
                    rend="italic">Grat. c. Arian,</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sabell.</hi>). The Monarchians, on the other hand, iu their equal anxiety to
                    avoid all danger of Ditheism and Tritheism, admitted the supernatural birth of
                    Christ, but only saw in Him the holiest of the prophets; these views were
                    expounded at Rome by Theodotus of Byzantium, who was consequently expelled from
                    the church by Pope Victor. The heresies of Paul of Samosata, the vain and
                    brilliant patriarch of Antioch, seem to have originated in an unhappy attempt to
                    reconcile the views of these Monarchian sects by teaching that not the whole
                    divine substance was manifested in Christ, but only one single divine power. He
                    thus distinguished between the Logos and the human Son of God. He was banished
                    and died in obscurity, but the sect, which was generally called Patripassian in
                    the West and Sabellian in the East, continued to linger on for a time.</p>
                <p>All these controversies were but preludes to the great struggle of the church
                    against Arianism. Hitherto she had condemned the Noetians and Sabellians for
                    denying the hypostasis of the Son as distinct from the Father, and the
                    Theodotians and Ebionites for denying His divinity. Arius, a presbyter of
                    Alexandria, admitted both the divine and the human nature of Christ, but by
                    making Him subordinate to God denied His divinity in its highest sense. He was
                    led to this error by the reaction against Sabellianism, and he ranked the Son
                    among created beings, saying that “there was (a time) when He was not.” Arius
                    was deposed and excommunicated by a council at Alexandria, but since many
                    bishops, and among them the distinguished Eusebius of Caesarea, and Eusebius of
                    Nicomedia, interceded in his favour, the dispute assumed such wide proportions
                    that Constantine was compelled to intervene by summoning in 325 the first
                    oecumenical council of Nice. By this council the doctrine of Arius was
                    condemned, and it λvas declared to be a matter of the Catholic faith that the
                    Son was not only of <hi rend="italic">like</hi> essence <hi rend="italic"
                    >{homoiousios)</hi> but of the <hi rend="italic">same</hi> essence <hi
                    rend="italic">{homoousios)</hi> with the Father.</p>
                <p>It λvas long, however, before the voice of controversy was silenced.</p>
                <p>Many bishops still continued to be on the one hand Arian or SemiArian, while on
                    the other hand men of gnat power and enlightenment, like Marcellus of Ancyra and
                    Photinus of Sirmium, slid back into dangerous affinity to Sabellianism. It was
                    in consequence of a similar reaction that Apollinaris, bishop of Laodicea, in
                    the desire to maintain the glory of Christ, fell into a new heresy and revived
                    an old error, by arguing that in Jesus the Logos supplied the place of the
                    reasonable soul. It is obvious that such a view undermined the doctrine of the
                    example and atonement of Christ, and it was condemned in 381 at the council of
                    Constantinople.</p>
                <p>The next great controversy arose from the refusal of Nestorius, patriarch of
                    Constantinople, to apply to the Virgin Mary the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theotokos</hi> or mother of God. In his endeavour to avoid the extremes which
                    had already been condemned, he spoke of the union of the two natures iu Christ
                    as a connexion <hi rend="italic">{συνάφεια)</hi> or indwelling <hi rend="italic"
                    >{evoiκη&lt;rιs),</hi> but denied that there was any communication of attributes
                    <hi rend="italic">{κοινωνία Ιδιωμάτων).</hi> He maintained, in fact, a
                    mechanical rather than a supernatural union of the two natures. He was condemned
                    in the council of Ephesus, 431, and died in exile; but the schools of Edessa and
                    Nisibis still maintained the Nestorian doctrine, which has continued in the East
                    even till the present day.</p>
                <p>The last great controversy on the two natures was raised by Eutyches,
                    archimandrite of Constantinople, who confounded together the two natures which
                    Nestorius had separated, thus , inaugurating what is known as the Monophysite
                    heresy, which was condemned in the council of Chalcedon, 451. It is needless to
                    explain the obscure heresies of Theopaschites, Phthartolatri, Aphthartodocetae,
                    or to do more than name the views of the Monothelites, who strove to put an end
                    to controversy by maintaining that though there were two <hi rend="italic"
                    >natures</hi> in Christ there was only one <hi rend="italic">will.</hi> The main
                    results at which the church arrived cannot be better summed up than they are in
                    an admirable passage of Hooker <hi rend="italic">{Eccl.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pol.,</hi> V. 54, 10): “There are but four things which concur to make complete
                    the whole state of our Lord Jesus Christ. His deity, His manhood, the
                    conjunction of both, and the distinction of the one from the other being joined
                    in one. Four principal heresies there are which have in those things withstood
                    the truth: Arians by bending themselves against the deity of Christ;
                    Apollinarians by maiming and misinterpreting that which belongeth to His human
                    nature; Nestorians by rending Christ asunder and dividing Him into two persons;
                    the followers of Eutyches by confounding in His person those natures which they
                    could distinguish. Against these there have been four most ancient general
                    councils: the council of Nice to define against Arians; against Apollinarians
                    the council of Constantinople; the council of Ephesus against Nestorians;
                    against Eutychians the Chalcedon council. In four words <hi rend="italic"
                    >hκ∙ηθωs, τfλiωs, aδιaιpiτωs, aσvγχ0τωs, truly, perfectly, indivisibly,
                    distinctly—</hi> the first applied to His being God, the second to His being
                    man, the third to His being of both One, and the fourth to His still continuing
                    of that one Both—λve may fully, by way of abridgement, comprise whatever
                    antiquity hath at large handled either in declaration of Christian belief, or in
                    refutation of the foresaid heresies.” The result of these centuries of
                    controversy was enshrined in the so-called Nicene creed—“the holy symbol
                    declared at Nice, established at Constantinople, strengthened at Ephesus, sealed
                    at Chalcedon.”</p>
                <p>When the church had thus rigidly defined the limits of Catholic orthodoxy, the
                    decisions of the four oecumenical councils were accepted, and no further
                    controversies roseon these subjects for about 800 years. The disputes between
                    the Nominalists and the Realists, and the speculations of the Schoolmen
                    generally as regards this subject, turned rather on the proofs or illustrations
                    of the doctrine of the Trinity than on theories respecting the two natures of
                    Christ. There are remarks and illustrations not only in the Schoolmen but even
                    in the Reformers which might be regarded as questionable, but none of them were
                    intended to diverge from the Catholic verity. Passing over the crude system of
                    Servetus, we hear of Unitarian communities in Poland as early as 1563. In 1544
                    Løelius Socinus had been obliged to leave Italy because his opinions'were known
                    to be unfavourable to the divinity of Christ. On his death at Zurich in 1562 his
                    nephew Faustus Socinus openly taught the opinions which he had learnt from his
                    uncle’s papers, and acquired a considerable following in Poland. The exegetic
                    methods of Socinianism were so weak, and its rupture with Christian history so
                    absolute, that the special views of the Socini—which were that Christ, though
                    miraculously born, was only the highest of men, and was deified after His death
                    as a reward for His virtue—have had an indirect rather than a direct influence.
                    In 1611 three men were burnt in England for denying the doctrine of the Trinity,
                    but in the middle of the 17th century we find John Biddle recognized as a leader
                    of the Unitarians, and the spread of Unitarian doctrines led Bull to write his
                    celebrated <hi rend="italic">Defensio Fidei</hi><hi rend="italic">Niccnae</hi>
                    in 1685. The first Unitarian church in England was founded in 1773 by Lindsay.
                    The writings of Spinoza and of the English deists—Herbert, Toland, Shaftesbury,
                    Chubb, Bolingbroke—helped largely to weaken the orthodox faith. But in later
                    periods it has been rather undermined than denied.</p>

                <p>While nominally accepted it has been understood and explained in a manner of
                    which the ancient church never so much as dreamt. Kant used all the traditional
                    formulae, but they do not appear to have been more to him than symbolic
                    expressions. Similarly Schelling spoke of the Three Persons of the creeds as
                    three <hi rend="italic">Momentums,</hi> for which he substituted in later years
                    the word <hi rend="italic">Potenzen,</hi> and the language of Fichte and Hegel
                    practically sublimates to nothing the doctrine of Christ’s divinity.</p>
                <p>But this “dispersive analysis” of the later centuries has shown itself most
                    markedly in some of the Lives of Jesus, and these prove very conclusively that
                    many Christians have not preserved the Nicene faith, but find an insuperable
                    stumbling block in the miracles. Even in the treatment of the life of Jesus by
                    Hess (1768) there is a spirit of concession to modern doubt which becomes still
                    more marked in the similar sketches of Herder (1796), who leans, wherever he
                    can, to the natural or the symbolic view of miracles. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leben Jesu</hi> of Paulus was written with the avowed object of explaining away
                    the supernatural elements in the Gospels while yet the evangelists themselves
                    were accepted as faithful witnesses,—an attempt which at once fell to the ground
                    under the weight of its own absurdity. Far different was the line adopted by
                    Schleiermacher in his <hi rend="italic">Lectures on the Life of Jesus</hi>
                    (published from notes by Riitenik in 1864). Schleiermacher wished to steer
                    between the Ebionitic and the Docetic views of Christ, but while maintaining the
                    divinity he systematically endea vours to reduce the miracles within the scope
                    of natural laws, and treats even the resurrection in a rationalizing manner, as
                    though Jesus had not really died. Hase, in his <hi rend="italic">Leben Jesu</hi>
                    (1829), leans in the same direction, supposing that Jesus possessed some unknown
                    power and a sort of sanative magnetism. None of these writers have, however,
                    produced so deep an impression as Strauss and Renan. Strauss, instead of
                    endeavouring to eliminate the supernatural, or to invest it in some sort with a
                    natural appearance, treated the Gospel narratives as myths from which it was
                    hardly possible to understand the historic personality of Christ. In his <hi
                    rend="italic">Leben Jesu</hi> (1835) he rejected the Fourth Gospel altogether;
                    in his second edition, in deference to Neander, he left the question neutral. In
                    this earlier phase he regarded Jesus as merely “the idea of the identity of God
                    and man, and the mission of humanity” built up on Messianic prophecy; but he
                    afterwards, as in his <hi rend="italic">Life of Christ for the People</hi>
                    (1864), attached more importance to the tendency-theory of Baur, and in his
                    later writings (<hi rend="italic">The Old Faith and the New,</hi> 1873) treated
                    the existence of Christianity in as disdainful a tone as though it were hardly
                    worthy of any explanation at all. Renan (<hi rend="italic">Vie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Jésus,</hi> 1863) entirely abandoned all faith in Chι∙ist <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> s divinity, and, while speaking of Him as one “whom
                    His death had made divine,” treated Him from the point of view of an amiable
                    rabbi who, beginning as an innocent enthusiast, developed into something hardly
                    if at all removed from conscious imposture. Meanwhile these negations had
                    provoked a strong reaction; and writers like Neander (1837), Ebrard (1842),
                    Lange (1843), Olshausen (1853), λVeisse (1856), Riggenbach (1858), and above all
                    Ewald (1855), maintained with abundant learning the truth of the Gospel
                    narratives, though the works of all of them betray, in a greater or less degree,
                    the signs, to which Neander so touchingly alludes, that they were produced ‘ ‘in
                    an age of crisis, of isolation, of pain, and of throes.” The most important
                    recent contribution to the literature of this subject is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jesu von</hi><hi rend="italic">Nazara</hi> of Keim (1867). He writes in a
                    reverent spirit and a powerful style, with abundant learning and patient
                    research. He takes his stand on the sinlessness of Jesus, and presents Him as
                    human indeed but still divine in the exaltation of His humanity. Keim attributes
                    the Fourth Gospel to a late and post-apostolic author, and when he gives it as
                    his conclusion that “in the life of Jesus, where the most genuine and
                    unadulterated humanity dwelt, was revealed at the same time not only a religious
                    genius, but the miracle of God and His presence upon earth,” and that “the
                    person itself and nothing else is the miracle,” he shows by how vast a space
                    modern opinion has receded from the views of the Catholic church. The English
                    works on the <hi rend="italic">Life of Christ</hi> have been very numerous of
                    late years, and have been marked with few exceptions by their fidelity to
                    Christian faith.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Literature—</hi> The bibliography of the life of Christ is
                    immense, and the monographs on isolated questions which bear upon it may be
                    counted by hundreds. The reader will find a fairly adequate account of the
                    results of a comprehensive critical survey of the whole field in Hase's <hi
                    rend="italic">Geschichte Jesu,</hi> 1875. So far as the patristic and mediaeval
                    periods are concerned, the gospel-harmonies of Tatian, Ammoniusof Alexandria,
                    victor of Capua, Gerson, and the poetical compositions based upon the Gospel
                    narratives by Prudentius, Sedulius, Nonnus, Caedmon, the author of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Heliand,</hi> Otfried of weissenburg, and others, may be dismissed
                    witlι a mere reference. Of greater importance as early examples of a large class
                    of works, designed for religious edification rather than for historical
                    portraiture, are the <hi rend="italic">Vita Christi</hi> of Bonaventura (first
                    printed in 1480, and often since, the latest English translation bearing so
                    recent a date as 1880), and the <hi rend="italic">Vita Jesu Christi</hi> of
                    Ludolphus Saxo (written about the middle of the 14th century, and first printed
                    at Strasburg in 1470). After the Reformation the harmony of the Gospels
                    continued to absorb much of the attention of scholars, and many able works in
                    this field, from that of Osiander (1537) to that of Bengel (173G), appeared, all
                    of them, however, unnaturally restricted by the limitations of a conventional
                    orthodoxy, and marked by a characteristic absence of the critical spirit. The
                    only work belonging to this early period which can be said still to possess
                    permanent value is the <hi rend="italic">Life of Christ</hi> by Jeremy Taylor,
                    1653. Such works as the <hi rend="italic">Messiah</hi> of Klopstock, 1748,
                    belong to literary rather than to theological history. The beginnings of a new
                    historical method can be traced in the writings of the English deists, such as
                    woolston and Chubb, a method which somewhat later was taken up by Reimarus and
                    Lessing, and gave rise on the other side to the apologetic works of Lardner,
                    Paley, and others in England, and in Germany to those of Herder (Pont <hi
                    rend="italic">Erlöser des Menschen, oder unsere drei ersten Evangelien,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Von Gottes Sohn der Welt Heiland nach Johannes)</hi> and of
                    Hess <hi rend="italic">(Geschichte der drei letzten Lebensjahre Jesu,</hi> 1768;
                    7th ed., 1823, witli the title <hi rend="italic">Lebensgeschichte Jesu).</hi> In
                    chronological order, the names of Schleiermacher and Hase come next. The
                    lectures of the former, first delivered in Berlin in 1819, and frequently
                    repeated in subsequent years, had almost expended their great influence before
                    their publication by Riitenik (<hi rend="italic">Vorlesungen über das Leben
                    Jesu,</hi> 1864); those of the latter, begun at Tübingen in 1823-^, first saw
                    the light as a <hi rend="italic">Leben Jesu</hi> in 1829 (5th ed., 1865, and in
                    a still more expanded form entitled <hi rend="italic">Geschichte Jesu</hi> in
                    1875). Their publication was preceded and occasioned by that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Leben Jesu als Grundlage einer reinen Geschichte des
                    Urchristenthurns</hi> of Paulus in 1828. A new phase of negative criticism was
                    introduced by the publication in 1835 of the <hi rend="italic">Leben
                    Jesu</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> Strauss, further developments of which are to
                    be found in his <hi rend="italic">Leben Jesu für das deutsche Volk
                    bearbeitet</hi> (1865; Eng. transi., 1865), and in the writings of his
                    followers, among whom may be mentioned C. H. weisse <hi rend="italic">(Das Leben
                    Jesu kritisch</hi><hi rend="italic">u.</hi><hi rend="italic">philosophisch

                    numerous works controverting these in the interests of Christian apologetics,
                    the most important are those of Tholuck <hi rend="italic">(Die</hi><hi
