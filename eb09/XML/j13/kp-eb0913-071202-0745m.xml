                <p><label type="entry">JOHN XXIII</label>. (pope from 1410 to 1415) was born in
                    Naples about 1360. He was of noble descent, his original name being Balthasar
                    Cossa. In his youth he had, along with his brothers, served as a corsair, and at
                    the university of Bologna, which he afterwards entered, he led a loose and
                    intemperate life. After occupying the office of archdeacon of Bologna, he became
                    chamberlain of Boniface IX., and in that office greatly enriched both himself
                    and the pope by his unscrupulous traffic in indulgences. In recognition of the
                    high value of his services he was in 1402 created by Boniface a cardinal, and
                    shortly afterwards he was appointed papal legate to Bologna, which he succeeded
                    in wresting from the Visconti. The scandalous and cruel excesses in which he
                    indulged when governor of the city caused Gregory</p>
                <p>XII. to pass against him a sentence of excommunication, but he was restored to
                    his full dignities by Alexander V. The death of this pope, which took place
                    suddenly at Bologna in 1410, was generally believed to have been contrived by
                    the governor, but the cardinals were unanimous in electing him his successor,
                    other two popes, Benedict</p>
                <p>XIII. and Gregory XII., the predecessors of Alexander, being still alive.
                    Previously John had entered into a close alliance with Louis of Anjou, and he
                    now united with him against Ladislaus of Naples, but notwithstanding the victory
                    of Rocca Secca in 1411 he found it necessary to come to ignominious terms with
                    Ladislaus in 1412. The compact was, however, congenial to neither party, and in
                    the following year Ladislaus, advancing on Rome, compelled the pope to flee to
                    Florence and thence to Bologna. In his extremity John implored the protection
                    and help of the emperor Sigismund, who condescended to acknowledge him to the
                    extent at least of requiring him to summon a council at Constance by which his
                    claims and that of the other two rival popes should be decided. John opened the
                    council in person in 1414, but, after consenting to abdicate preliminarily to
                    the council deciding on his claims, he made his escape in disguise to Freiburg,
                    where he obtained the protection of the duke of Austria. On his refusal to
                    return he was solemnly deposed by the council as guilty of a long list of
                    heinous crimes. The duke of Austria then surrendered him to the emperor, and
                    after he had acknowledged the justice of his sentence he was confined iu the
                    castle of Heidelberg. At the end of four years’ imprisonment he obtained his
                    freedom, in all probability through a bribe, and, having made his submission to
                    his successor Martin V., he was appointed by him cardinalbishop of Frascati and
                    dean of the college of cardinals, but he died a few months afterwards.</p>
