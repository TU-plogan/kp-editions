                    narrative is more apparent than real. This is very clearly the case in the book
                    of Judges.</p>
                <p>We observe in the first place that the book has two commencements, each of which
                    connects it directly with the book of Joshua (chap. i. 1; ii. 6). But in i. 1
                    the connexion is merely apparent. The events related in chap, i. are there said
                    to have taken place after the death of Joshua, but in reality the chapter,
                    covers the same ground with the book of Joshua, giving a brief account of the
                    conquest of Canaan, which in some particulars repeats the statements of the
                    previous book, while in others it is quite independent. It is impossible to
                    regard the warlike expeditions described in this chapter as supplementary
                    campaigns undertaken after Joshua’s death; they are plainly represented as the
                    first efforts of the Israelites to gain a firm footing in the centre of the land
                    (at Hebron, Debir, Bethel), in the very cities which Joshua in the book that
                    bears his name is related to have subdued (Josh. x. 39). And this is confirmed
                    by the circumstance that in Judges il 1 the “angel of Jehovah,” who, according
                    to Exod. xiv. 24, xxiii. 20, xxxii. 34, xxxiii. 2, 7 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi>
                    must be viewed as having his local manifestation at the headquarters of the host
                    of Israel, is still found at Gilgal and not at Shiloh (Josh, xviii. ]). Here
                    then we have an account of the first settlement of Israel west of the Jordan
                    which is parallel to the book of Joshua, but makes no mention of Joshua himself,
                    and places the tribe of Judah in the front. The author of the chapter cannot
                    have had Joshua or his history in his eye at all, and the passage, Josh. XV.
                    13-19, which corresponds to Judg. i. 10-15, 20, is either derived from our
                    chapter or from an earlier source common to both. It follows from these
                    considerations that the words “Now after the days of Joshua” in Judg. i. 1 are
                    from the hand of the editor, who desired to make the whole book of Judges,
                    including chap, i., read continuously with that which now precedes it in the
                    canon of the earlier prophets.</p>
                <p>There are other signs of more than one pen having been engaged on Judges i.
                    Compare, for example, ver. 8 with ver. 21, and see for the details, which are
                    too complicated to bo discussed here, Graf, <hi rend="italic">Ber Stamm

                    chapter was written after Israel had become strong enough to make the Canaanite
                    cities tributary (ver. 28), that is, in the time of the kingship. Meyer,
                    following hints by Wellhausen, brings arguments to show that the original author
                    is the Jahwist of the Pentateuch, of whose work there is but little trace among
                    the sources of Joshua, though it cannot have closed without speaking of the
                    conquest.</p>
                <p>The second and main section of our book (chap. ii. 6-xvi.) stands on quite
                    another footing. The opening verses ii. 6-9 repeat the closing words of Joshua’s
                    history (Josh, xxiv. 28-31), and so link what follows to the book of Joshua as
                    strictly as the first words of Ezra connect that book with the last verses of
                    Chronicles. According to Josh, xxiv. the people “served Jehovah” during the
                    lifetime of the great conqueror and his contemporaries. In Judg. ii. this
                    statement is repeated, and the writer proceeds to explain that subsequent
                    generations fell away from the faith, and served the gods of the nations among
                    which they dwelt. The worship of other gods is represented, not as something
                    which went on side by side with Jehovah worship (compare x. 6), but as a revolt
                    against Jehovah, periodically repeated and regularly chastised by foreign
                    invasion. The history, therefore, falls into recurring cycles, each of which
                    begins with religious corruption, followed by chastisement, which continues till
                    Jehovah in answer to the groans of His oppressed people raises up a judge to
                    deliver Israel, and recall them to the true faith. On the death of the judge, if
                    not sooner, the corruption spreads anew and the same vicissitudes follow. This
                    religious explanation of the course of the history, formally expounded at the
                    outset and repeated in more or less detail from chapter to chapter (most fully
                    in chap, x.), determines the form of the whole narrative, which is grouped round
                    six principal judges, Othniel, Ehud, Deborah, Gideon, Jephthah, and Samson. The
                    intervals between the great judges are filled up by the history of Gideon’s son
                    Abimelech and of six minor heroes —Shamgar (following Ehud), Tola and Jair
                    (following Abimelech), Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon (between Jephthah and Samson). The
                    minor judges are not represented as having any immediate religious importance.
                    The cycles of revolt, chastisement, and deliverance are six, not twelve.</p>
                <p>To the unity of religious pragmatism in the main stock of the book of Judges
                    corresponds a unity of chronological scheme. The judges, in spite of the fact
                    that most of them had clearly no more than a local influence, are all
                    represented as successive rulers, and the history is dated by the years of each
                    judgeship and those of the intervening periods of oppression. Here, however, a
                    difficulty arises. The fourth year of Solomon is, according to 1 Kings vi. 1,
                    the 480th from the exodus. These 480 years are 12 generations of 40 years each.
                    The larger numbers which make up this total are also mainly reckoned by forties.
                    Moses, Othniel, Ehud, Deborah, Gideon, and the Philistine oppression, in which,
                    according to Judg. xv. 20, Samson’s judgeship was but an incident, make up
                    together 7 × 40 years. Again, David has 40 years, and Samuel (who arose to close
                    the Philistine interregnum twenty years after the death of Eli, and continued in
                    office till he was quite old) cannot have ruled much less than a normal
                    generation. Finally Joshua, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n797/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0797-0764"/> who died at the age of 110, ruled 30 years, if in
                    point of age he was a man of the same standing with Caleb (Josh, xiv. 10). Add
                    to these 30 years 6 for Jephthah and 4 for Solomon and we get 10 × 40. There
                    remain but 80 years for the elders who outlived Joshua, the interregna or times
                    of oppression previous to the Philistine period, the minor judges, and Saul. But
                    the interregna alone are 71 years, and the minor judges 70, or with Abimelech 73
                    or 74. It is plain that there is no room for both in the chronological scheme,
                    and the two series correspond so nearly that they must be held to be alternative
                    items in the reckoning, leaving a slightly different length for Saul’s brief
                    reign. But as a matter of fact the minor judges are not so placed in the
                    narrative as to coincide with the periods of oppression. Thus the apparent
                    consecutiveness of the narrative breaks down. The minor judges really lie
                    outside of the chronological scheme of the history as well as of the system of
                    religious cycles; and we infer that even the main stock of the book of Judges is
                    not all constructed by one hand or on a uniform plan.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The minor details of the chronology appear
                    not to be derived throughout from tradition, but to be got by subdividing the

                <p>The religious interpretation of the history corresponds with the prophetic
                    teaching of the 8th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The use of Baal as a
                    title peculiar to false deities as opposed to Jehovah hardly fits an earlier
                    date than the time of Hosea, and the hostile attitude taken up towards the <hi
                    rend="italic">ashera</hi> (sacred tree or pole) was not shared by the religious
                    leaders of the period of Jehu. Critics have spoken of chaps, ii. and X. as
                    Deuteronomic, and no doubt the last hand that touched all the earlier historical
                    books and reduced them to unity may be so named; but the main ideas are not
                    necessarily so late, and are rather akin to the non-Levitical Elohist, the
                    author of Josh, xxiv. In particular the worship of the high places is not
                    condemned, nor is it excused as is done in 1 Kings iii. 2.</p>
                <p>But the sources of the narrative are obviously much older than the theological
                    exposition of its lessons. The composer of the book has generally transcribed
                    them with little change, so that in reading the story of each great deliverance
                    vouchsafed to Israel we feel ourselves in living contact with the earliest
                    strain of Hebrew patriotism and religion. In this respect the book of Judges is
                    one of the most valuable and interesting in the Old Testament. The song of
                    Deborah and the history of Abimelech carry us back to the beginnings of national
                    life in Israel, when Judah lived outside the main current of the history—the
                    tribe is not even named by Deborah—and when Israelite and Canaanite populations
                    existed side by side and struggled together for supremacy. In these chapters
                    Israel is still in some sense a nation foreign to Canaan, and Jehovah Himself
                    has His seat not on the mountains of Israel but beyond the fields of Edom on the
                    southern heights of Sinai. The importance of such documents for the scientific
                    historian lies not so much in the events they record as in the unconscious
                    witness they bear to the state of things in which the narrator or poet lived.
                    From this point of view all parts of the book are by no means of equal value,
                    and in some instances, particularly in the histories of Deborah and Gideon,
                    critical analysis appears to show that two narratives of different age have been
                    fused together, the older story giving more prominence to ordinary human motives
                    and combinations, while the later version is coloured by religious reflexion,
                    and shows the characteristic tendency of the Old Testament to retell the
                    fortunes of Israel in a form that lays ever increasing weight on the work of
                    Jehovah for His people. The history of the minor judges is plainly not related
                    from such lively and detailed remin iscence as gives charm to the longer
                    episodes of the book; and some of the names, as Nöldeke <hi rend="italic">(op.
                    cit.)</hi> and others have shown, are those of personified families or
                    communities rather than of individuals. This indeed is a characteristic feature
                    of the earlier Hebrew history, which older expositors failed to recognize, but
                    which modern science can no longer ignore.</p>
                <p>The third and last part of the book embraces chaps, xvii.-xxi., and consists of
                    two narratives independent of one another and of the main stock of the book,
                    with which they are not brought into any chronological connexion. The first
                    narrative, that of Micah and the Danites, belongs to the most primitive strata
                    of the Old Testament history, and is of the highest interest both as a record of
                    the state of religion and for the accurate picture it gives of the way in which
                    one tribe passed from the condition of an invading band into settled possession
                    of land and city. The history of the Levite and the Benjamites is of quite
                    another character, and presupposes a degree of unity of feeling and action among
                    the tribes of Israel which it is not easy to reconcile with the rest of the
                    book. In its present form this episode appears to be not very ancient; it
                    resembles the book of Ruth in giving a good deal of curious archaeological
                    detail (the feast at Shiloh) in a form which suggests that the usages referred
                    to were already obsolete when the narrative was composed.</p>
