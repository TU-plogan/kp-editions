                    (1806-1872), president of Mexico, was born near Ixtlan, in the state of Oajaca,
                    Mexico, March 21, 1806, of full Indian blood. Early left in poverty by the death
                    of his father, he received from a charitable friar a good general education, and
                    afterwards the means of studying law. Beginning to practise in 1834, Juarez
                    speedily rose to professional distinction, and in the stormy political life of
                    his time and country took a prominent part as an exponent of liberal views. In
                    1832 he sat in the state legislature; in 1846 he was one of a legislative
                    triumvirate for his native state and a deputy to the republican congress, and
                    from 1847 to 1852 he was governor of Oajaca. Banished in 1853 by Santa Anna, he
                    returned to Mexico in 1855, and joined Alvarez, who, after Santa Anna’s defeat,
                    made him minister of justice. Under Comonfort, who succeeded Alvarez in December
                    1855, Juarez was made president of the supreme court of justice and minister of
                    the interior; and, when Comonfort was unconstitutionally replaced by Zuloaga in
                    1858, the chief justice, in virtue of his office, claimed to be legal president
                    of the republic. It was not, however, till the beginning of 1861 that he
                    succeeded in finally defeating the unconstitutional party and in being duly
                    elected president by congress. His decree of July 1861, suspending for two years
                    all payments on public debts of every kind, led to the landing in Mexico of
                    English, Spanish, and French troops. The first two powers were soon induced to
                    withdraw their forces; but the French remained, declared war in 1862, placed
                    Maximilian upon the throne as emperor, and drove Juarez and his adherents to the
                    northern limits of the republic. Juarez maintained an obstinate resistance,
                    which resulted in final success. In 1867 Maximilian was taken at Quaretero, and
                    shot; and in August Juarez was once more elected president. His term of office
                    was far from tranquil; discontented generals stirred up ceaseless revolts and
                    insurrections; and, though he was re-elected in 1871, his popularity seemed to
                    be on the wane. He died of apoplexy in the city of Mexico, July 18, 1872. In him
                    Mexico lost a statesman of integrity, ability, and determination<pb break="no"
