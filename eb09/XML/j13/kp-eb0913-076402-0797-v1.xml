                <p><label type="entry">JUDICATURE, JUDICATURE A</label>.CTS. The Judicature Acts are
                    an important series of English statutes having for their object to simplify the
                    system of judicature in its higher branches. They are the following :—36 &amp;
                    37 Vict. c. 66 37 &amp; 38 Vict. c. 83; 38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. 77; 39 &amp; 40
                    Viet c. 59 (the Appellate Jurisdiction Act); 40 &amp; 41 Vict. c. 9.</p>
                <p>The movement which ended in the Judicature Acts has been promoted by all the
                    recent holders of the office of Lord Chancellor and by most of the leading
                    judges, but it required a long time to bring it to a successful issue, on
                    account of the difficulty always experienced in creating a sufficient amount of
                    public interest in legal reform to overcome the obstacles to legislation. The
                    principal Judicature Act is framed on the basis of a report by a commission
                    which was appointed in 1867. It was carried in the <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0913-0798-0765"/> chancellorship of Lord Selborne, but his
                    predecessor Lord Hatherley had in 1870 introduced a measure of the same
                    character. The objects of the Act are threefold—first, to reduce the
                    historically independent courts of common law and equity to one supreme court of
                    judicature, consisting of two branches, a High Court of Justice and a Court of
                    Appeal; secondly, to establish for all divisions of the court a uniform system
                    of pleading and procedure; and, thirdly, to provide for the enforcement of the
                    same rule of law in those cases where chancery and common law had hitherto
                    recognized different rules. The Act does not fuse common law and equity in the
                    sense in which that phrase has generally been employed. The chancery division
                    still remains distinct from the common law division, having a certain range of
                    legal questions under its exclusive control, and possessing to a certain extent
                    a peculiar machinery of its own for carrying its decrees into execution. But all
                    actions may now be brought in the High Court of Justice, and, subject to such
                    special assignments of business as that alluded to, may be tried in any division
                    thereof; and all divisions must recognize the same principles. Further, the
                    difficulties occasioned by mere technicalities of procedure have been to a great
                    extent removed by a system of pleading, the inspiring principle of which is that
                    each party should state his case in the simplest possible manner. It is in
                    respect of the last point that the operation of the Judicature Act has been
                    least satisfactory, and it is certain that a further simplification of pleading,
                    possibly based on the practice of the Scotch courts, will follow very soon.<note

                <p>The appellate part of the judicature has after some hesitation been finally
                    settled thus. The House of Lords remains the last court of appeal, as before the
                    first Judicature Act. That Act abolished the appellate jurisdiction of the Lords
                    so far as the new court of judicature was concerned, leaving it still the
                    appeals from Scotland and Ireland. A temporary Act allowed appeals to be brought
                    from the new court, and the Act 39 &amp; 40 Vict. c. 59 made provisions for the
                    permanent hearing of appeals from all courts to the Lords. The judicial
                    functions of the House of Lords have been virtually transferred to an appeal
                    committee, consisting of the Lord Chancellor and other peers who have held high
                    judicial office, and certain lords of appeal in ordinary created by the Act. No
                    appeal is to be heard unless three of such persons shall be present, and the
                    lords of appeal may sit for the despatch of judicial business during a
                    prorogation of parliament, and even by order of the queen during a dissolution.
                    The lords of appeal in ordinary are an entirely new creation. They hold office
                    on the same conditions as other judges; they take rank as barons for life; but
                    they are entitled to a writ of summons to attend and vote in the House only so
                    long as they hold office, and their dignity does not descend to their heirs. Two
                    are appointed in the first instance, but an arrangement is provided for by which
                    the four head judges of the privy council may ultimately be the four lords of
                    appeal in ordinary. When two of the privy council judges die or resign, a third
                    lord of appeal may be appointed, and a fourth when the remaining two judges of
                    the privy council cease to hold office. The judicial committee of the House of
                    Lords and the judicial committee of the privy council will then be the same, and
                    the two jurisdictions will be fused. The Court of Appeal, created by the
                    Judicature Act of 1873, with intention of making it a final court, is now
                    subject to an appeal to the House of Lords. It now consists of six judges,
                    andsits in two divisions, which, roughly speaking, take respectively the
                    chancery and common law business of the divisional courts, but the lords
                    justices of appeal sit in either division according to convenience. This part of
                    the rearrangement of the judicature may be pronounced entirely successful. A
                    strong and stable court of appeal has been created, instead of the fluctuating
                    tribunal of former times. The same is true generally of the redistribution of
                    judicial strength effected by the Acts, which has led to a marked improvement in
                    the despatch of business.</p>
                <p>The Irish Judicature Act (40 &amp; 41 Vict. c. 57) follows the same lines as the
                    English Acts. The pre-existing courts are consolidated into a supreme court of
                    judicature, consisting of a High Court of Justice and a Court of Appeal. The
                    Judicature Acts do not affect Scotch judicature, but the Appellate Jurisdiction
                    Act includes the Court of Session among the courts from which an appeal lies to
                    the House of Lords under the new conditions. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.
