                    slope of the Cofre de Perote. In these localities, where the temperature varies
                    during the day from 60° to 75° Fahr. (15° to 24° C.), and rain falls almost
                    every day, it flourishes in the deep rich soil of shady woods. Jalap has been

                    derives its name from the city of Jalapa in Mexico, near which it grows, but its
                    botanical source was not accurately determined until the year 1829, when Dr Coxe
                    of Philadelphia published a description and coloured figure taken from living
                    plants sent him two years previously from Mexico. The Jalap plant has slender
                    herbaceous twining stems, with alternately-placed cordate acuminate leaves
                    sharply pointed at the basal angles, and salver-shaped deep purplish-pink
                    flowers. The underground stems are slender and creeping; their vertical roots
                    enlarge and form turnip-shaped tubers, which, as they do not bear leaf organs on
                    their surface, are sometimes called tubercules. The roots are dug up in Mexico
                    throughout the year, and are suspended to dry in a net over the hearth of the
                    Indians’ huts, and hence acquire a smoky odour. The large tubers are often
                    gashed to cause them to dry more quickly. In appearance they vary from
                    spindle-shaped to ovoid or globular, and in size from a pigeon’s egg to a man’s
                    fist. Externally they are brown, and marked with small transverse paler scars,
                    and internally they present a dirty white resinous or starchy fracture. The
                    ordinary drug is distinguished in commerce as Vera Cruz jalap, from the name of
                    the port whence it is shipped. The average annual imports into Great Britain
                    have been estimated at 180,000 lb.</p>
                <p>Jalap has been cultivated for ten years past in India, at Ootacamund, and grows
                    there as easily as a yam, often producing clusters of tubers weighing over 9
                    ft&gt;; but these, as they differ in appearance from the commercial article,
                    have not as yet obtained a place in the English market. They are found, however,
                    to be rich in resin, containing 18 per cent. In Jamaica also the plant has been
                    grown, at first amongst the cinchona trees but more recently in new ground, as
                    it was found to exhaust the soil. The 1880 crop of jalap in Jamaica amounted to
                    14,294 B), and sold in the fresh state for £62, 3s. 8d. Some of it was exported
                    to the London market.</p>
                <p>Jalap owes it properties to <hi rend="italic">jalapin,</hi> a resin which is
                    present in it to the extent of 12 to 18 percent. According to Mayer<note

                    about 19 per cent, of sugar according to Guibourt, and starch, gum,
                    uncrystallizable sugar, and colouring matter.</p>
                <p>Besides Mexican or Vera Cruz jalap, a drug called Tampico jalap has been imported
                    during the last few years in considerable quantity. It has a much more
                    shrivelled appearance and paler colour than ordinary jalap, and lacks the small
                    transverse scars present in the true drug. It differs also in containing in the
                    place of jalapin a resin identical with the convolvulin above mentioned, and
                    with the para-rhodeoretin of Kayser, which exists in it to the extent of 11 per
                    cent. This kind of jalap, the Purga de Sierra Gorda of the Mexicans, was traced
                    by Hanbury to <hi rend="italic">Ipomaea</hi><hi rend="italic">simulans,</hi>
                    Hanbury. It grows in Mexico along the mountain range of the Sierra Gorda in the
                    neighbourhood of Sau Luis de la Paz, from which district it is carried down to
                    Tampico, whence it is exported. A third variety of jalap known as woody jalap,
                    male jalap, or Orizaba root, or by the Mexicans as Purgo macho, is derived from
                    <hi rend="italic">Ipomaea</hi><hi rend="italic">orizabensis,</hi> Ledanois, a
                    plant of Orizaba. The root occurs in fibrous pieces, which are usually
                    rectangular blocks of irregular shape, 2 inches or more in diameter, and are
                    evidently portions of a large root. It is only occasionally met with in
                    commerce. The resin contained in it is identical with that found in Tampico
                    jalap.</p>
                <p>According to Dr W. Rutherford, jalap acts as a powerful hepatic and intestinal
                    stimulant. It is used as a hydragogue cathartic in combination with cream of
                    tartar in dropsy, and in all cases where it is desirable to cause a copious
                    watery evacuation, also as a vermifuge. Buchheim asserts that jalap is only
                    purgative when combined with bile, in which the resin is soluble.</p>
