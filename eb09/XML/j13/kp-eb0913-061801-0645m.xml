                    and, although his family was hard put to it by the expense, he spent some time
                    at Westminster school before entering the Inner Temple as a student at sixteen.
                    The allowance he received from home was quite unequal to the demands of the
                    dissolute habits into which he quickly fell, but it is said that the promise of
                    future eminence, afforded by the fits of studiousness which divided his orgies,
                    procured for the dissipated student both long credit and presents of money. He
                    was exceedingly popular as a table companion, especially with the inferior
                    attorneys and attorneys’ clerks with whom, then as afterwards, he preferred to
                    drink; and in the low practice which he began at Old Bailey and the London
                    Sessions immediately on being called to the bar in November 1668, he found his
                    boon companions very useful in procuring him briefs. Voluble, unscrupulous, and
                    overbearing, he rapidly developed in his constant dealings w ith the most
                    degraded criminals the coarse bullying manner which disgraced him throughout his
                    whole career. He sought every means of ingratiating himself with the city
                    aidermen, and in 1671, at the singularly early age of twenty-three, became their
                    common seιjeant, and in 1678 recorder of London. He had by that time pushed his
                    way into the higher courts, where his marvellous address in speaking and
                    cross-examination made up for, if it did not conceal, his shallow legal
                    knowledge. Jeffreys had hitherto nominally belonged to the anti-court or liberal
                    party; but, perceiving that they had but little patronage in their gift, he had
                    opened secret negotiations with Charles II., and immediately on taking the oaths
                    as recorder he openly declared himself a partisan of the court. The year before
                    he had been knighted and appointed solicitor to the duke of York. To reward him
                    for the servility which he displayed, especially in connexion with the Popish
                    plot trials, he was appointed chief justice of Chester, and advanced to a
                    baronetcy. His insolence and intemperance, already notorious, became in his
                    chief-justiceship well nigh intolerable. He received a rebuff in 1680 when for
                    his conduct in obstructing the assembling of parliament he was reprimanded on
                    his knees by the speaker, and forced to resign his recordership in December of
                    the same year. Such indignities were merits in the eyes of the king, to whose
                    favour Jeffreys laid additional claims by his efforts to abrogate the charter of
                    London, and by his activity as counsel against the suspected Rye House
                    conspirators. He received his reward. Lord Campbell remarks, “Jeffreys became
                    chiefjustice of England, as the only man fit to condemn Algernon Sidney.” He was
                    sworn in in November 1683, and shortly became privy councillor and member of the
                    cabinet. In the court of the King’s Bench, the new chiefjustice let few
                    considerations stand between him and his desire to satisfy the king. His
                    iniquitous servility is to be traced in the <hi rend="italic">State Trials.</hi>
                    When Charles died in February 1685, Jeffreys exchanged a master who disliked him
                    as a wretch “with no learning, no sense, no manners, and more impudence than ten
                    carted street-walkers,” for one who found in him a thoroughly congenial tool. In
                    May 1685 Jeffreys was raised to the peerage by the style of Baron Jeffreys of
                    Wem, and in August went into the western counties as president of a special
                    commission appointed to try the numerous cases of treason arising from the duke
                    of Monmouth’s ill-fated rebellion. It was in this “bloody assize” that he was to
                    deepen the stain that already tarnished his fame, and to make the name “Judge
                    Jeffreys” a synonym for a monster of bloodthirsty cruelty, blasphemous rage, and
                    brutish intemperance. In the “campaign” he gave the rein to his ferocity; he was
                    maddened with slaughter, and his appetite for blood grew by what it fed on. The
                    horrible glare of his eye, the savage lines of his face, his fierce shouts of
                    wrath, terrified and confused guilty and innocent alike. With hateful cunning he
                    let it be bruited that the only hope of mercy lay in pleading guilty, and by
                    this cold-blooded artifice lightened his labours. He had a powerful incentive to
                    active butchery: the vacant post of lord chancellor was to be won by good
                    service. The estimates of the numbers of victims of the commission vary: 320 was
                    the official return to the treasury; Lord Lonsdale says 700, and Burnet 600.
                    Upwards of 800 were transported as slaves to the West Indies, while others only
                    escaped by purchasing their pardons from the judge at most exorbitant rates.
                    When the chief-justice returned to Windsor in September, the great seal of
                    England was placed in his blood-stained hands. For the rest of his career the
                    lord chancellor was an unresisting agent of King James in his most illegal
                    schemes. Finding himself losing favour at court, he even revived the
                    ecclesiastical court of high commission, abolished in 1640 by an Act which
                    forbade its revival, and himself engaged to act aspresident. In the attempt
                    against the rights of the fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford, and in the trial
                    of the seven bishops, Jeffreys was the king’s right hand; but, when the
                    proceedings of James had at last roused the indignation that cost him his crown,
                    the lord chancellor was one of the first to advise concession. When the king
                    fled in 1688, Jeffreys was in the utmost consternation. For him, he knew, there
                    could be no mercy. Shaving off his shaggy eyebrows, and disguising himself as a
                    common sailor, he attempted to escape to Hamburg in a small collier, but, while
                    drinking in a low public-house at Wapping, he was recognized by a poor scrivener
                    who had once encountered the wrath of the judge, and had never forgotten the
                    glare of his eye. Jeffreys was only saved from being torn in pieces by the mob
                    by the timely arrival of a strong guard, who conducted the trembling wretch to
                    the Tower. There he lay for some months, tortured by anguish both of mind and
                    body, which he endeavoured to drown in copious draughts of brandy. He died
                    miserably on April 19, 1689. Jeffreys was twice married, and had ten children,
                    but his title became extinct in 1703, in the person of his son John, notorious
                    for having interrupted the funeral of Dryden. It is said that in 1688 Lord
                    Jeffreys was about to be created earl of Flint; and, though <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n646/mode/1up"

                    was dedicated to him, giving him the title.</p>
                <p>For the character of Jeffreys not even the most impartial historian can say a
                    good word. Of strong intelligence and clear legal head, and, according to Roger
                    North, when he was in temper and matters indifferent came before him, becoming
                    his seat of justice better than any other that author had seen in his place, he
                    might have risen to a high position among the learned luminaries of the bench,
                    had he not prostituted his talents to unworthy ends, and swamped his faculties
                    in the most brutal intemperance. He treated all from whom he had nothing to
                    expect with coarse insolence, taking an especially malicious delight in giving,
                    as he phrased it, “a lick with the rough side of his tongue” to those whom his
                    maudlin caresses of the night before had encouraged to presume. No less was he
                    pleased to revile at dissenters; “Show me,” be said, “a Presbyterian, and I will
                    engage to show a lying knave.” He is remarkable as the only politically
                    prominent lawyer of his century who never sat in the House of Commons, nor left
                    a single publication behind him. In the House of Lords he once attempted to use
                    the insolent abuse of his court habits, but was compelled humbly to apologize,
                    in tears of maudlin chagrin, to all whom he had attacked.</p>
