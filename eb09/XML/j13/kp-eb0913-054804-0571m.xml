                    length and 21 1 to 49 miles in breadth. Its area is about 4200 square miles, or,
                    as stated in the Report of the Geological Survey, 3250 square miles. Within its
                    government are comprised the three small islands called the Caymanas, <pb

                    the centre of the Yucatan passage; British Honduras has a lieutenant-governor
                    under the general government of Jamaica, although distant 660 miles, on the
                    mainland of Central America; and Turks and Caicos islands, lying between 21° and
                    22° N. lat. and 71° and 72° 37' W. long., were annexed to Jamaica in 1874.</p>
                <p>The surface of Jamaica is usually hilly or mountainous, and there is a great
                    variety of climate, according to situation and elevation. The largest extent of
                    level land is to the westward, where the low lands are near the sea. The form of
                    the coasts presents the outline of a turtle, the mountain ridges representing
                    the back. The highest elevations are situated to the east, the inclined slope
                    rising from the west. Vestiges of intermittent volcanic action occur. From the
                    sea-level on all sides a series of ridges gradually ascend towards the central
                    range, dividing the large rivers, and rising occasionally into peaks of 6000
                    feet. The Blue Mountains, running centrally from east to west, rise at some
                    points to above 7000 feet. The vapours ascending from the rivers and surrounding
                    ocean produce in the upper regions clouds saturated with moisture, which induce
                    vegetation belonging to a colder climate. During the rainy season there is such
                    an accumulation of vapour as to cause a general coolness over the island, and of
                    course occasioning very sudden and heavy showers, and sometimes destructive
                    floods. Upwards of one hundred and fourteen rivers or streams find their way
                    from the interior to the sea, besides the numerous tributaries which issue from
                    every ravine in the mountains. These streams for the most part are not
                    navigable; in times of flood they become devastating torrents. In the parish of
                    Portland, the Rio Grande receives all the smaller tributaries from the west;
                    there is scarcely a mile width between any of these streams, and the land rises
                    about 1000 feet to the mile. In St Thomas in the east, the drainage of the main
                    ridge is performed by the Plantain Garden river, the tributaries of which form
                    deep ravines and narrow gorges in the mountains, which unite and descend, the
                    valley of the Plantain Garden expanding out into a most picturesque and fertile
                    plain. Black River flows through a level country, and is accessible to small
                    craft for about 30 miles. Salt River and the Cabarita, both also on the south
                    side, are navigable by barges. The others on the south are the Rio Cobre (where
                    irrigation works have been constructed for the sugar estates and provision and
                    fruit growing in the district), Yallahs, and Rio Minho; on the north Martha
                    Brae, the White River at Buff Bay, the Great Spanish River, and Rio Grande.
                    There are several medicinal springs. Jamaica has sixteen harbours, the chief of
                    which are Port Morant, Kingston, Old Harbour, Green Island, Montego Bay,
                    Falmouth, Port Maria, St Ann’s Bay, Lucea, and Port Antonio, besides numerous
                    bays, roadsteads, and shipping stations affording tolerable anchorage. The
                    surface of the valleys and level lands consists of alluvial deposits composed of
                    sediment derived from the disintegration of the higher land. The White Limestone
                    formation seems to originate two descriptions of alluvia, one white and the
                    other red, the colour being due to oxide of iron combined with the argillaceous
                    residue of the pre-existing limestone. The red soil is particularly favourable
                    for coffee growing. The area occupied by the Coast Limestone and White Limestone
                    represents about five-eighths of the island. The substructure of Jamaica
                    consists of igneous rocks. In economic geology Jamaica produces a great variety
                    of marbles, porphyrites, granite, and ochres. Traces of gold have been found
                    associated with some of the oxidized copper ores (blue and green carbonates) of
                    the Clarendon mines. Copper ores are very widely diffused, though the working of
                    the veins has been found too expensive. Cobalt and lead have been worked, but
                    hitherto unprofitably. Manganese occurs, also iron ores and a form of arsenic.
                    There is a great variety (and at the same time great equability) of climate. In
                    the lowlands the temperature rises from 75 <hi rend="superscript"> α</hi> at
                    night to 85° in the day, and is tempered by the sea and land breezes. At Up-Park
                    Camp, 225 feet above the sea-level, the mean temperature of the hottest month
                    (July) was 81 <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 71, and of the coldest month
                    (January) 75 <hi rend="superscript"> o-</hi> 65. At Newcastle, 3800 feet, the
                    hottest month was 67 <hi rend="superscript"> 0,</hi> 75, and the coldest 61°.
                    The temperature therefore is very equable. In the higher levels the temperature
                    may be 40° to 50°. In the plains there is much humidity. At Kingston the
                    temperature ranges from 70° to 80° throughout the year. Parts of the island are
                    extremely favourable for sufferers from tubercular disease. The island is
                    generally healthy, though sometimes subject to yellow fever, like most tropical
                    countries. Hurricanes, when they occur, come between July and October. The
                    periodical rains, which generally last for six weeks, constitute the May and
                    October seasons.</p>
                <p>The vegetable productions are very numerous. There are forest trees fit for every
                    purpose; among these are the ballata, rosewood, satinwood, mahogany, lignum
                    vitae, lancewood, and ebony. The logwood and fustic are exported for dyeing.
                    There are also the Jamaica cedar, and the silk cotton tree <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ceiba Dombax).</hi> Pimento (peculiar to Jamaica) is indigenous, and furnishes
                    the allspice. The bamboo, coffee, and cocoa are well known. Several species of
                    palm abound,—the macaw, the fan palm, screw palm, and palmetto royal. There are
                    plantations of cocoa-nut palm. The Government are raising cocoa-nuts with profit
                    on a barren spit of sand by the sea. Cinchona plantations have recently been
                    successfully established in the mountains, the produce selling well in the
                    London market. The other noticeable trees and plants are the mango, the
                    breadfruit tree, the papaw, the lacebark tree, and the guava. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Palma Christi,</hi> from which castor oil is made, is a very
                    abundant annual. English vegetables grow in the hills, and the plains produce
                    plantains, cocoa, yams, cassava, ochra, beans, pease, ginger, and arrowroot.
                    Maize and guinea corn are cultivated, and the guinea grass, accidentally
                    introduced in 1750, is very valuable for horses and cattle,—so much so that
                    pen-keeping or cattle farming is a highly profitable occupation. Among the
                    principal fruits are the orange, shaddock, lime, grape or cluster fruit,
                    pine-apple, mango, banana, grapes, melons, avocado pear, breadfruit, and
                    tamarind. There are public gardens at Kingston, at Castleton, about 20 miles
                    from Kingston, and at Bath, and an experimental plantation of different
                    varieties of cane at Hope plantation. The sugar cane was cultivated at an early
                    period, for in 1671 there were a number of sugar works. There are many beautiful
                    flowers, such as the aloe, the yucca, the datura, the mountain pride, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Victoria regia;</hi> the cactus tribe is well represented.
                    Innumerable varieties of ferns grow in the mountains, and orchids in the woods.
                    The sensitive plant grows in pastures.</p>
                <p>There are fourteen sorts of <hi rend="italic">Lampyridx</hi> or fireflies,
                    besides the <hi rend="italic">Elateridae</hi> or lantern beetles. There are no
                    venomous serpents, but plenty of harmless snakes and lizards. The large lizard,
                    the iguana, is eaten, as are also the land crab and tortoise. The scorpion and
                    centipede are poisonous, but not very dangerous. Ants, mosquitoes, and sandflies
                    swarm in the lowlands. Gosse enumerates twenty different song birds in Jamaica.
                    Parrots, pigeons, guinea fowl, and a great variety of water birds are found. The
                    sea and rivers swarm with fish, and turtles abound. The seal and manatee are
                    sometimes found, and the crocodile. The domestic animals are those of the
                    ordinary English kind. Jamaica beef and pork are very good. Poultry succeeds
                    well <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n575/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0575-0550"/> The population was returned in the census of 1844
                    as 380,000, of whom 16,000 were white, 68,000 coloured, and the rest black. In
                    1861 it was returned at 441,000, of whom 14,000 were white, 80,000 coloured, and
                    347,000 black. In 1871 the numbers were 13,000 white, 100,000 coloured, 393,000
                    black; total 506,000. The census of 1881 will probably show a total of
                    600,000,—a large increase in the black and coloured population, and a stationary
                    if not reduced number of white people.</p>
                <p>The total value of imports was £1,492,722 (including £757,077 from the United
                    Kingdom) in 1878, and £1,347,342 in 1879— amounts considerably below the values
                    for the preceding six years, in four of which it was above £1,700,000. The
                    imports consist principally of provisions for consumption, a considerable
                    proportion coming from the United States. The total value of exports in 1878 was
                    £1,210,705 (£954,584 to the United Kingdom), consisting of 9,572,714 lb of
                    coffee (an extending industry), 908,603 tt&gt; of ginger, 6,195,109 lb of
                    pimento, 18,115 puncheons of rum, 26,066 hhds. of sugar, and 35,157 tons of
                    logwood. The total value is below that of the six preceding years. The sugar
                    exported was below the average of preceding years; but in 1879 sugar exports
                    rose again to 29,000 hhds. The value of the fruit exported (principally to
                    United States) had risen from £9337 in 1875 to £39,451 in 1878. The total
                    exports for 1879 were £1,357,571 value. Tire area under crops in 1878 was
                    121,457 acres, in guinea grass 120,264, in pasture 318,549, in wood and runate
                    1,217,596, leaving 942,134 acres of the total extent to be accounted for as
                    unpatented primeval forest or rocky land of no value. One of the newest
                    industries, besides cinchona, is the growth of excellent tobacco; Jamaica cigars
                    are now becoming well known in England. The public revenue for 1878 was
                    £438,564, and the appropriated revenues from roads, poor rates, &amp;c.,
                    £74,900, making a grand total of £512,465, or about 18s. per head of the
                    population. The estimates for 1880 showed a public revenue of £469,875 and
                    appropriated £72,580, total £542,455. £245,000, or more than half the public
                    revenue, is raised from import duties, and £94,000 from rum duties; the railway
                    receipts (Government having purchased the line by loan with a view to extension)
                    for 1880 were estimated at £23,000. The remainder comes from licences, postal
                    revenues, and other sources. The public expenditure for 1879 was £460,154, the
                    appropriated £73,050, total £533,204, and the estimated expenditure for
                    1880—public £485,655, appropriated £72,580, total £558,235. The main items of
                    expends ture are—debt charges and sinking funds and redemption, £73,000;
                    administrative departments, £33,000; revenue departments, £33,000; judicial,
                    £36,000; ecclesiastical, £10,000 (the church has been disestablished, and the
                    expenditure will be gradually less as vested interests disappear); medical,
                    £55,000; constabulary, £50,000; penitentiary and prisons, £25,000; education,
                    £25,000; railway managing, &amp;c., £14,000; public works and irrigation,
                    £58,000.</p>
                <p>In 1878, 617 schools. underwent inspection by the Government; 51,488 children
                    were on the books, the average attendance being 29,679. Of these schools, 54
                    passed first class, 176 second class, and 343 third class. The average
                    Government grant to each school aided during the year was £29, and the total
                    education grant, exclusive of departmental salaries, was £18,572. Elementary
                    education has made progress during the eleven years the present system has been
                    in operation. The collegiate school in Kingston offers higher education. Among
                    educational institutions, the Church of England high school, the Calabar
                    institution or Jamaica Baptist College, and Wolmer’s free school, founded in
                    1729 by John Wolmer forthe free education of poor children, as well as the Mico
                    school, require mention. The ecclesiastical establishment is regulated by Law
                    No. 30 of 1870, which provided for gradual disendowment. This law created a
                    synod, to consist of clergymen and lay representatives, and it continued to each
                    existing rector, island curate, and stipendiary curate the payments from the
                    state so long as they fulfilled their functions. Under this law the estimates
                    for 1880 show as still op the establishment five rectors, twenty island curates,
                    and three stipendiary curates, the total amount for the Church of England being
                    £9749; this, with £367 to the Church of Scotland, and £100 to the Church of
                    Rome, makes up the ecclesiastical establishment. Besides the state paid
                    clergymen, there are about forty clergymen paid out of the Diocesan Church Fund.
                    Besides three American church missionaries at Kingston, there are about twenty
                    Presbyterian ministers, thirty Wesleyan, eight of the London Missionary Society,
                    fifty Baptist, one Independent, six United Methodist Free Church. The Moravians
                    have fourteen stations and seventeen missionaries. There are two synagogues.</p>
                <p>Kingston, the capital, is on the south coast. It was founded in 1693, and is
                    built on a plain which rises from the shore with a gradual ascent to the foot of
                    the Liguanea mountains. This plain is covered with country residences and sugar
                    estates. The town population in 1871 was 4393 whites, 13,291 coloured, and
                    16,630 blacks. It is now estimated at over 40,000. The seat of government was
                    recently transferred from Spanish Town to Kingston, and the principal civil and
                    judicial business is transacted there. The chief retail business street is
                    Harbour Street. Port Royal Street is the chief thoroughfare of the wholesale
                    merchants, who keep wharves which line the seaboard of the town. The public
                    buildings possess little architectural interest. The Victoria Market (opened in
                    1872) and public landing place at the foot of King Street (where Rodney’s statue
                    was brought from Spanish Town), form a very fine market-place. The court house
                    in Harbour Street is a handsome building. The public hospital (with 170 beds),
                    the law library, the chancery registrar’s office (with its piece of tapestry of
                    the royal and island arms, which used to be carried before the governor on state
                    occasions), the court of vice-admiralty, the public library and museum in East
                    Street, are also worthy of mention. The parish church in King Street is one of
                    the oldest churches in the island, dating probably from 1692. It contains the
                    tombs of William Hall (1699) and Admiral Benbow (1702). The only bank is a
                    branch of the Colonial Bank, besides the Government Savings Bank. Up-Park Camp,
                    to the north-east of the city, is the headquarters of a West India regiment.</p>
                <p>Jamaica was discovered by Columbus and possession taken in the name of the king
                    of Spain on the 3d of May 1494. He called it St Jago, but it is known by its
                    Indian name Jamaica, “the isle of springs.” It is sometimes written Xamayca. The
                    inhabitants belonged to the gentler Indian tribes, not to the fierce Caribs. In
                    June 1503 Columbus was driven by a tempest into a bay on the north side, now St
                    Ann’s Bay. After his departure the island remained unvisited until 1509, when
                    his son Diego, having established his right in the council of the Indies to the
                    governorship of Hispaniola, sent Don Juan d’Esquivel to take possession of the
                    island, in opposition to Alonzo d’Ojeda, who claimed it under a royal grant.
                    Thenceforward, under the nde of the Spaniards, the Indian population diminished,
                    until in 1655, when the island fell into the possession of the English, the race
                    was practically extinct. The controversy respecting the rights of the
                    descendants of Columbus continued for a long time. About the year 1523 Diego
                    Columbus founded St Jago de la Vega, St James of the Plain, which was the
                    official capital, under the name of Spanish Town, until Kingston was recently
                    selected. Attention had been gradually given to agriculture, the cotton plant,
                    sugar cane, and various kinds of corn and grass having been introduced. In 1596,
                    during the alliance of Queen Elizabeth with the Low Countries,
                    andtheconsequentwar withSpain, Sir A. Shirley, a British admiral, invaded
                    Jamaica, but made no attempt at occupation. In the reign of Charles I. Colonel
                    Jackson defeated the inhabitants at Passage Fort. Shortly afterwards the island
                    was divided into eight districts in the nominal possession of eight noble
                    families, and the total population became extremely small. The next important
                    event was the expedition sent by Cromwell, under Admirals Penn and Venables;
                    failing against Hispaniola, they took possession of Jamaica on the 3d May 1655,
                    the island having been in the possession of the Spaniards one hundred and
                    sixty-one years. Under Cromwell emigrants were sent from Scotland and Ireland
                    and other places. But the Spaniards and their negroes harassed the new comers,
                    who died in considerable numbers. On the 8th May 1658 an attack from Hispaniola
                    was defeated, and soon after the remaining Spaniards were driven from the
                    island. The slaves called Maroons, however, who had fled to the mountains,
                    continued formidable. Down to the end of the 18th century the disaffection of
                    these Maroons caused much trouble. In 1661 a regular civil government was
                    established, Colonel D’Oyley being appointed governor-general with an elective
                    council. Next year he was succeeded by Lord Windsor, who was instructed to
                    summon a popular assembly to pass laws. Jamaica became the resort of the
                    buccaneers, who carried on a profitable piracy on these seas during the war with
                    Spain. In 1670 peace was made with Spain, and the English title was recognized
                    by the treaty of Madrid. The buccaneers were suppressed. In 1672 the Fourth or
                    Royal African Company was formed to carry on a monopoly of the slave trade. From
                    1700 to 1786 the number of slaves imported was estimated at 610,000, of whom
                    about one-fifth were re-exported. In 1673 the governor sent home the first pot
                    of sugar to the secretary of state; at this time there were 7768 whites and 9504
                    negroes on the island. In 1678, while the earl of Carlisle was governor, an
                    attempt was made to saddle the island with a yearly tribute to the crown, and to
                    restrict the free legislative<pb break="no"

                    assembly, however; were restored under Sir Thomas Lynch in 1682; it was not
                    until 1728 that £8000 (currency) a year was settled on the crown, and the laws
                    and statutes of England were made equally applicable to Jamaica. This amount was
                    afterwards commuted for £6000, used by the governor for salaries, allowances,
                    and contingencies. In 1854 this fund was merged in the ordinary civil list. The
                    other principal event in the general history of Jamaica was the threatened
                    invasion in 1782 by the combined fleets of France mid Spain under De Grasse. It
                    was saved by the victory of Rodney and Hood, off Dominica, in commemoration of
                    which event a statue of Rodney, by Bacon, was erected in Spanish Town.</p>
                <p>A great earthquake occurred in 1692, when the chief part of the town of Port
                    Royal, built on a shelving bank of sand, slipped into the sea. In 1712 and 1722
                    there were dreadful hurricanes, the last causing the seat of commerce to be
                    transferred from Port Royal to Kingston. Since then there have been a number of
                    hurricanes, the most recent being in August 1880, when considerable damage was
                    done to crops, provision grounds, churches, chapels, and schoolhouses in the
                    eastern part of the island.</p>
                <p>Since 1800 the history of Jamaica has been, with some exceptions (such as the
                    defeat by Admiral Duckworth in 1806 of the French squadron intended to invade
                    Jamaica), confined to its domestic concerns and its relations with the mother
                    country. In 1807, when the slave trade was abolished, there were 323,827 slaves
                    in the island. The island was very prosperous,—sugar, coffee, cocoa, cotton,
                    pimento, ginger, and indigo being produced; and it was also the dépôt of a very
                    lucrative transit trade between Europe and the Spanish main. The anti-slavery
                    agitation in England, growing stronger every year, caused great excitement in
                    the island, and there was much violence and misrepresentation on both sides of
                    the question. The negroes revolted in 1832, under the belief that emancipation
                    had been granted; many hundreds of lives were sacrificed, a large amount of
                    property destroyed, and various atrocities were committed. This stimulated the
                    agitation in England, and in 1833 the Emancipation Act was passed, the period of
                    apprenticeship being ultimately reduced to four years. Of the £20,000,000
                    compensation, £6,161,927 was awarded to Jamaica, being about £19 a head on a
                    slave population of 309,338. The wisdom of the manner in which the emancipation
                    policy was carried out by England has been often questioned. During Sir Lionel
                    Smitns administration, on the 1st of August 1838, the apprenticeship came to an
                    end, and entire emancipation was effected by an Act of the assembly.
                    Difficulties arising between the British Government and the assembly as to the
                    Prisons Act, a bill was introduced by Mr Labouchere (Lord Taunton) into the
                    House of Commons to suspend the constitution of Jamaica, the rejection of which
                    measure occasioned the resignation of Lord Melbourne’s ministry. The dispute was
                    afterwards compromised, and under the government of Sir Charles Metcalfe an
                    improved state of things was brought about. Education and religious instruction
                    and better administration of justice were subjects of attention, together with
                    schemes of agriculture to develop the varied resources of the island. The want
                    of cheap and continuous labour was, however, a great obstacle. The introduction
                    of labourers from Africa was objected to in England as a renewal of the slave
                    trade. Coolie immigration was fenced about with such expensive restrictions by
                    the home Government that no large or comprehensive scheme was possible. The earl
                    of Elgin continued Sir C. Metcalfe’s policy, and a railway was opened, 12 miles
                    long, between Kingston and Spanish Town, but the prospects of the colony became
                    exceedingly gloomy under the effects of the legislation in 1846 equalizing the
                    duties on free and slave sugar. The advantages of slave labour in Cuba were so
                    great that the utmost economy and skill of practical resident planters in
                    Jamaica failed of success. Differences between the assembly, the council, and
                    the home Government on the means of retrenching the public expenditure, created
                    much bitterness of feeling, and most disastrous results were brought about,
                    affecting seriously the credit of the island, by the assembly refusing to
                    perform its functions and renew duties necessary for revenue. An outbreak of
                    cholera added to the confusion and gloom. The result of this controversy was
                    that the home Government offered an imperial guarantee for a loan of £500,000
                    and other financial assistance, conditionally on permanent provision being made
                    for official salaries, on the initiation of all money grants by the crown, and
                    on certain members of the legislature being held responsible for the expenditure
                    of the public money. Sir Henry Barkly had the task of carrying out these
                    arrangements. In 1854 the Incumbered Estates Act was passed, under which in
                    recent years considerable sales of property in Jamaica have taken place. During
                    the next decade the island was tranquil, but very much depressed. Many white
                    people, of a superior class, had left. Public business suffered by the
                    recriminations in the assembly, and by want of economy and good management
                    (causing annual deficits) of the public finances. But in 1865 an event occurred
                    which opened a perfectly new chapter in Jamaica history. On October 20 Governor
                    Eyre reported to the secretary of state (the present Lord Cardwell) a “serious
                    and alarming insurrection of the negro population.” In this despatch the letter
                    written by Dr Underhill, the secretary to the Baptist Society, was referred to
                    as causing public meetings to be held, and giving rise to excitement. Dr
                    Underhill subsequently asserted that it was through Governor Eyre his letter
                    became public. The letter referred to the distress among the population, to
                    alleged unjust taxation, to the alleged refusal of just tribunals, to the denial
                    of political rights to the emancipated negroes. The despatches of Governor Eyre
                    caused much discussion and excitement in England, and under date of 30th
                    December 1865 a royal commission was issued to inquire into the disturbances.
                    The commissioners—Sir Henry Storks (sent out as governor), Mr Russell Gurney,
                    and Mr J. B. Maule—began their work on January 23, 1866, and sat for fifty-one
                    days. They reported on the 9th April that the disturbances in St Thomas in the
                    east had their immediate origin in a planned resistance to lawful authority,
                    arising from the desire to obtain land free of rent, want of confidence in
                    tribunals, feelings of hostility towards political and personal opponents, while
                    not a few contemplated the death or expulsion of the white inhabitants. Had more
                    than a momentary success been obtained, the ultimate overthrow of the insurgents
                    would have been attended with a still more fearful loss of life and property.
                    The commissioners attributed the speedy termination of the outbreak to the
                    skill, promptitude, and vigour of Governor Eyre in the early stages; they viewed
                    the military and naval operations as prompt and judicious; but they thought
                    martial law was continued too long, and that the • punishments inflicted were
                    excessive. The commissioners expressed an opinion that the conduct of Gordon, a
                    member of the assembly, whose trial by court martial and execution caused great
                    controversy in England, had been such as to convince both friends and enemies of
                    his being a party to the rising, yet they could not see any sufficient proof
                    either of his complicity in the outbreak at Morant Bay, or of his having been a
                    party to a general conspiracy. The case was warmly taken up in England by the
                    Jamaica committee under the leadership of Mr J. S. Mill. A charge was made
                    against Mr Eyre, resulting in an elaborate exposition of martial law by Chief
                    Justice Cockburn, and the stoppage of the prosecution by the grand jury ignoring
                    the bill. On the 20th December 1866 the assembly passed an Act rendering it
                    lawful for the Queen to create and constitute a Government for the island; the
                    same was passed by the council on the 22d, and on the 23d it received the
                    governor’s consent.</p>
                <p>Thus the constitution which had existed for two hundred years was swept away. It
                    was composed at the time of a governor, a privy council, a legislative council,
                    an assembly of forty-seven elected members, and a paid body called the executive
                    committee, who were practically responsible ministers of the crown, holding
                    office at the governor’s pleasure. The present constitution is that of an
                    ordinary crown colony. It was established by an imperial Act, and an order in
                    council, dated 9th April 1866, and subsequent orders. There is only one chamber,
                    called a legislative council. In 1880 this consisted of the governor as
                    president, eight officials, (viz., colonial secretary, senior military officer,
                    attorney general, director of roads, collector general, auditor general,
                    assistant colonial secretary, and crown solicitor), and eight non-officials,
                    nominated by the crown,— all councillors holding office at the royal will and
                    pleasure. No proposal is admitted or debate allowed on any matter affecting
                    revenue, unless introduced by the governor or by his direction. Sir J. P. Grant
                    was governor from 1866 to 1874, and reforms and changes were vigorously
                    effected. The revenue was better collected. Irrigation and other public works
                    were begun. But the sugar industry has continued in a state of great depression,
                    though Sir A. Musgrave, who was appointed governor in 1877, reported in 1880
                    that the public debt had been reduced from £719,000 to £485,000 (excluding loans
                    for special purposes), that there had been no increase of taxation since 1867,
                    that savings banks deposits had increased from £58,913 in 1868 to £207,000 in
                    1879 (the Government paying interest at 4 per cent.), and that the industrious
                    negroes, especially those with small holdings, growing provisions, coffee,
                    cocoa, or possessing small sugar mills, were fairly prosperous. These results
                    are attributed by officials to the change from representative to crown
                    government, although the latter has been much criticized as too arbitrary, and
                    tending to a narrow officialism. The number of parishes for purposes of local
                    government has been reduced from twenty-two to fourteen. Each parish has its own
                    hospitals, almshouses, &amp;c., managed by its municipal board, the chairman of
                    whom is the custos, nominated by the governor. The members are appointed by the
                    custos, subject to the governor’s approval. Each parish also has a road board.
                    The judicial establishment consists of the chancellor (the governor), a
                    vice-chancellor and chief justice, two puisne judges of the supreme court,
                    attorney general, crown solicitor, &amp;c.; there are seven district courts,
                    somewhat on the model of county courts in England, the judges being barristers
                    sent out from England. There are also four stipendiary magistrates, and a police
                    magistrate for Kingston. The constabulary was placed on its present footing in
                    1867, and is modelled on the system of the Irish (semi-military) constabulary.
                    Parochial medical officers paid by Government attend the parochial institutions,
                    constabulary, and immigrants. These officers are <pb break="no"

                    is in telegraphic communication with England, and indeed with the world, and has
                    also an inland telegraphic service. The Government have purchased the 25 miles
                    of railway from Kingston to Old Harbour, and are about to construct 47 miles
                    more. Steam communication is very frequent between England, United States, and
                    the colony.</p>
