                    rend="smallcaps">Permon</hi> (1784-1838), Duchesse d’Abrantès, was born at
                    Montpellier, 6th November 1784. Her father was an army contractor, who allowed
                    his wife to take his daughters to Paris in order that they might make good
                    matches. They were lively, witty young ladies, and soon attracted to their hotel
                    a mixed society of officers. Madame Junot declared that Napoleon wished to marry
                    her mother; but there is no evidence for the truth of the story. But he gave
                    Laure Permon 100,000 francs when she married Junot, and after the birth of her
                    first child a house in the Champs-Élysées, with 100,000 francs to furnish it.
                    Her husband had extravagant tastes; but she was extravagant to recklessness,
                    contracting debts as rapidly as tradesmen would allow her to run them up. In
                    1805 she went with her husband to Lisbon, and, as she took it on her to
                    represent “female France,” her train was more expensive than that of a queen.
                    After she returned to Paris, she renewed her extravagance, and, opening her
                    drawing-room to the older families as well as to the new men of the empire, she
                    fell under suspicion. With Junot she went through the Spanish campaign, and
                    contrived to give pleasant balls and to hold drawing-rooms all along the route.
                    After her husband’s death she was forbidden to return to Paris, but she ignored
                    Napoleon’s order, returned, opened her house again, and attracted to it all the
                    celebrities of the day. Her poverty compelled her to retire to L’Abbaye-aux-Bois
                    when the empire ended; but she devoted herself to literature with much zeal. She
                    made social recollections from her own life her chief subject; her style was
                    free and flowing; and her articles, memoirs, and romances were widely read. She
                    died at Paris, 7th June 1838.</p>
