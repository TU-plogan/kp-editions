                <p><label type="entry">JERBOA</label>, a family of rodent mammals <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Dipodidae),</hi> chiefly characterized by the great length of the hind limbs
                    as compared with those in front, the disproportion being, in most cases, greater
                    even than in the kangaroos. Like the latter, the jerboas, or jumping mice, as
                    they are also called, raise themselves when disturbed on their hind legs, and
                    execute enormous leaps by the aid of a long muscular tail. When undisturbed,
                    however, they make use of all their <pb break="no"

                    employed by many species as hands for the conveyance of food to the mouth. The
                    jerboas, of which there are three genera and twenty-two species known, occur
                    chiefly throughout northern and central Africa, south-eastern Europe, and
                    central and southern Asia, while one genus <hi rend="italic">(Pedetes)</hi> is
                    confined to South Africa and another <hi rend="italic">(Jaculus)</hi> to North
                    America. Of the third genus <hi rend="italic">(Dipus)</hi> there are twenty
                    known species, a typical example of which is the Egyptian jerboa <hi
                    rend="italic">(Dipus segyptius).</hi> The length of its body is 8 inches, and of
                    its tail, which is long, cylindrical, and covered with short hair, terminated by
                    a tuft, 10 inches. Its front limbs are pentadactylous, and only 1 inch in
                    length, the hind pair three-toed and six times as long. When about to spring, it
                    raises its body by means of the hinder extremities, and supports itself at the
                    same time upon its tail, while the fore feet are so closely pressed to the
                    breast as to be scarcely visible. Hence probably the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dipus,</hi> or two-footed. It then leaps into the air and alights upon its four
                    feet, but instantaneously erecting itself, it makes another spring, and so on in
                    such rapid succession as to appear as if rather flying than running. It is a
                    gregarious animal, living in considerable colonies in burrows, which it
                    excavates with its nails and teeth in the sandy soil of Egypt and Arabia. In
                    these it remains during great part of the day, emerging at night in search of
                    the herbs on which it feeds. It is exceedingly shy, and this, together with its
                    extraordinary agility, renders it difficult to capture. The Arabs, however,
                    succeed, it is said, in this by closing up all the exits from the burrows with a
                    single exception, by which therefore they are forced to come, and over which a
                    net is placed for their capture. When confined, they will gnaw through the
                    hardest wood in order to make their escape. The Indian jerboa <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Dipus</hi><hi rend="italic">indiens)</hi> is also a nocturnal burrowing
                    animal, feeding chiefly on grain, which it stores up in underground
                    repositories, closing these when full, and only drawing upon them when the
                    supply of food above ground is exhausted. The natives in some parts of India are
                    in the habit of searching for and robbing those granaries. The South African
                    form, known as the spring haas or jumping hare of the colonists <hi
                    rend="italic">(Pedetes capensis),</hi> is the largest member of the family,
                    measuring about a foot in length, exclusive of the tail, which is somewhat
                    longer, and is bushy throughout. Its molar teeth are rootless, while its toes,
                    which are three in number on each hind foot, are armed with long hoof-like
                    nails. It is a powerful animal, nearly as large as a hare, and progresses when
                    pursued by a series of leaps, each usually from 20 to 30 feet in length. Those
                    jumping hares are found abundantly in the rocky plateaus of South Africa, where
                    colonies of them form extensive burrowings somewhat similar to the rabbit
                    warrens of Britain. Like other jerboas it is chiefly nocturnal, and occasionally
                    it does considerable injury to the grain crops on which it feeds. Of the
                    American genus <hi rend="italic">(Jaculus)</hi> there is only a single
                    species—the Labrador jumping mouse <hi rend="italic">(Jaculus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">hudsonius).</hi> It occurs over a wide area of North America,
                    extending from Missouri northward to Labrador, and from the Atlantic westward to
                    the Pacific coast. It resembles the spring haas, and differs from all other
                    jerboas in having the metatarsal bones separated, and also in having its feet
                    fivetoed. It is a small creature, measuring about 5 inches in length, exclusive
                    of the much longer and very rat-like tail, and lives chiefly in the
                    neighbourhood of woods and shrubby places, where it conceals itself by day but
                    roams in companies at night. Its agility is extraordinary; one kept in
                    confinement by General Davies took, he says, “progressive leaps of from 3 to 4
                    and sometimes of 5 yards”; while Audubon considered it as probably the most
                    agile of all wild animals. On the approach of winter the American jumping mouse
                    retires into its burrow, and there encloses itself within a hollow ball of mud,
                    in which it passes the cold season in a state of complete torpidity. The North
                    American Indians neither eat its flesh nor make any use of its skin.</p>
