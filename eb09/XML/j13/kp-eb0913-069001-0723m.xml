                    state, and on the W. by the Datiyâ, Gwalior, and Khaniya Dânâ states. Jhânsi
                    forms a portion of the hill country of Bundelkhand, sloping down from the
                    outliers of the Vindhyân range on the south to the tributaries of the Jumna on
                    the north. The extreme south is composed of parallel rows of long and
                    narrow-ridged hills. Through the intervening valleys the rivers of the district
                    flow down impetuously over ledges of granite or quartz. North of the hilly
                    region, the rocky granite chains gradually lose themselves in clusters of
                    smaller hills. The northern portion consists of the level plain of Bundelkhand,
                    distinguished for its deep black soil, known as <hi rend="italic">mdr,</hi> and
                    admirably adapted for the cultivation of cotton. The district is intersected or
                    bounded by three principal rivers—the Pahüj, Betwa, and Dhasân. There are many
                    minor streams, most of which are feeders of the Dhasân. The district is much cut
                    up, and portions of it are insulated by the surrounding native states.</p>
                <p>The census of 1872, taken over an area of 1567 square miles, returned a
                    population of 317,826, of whom (exclusive of non-Asiatics) 167,519 were males
                    and 150,216 females. As regards religion, 305,151 were Hindus, while only 12,417
                    were Mahometans. Five towns have a population exceeding 5000:—Mhow, 15,065;
                    Ranipur, 6326; Giirsarai, 5897; Barwa Sagar, 5556; and Bhânder, 5141. Jhansi, in
                    the nature of its soil, the character of its people, the poor means of
                    irrigation, and the want of good communication, is worse off than any other
                    district in the North-Western Provinces, except Lâlitpur. Out of a total area of
                    1,002,734 acres, only 428,348 acres were under cultivation. The principal crops
                    are <hi rend="italic">joAr, bdjra,</hi> cotton, <hi rend="italic">tili</hi> or
                    oilseed, <hi rend="italic">kodon</hi> (a kind of pulse), wheat, gram, and
                    barley. The most important product is the <hi rend="italic">al</hi> dye,
                    procured from the root of the <hi rend="italic">Morinda citrifolia,</hi> which
                    is only dug up every third year. The destructive <hi rend="italic">kilns</hi>
                    grass has proved as great a pest here as elsewhere in Bundelkhand. Jhansi is
                    specially exposed to blights, droughts, floods, hailstorms, epidemics, and their
                    natural consequence— famine. It is considered that famine may be feared on an
                    average every five years. The district imports grain, and in return exports the
                    <hi rend="italic">al</hi> dye and cotton. The 110 schools in 1870 taught 2235
                    pupils at a cost of £1247. The climate is hot and very dry, but not unhealthy.
                    The mean annual temperature for 1871 was 81° '7 Fahr. The average rainfall for
                    the ten years ending 1870 was 31 inches. The population are habitually underfed,
                    and consequently succumb readily to slight diseases.</p>
                <p>Nothing is known with certainty as to the history of this district before the
                    period of Chandel rule, about the 11th century of our era. To this epoch must be
                    referred the artificial reservoirs and architectural remains of the hilly
                    region. The Chandels were succeeded by their servants the Khangars, who built
                    the fort of Karâr, lying just outside the British lines. About the 14 th century
                    the Bundelas poured down upon the plains, and gradually spread themselves over
                    the whole region which now bears their name. The Mahometan <hi rend="italic"
                    >subahMrs</hi> were constantly making irruptions into the Bundela country; and
                    in 1732 Chhatarsâl, the Bundela chieftain, called in the aid of the Marhattâs.
                    They came to his assistance with their accustomed promptitude, and were
                    rewarded, on the rajas death in 1734, by one-third of his dominions. Their
                    general founded the city of Jhansi, and peopled it with inhabitants from Orchha
                    state. In 1806 the British protection was promised to the Marhatta viceroy, and
                    in 1814 the peshwa ceded to the East India Company his rights over Bundelkhand.
                    In 1853 Gan-gadhar Râo died childless, and his territories lapsed to the
                    British. The Jhansi state and the Jalaun and Chanderi districts were then,
                    formed into a superintendency. The widow of the late raja con» sidered herself
                    aggrieved because she was not allowed to adopt an heir, and because the
                    slaughter of cattle was permitted in the Jhansi territory. Reports were spread
                    which excited the religious prejudices of ' the Hindus. The events of 1857
                    accordingly found Jhansi ripe for mutiny. In June a few men of the 12th native
                    infantry seized the fort containing the treasure and magazine, and massacred the
                    European officers of the garrison. . Everywhere the usual anarchic quarrels rose
                    anion" the rebels, and the country was plundered mercilessly. The rani put
                    herself at the head of the rebels, and died bravely in battle. It was not till
                    November 1858, after a series of sharp contests with various guerilla leaders,
                    that the work of reorganization was fairly set on foot. Since that time Jhansi
                    has remained a British district, and famines and floods alone have disturbed the
                    prosperous course of civil administration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Jhansi,</hi> a city and fort in Gwalior state, NorthWestern
                    Provinces, India, in 25° 27' 30" N. lat. and 78° 37' E. long. A stone fort
                    crowns a neighbouring rock, and commands the town, as well as the British
                    outpost, Jhânsi Naoâbâd, which adjoins the city. It lapsed to the British in
                    1853, and during the mutiny was the scene of insurrection and massacre. In 1861
                    the town, fcrt, and surrounding territory beyond the Pahüj were handed over to
                    Gwalior state. The administrative headquarters of Jhânsi district is Jhânsi
                    Naoâbâd, which had a population in 1872 of 536 persons. The estimated population
                    of Jhânsi proper is 30,000.</p>
