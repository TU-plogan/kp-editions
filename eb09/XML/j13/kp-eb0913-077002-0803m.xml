                    Orleans April 13,1797. His father, who was a mechanic, being desirous of
                    improving the position of his son, destined the young Stanislas-Aignan for the
                    priesthood, and in preparation for that calling sent him to the seminary in his
                    native town. Here his extraordinary talent for the acquisition of languages
                    first displayed itself, and with his knowledge increased his repugnance to the
                    profession marked out for him. His favourite study at this time was Greek
                    literature, and so recognized did his scholarship become that, when he went to
                    Paris in 1821, he received the appointment of assistant professor of Greek at
                    the Collège de France. In the same year he published a translation of the <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Eλ0ι∕s <hi rend="italic">αρπαγή</hi> of Coluthus, of
                    which work· he subsequently brought out a new edition, with a Latin version and
                    notes. In later years'he was in the habit of saying that it was as the author of
                    this work that he would be best known by posterity,—another instance of the
                    common inability of authors to judge correctly of the relative merits of their
                    works. At this period his attention was drawn to the lectures being delivered by
                    Abel Rémusat on the Chinese language, and being attracted to the study he placed
                    himself under the tuition of that professor. In this new pursuit his progress
                    was -as marked and as rapid as formerly in Greek. From the first he, as if by
                    intuition, thoroughly mastered the genius of the language; and the complexity of
                    the characters and the peculiarities of construction, which to others have
                    always presented·serious difficulties) at once yielded to his ability and
                    diligence. In 1823 he published a translation in Latin of a part of the works of
                    Mencius, one of the nine classical books of the Chinese, and, though this volume
                    appeared within two years of his having taken up the study of the language, it
                    justified its publication by its success. A year later he produced a translation
                    of the modern Greek odes of Kalvos under the title of <hi rend="italic">La Lyre
                    patriotique de la Grèce.</hi> But such works were not profitable in a commercial
                    sense, and, being without any patrimony, Julien was glad to accept the
                    assistance of Sir William Drummond and others, until in 1827 he was appointed
                    sub-librarian to the French Institute.. In 1831 he was elected a member of
                    L’Académie des Inscriptions .et Belles-Lettres de ΓInstitut de France in the
                    place of Saint-Martin, and in the following year he succeeded Rémusat as
                    professor of Chinese at the Collège de France. For some years his studies had
                    been directed towards the dramatic and lighter literature of the Chinese, and in
                    rapid succession he now brought out translations of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hoei-lan-ki,</hi> or “L’histoire du cercle de craie,” a drama in which occurs a
                    curiously analogous scene to the judgment of Solomon; the <hi rend="italic">Pih
                    shay tsing Id; Blanche</hi><hi rend="italic">et Bleue, ou les deux couleuvres
                    fées</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Tchao-chi kou
                    eul,</hi> upon which Voltaire subsequently founded his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orphelin de la Chine.</hi> With the versatility which belonged to his genius,
                    he next turned, apparently without difficulty, to the very different style
                    common to Taouist writings, and translated in 1835, for the Oriental Translation
                    Fund, <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Livre des Recompenses</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et des Peines</hi> of Laou-tsze. About this time the cultivation
                    of silk-worms was beginning to attract attention in France, and by order of the
                    minister of agriculture Julien compiled, in 1837, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Resume</hi><hi rend="italic">des principaux traites Chinois sur la culture des
                    mûriers, et</hi><hi rend="italic">Γeducation</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    vers-a-soie,</hi> which was speedily translated into English, German, Italian,
                    and Russian.</p>
                <p>Nothing was more characteristic of his method of studying Chinese than his habit
                    of collecting every peculiarity of idiom and expression which he met with in his
                    reading; and, in order that others might reap the benefit of his experiences, he
                    published in 1841 a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Discussions</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">grammaticales sur certaines</hi><hi rend="italic">regies de
                    position</hi><hi rend="italic">qui, en Chinois, jouent la même</hi><hi

                    >lexigraphie</hi><hi rend="italic">Chinoise.</hi> Meanwhile in 1839 he had been
                    appointed joint keeper of the Bibliothèque Royal, with the especial
                    superintendence of the Chinese books, and shortly afterwards he was made
                    Administrateur du Collège de France.</p>
                <p>The facility with which he had learned Chinese, and the success which his
                    proficiency commanded, naturally inclined other less gifted scholars to resent
                    the impatience with which he regarded the mistakes into which they fell in their
                    translations from this most difficult language, and at different times bitter
                    controversies arose between Julien and his fellow Sinologues on the one subject
                    which they had in common. How envenomed were the disputes which thus arose may
                    be gathered from the following title of a work published in 1842 by Julien, <hi

                    de Vecrùure</hi> 2353 <hi rend="italic">ans avant J. C.</hi> In the same year
                    appeared from his busy pen a translation of the <hi rend="italic">Tao te
                    King,</hi> the celebrated work in which Laou-tsze attempted to explain his idea
                    of the relation existing between the universe and something which he called <hi
                    rend="italic">Taou,</hi> and on which the religion of Taouism is based. From
                    Taouism to Buddhism was a natural transition, and about this time Julien turned
                    his attention to the Buddhist literature of China, and more especially to the
                    travels of Buddhist pilgrims to India. In order that he might better understand
                    the references to Indian institutions, and the transcriptions in Chinese of
                    Sanskrit words and proper names, he began the study of Sanskrit, and in 1853
                    brought out his <hi rend="italic">Voyages</hi><hi rend="italic">des Pèlerins
                    Bouddhistes,</hi> the value of which work is much enhanced by the fruits of this
                    new instance of his extraordinary mental enterprise. The same remark applies to
                    the work which he published six year later entitled <hi rend="italic">Les
                    Avadânas, contes et</hi><hi rend="italic">apologues</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Indiens inconnus jusqu' à ce jour, suivis de poésies et de nouvelles
                    Chinoises.</hi> For the benefit of future students he disclosed his system of
                    deciphering Sanskrit words occurring in Chinese books in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Methode</hi><hi rend="italic">pour déchiffrer</hi> ei <hi rend="italic"
                    >transcrire les noms Sanscrits qui se rencontrent dans les livres Chinois</hi>
                    (1861). This work, which contains much of interest and importance, falls short
                    of the value which its author was accustomed to attach to it. It had escaped his
                    observation that, since the translations of Sanskrit works into Chinese were
                    undertaken in different parts of the empire, the same Sanskrit words were of
                    necessity differently represented in Chinese characters in accordance with the
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n804/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0804-0771"/> dialectical variations. No hard and fast rule can
                    therefore possibly be laid down for the decipherment of Chinese transcriptions
                    of Sanskrit words, and the effect of this impossibility was felt though not
                    recognized by Julien, who in order to make good his rule was occasionally
                    obliged to suppose that wrong characters had by mistake been introduced into the
                    texts. His Indian studies led to a controversy with M. Reinaud, which was
                    certainly not free from the gall of bitterness. Among the many subjects to which
                    he turned his attention were the native industries of China, and his work on the
                    <hi rend="italic">Histoire et</hi><hi rend="italic">fabrication</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de la porcelaine Chinoise</hi> is still, and is likely to remain,
                    a standard work on the subject. In another volume he also published an account
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Industries</hi><hi rend="italic">anciennes et modernes
                    de V empire Chinois</hi> (1869), translated from native authorities. In the
                    intervals of more serious undertakings he translated the <hi rend="italic">San
                    tseu King,</hi> or “Le Livre des trois mots”; <hi rend="italic">Thsien tseu
                    wen,</hi> or “Le Livre de mille mots”; “Les deux cousines”; “Nouvelles
                    Chinoises”; the <hi rend="italic">Ping chan ling yen,</hi> “Les deux jeunes
                    filles lettrées”; and the “Dialoghi Cinesi,” <hi rend="italic">Ji-tch</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">ang Peou-Veou-koa.</hi> The
                    last work of importance which proceeded from his pen was his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Syntaxe nouvelle de la langue Chinoise</hi> (1869). In these volumes he gives
                    the results of his study of the language, and has collected in them a vast array
                    of facts and of idiomatic expressions. A more scientific arrangement and
                    treatment of his subject would have added much to the value of this work, which,
                    however, contains a mine of material which amply repays exploration. One great
                    secret by which Julien acquired his grasp of the Chinese language was, as we
                    have said, his methodical collection of phrases and idiomatic expressions.
                    Whenever in the course of his reading he met with a new phrase or expression, he
                    entered it on a card which took its place in regular order in a long series of
                    boxes. At his death, which took place on the 20th February 1873, he left, it is
                    said, 250,000 of such cards, about the fate of which, however, little seems to
                    be known. In politics Julien was imperialist, and in 1863 he was made a
                    commander of the legion of honour in recognition of the services he had rendered
                    to literature during the empire. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r, k. d.)</hi> JULIERS.
