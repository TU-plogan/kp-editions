                    Arabic name Abu fl Walid Merwân ibn Janâh, was born at Cordova towards the close
                    of the 10th century, but spent his youth partly at the neighbouring Jewish town
                    of Lucena (Alisana), where he studied under Isaac ben Gikatila and Isaac ben
                    Saul. He appears not to have returned to Cordova till after the death of the
                    famous Hayyιij, the founder of a scientific Hebrew grammar based on the doctrine
                    of triliteral roots. Though not a personal disciple of Hayyùj, Abu fl Walid
                    adopted the general principles of his system, and early applied himself to the
                    task of completing and correcting the observations of his predecessor on the
                    subject of weak roots. While engaged in these studies he retired from Cordova
                    during the siege of the town by the Berber prince Suleiman (1013 ), and took up
                    his residence in Saragossa, where he published his first work, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kitâb</hi><hi rend="italic">el Mustalhik,</hi> so named because it
                    contained an <hi rend="italic">attempt to supply</hi> the omissions of Hayyùj.
                    The Jews of Saragossa were not favourably disposed to the new philology, and the
                    writings of Abu fl Walid were not only displeasing to men of the old school, but
                    involved him in bitter controversy with the professed disciples of Hayyιij, on
                    whose views he had presumed to improve. The most formidable of these antagonists
                    was Samuel Ibn Nagdela Hallevy, the prime minister of Granada. Abu Ί Walid had
                    much to suffer from the rancour of so influential an opponent, but he persisted
                    in his studies, which were finally crowned by the <pb break="no"

                    work of the first order, which is still consulted by scholars, and can never be
                    opened without admiration for the range and precision of the author’s
                    scholarship and the soundness &lt;of his philological method. There is more
                    Hebrew to be learned from Abu Ί Walid than from all the later rabbins <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> put together. Abu Ί Walid was essentially a philologist. He
                    had essayed poetry in his youth, was read in philosophy, and not only practised
                    as a physician but wrote on medicine; but the devotion of his life was
                    concentrated on the exact verbal study of Scripture. Armed with a thorough
                    knowledge of the language and grammatical system of the Arabs, as well as of the
                    dialects of Jewish Aramaic, he studied the Biblical idiom in the light of the
                    cognate Semitic tongues, and in a spirit of pure scholarship, free from
                    traditional prejudice.</p>
