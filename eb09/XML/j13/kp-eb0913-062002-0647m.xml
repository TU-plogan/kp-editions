                    south-west of Leipsic by rail, at the junction of the Leutra and Saale, in a
                    beautiful valley, surrounded by romantic hills, and dotted over with villages.
                    The town is tolerably well built, though the houses are quaint, and many of the
                    streets narrow. Besides the university buildings, the more interesting edifices
                    are the 15th century church of St Michael, with a tower 318 feet high, and
                    containing the bronze statue of Luther, originally intended for his tomb; the
                    college-church; the library; the old-fashioned town-house in the market-place;
                    the castle, built in 1620, where Goethe ψrote his <hi rend="italic"

                    Black Bear tavern (now a hotel), where Luther spent the night after his flight
                    from the Wartburg; and Weigel’s house. The <hi rend="italic">career,</hi> or
                    students’ prison, ceased to be used for academic discipline in 1880. In 1858,
                    the tercentenary of the inauguration of the university, the various houses in
                    Jena that had been occupied by illustrious men were marked by memorial tablets.
                    Close to the town are the Thuringian district court and the large lunatic
                    asylum—both built in 1879. Of the old fortifications there remain only four
                    towers and an ancient gateway; while the moat has been laid out as a promenade,
                    adorned with busts and statues. On the Hausberg to the east rises the gaunt and
                    legendary Fuchsthurm; and 2 miles to the west, on the Forstberg, is the tower
                    raised to the students of Jena who fell in the war against France, 1870-71.
                    Among the schools are a gymnasium opened in 187 6, and a commercial school. Jena
                    is the seat of an upper appeal court, of a statistical bureau for the Thuringian
                    states, and of a chamber of commerce. The town owes what prosperity it now has
                    to the presence of the university founded by the elector, John Frederick of
                    Saxony, whose statue stands in the marketplace. In 1547 that prince, while a
                    captive in the hands of Charles V., conceived the plan of erecting a university
                    at Jena, in place of that of Wittenberg, which he had forfeited. The academy,
                    founded accordingly at Jena in 1548 by the elector’s three sons, obtained the
                    necessary charter from the emperor Ferdinand I., and on February 2, 1558, was
                    formally inaugurated as a university. The students were most numerous about the
                    middle of the 18th century, when some 3000 attended; but the most brilliant
                    professoriate was under Duke Karl August, Goethe’s patron (1787-1806), when in
                    the different faculties Reinhold, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, Schlegel, Oken, and
                    Schiller read lectures. Founded as a home for the new religious opinions of the
                    16th century, Jena has always liberally granted a hearing to new teaching; and
                    it distances perhaps every other German university in the extent to which it
                    carries what are popularly regarded as the characteristics of German
                    student-life,—duelling, and the sentimental passion for <hi rend="italic"
                    >Freiheit.</hi> At the end of last and the beginning of the present century, the
                    opening of new universities, co-operating with the suspicions of the various
                    German Governments as to the democratic opinions which obtained at Jena,
                    militated against it, and the university has never regained its former
                    prosperity. In the session 1880-81 the teaching-staff numbered 80 members; in
                    the winter session 1879-80 the students numbered 481, and in the summer session
                    1880, 546. Amongst the numerous auxiliaries of the university may be mentioned
                    the library with 180,000 volumes; the seminaries of philology, theology, and
                    education; the institutes for chemistry, pharmacy, zoology, botany (with a
                    botanical garden), and meteorology (with an observatory in the garden of which a
                    bust of Schiller marks the spot where he wrote his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wallenstein')</hi>; the veterinary and agricultural institutions; and the
                    various physical and archaeological collections, which now occupy the castle. A
                    clinical institute and the several hospitals assist the study of medicine. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Jenaer Literaturzeitung,</hi> whose issue in its present form
                    began in 1874 under the patronage of the university, is the ultimate successor
                    of the first <hi rend="italic">Literaturzeitung für Deutschland,</hi> which
                    appeared at Jena in 1785. The manufactures of Jena, which are not important,
                    comprise cigars, pianos, cloth, woollens, cement, beer, and sausages. There is
                    some activity in the book-trade and in vine-growing; and the traffic of
                    wood-rafts on the Saale deserves mention. The population in 1875 was 9020.</p>
                <p>Jena appears to have possessed town-rights in 1029. At the beginning of the 14th
                    century it was in the possession of the margraves of Meissen, from whom it
                    passed in 1423 to the elector of Saxony. Since 1485 it has remained in the
                    Ernestine line of the house of Saxony. In 1662 it fell to Bernhard, youngest son
                    of the duke of Weimar, and became the capital of a small separate duchy.
                    Bernhard's line having become extinct in 1690, Jena was united with Eisenach,
                    and in 1741 reverted with that duchy to Weimar. In more modern times Jena has
                    been made famous by the defeat inflicted in the vicinity, on October 14, 1806,
                    by Napoleon upon the Prussian army under the duke of Brunswick</p>
