                    pseudonym. The first of the published letters with this signature was dated
                    January 21, 1769; the last, January 21, 1772. The entire series appeared in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Public Advertiser,</hi> a popular newspaper edited by
                    Woodfall, to whom a number of private letters were also addressed by the same
                    writer. These are ineluded in the collected and complete editions, as well as a
                    number of letters attributed on varying grounds, more or less satisfactory, to
                    Junius.</p>
                <p>The first of the letters was a sweeping attack on the •Government for the time
                    being. Its spirit may be judged from the concluding sentence; “They (posterity)
                    will not Relieve it possible that their ancestors could have survived or
                    recovered from so desperate a condition while a duke of Grafton was prime
                    minister, a Lord North chancellor of the exchequer, a Weymouth and a
                    Hillsborough secretaries of state, a Granby commander-in-chief, and a Mansfield
                    chief criminal judge of the kingdom.” He does not condescend to particulars, and
                    the letter might have passed unnoticed if Sir William Draper, a man of
                    considerable note, had not undertaken the defence of Lord Granby in answer to
                    it. A bitter controversy ensued, which rapidly degenerated into an exchange of
                    personalities, much to the disadvantage of Sir William. Then came letters to the
                    duke of Grafton, the prime minister, directed more against his private character
                    and conduct than his policy, the main charge against his Grace being his
                    abandonment of Wilkes, whom Junius treats throughout the letters as the champion
                    of the constitution, to be supported against the ministry and the crown. He
                    takes Blackstone, the author of the <hi rend="italic">Commentâmes,</hi> severely
                    to task for justifying the expulsion of Wilkes, whose cause he also espouses in
                    an altercation with Horne Tooke; and he omits no opportunity of denouncing
                    Luttrell, the elect of Middlesex. The address to the king, the most celebrated
                    of Junius’s compositions, after recapitulating the familiar charges of personal
                    pique and favouritism, calls upon his Majesty to summon his whole council
                    without consulting his minister: “Lay aside the wretched formality of a king,
                    and speak to your subjects with the spirit of a man and in the language of a
                    gentleman. Tell them you have been fatally deceived.” Many of the letters turn
                    on topics which have no longer the slightest interest. A long letter is
                    addressed to Lord Mansfield for bailing a man named Eyre. In another, equally
                    elaborate, this learned lord is accused of tampering with the common law by an
                    admixture of the civil law, which is now regarded as his highest praise; Junius
                    treats it as an attempt to undermine the liberties of England. He relies little
                    on argument or proof. His force is in his style. He commonly assumes his victim
                    to be what he wishes him to be thought, and produces the desired effect by
                    irony, sarcasm, or polished invective. One of his happiest figures of speech is
                    in the letter on the affair of the Falkland Islands: “Private credit is wealth;
                    public honour is security; the feather that adorns the royal bird supports his
                    flight; strip him of his plumage, and you fix him to the earth.” Although an
                    admirer of Lord Chatham, Junius agreed with Mr Grenville as to the right of
                    England to tax the colonies; and, although an uncompromising supporter of
                    popular rights, he was an advocate or apologist for rotten boroughs.</p>
                <p>The sensation Juniüs created in the political world may be inferred from the
                    manner in which the leading orators and statesmen of the day spoke of him. “How
                    comes this Junius,” exclaimed Burke, addressing the Speaker, “to have broke
                    through the cobwebs of the law, and to range uncontrolled, unpunished, through
                    the land! The myrmidons of the court have been long, and are still, pursuing him
                    in vain. They will not spend their time upon me or you. No, sir, they disdain
                    such vermin when the mighty boar of the forest who has broke through all their
                    toils is before them. But what will all their efforts avail! No sooner has he
                    wounded one than he lays down another dead at his feet For my part, when I read
                    his attack upon the king, I own my blood ran cold.” . . . . “Nor has he dreaded
                    the terrors of your brow, but he has attacked even you—he has—and I believe you
                    have no reason to triumph in the encounter. In short, after carrying away our
                    royal eagle in his pounces and dashing him against a rock, he has laid you
                    prostrate. King, lords, and commons are but the sport of his fury. Were he a
                    member of this House, what might not be expected from his knowledge, his
                    firmness, and integrity! He would be easily known by his contempt of all danger,
                    by his pointed penetration and activity.” Lord North spoke in the same strain:
                    “Why should we wonder that the great boar of the wood, this mighty Junius, has
                    broke through the toils and foiled the hunters! Though there may be at present
                    no spear that will reach him, yet he may be some time or other caught.”</p>
                <p>What added signally to his influence was the general belief of his contemporaries
                    that he was a man of rank and position, familiar with what was passing behind
                    the scenes in high places; and this belief arose not simply from the intimate
                    knowledge he showed of things and persons about the court and the principal
                    departments of the state, but from the lofty and independent tone that was
                    habitual and seemed natural to him,—as when he tells Sir William Draper, “I
                    should have hoped that even my name might carry some authority with it if I had
                    not seen how very little weight or consideration a printed paper receives even
                    from the respectable signature of Sir William Draper”; or when in private
                    letters to the publisher, after waiving all right to the profits of the
                    publication, he says: “As for <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n809/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0809-0776"/> myself, be assured that I am far above all
                    pecuniary views.” ... “You, I think, sir, may be satisfied that my rank and
                    fortune place me above a common bribe.”</p>
                <p>In the preface to the second volume of Bohn’s edition of 1855, no less than
                    thirty-seven persons are enumerated to whom the authorship has been attributed.
                    Contemporary opinion strongly inclined to Burke, whose power of assuming or
                    disguising style is proved by his <hi rend="italic">Vindication of Natural
                    Society;</hi> and, as his biographer Prior pointedly remarks, “contemporary
                    opinion, as formed from a variety of minor circumstances which do not come
                    within the knowledge of future inquirers, is perhaps, on such occasions, the
                    truest.” Dr Johnson, who had entered the lists against Junius, told Boswell: “I
                    should have believed Burke to be Junius, because I know no man but Burke who is
                    capable of writing these letters; but Burke spontaneously denied it to me.”
                    Burke told Reynolds that he knew Junius, and uniformly spoke of him as he would
                    hardly have spoken of himself. A very strong case was made out for Lord George
                    Sackville, on whom, after Burke’s denial, Sir William Draper’s suspicions
                    permanently fixed. Fox used to say that, although he would not take Singlespeech
                    Hamilton against the field, he would back him against any single horse. Boyd is
                    another candidate who did not lack supporters. A plausible claim was advanced
                    for the American General Lee, backed by three experts who pretended to detect
                    him by the handwriting. A famous expert, Imbert, gave a written certificate on
                    the same ground in favour of Horne Tooke; and another, Nether-clift, declared
                    that there was more of the Junius character in the handwriting of Mrs Dayrolles
                    (the alleged amanuensis of Lord Chesterfield) than in any other specimen
                    submitted to him as a possible performance by the great unknown. Other experts
                    declared confidently for other claimants. But the identity remained an open
                    question, and case after case was pronounced not proven, till the appearance of
                    Mr Taylor’s <hi rend="italic">Junius Identified</hi> in 1816, when Sir Philip
                    Francis immediately became the favourite, and during the next half century the
                    problem was pretty generally considered at an end.</p>
                <p>Prior to the publication, Mr Taylor called on Sir Philip to intimate what was
                    intended, and came away with the impression that he was rather pleased than
                    displeased with the intimation. In fact, he had been already playing Junius, and
                    he continued playing the part till his death in 1818. “His first gift,” writes
                    his second wife, whom he married in 1814, two years before <hi rend="italic"
                    >Junius Identified,</hi> “was an edition of Junius, which he bade me take to
                    my'room and not let it be seen or speak upon the subject; and his posthumous
                    present, which his son found in his bureau, was <hi rend="italic">Junius
                    Identified,</hi> sealed up and directed to me.” The real Junius might have
                    bequeathed a much more conclusive legacy. He writes to Woodfall, December 17,
                    1771: “When the book is finished, let me have a sett <hi rend="italic"
                    >(sic)</hi> bound in vellum, gilt, and lettered <hi rend="superscript"> f</hi>
                    Junius I. II.’ as handsomely as you can. The edges gilt, let the sheets be well
                    dried before binding, I must also have two setts in blue paper covers. This is
                    all the fee I shall ever require of you.” These were duly sent, and it would
                    have been something to the purpose had Francis bequeathed one of them to his
                    wife. Neither of them has turned up. The surviving son (by the first wife)
                    likewise claimed the authorship for the father as a source of pride to the
                    family, so that no evidence in their possession would have been kept back.</p>
                <p>Pitt told Lord Aberdeen (the fourth earl) that he knew who Junius was, and that
                    it was not Francis. On its being objected that the Franciscan theory had not
                    been started till after Pitt’s death, Lord Aberdeen replied <hi rend="italic"
                    >“that's stufff</hi> and proceeded to relate that he himself had once dined in
                    company with Francis when proofs of his being Junius were adduced before him,
                    that he had listened with evident pleasure, and at last exclaimed in a stilted
                    theatrical manner, “God! if men force laurels on my head, I’ll wear them.” His
                    immediate contemporaries remained unconvinced. Sir Fortunatus Dwarris states
                    broadly that no one who knew, heard, or read Francis thought him capable of
                    producing Junius. Lord Broughton confirmed this. Tierney said: “I. know no
                    better reason for believing the fellow to be Junius than that he was always
                    confoundedly proud of something, and no one could ever guess what it could
                    be.”</p>
                <p>Lord Stanhope, however, would admit no shadow of doubt upon the point, and Lord
                    Macaulay declared that all reasoning from circumstantial evidence was at an end
                    unless Francis were admitted to be Junius. Both these eminent authorities agree
                    in resting their case on similarity of handwriting, on the internal evidence of
                    style, and on five points which are summarily stated by Lord Macaulay in his
                    essay on Warren Hastings. As regards similarity of handwriting, there is one
                    plain test on which experts are agreed, namely, that “it is impossible for a
                    man, in order to disguise his writing, to write better than he does habitually”;
                    and the best penmanship of Junius is incomparably superior in fineness,
                    delicacy, and grace to the best of Francis, who wrote a large, coarse,
                    clerk-like hand. As regards style, the specimens culled from Francis’s speeches
                    and writings prove no more than that he, an assiduous imitator of Junius,
                    succeeded occasionally in catching the mannerism, without any one of the
                    distinctive merits, of his model. Lord Macaulay, not denying the inferiority,
                    endeavours to weaken the argument drawn from it by remarking that it may be
                    urged with at least equal force against every claimant that has ever been
                    mentioned, with the single exception of Burke. “And what conclusion,” he asks,
                    “after all, can be drawn from mere inferiority! Every writer must produce his
                    best work; and the interval between his best and his second best work may be
                    very wide indeed.” This undeniable truth might have been urged with equal force
                    by any pretender to a disputed authorship,—for example, by Theophilus Swift, the
                    dean’s cousin, when he claimed the authorship of the <hi rend="italic">Tale of a
                    Tub.</hi> Surely the strongest argument in favour of any given candidate is that
                    (tested by his known writings) he alone was equal to the authorship, and the
                    strongest argument against any given candidate that (tested in the same manner)
                    he was unequal to it. Francis put forth his full powers in his controversy with
                    Hastings, and his friend D’Oyly writes to him in 1778 that the public who had
                    followed the controversy allowed both to be good writers; “but, in their
                    opinion, he (Hastings) takes the lead so decidedly as to admit of no
                    comparison.”</p>
                <p>The five points (which have been logically resolved into three) remained
                    untouched till the publication of the memoirs of Sir Philip Francis by Parkes
                    and Merivale in 1867. This book entirely changed the aspect of the controversy
                    by showing that Francis’s position, opinions, interests, manner of life, and
                    tone during the Junian period were the reverse of what those of Junius might be
                    supposed to have been. During the whole of that period he was first clerk in the
                    war office under Lord Barrington. Born in Dublin, October 22, 1740, he was in
                    his thirtieth year when the famous letters commenced. He was the son of Dr
                    Francis, the translator of Horace, but had married under his station, and was
                    associating principally with his wife’s relatives and connexions. The habits of
                    his set may be collected from his letters, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>: “January
                    4, 1769: I am just returned from spending a riotous fortnight at Bath. Gravier
                    and two others filled a post-coach, which was dragged with no small velocity by
                    four horses. We <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n810/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0810-0777"/> travelled like gentlemen, and lived like rakes.”
                    February 12, 1771: “Tilman dined with me yesterday, and swallowed a moiety of
                    two bottles of claret.” . . . . “We lead a jolly kind of life. This night to a
                    concert, on Thursday to a ridotto, on Saturday the opera, and on Tuesday
                    following a grand private ball at the London Tavern.” July 26, 1771: “To-morrow
                    Godfrey, Tilman, another gent, and I set out upon a tour through Derbyshire, and
                    propose to reach Manchester.” They did not return till August 13, the day on
                    which Junius’s reply to Horne Tooke appeared. On June 25, 1771, in the very
                    thick of the Junian correspondence, Francis writes to a friend abroad: “For the
                    next three years I am likely enough to remain in my present state of
                    uninteresting indolence.”</p>
                <p>There is no trace at this time of any connexion with the newspapers, nor of any
                    earnest or sustained literary occupation. The only political personage we find
                    him in communication with was Calcraft, to whom he occasionally supplied scraps
                    of official news. By a startling coincidence, all the persons who had been kind
                    or useful to him in promoting his advancement, including Wood (to whom he owed
                    his clerkship), his chief (Lord Barrington), and Calcraft, were bitterly
                    assailed by Junius. The predilections of the pair, the substance and the shadow,
                    are as hard to reconcile as their antipathies. Junius had a high respect for
                    Wilkes’s judgment, and avows a liking for both the cause and the man. On
                    November 8, 1771, he wιites to Woodfall: “Show the dedication and preface of the
                    letters to Mr Wilkes, and, if he has any material objection, let me know.”
                    Francis, in his private correspondence, uniformly expresses the most unmitigated
                    contempt for Wilkes. He writes like one of the general public about Junius. Thus
                    on June 12, 1770, to his brother-in-law: “Junius is not known, and that
                    circumstance is perhaps as curious as any of his writings. I have always
                    suspected Burke; but, whoever he is, it is impossible he can ever discover
                    himself.” Sir William Draper, Junius’s first victim, was an old friend of the
                    Francis family, and in a letter dated Bath, January 28, 1769, Dr Francis writes
                    to Philip: “Give my love to Mr Calcraft. Tell him to expect a very spirited and
                    exceeding honourable defence of L. G—y (Granby) against the virulent Junius, by
                    our friend Sir W. D—r. [truly honour him for it.” Again, February 11, 1769:
                    “Poor Sir William! I am glad he is gone to Clifton, where he may eat his own
                    heart in peace. When he repeated to me some passages of his letter, I bid him
                    prepare his best philosophy for an answer. But who is this devil Junius, or
                    rather legion of devils 1 Is it not B—rke’s pen dipped in the gall of Sa—lie’s
                    heart I Poor Sir William !”</p>
                <p>One of Lord Macaulay’s five points is that Junius was “bound by some strong tie
                    <hi rend="italic">” to</hi> the first Lord Holland, the friend of Dr Francis and
                    the early patron of Philip. Now, in a fragment of autobiography (included in the
                    memoirs) it is stated that, long before the Junius letters, Dr Francis
                    considered himself grossly ill used by Lord Holland, and “was stung with the
                    idea of having been so long the dupe of a scoundrel.” “In this,” adds the son,
                    “I concurred with him heartily.” Another point, and a most important one, is
                    that Francis bitterly resented the appointment (over his head) of Mr Charnier to
                    the place of deputy secretary-at-war, and that to the resentment thus aroused
                    was owing the downright ferocity, tho brutal abuse (as Mr Merivalo calls it),
                    with which Lord Barrington was assailed by Junius under the signature of
                    Veteran. Laying out of tho account the fact that Lord Barrington had been the
                    object of Junius’s unrelenting attacks for more than two years before the
                    appointment of Charnier, it is sufficient to refer to Francis’s letter υf
                    January 24, 1772, to Major Baggs, in which he says: “You will have heard that Mr
                    DOyly has resigned his employment (of deputy). He did it while I was at Bath.
                    Immediately upon my return, my Lord Barrington was so good as to make me the
                    offer with many obliging and friendly expressions. I had, however, solid reasons
                    for declining the offer, and Mr Anthony Charnier is appointed.” He was obviously
                    looking out for an Indian appointment, and left the war office in the March
                    following, relying on Lord Barrington’s aid in procuring one. After relating in
                    the autobiography how he accidentally heard that Cholwell, one of the intended
                    commissioners for India, had declined the appointment, he proceeds: “It was the
                    king’s birthday, and Barrington was gone to court. I saw him the next morning;
                    and, as soon as I had explained my views, he wrote the handsomest and strongest
                    imaginable letter in my favour to Lord North. Other interests contributed, but I
                    owe my success to Lord Barrington.” After his arrival in India, Francis was in
                    the habit of writing long and confidential letters to Lord <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> Barrington, who, in 1777, writes to express his gratification at the good
                    understanding between Francis and Clavering. “I love you both so much that I
                    cannot wish youto continue long in a situation so painful though so creditable
                    to you.” One of the first visits Francis paid on his return was to Lord
                    Barrington at his country house. “It is the imputed folly,” urge the opponents
                    of the Franciscan theory, “not merely the imputed baseness of Francis that
                    startles us. He is represented systematically writing against every friend,
                    benefactor, and patron in succession, without a rational motive or an
                    intelligible cause.”</p>
                <p>As if the embarrassments of his position were not enough, he must have gone out
                    of his way to multiply them. The terms on which Junius stood with Sir William
                    Draper are well known. In a letter dated February 14, 1770, he describes Sir
                    John Burgoyne as “sitting down for the remainder of his life infamous and
                    contented.” On December 11, 1787, when Francis was attacked in the House of
                    Commons for having allowed himself to be included in the list of managers for
                    the impeachment of Warren Hastings, his personal enemy, he rose and stated that
                    the two persons whom he had consulted as the best judges of points of honour
                    were Sir William Draper and Sir John Burgoyne. Draper was dead, but Burgoyne
                    rose and handsomely responded to tho appeal, which, if Francis was Junius, has
                    been justly stigmatized as one of the strongest examples of gratuitous folly and
                    brazen impudence on record.</p>
                <p>That Earl Temple wrote or inspired Junius is a theory which has been maintained
                    in two able essays, and it derives plausibility from Pitt’s assertion that he
                    knew who Junius was, as well as from the language of the Grenville family, which
                    all points to Stowe as the seat of the mystery. The Right Hon. T. Grenville told
                    the first duke of Buckingham, who thought he had discovered the secret, that it
                    was no-news to him, but for family reasons the secret must be kept. He also
                    stated to other members of the family, subsequently to tho publication of <hi
                    rend="italic">Junius Identified.,</hi> that Junius was not either of the persons
                    to whom the letters had been popularly ascribed. Lord Grenville told Lord
                    Sidmouth that he (Lord G.) knew who Junius was. Lady Grenville told Sir Henry
                    Holland and Dr James Ferguson that she had hoard Lord Grenville state that he
                    knew who Junius was, and that it was not Francis. The handwriting of Countess
                    Temple (supposed to have acted as tho amanuensis of her lord) comes far the
                    nearest to the Junian hand of any that have been produced as similar to it,
                    especially as regards powers of penmanship; but evidence is altogether wanting
                    that Earl Temple, or any one about him, possessed tho required literary
                    qualifications and capacity. Tho authorship of the letters, therefore, remains a
                    mystery, and <pb break="no"
