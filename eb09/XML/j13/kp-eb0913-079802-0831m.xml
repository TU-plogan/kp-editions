                <p><label type="entry">JUTE</label> is a vegetable fibre which, notwithstanding the
                    fact that it has come under the notice of manufacturing communities only within
                    comparatively recent times, has advanced in importance with so rapid strides
                    that it now occupies among vegetable fibres a position, in the manufacturing
                    scale, inferior only to cotton and flax. The term jute appears to have been
                    first used by Dr Roxburgh in 1795, when he sent to the directors of the East
                    India Company a bale of the fibre which he described as “the jute of the
                    natives.” Importations of the substance had been made at earlier times under the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">pdt,</hi> an East Indian native term by which the
                    fibre continued to be spoken of in England till the early years of the 19th
                    century, when it was supplanted by the name it now bears. This modern name
                    appears to be derived from <hi rend="italic">jhot</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >jhout</hi> (Sanskrit, <hi rend="italic">jhat),</hi> the vernacular name by
                    which the substance is known in the Cuttack district, where the East India
                    Company had extensive roperies at the time Dr Roxburgh first used the term.</p>
                <p>The fibre is obtained from two species of <hi rend="italic">Corchorus</hi> (nat.
                    ord. <hi rend="italic">Tiliaceae),</hi><hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi

                    >olitorius,</hi> the products of both being so essentially alike that neither in
                    commerce nor agriculture is there any distinction made between them. These and
                    various other species of <hi rend="italic">Corchorus</hi> are natives of Bengal,
                    where they have been cultivated from very remote times for economic purposes,
                    although there is reason to believe that the cultivation did <pb break="no"

                    two species cultivated for jute fibre are in all respects very similar to each
                    other, except in their fructification and the relatively greater size attained
                    by <hi rend="italic">C. capsularis.</hi> The capsules or seed-pods in the case
                    of <hi rend="italic">C. capsularis</hi> are globular, rough, and wrinkled, while
                    in <hi rend="italic">C. olitorius</hi> they are slender quill-like cylinders, a
                    very marked distinction, as may be noted from fig. 1, in which <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> show the capsules of <hi rend="italic">C.
                    capsularis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C. olitorius</hi> respectively. Fig. 2
                    represents a flowering top of <hi rend="italic">C. olitorius.</hi> The two
                    plants are thus botanically defined :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cοrchοrus</hi><hi rend="italic">capsularis.</hi> —Annual; 5-10
                    feet; calyx deeply 5-cleft; petals 5; leaves alternate, oblong, acuminate,
                    seιτated, two lower seι∙ratures terminating in narrow filaments; peduncles
                    short; flowers whitish-yellow, in clusters opposite the leaves; capsules
                    globose, truncated, wrinkled, and rnuricated, 5-celled; seeds few in each cell,
                    without transverse partitions; in addition to the 5-partite cells, there are
                    other 5 alternating, smaller and empty.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Corchorus</hi><hi rend="italic">olitorius.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> Annual; 5-6 feet; erect; leaves alternate,
                    ovate-acuminated, serrated, the two lower serratures terminated by a slender
                    filament; peduncles 1-2 flowered; calyx 5-sepalled; petals 5; capsules nearly
                    cylindrical, 10-ribbed, 5-celled, 5-valved; seeds numerous, with nearly perfect
                    transverse septa; flowers small, yellow.</p>
                <p>Both species are cultivated in India, not only on account of their fibre, but
                    also for the sake of their leaves, which are there extensively used as a
                    pot-herb. The use of <hi rend="italic">C. olitorius</hi> for the latter purpose
                    dates from very ancient times, if it may be identified, as some suppose, with
                    the mallows (∏∙⅛P) mentioned in Job xxx. 4, “Who cut up mallows by the bushes.”
                    It is certain that the Greeks used this plant as a pot-herb; and by many other
                    nations ground the shores of the Mediterranean this use of it was, and is still,
                    common. Throughout Bengal the name by which the plants when used as edible
                    vegetables are recognized is <hi rend="italic">nalitd∙,</hi> when on the other
                    hand they are spoken of as fibre-producers it is generally under the name <hi
                    rend="italic">pat.</hi> Both species are cultivated, on account of the fibre
                    they yield, in the greater part of Bengal. The cultivation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >C. capsularis</hi> is most prevalent in central and eastern Bengal, while in
                    the neighbourhood of Calcutta, where, however, the area under cultivation is
                    limited, <hi rend="italic">C. olitorius</hi> is principally grown. In 1872, a
                    year which showed an extraordinary development of the cultivation, there were
                    returned 921,000 acres as under jute in Bengal, to which Pubna contributed
                    122,000, Dinajpur 117,000, and Rangpur 100,000 acres respectively.</p>
                <p>Hitherto jute has not been cultivated to any considerable extent in localities
                    other than Bengal. From remote times it has been grown in the Hankow district of
                    China, but not largely. In the United States of America the cultivation of the
                    plants has also been introduced, but it has not made much progress. Recently
                    considerable attention has been given to the culture of the plant in Egypt, and
                    in the Dundee trade report of the 23d March 1881 there occurs the following
                    statement :—“Some samples of jute grown in Egypt are being shown here. Reports
                    on quality are varied, but, considering it is a first attempt, on the whole
                    satisfactory. It proves beyond a doubt that Egypt is capable of producing this
                    material, and for the trade of the district this is a matter of great
                    importance, as having the fibre grown near at hand will enable our manufacturers
                    to compete more successfully in all markets with the Indian mills.”</p>
                <p>A hot moist climate with abundant rainfall and rich alluvial soil appear to be
                    the conditions most favourable for the successful cultivation of the jute
                    plants. The land requires to be well tilled and abundantly manured, and, the
                    ground being so prepared, the general time of sowing the seed throughout
                    northern and eastern Bengal extends from about the middle of March to the end of
                    May. The seed is sown broadcast on the prepared ground, the young plants are
                    thinned out to G inches apart, and the ground carefully weeded. The stalks are
                    ready for cutting down between the middle of August and the middle of October.
                    As a rule the plants are cut down close to the root with a kind of bill-hook or
                    sickle, and the fibre is obtained best in quality when the crop is secured in
                    the flower. It is, however, common to allow the crop to run to seed and even to
                    ripen seed before cutting, a practice which renders the resulting fibre hard and
                    woody, thus intensifying one of the principal drawbacks of the jute fibre.</p>
                <p>The fibre is separated from the stalks by the process <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n833/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0833-0800"/> of retting practised in the case of flax, hemp,
                    &amp;c. (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Flax,</hi> vol. ix. p. 294). In certain
                    districts of Bengal it is the practice to stack the crop for a few days previous
                    to retting, during which period the leaves drop off the stalks, and otherwise
                    the stalks themselves are thereby brought into a condition for more rapid
                    retting. The general practice, however, is to tie the crop into bundles
                    sufficient for one man to carry, and to place these at once in water for the
                    purpose of retting. Pools and ponds of stagnant water are preferred for retting
                    where such are available, but the process is also carried on in the water of
                    running streams. The period necessary for the completion of the retting process
                    varies much according to the temperature and condition of the water, and may be
                    said to occupy from two or three days up to a month. The stalks are examined
                    periodically to test the progress of the retting operation, and when it is found
                    that the fibres peel off and separate readily from the woody portion of the
                    stalk, the operation is complete, and the bundles are withdrawn. The following
                    is a description of the method generally practised for separating the fibre from
                    the stalks. “The proper point being attained, the native operator, standing up
                    to his middle in water, takes as many of the stalks in his hands as he can
                    grasp, and, removing a small portion of the bark from the ends next to the
                    roots, and grasping them together, he strips off the whole with a little
                    management from end to end without either breaking stern or fibre. Having
                    prepared a certain quantity into this half state, he next proceeds to wash off:
                    this is done by taking a large handful; swinging it round his head he dashes it
                    repeatedly against the surface of the water, drawing it through towards him so
                    as to wash off the impurities, then with a dexterous throw he fans it out on the
                    surface of the water and carefully picks off all remaining black spots. It is
                    now wrung out so as to remove as much water as possible, and then hung up on
                    lines prepared on the spot to dry in the sun.” The separated fibre is then
                    washed, sun-dried, and made up into hanks, and so is ready for the market. In
                    favourable circumstances the produce of cleaned fibre amounts, on an average, to
                    about 6 maunds per beegah (13∣ cwts. per acre), but official returns from
                    various districts show differences ranging from 5 to 26 or even 30 cwts. per
                    acre. The cost of cultivation also varies much in different localities.
                    According to the official report of Hem Chunder Kerr, it is as much as Rs. 17
                    per beegah (about <hi rend="italic">£2,</hi> 12s. per acre) in Chittagong, and
                    as low as R. 1 (or 3s. per acre) in Manbhum; but such estimates are obviously of
                    little value, as the cultivation is carried on by the ryots without the aid of
                    hired labour, and forms generally only one among the various cultivated products
                    of the land by which a livelihood is obtained. Jute, however, is certainly one
                    of the most cheaply raised and prepared of all fibres; and to this fact more
                    than to any special excellency of character it possesses is due its now
                    extensive employment as a manufacturing staple.</p>
                <p>The characters by which qualities of jute are judged are principally colour,
                    lustre, softness, strength, length, firmness, uniformity, and cleanness of
                    fibre. The best qualities of jute are of a clear white yellowish colour, with a
                    fine silky lustre, soft and smooth to the touch, and fine, long, and uniform in
                    fibre. As a general rule the root ends are harsher and more woody than the
                    middle and upper portions, but in fine jute this distinction is not so
                    noticeable as in less valuable qualities. In length the fibre varies from 6 to 7
                    feet, but occasionally it is obtained to a length of 14 feet, and, generally
                    speaking, in proportion to the length of the fibre is its fineness of quality.
                    Inferior qualities of jute are brownish in colour and, especially at the root
                    ends, harsh and woody, with much adhering dark cortical matter and other
                    impurities. The fibre is decidedly inferior to flax and hemp in strength and
                    tenacity; and, owing to a peculiarity in its microscopic structure, by which the
                    walls of the separate cells composing the fibre vary much in thickness at
                    different points, the single strands of fibre are of unequal strength. Recently
                    prepared fibre is always stronger, more lustrous, softer, and whiter than such
                    as has been stored for some time,—age and exposure rendering it brown in colour
                    and harsh and brittle in quality. Jute, indeed, is much more woody in texture
                    than either flax or hemp, a circumstance which may be easily demonstrated by its
                    behaviour under appropriate reagents; and to that fact is due the change in
                    colour and character it undergoes on exposure to the air. The fibre bleaches
                    with facility, up to a certain point, sufficient to enable it to take brilliant
                    and delicate shades of dye colour, but it is with great difficulty brought to a
                    pure white by bleaching. A very striking and remarkable fact, which has much
                    practical interest, is its highly hygroscopic nature. While in a dry position
                    and atmosphere it may not possess more than 10 per cent, of moisture, under damp
                    conditions it will absorb up to 30 per cent, or thereby.</p>
                <p>As already stated, its commercial distinction is based on the botanical species
                    of plant from which the fibre is prepared; but in the Calcutta market a series
                    of commercial staples are recognized based on the districts whence they are
                    drawn, the values of which bear a pretty constant relation to each other. These
                    classes, in the order of quality, are :— (1) <hi rend="italic">Uttariyd</hi> or
                    northern jute, coming from Rangpur, Goalpara, Bogra, and the districts north of
                    Sirajganj;— for length, colour, and fineness, this is unequalled; (2) <hi
                    rend="italic">Deswal</hi> or Sirajganj jute, which is valued on account of its
                    softness, bright colour, fineness, and strength,—in the last characteristic it
                    is superior to Uttariyà jute; (3) <hi rend="italic">Desi</hi> jute comes from
                    Hooghly, Bardwan, Jessore, and the 24 Parganas; (4) <hi rend="italic">Deord</hi>
                    jute is produced in Faridpur and Bakarganj,—it is a strong coarse dark and sooty
                    fibre, used principally for rope-making. The other qualities recognized in
                    Calcutta are—(5) <hi rend="italic">Narainganji</hi> jute from Dacca, a strong
                    soft long fibre, of inferior colour; (6) <hi rend="italic">Bdkrabadi</hi> jute
                    from Dacca, of fine colour and softness; (7) <hi rend="italic">Bhatial</hi> jute
                    from Dacca, very coarse but strong, and very suitable for rope-making; (8) <hi
                    rend="italic">Karimganji</hi> jute from the Mymensing district, a long, strong,
                    and well-coloured staple; (9) <hi rend="italic">Mirganji</hi> jute, the produce
                    of Rangpur, harsh and woody from over-ripeness of the stalks; and (10) <hi
                    rend="italic">Jangipuri</hi> jute of Patna, a short, weak, and foxy-coloured
                    fibre of very inferior quality. In the European markets these distinctions are
                    not much remarked, traders’ marks and classification being the accepted
                    standards of quality and condition. Moreover, it is only the finer qualities
                    that are exported, the lower class jute being used locally for gunny bags,
                    ropes, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>At Calcutta and various other centres the jute received from local traders is
                    sorted, packed, and pressed into bales of 400 ft&gt; for shipment to the English
                    and other markets. Woody and hard root ends, which will not press into bales,
                    are cut off and sold separately under the name of “cuttings.” “Jute,”
                    “cuttings,” and “rejections” (the last the name of the low-class fibre) are the
                    three heads under which jute fibre is entered in the trade and import lists of
                    Western countries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Jute Trade of Calcutta.—</hi> The importation of jute into
                    Europe commenced about the end of the last century, but so recently as that
                    period it was confused with hemp. During the earlier years of the present
                    century the imports slowly increased, but, as Hem Chunder Kerr says, “the
                    shipments were so insignificant that little or no notice was taken of them by
                    the custom house authorites.” Since that time a great revolution has taken
                    place. In 1829 the custom house assigned to jute a separate heading, in which

                    (364 cwt.). From that time the growth of the trade has been upon the whole
                    steady and continuous, and marked by extraordinary progress, as will be evident

                <p>Excepting a comparatively insignificant fraction, the whole of these exports of
                    raw jute have been consigned to Great Britain, the United States of America
                    being the only other country which bulks at all largely in the returns.
                    Occasional shipments were made to America from 1829 onwards; but the quantities
                    were small and very fluctuating till about 1850, up to which year frequently the
                    total imports for a year were under 1000 cwts. From 1850-51 onward a rapidly
                    increasing but still fluctuating demand for raw jute has grown up in the United
                    States, till in 1872-73 the American demand amounted to 307,718 cwts. of jute
                    and 1,158,895 cwts. of cuttings and rejections. An importation of 3072 cwts. was
                    made into France in 1836-37, but there was no steady demand for jute in that
                    country till 1845-46, when 9708 cwts. were taken. Since that time there has been
                    a varying but upon the whole increasing demand, and in 1872-73 there were
                    imported 137,126 cwts. The only other considerable shipments are to East Indian
                    ports; but, taken altogether, it may be said that quite nine-tenths of the raw
                    jute which leaves Calcutta is primarily disposed of in the British market.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Jute Manufacture.—</hi> Long before jute came to be known and
                    to occupy a prominent place amongst the textile fibres of Europe, it was in
                    extensive use and formed the raw material of a large and important industry
                    throughout the regions of eastern Bengal, in which the plant was cultivated.
                    Among the native Hindu population the spinning and weaving of jute was, and
                    still is, in various districts, the most important domestic industry. The forms
                    into which the material is worked among the Hindu population—for the Mussulmans
                    do not use jute—are cordage, cloth, and paper. The cordage is twisted into all
                    sizes, from the fine thread used for weaving up to strong ropes for the hawsers
                    of native boats and for tying bales. The more important native application of
                    jute is, however, in the manufacture of gunny cloth and gunny bags, used in
                    extraordinary quantity and number throughout the world, for packing and carrying
                    all manner of goods and merchandise, and by the natives themselves for clothing
                    and numerous domestic purposes. The ordinary mode of weaving gunnies for bags
                    and other coarse purposes is thus described :—“Seven sticks or chattee
                    weaving-posts, called <hi rend="italic">tand pard</hi> or warp, are fixed upon
                    the ground, occupying the length equal to the measure of the piece to be woven,
                    and a sufficient number of twine or thread is wound on them as warp called <hi
                    rend="italic">tand.</hi> The warp is taken up and removed to the weaving
                    machine. Two pieces of wood are placed at two ends, which are tied to the <hi
                    rend="italic">ohari</hi> and <hi rend="italic">okher</hi> or roller; they are
                    made fast to the <hi rend="italic">khoti.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">belut</hi>
                    or treadle is put into the warp; next to that is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sarsul</hi>; a thin piece of wood is laid upon the warp, called <hi
                    rend="italic">chupari</hi> or regulator. There is no sley used in this, nor is a
                    shuttle necessary; in the room of the latter a stick covered with thread called
                    <hi rend="italic">singa</hi> is thrown into the warp as woof, which is beaten in
                    by a piece of plank called <hi rend="italic">beyno,</hi> and as the cloth is
                    woven it is wound up to the roller. Next to this is a piece of wood called <hi
                    rend="italic">khetone,</hi> which is used for smoothing and regulating the woof;
                    a ,stick is fastened to the warp to keep the woof straight.” Gunny cloth is
                    woven of numerous qualities, according to the purpose to which it is'devoted.
                    Some kinds are made close and dense in texture, for carrying such seed as poppy
                    or rape and sugar; others less close are used for rice, pulses, and seeds of
                    like size, and coarser and opener kinds again are woven for the outer cover of
                    packages and for the sails of country boats. There is a thin close-woven cloth
                    made and used as garments among the females of the aboriginal tribes near the
                    foot of the Himalayas, and in various localities a cloth of pure jute or of jute
                    mixed with cotton is used as a sheet to sleep on, as well as for wearing
                    purposes. To indicate the variety of uses to which jute is applied, the
                    following quotation may be cited from the official report of Hem Chunder Kerr as
                    applying to Midnapur. “The articles manufactured from jute are principally (1)
                    gunny bags; (2) string, rope, and cord; (3) <hi rend="italic">kampa,</hi> a
                    net-like bag for carrying wood or hay on bullocks;</p>

                    cloth;</p>
                <p>(5) <hi rend="italic">dola,</hi> a swing on which infants are rocked to sleep;

                    for little earthen pots, &amp;c.; (7) <hi rend="italic">dulina,</hi> a floor
                    cloth; (8) <hi rend="italic">beera,</hi> a small circular staj·d for wooden
                    plates used particularly in <hi rend="italic">poojahs;</hi> (9) painter’s brush
                    and brush for white-washing; (10) <hi rend="italic">ghunsi,</hi> a waist-band
                    worn next to the skin; (11) <hi rend="italic">gochh-dari,</hi> a hair-band worn
                    by women; (12) <hi rend="italic">mukbar,</hi> a net bag used as muzzle for
                    cattle; (13) <hi rend="italic">parchula,</hi> false hair worn by players; (14)
                    <hi rend="italic">τakhi∙bandhan,</hi> a slender arm-band worn at the

                    sticks burned at <hi rend="italic">poojahsT</hi> Raw jute fibre and old gunnies
                    are also largely used throughout the presidency in the manufacture of paper.</p>
                <p>The introduction of jute factories on the European system into Bengal has had a
                    considerable influence on the domestic manufacture of jute, notwithstanding that
                    a vast industry is still prosecuted in the ancient Hindu manner.</p>
                <p>The following extracts from official tables will show the extent of this
                    particular branch of industry.</p>
                <p>The number of gunny bags imported into Calcutta amounted in 1877-78 to
                    21,446,000, in 1878-79 to 26,380,000, and in 1879-80 to 20,488,000.</p>
                <p>The different districts which contributed chiefly to the trade during these three
                    years are the following :—</p>

                <p>It will be seen that the exports of bags exceed the quantity sent into Calcutta
                    by no less than 57,938,000 bags in 1877—78, 56,255,000 in 1878-79, and
                    71,796,000 in 1879-80. This is of course due to the large manufacture in
                    Calcutta and the suburbs.</p>
                <p>The import trade of Calcutta in gunny cloth during the three years referred to

                    and 88,000 in 1879-80.</p>
                <p>Out of the total supply, that of power-loom manufacture was 43,000 pieces in
                    1879-80, as compared with 19,000 pieces in 1878-79. The hand-made pieces
                    amounted to 45,000, as compared with 51,000 in 1878-79.</p>

                <p>Besides the registered supplies mentioned above, the returns show a large
                    quantity of power-loom gunny cloth, amounting to 664,000 pieces, sent up country
                    from Calcutta mills without passing the port commissioners wharves. The gross
                    total of gunny cloth exported from Calcutta was 54,731,000 yds. in 1878-79, and
                    61,468,000 yds. in 1879-80.</p>
                <p>Formerly America was the largest customer for Indian jute manufactures, very
                    large quantities of gunny having been consigned to the United States for packing
                    cotton and other merchandise. That demand has, however, very largely fallen off,
                    and now the Australian colonies and Burmah and the various East Indian ports are
                    the principal places to which the manufactured articles are sent from
                    Calcutta.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">European Trade and Manufacture.</hi> —The occasional parcels of
                    jute which were sent to the European market by the East India Company previous
                    to the year 1830 appear to have been principally used for the making of door
                    mats and similar purposes; but the whole quantity was at that date, and, as will
                    be seen by the table, p. 801, for several years thereafter, quite insignificant.
                    Some part of these imports found their way to Abingdon in Oxfordshire, a town in
                    which the manufacture of carpets, sacking, and cordage was extensively
                    prosecuted, and to the manufacturers of that town is due the credit of being the
                    first in Great Britain to experiment with the fibre, making it into yarn and
                    cloth. In 1833 a quantity of dyed yarn was sent from Abingdon to Dundee, then an
                    important centre of the heavier flax manufactures, and there it attracted a good
                    deal of attention. Consignments were soon thereafter received direct at Dundee
                    and experimented with, but little or no real progress was made for a
                    considerable time, for jute forms no exception to the general rule that the
                    introduction of· new textile fibres is attended with many difficulties before a
                    successful issue is reached. The many unsuccessful attempts to convert it into
                    yarn caused it to be disliked by the manufacturer, and the bad reputation it had
                    acquired as to strength and durability made it no favourite in public
                    estimation. Indeed, so far was prejudice carried against it that some of the
                    manufacturers banished the fibre entirely from their works, fearing it might
                    prove prejudicial to their interests. Among the circumstances which added
                    materially to the rapid development of the jute trade, lying outside its natural
                    growth owing to cheapness and other causes, were the war with Russia in 1854-56,
                    which temporarily cut off the supplies of Russian flax and hemp, and the cotton
                    famine which resulted from the civil war in America in 1861-63. Leaving these
                    circumstances out of account, however, the growth of the jute trade has been
                    remarkable and steady, as will be seen by the following table, embracing a
                    period of fifteen years from 1865 to 1880, during which no such cause as those
                    alluded to above affected the trade.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufacture.—</hi> In their general features the spinning and
                    weaving of jute fabrics do not differ essentially as to machinery and processes
                    from those employed in the manufacture of hemp and heavy flax goods. Owing,
                    however, to the woody and brittle nature of the fibre, it has to undergo a
                    preliminary treatment peculiar to itself. The pioneers of the jute industry, who
                    did not understand this necessity, or rather who did not know how the woody and
                    brittle character of the fibre could be remedied, were greatly perplexed by the
                    difficulties they had to encounter, the fibre spinning badly into a hard, rough,
                    and hairy yarn owing to the splitting and breaking of the fibre. This
                    peculiarity of jute, coupled also with the fact that the machinery on which it
                    was first spun, although quite suitable for the stronger and more elastic fibres
                    for which it was designed, required certain modifications to sιiit it to the
                    weaker jute, was the cause of many annoyances and failures in the early days of
                    the trade.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Batching or Softening.—</hi> The introduction of this
                    preliminary process constituted the first important step in the practical
                    solution of the difficulties of jute spinning. The process, in a great measure,
                    supplies artificially that in which jute is naturally deficient. The mode of
                    batching originally adopted was to divide the rolls or heads, taken from the
                    bale, into four or five parts, each being about what a hand could grasp. These
                    divisions, called stricks, ∣ were doubled up with a slight turn at the centre,
                    and laid out in the floor in double rows, the roots and crop ends of the stricks
                    overlapping each other, in the centre of the batch; each row when completed

                    ideas of the person superintending, a mixture of ashes or other ingredients,
                    supposed to have a softening tendency. These batches, which generally contained
                    from 4 to 5 tons each, were allowed to' lie from twenty-four to forty-eight
                    hours, at the end of which time a slight fermentation caused by the oil and
                    water was induced, and the batch was then considered ready for the preparation
                    process. The hand process has now, however, been superseded by a more speedy and
                    economical appliance. In order to get the fibre into that soft pliant condition
                    so essential to the spinning operation, jute softeners or mangles have been
                    introduced. Of these machines there are various types, but in their general
                    outline and principle they are closely allied to each other. The machine
                    consists of a double row of fluted rollers, generally from twelve to eighteen
                    pairs, the one placed on the top of the other, so that the flutes longitudinally
                    intersect each other. The rollers, when the machine is in motion, have a
                    rippling reciprocating action, by which means the material passing through is
                    rendered soft and pliant. In connexion with this machine, and with the view of
                    dispensing with the more cumbrous and expensive mode of batching already
                    described, an apparatus is attached, and is so adjusted that the jute on passing
                    through the rollers receives with great precision a proper allowance of oil and
                    water. The quantity of oil used varies from half a gallon to one gallon per 400
                    K&gt; bale, and the quantity of water, according as the atmosphere is dry or
                    damp, is from 12 to 18 per cent, of the weight of material operated on.</p>
                <p>Such qualities of jute as retain rough and hard root ends or “butts” require to
                    undergo another preliminary process termed “snipping,” by which these “butts”
                    are combed out, and separated from the remainder of the fibre; these, being torn
                    and split up into the form of tow, may be so used in the subsequent preparing
                    and spinning operations. A good deal of jute is now prepared at Calcutta by the
                    snipping process instead of by cutting, the butts being thereby secured in a
                    more useful and valuable condition.</p>
                <p>The material, after being softened, and, if necessary, snipped, is passed on to
                    the assorters, whose duty is to select the different qualities for the special
                    uses.to which they may be applied.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spinning.—</hi> All the subsequent processes through which jute
                    passes are essentially the same as those employed in the corresponding heavy
                    manufactures of flax (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Linen). As</hi> in the case of
                    that fibre, there are two distinct processes of preparing yarn, viz., by “line”
                    spinning and by “tow” spinning. If intended for line spinning, the long jute
                    fibre is cut or rather broken into lengths of from 20 to 24 inches. It is then
                    ready for hackling, spreading, drawing, and roving, just as in the parallel case
                    of flax “line” spinning. Similarly in the tow spinning the fibre is first
                    submitted to the breaker card, then the finishing card, after which it passes
                    through the drawing frames and the roving frame, and then, as “rove” or rovings,
                    it is ready for the spinning frame; but, in the case of some very heavy yarns,
                    the material is spun direct on the roving frame.</p>
                <p>The weights of jute yarn are estimated by the spindle of 14,400 yards, and the
                    finest kinds spun are about “2 5&gt; yarn,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> yarn
                    weighing 2 tt&gt; per spindle. The minimum weight commonly found in the market
                    is, however, 7 lb, from which the yarn lists rise in sizes up to 40 lb, or to
                    very much heavier weights for special purposes. The ruling feature of jute is
                    its cheapness, and the great demand for jute manufactures arises in connexion
                    with rough and cheap fabrics,’ such as sacking and bagging, bale covers,
                    hessians for upholstery purposes, &amp;c., tarpaulings, linings, pocketings, and
                    backing for floorcloths, for which purpose it is woven in webs from 6 to 8 yards
                    wide. It takes dye colours readily, which, however, are fugitive, and as dyed
                    yarn it is woven into carpets, rugs, &amp;c.; and woven and printed curtain
                    cloths and tapestries are also made from jute. The fibre, however, is not worthy
                    of being woven into elaborate and somewhat costly fabrics; and it is not likely
                    that as a tapestry material it will take any permanent place. Jute also lends
                    itself readily to the sophistication of more expensive fibrous materials, and is
                    said to be employed in the adulteration of woven silks, more especially in such
                    as are used for cheap ribbons, scarfs, &amp;c. It can also be prepared to
                    imitate human hair with remarkable closeness, and advantage of this is largely
                    taken in making stage wigs.</p>
                <p>Although a few jute factories have sprung up in several localities other than
                    Dundee throughout the United Kingdom, ’ notably in Glasgow, Aberdeen, and
                    Barrow-in-Furness, and also in various parts of the Continent, Dundee is still
                    the headquarters and controlling centre of the jute trade,—even many of the
                    Bengal factories being owned by Dundee merchants. The following table shows the
                    distribution of the trade and the number of persons finding employment in it for
                    the United Kingdom at the respective dates mentioned :—</p>
