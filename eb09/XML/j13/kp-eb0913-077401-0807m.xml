                    of political science, and mystic, was born in the village of Grund in the duchy
                    of Nassau on the 12th September 1740. His father, Wilhelm Jung, schoolmaster and
                    tailor, was the son of Eberhard Jung, charcoal-burner, and his mother was
                    Dortchen or Dorothy Moritz, daughter of a poor clergyman. In the best of his
                    books Stilling gives a charming description of the patriarchal simplicity of his
                    home, and draws the portrait of his grandfather especially with a loving and
                    skilful hand. Stilling became, by his father’s desire, schoolmaster and tailor,
                    but “to be always sitting at the needle and making clothes for people was highly
                    repugnant to me,” and “to be everlastingly instructing boys and girls in ABC”
                    was equally wearisome. Severe home discipline made Stilling glad to accept an
                    appointment as schoolmaster in a neighbouring village, where, however, he taught
                    not with pleasure but from a sense of duty. He afterwards became tutor in the
                    family of a merchant, and in 1768 went with “half a French dollar,” as he
                    himself tells us, to study medicine at the university of Strasburg. What he
                    wanted in money he possessed in confidence in Divine aid; and in after life he
                    was wont to refute sceptical adversaries by recounting the many occasions on
                    which his prayers were answered byprovidential messengers, for so he regarded
                    them, who in the most unexpected way provided him with the money necessary not
                    only for his studies but for his very existence. At Strasburg he met Goethe, who
                    showed him much kindness, and introduced him to Herder. The acquaintance with
                    Goethe ripened into friendship; and it was by his influence that Stilling’s
                    first and best work, <hi rend="italic">The Account of his Youth,</hi> was in
                    1777 given to the world. In 1772 he settled at Elberfeld as physician and
                    oculist, and soon became celebrated for operations in cases of cataract.
                    Surgery, however, was not much more to his taste than tailoring or teaching; and
                    in 1778 he was glad to accept the appointment of lecturer on “agriculture,
                    technology, commerce, and the veterinary art” (!) in the newly established
                    academy at Kaiserslautern. In 1784 the academy was transferred to Heidelberg and
                    united with the university. In 1786, on the occasion of the anniversary of the
                    fourth centenary of Heidelberg university, Stilling created immense enthusiasm
                    by delivêring his speech, the last of the day, in German. The other professors
                    had used Latin. In 1787 Stilling was appointed professor of economical,
                    financial, and statistical science in the university of Marburg. In 1803 he
                    resigned his professorship and returned to Heidelberg, where he remained with no
                    official appointment until 1806. In that year he received a pension from the
                    grand-duke Charles Frederick of Baden, and removed to Carlsruhe, where he
                    remained until his death on the 2d April 1817. He was married three times, and
                    left a numerous family. Of his engagement to his first wife he tells a most
                    amusing story in his autobiography. Of his works this autobiography <hi
                    rend="italic">Heinrich Stillings</hi><hi rend="italic">Leben,</hi> from which he
                    came to be known as Stilling, is the only one now of any interest, and, with the
                    supplement by his son-in law Dr Schwarz, is the chief authority for his life. A
                    believer in dreams and apparitions, he was superstitious rather than mystical.
                    His piety was fervent, but not austere; and his chief delight was in seeing
                    others happy. Modest and affable, he endeared himself to all who came in contact
                    with him. He hated nothing except sects, which, he says, are due merely to pride
                    under the mask of piety. He numbered among his many friends Goethe and Kant and
                    Lavater, the first of whom pays him high tribute in the second part of <hi
                    rend="italic">Aus meinem Leben.</hi></p>
                <p>A complete edition of his numerous works, in 14 vols. 8vo, was published at
                    Stuttgart in 1835-38. There are English translations by Sam. Jackson of the <hi
