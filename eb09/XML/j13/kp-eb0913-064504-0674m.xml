                <p><label type="entry">JESUITS</label>. The “Company of Jesus,” in its original
                    conception, and in its avowed or ostensible objects, does not at the first
                    glance appear as more than one of many similar communities which have grown up
                    in the bosom of Latin Christianity. Like several of them, it is a congregation
                    of ecclesiastics living in accordance with a definite rule, whence technically
                    called “Clerks Regular”; like the Templars, Hospitallers, and Teutonic Knights,
                    military ideas have entered largely into its plans; like Benedictines,
                    Dominicans, and Franciscans, its spiritual labours have been those of teaching
                    the young by schools and catechizings, conducting home missions by such agencies
                    as sermons, retreats, and the like, combating heresy with the pulpit and the
                    pen, and converting the heathen. In each and all of these peculiarities and
                    occupations it comes late into a field where its precursors had been busy for
                    centuries, and it might seem to differ from them merely by a more careful
                    selection of instruments, a more skilful organization, and a more perfect
                    discipline.</p>
                <p>But such a view is entirely misleading. On closer <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0675-0646"/> examination the Jesuit body proves to resemble
                    those other religious societies only in external and separable accidents,
                    differing from them and from all others in its essential character,—and that not
                    in degree merely, but in kind also, so as to be an institution absolutely unique
                    in history.</p>
                <p>In the first place, all the earlier associations of the kind, even the military
                    orders themselves, have their origin in a desire to withdraw so far as possible
                    from contact with the world and its concerns, to seek spiritual perfection in a
                    retired life of contemplation and prayer, to concentrate efforts for this end
                    chiefly within the cloister where each such group is collected, and to act only
                    indirectly, and as it were with the mere surplus overflow of religious energy,
                    on their more immediate neighbours around, and even then chiefly with the idea
                    of persuading all the most devout and fervent amongst them to forsake the world
                    in a similar fishion. Contrariwise, the Jesuit system is to withdraw religious
                    men from precisely this sort of retirement, except as a mere temporary
                    preparation for later activity, and to make habitual intercourse with society a
                    prime duty, rigidly suppressing all such external regulations of dress, rule,
                    and austerities as tend to put obstacles in the way, so leaving the members of
                    the “Company” free to act as emissaries, agents, or missionaries in the most
                    various places and circumstances. Next, the constitution of the elder societies
                    was for the most part democratic. Allowing for special exceptions, the normal
                    scheme of government was this. Each house of an order had a separate life and
                    partial independence of its own. It elected its own superior and officers,
                    usually by ballot, for a short term of years, it discussed its business, and its
                    members confessed their faults, in open chapter. Each group of houses elected a
                    provincial; the provincials, or delegates from among them, elected the general,
                    whose authority was strictly constitutional, and limited as definitely by the
                    rule and statutes as the rights of the youngest novice. Further, admission was
                    seldom difficult; the noviciate rarely exceeded two years, and the novice,
                    professed at the close of that probation, at once entered on a share in the
                    government of the society, and became eligible for its highest offices. Unlike
                    this method in every respect, the Jesuit polity is almost a pure despotism,
                    guarded, no doubt, with certain checks, but even those of an oligarchical kind.
                    The general is indeed elected by the congregation of the society; but, once
                    appointed, it is for life, and with powers lodged in his hands, partly due to
                    the original constitutions, and partly to special faculties and privileges
                    conferred by various popes, which enormously exceed, as regards enactment and
                    repeal of laws, as to restraint and dispensation, and both in kind and degree,
                    those wielded by the heads of any other communities, ∏e alone nominates to every
                    office in the society (with certain significant exceptions to be named
                    presently) and appoints the superiors of all the houses and colleges. The vow of
                    obedience is taken directly to him, and not, as in the older orders, to the
                    rule, as distinguished from the mere chief of the executive. The admission or
                    dismissal of every member depends on his absolute fiat; and, by a simple
                    provision for reports to him, he holds in his hands the threads of the entire
                    business of the society in its most minute and distant ramifications.</p>
                <p>Once more, the distinguishing peculiarity of the earlier communities, dating from
                    the origin of the Benedictine rule, is their hostility to local change. The vow
                    of <hi rend="italic">stability,</hi> soon added to the three customary pledges
                    of poverty, chastity, and obedience, was designed to impede, not merely
                    itinerancy without settled abode, such as had brought discredit on those ancient
                    monks who were styled <hi rend="italic">circumceUions,</hi> nor even easy
                    transition from one religious community to another, unless in search of greater
                    austerity, but even facility of transfer from one house to another of the very
                    same order. Where the profession was made, there, in the absence of exceptional
                    reasons, the life should be spent; and this rule of course tended to nationalism
                    in the monasteries of every country, even in the great military orders, which,
                    though accepting recruits from all quarters, yet grouped them into <hi
                    rend="italic">tongues.</hi> But mobility and cosmopolitanism are of the very
                    essence of the Jesuit programme. The founder of the society has excluded the
                    possibility of doubt on this subject, for having chosen the military term
                    “Company,” rather than “Order” or “Congregation ’* to describe his new
                    institute, he explained its meaning to Paul III. as being that, whereas the
                    ancient monastic communities were, so to speak, the infantry of the church,
                    whose duty was to stand firmly in one place on the battlefield, the Jesuits,
                    contrariwise, were tobe the “light horse,” capable of going anywhere at a
                    moment’s notice, but especially apt and designed for scouting or skirmishing.
                    And, to carry out this view, it was one of his plans to send foreigners as
                    superiors or officers to the Jesuit houses of each country, requiring of these
                    envoys, however, to use invariably the language of' their new place of
                    residence, and to study it both in speaking and writing till entire mastery of
                    it had been acquired,—thus by degrees making all the parts of his vast system
                    mutually interchangeable, and so largely increasing the number of persons
                    eligible to fill any given post, without reference to locality.</p>
                <p>Further, the object of the older monastic societies was the sanctification of
                    their individual members. In truth, community life was only a later development
                    of the original system, as exhibited in the Thebaid, in accordance with which
                    solitary hermits began to draw near to each other, until the collection of
                    separate huts gradually assumed the form of a <hi rend="italic">laura</hi> or
                    hamlet of cells, grouped under an abbot, and with a common place of worship—a
                    model still surviving in the Camaldolese order. Their obedience to a superior,
                    and the observance of some kind of fixed" rule, had no further intention than
                    the improvement of the spiritual character of each person who entered such a
                    community; and, with certain qualifications, this has continued the ideal of the
                    older orders,—modified chiefly by the natural desire of each such body to gain
                    influence and credit from the personal character of all its members and the
                    efficiency of its active operations. But the founder of Jesuitism started at
                    once with a totally diffèrent purpose. To him, from the first, the society was
                    everything, and the individual nothing, except so far as he might prove a useful
                    instrument for carrying out the society’s objects. In a MS. collection of
                    sayings by Loyola, whose genuineness is accepted by the Bollandists, themselves
                    Jesuits, and by his biographer F. Genelli, he is stated to have said to his
                    secretary, Polanco, that “in those who offered themselves he looked less to
                    purely natural goodness than to firmness of character and ability for business,
                    for he was of opinion that those who were not fit for public business were not
                    adapted for filling offices in the society.” He went even further than this, and
                    laid down that even exceptional qualities and endowments in a candidate were
                    valuable in his eyes only on the condition of their being brought into play or
                    held in abeyance strictly at the command of a superior. On this principle, he
                    raised obedience to a position it had never held before, even amongst monastic
                    virtues. His letter on this subject, addressed to the Jesuits of Coimbra in
                    1553, is still one of the standard formularies of the society, ranking with
                    those two other products of his pen, the <hi rend="italic">Spiritual
                    Exercises</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Constitutions;</hi> and it is evident
                    that his views differ very seriously from the older theories on the subject, as
                    formulated in other rules. In them the superior is head of a local family,
                    endued with patemal authority, no doubt as <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n676/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0676-0647"/> understood by the old civil code of the Roman
                    empire, centuries after the very memory of freedom had been lost, yet having
                    fixed limits, alike traditional and prescribed, besides being exercised only
                    within a limited area and for certain specified purposes. Loyola, true to his
                    military training and instincts, clothes the general with the powers of a
                    commander-in-chief of an army in time of war, giving him the absolute disposal
                    of all members of the society in every place and for every purpose. Not only so,
                    but he pushes the claim much further, requiring, besides entire outward
                    submission to command, also the complete identification of the inferior’s will
                    with that of the superior. He lays down that this superior is tobe obeyed simply
                    as such, and as standing in the place of God, without reference to his personal
                    wisdom, piety, or discretion; that any obedience which falls short of making the
                    superior’s will one’s own in inward affection as well as in palpable effect, is
                    lax and imperfect; that going beyond the letter of command, even in things
                    abstractly good and praiseworthy, is disobedience; and that the “sacrifice of
                    the intellect”—a familiar Jesuit watchword—is the third and highest grade of
                    obedience, well-pleasing to God, when the inferior not only wills what the
                    superior wills, but thinks what he thinks, submitting his judgment so far as it
                    is possible for the will to influence and lead the judgment. So far-reaching and
                    dangerous are these maxims that the <hi rend="italic">Letter on Obedience</hi>
                    was formally condemned, not long after Loyola’s death, by the Inquisition in
                    Spain and Portugal, and it tasked all the skill and learning of Bellarmine as
                    its apologist, together with the whole influence of the company, to avert the
                    ratification of the sentence at Rome.</p>
                <p>It has, however, been alleged in defence that this very strong language must be
                    glossed and limited by two other maxims penned by Loyola: (1) “Preserve your
                    freedom of mind, and do not relinquish it by the authority of any person, or in
                    any circumstances whatever”; and (2) “In all things <hi rend="italic">except
                    sin</hi> I ought to do the will of my superior, and not my own.” But the value
                    of these checks is seriously diminished when it is added that the former of them
                    occurs in the introductory part of the <hi rend="italic">Spiritual
                    Exercises,</hi> a manual expressly designed and used for the purpose of breaking
                    down the will of those who pass through its appointed ordeal under a director;
                    while the latter is qualified in its turn, not only by'the whole principle of
                    probabilism, the special doctrine of the society, which can attenuate and even
                    defend any kind of sin, but by the four following maxims, in close juxtaposition
                    to itself in the very same document: “I ought to desire to be ruled by a
                    superior who endeavours to subjugate my judgment or subdue my understanding”;
                    “When it seems to me that I am commanded by my superior to do a thing against
                    which my conscience revolts as sinful, and my superior judges otherwise, it is
                    my duty to yield my doubts to him, unless I am otherwise constrained by evident
                    reasons”; “If submission do not appease my conscience, I must impart my doubts
                    to two or three persons of discretion, and abide by their decision”; “I ought
                    not to be my own, but His who created me, and his too by whose means God governs
                    me, yielding myself to be moulded in his hands like, so much wax I ought to be
                    like a corpse, which has neither will nor understanding, or like a small
                    crucifix, which is turned about at the will of him that holds it, or like a
                    staff in the hands of an old man, who uses it as may best assist or please him.”
                    And one master-stroke of Loyola’s policy was to insure the permanence of this
                    submission by barring access to all independent positions on the part of members
                    of the society, through means of a special constitution that no Jesuit can
                    accept a cardinal’s hat, a bishopric other than missionary, an abbacy, or any
                    similar dignity, save with permission of the general, not to be accorded unless
                    and until the pope has commanded its acceptance under pain of sin.</p>
                <p>The next matter for consideration is the machinery by which the society is
                    constituted and governed, so as to enable this principle to become a living
                    energy, and not a mere abstract theory. The society, then, is distributed into
                    six grades :—novices, scholastics, temporal coadjutors, spiritual coadjutors,
                    professed of the three vows, and professed of the four vows. The novice cannot
                    become a postulant for admission to the society till fourteen years old, unless
                    by special dispensation, and is at once classified according as his destination
                    is the priesthood or lay brotherhood, while a third class of “indifferente”
                    receives such as are reserved for further inquiry before a decision of this kind
                    is made. They first undergo a strict retreat of a month in what is practically
                    solitary confinement, during which they go through the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spiritual</hi><hi rend="italic">Exercises,</hi> and make a general confession
                    of their whole previous life; after which the first noviciate, of two years’
                    duration, begins. This is spent partly in daily study, partly in hospital work,
                    and partly in teaching the rudiments of religious doctrine to children and the
                    poor. They may leave or be dismissed at' any time during this noviciate, but if
                    approved are advanced into the grade of scholastics, corresponding in some
                    degree to that of undergraduates at a university. The ordinary course for these
                    is five years in arts, when, without discontinuing their own studies, they must
                    pass five or six years more.in teaching junior classes, not reaching the study
                    of theology till the age of twenty-eight or thirty, when, after another year of
                    noviciate, a further course of from four to six years is imposed, and not till
                    this has been completed can the scholastic be ordained as a priest of the
                    society, and enter on the grade of spiritual coadjutor, assuming that he is not
                    confined to that of temporal coadjutor, who discharges only such functions as
                    are open to lay-brothers, and who must be ten years in the society before being
                    admitted to the vows. The time can be shortened at the general’s pleasure, but
                    such is the normal arrangement. Even this rank confers no share in the
                    government, nor eligibility for the offices of the society. That is reserved for
                    the professed, themselves subdivided into those of the three vows and of the
                    four vows. It is these last alone, forming only a small percentage of the entire
                    body, who constitute the real core of the society, whence its officers are all
                    taken, and their fourth vow is one of special allegiance to the pope, promising
                    to go in obedience to him for missionary purposes whensoever and whithersoever
                    he may order,—a pledge seriously qualified in practice, however, by the power
                    given to the general of alone sending out or recalling any missionary. The
                    constitutions enjoin, by a rule seldom dispensed with, that this final grade
                    cannot be attained till the candidate has reached his forty-fifth year, which
                    involves a probation of no fewer than thirty-one years for even such as have
                    entered on the noviciate at the earliest legal age. These various members of the
                    society are distributed in its noviciate houses, its colleges, its professed
                    houses, and its mission residences. The question has long been hotly debated
                    whether, in addition to these six avowed grades, there be not a seventh,
                    answering in some degree to the Tertiaries of the Franciscan and Dominican
                    orders, secretly affiliated to the society, and acting as its unsuspected
                    emissaries in various lay positions. This class is styled in France “Jesuits of
                    the short robe,” and some evidence in support of its actual existence was
                    alleged during the lawsuits against the company under Louis XV. The J esuits
                    themselves deny the existence of any such body, and are able to adduce the
                    negative disproof that no provision for it is to be found in their
                    constitutions. On the other hand, there are clauses therein which make the
                    creation of such <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n677/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0677-0648"/> a class perfectly feasible if thought expedient.
                    One is the power given to the general to receive candidates secretly, and to
                    conceal their admission, for which there is a remarkable precedent in the case
                    of Francis Borgia, duke of Gandia, afterwards himself general of the society;
                    the other is an even more singular clause, providing for the admission of
                    candidates to the company by persons who are not themselves members of it. The
                    known facts on either side are insufficient for a decisive verdict, and “Not
                    proven” is the only impartial judgment possible. The general, who should by the
                    statutes of the society reside permanently at Rome, holds in his hands the right
                    of appointment, not only to the office of provincial over each of the great
                    districts into which the houses are mapped, but to the offices of each house in
                    particular, no shadow of electoral right or even suggestion being
                    recognized.</p>
                <p>The superiors and rectors of all houses and colleges in Europe must report weekly
                    to their provincial on all matters concerning the members of the society and all
                    outsiders with whom they may have had dealings of any sort. Those employed in
                    district missions report at such longer intervals as the provincial may fix. The
                    provincial, for his part, must report monthly to the general, giving him a
                    summary of all details which have reached himself. But, as a check on him, all
                    superiors of houses in his province are to make separate reports directly to the
                    general once in three months, and further to communicate with him without delay
                    every time any matter of importance occurs, irrespective of any information
                    which the provincial may have forwarded. Nor is this all; an elaborate system of
                    espionage and delation forms part of the recognized order of every house, and,
                    in direct contrast to the ancient indictment and confession of faults in open
                    conventual chapter, every inmate of a house is liable to secret accusation to
                    its superior, while the superior himself may be similarly delated to the
                    provincial or the general.</p>
                <p>Nor is the general himself exempt from control on the part of the society, lest
                    by any possibility he might prove, from disaffection or error, unfaithful to its
                    interests. A consultative council is imposed on him by the general congregation,
                    consisting of six persons, whom he may neither select nor remove,—namely, four
                    assistants, each representing a nation, an admonisher or adviser (resembling the
                    <hi rend="italic">adlatus</hi> of a military commander) to warn him of any
                    faults or mistakes, and his confessor. One of these must be in constant
                    attendance on him; and, while he is not at liberty to abdicate his office, nor
                    to accept any dignity or office outside it without the assent of the society, he
                    may ybt be suspended or deposed by its authority. No such instance, however, has
                    yet occurred in Jesuit history, although steps in this direction were once taken
                    in the case of a general who had set himself against the current feeling of the
                    society. With so widely ramifying and complex a system in full working order,
                    controlled by the hand of one man, the Company of Jesus has been aptly defined
                    as “a naked sword, whose hilt is at Rome, and whose point is everywhere.”</p>
                <p>There would seem at first to be an effectual external check provided, however, in
                    the fact that, while all the officers of the society, except the council
                    aforesaid, hold of the general, he in turn holds of the pope, and is his
                    liegeman directly, as well as in virtue of the fourth vow, which he has taken in
                    common with the other professed. But such is the extraordinary skill with which
                    the relations of the society to the papacy were originally drafted by Loyola,
                    and subsequently worked by his successors, that it has always remained
                    organically independent, and might very conceivably break with Rome without
                    imperilling its own existence. The general has usually stood towards the pope
                    much as a powerful grand feudatory of the Middle Ages did towards a weak titular
                    lord paramount, or perhaps as the captain of a splendid host of “Free
                    Companions” did towards a potentate with whom he chose to take temporary and
                    precarious service; and the shrewd Roman populace have long shown their
                    recognition of this fact by styling these two great personages severally the
                    “White Pope” and the “Black Pope.” In truth, the society has never, from the
                    very first, obeyed the pope, whenever its will and his happened to run counter
                    to each other. Even in the very infancy of the company, Loyola himself used
                    supplications and arguments to the pope to dissuade him from enforcing
                    injunctions likely to prove incompatible with the original plan, and on each
                    occasion succeeded in carrying his point; while his immediate successors more
                    openly resisted Paul</p>
                <p>IV. when attempting to enforce the daily recitation of the breviary on the clerks
                    of the society, and to limit the tenure of the generalship to three years, and
                    Pius V. when following his predecessor’s example in the former respect.
                    Sixtus</p>
                <p>V. having undertaken with a high hand the wholesale reform of the company,
                    including the change of its name from “Society of Jesus” to “Society of
                    Ignatius,” met with strenuous opposition, and the fulfilment of Bellarmine’s
                    prophecy that he would not survive the year 1590 was looked on less as the
                    accomplishment of a prediction than of a threat,—an impression deepened by the
                    sudden death of his successor. Urban VII., eleven days after his election, who,
                    as Cardinal Castagna, had been actively co-operating with Sixtus in his plans.
                    The accuracy of a similar forecast made by Bellarmine as to Clement VIII., who
                    was also at feud with the society, and who died before he could carry out his
                    intended measures, confirmed popular suspicion. Urban VIII., Innocent XL,
                    Alexander VIII., and Clement XII. vainly contended against the doctrines taught
                    in Jesuit books and colleges, and could effect no change. Nine popes fruitlessly
                    condemned the “Chinese rites,” whereby the Jesuit missionaries had virtually
                    assimilated Christianity to heathenism, and the practical reply of the latter
                    was to obtain in 1700 an edict from the emperor of China, in opposition to the
                    papal decree, declaring that there was nothing idolatrous or superstitious in
                    the inculpated usages, while in 1710 they flung Cardinal Tournon, legate of
                    Clement XI., into the prison of the Inquisition at Macao, where he perished; and
                    finally, they disobeyed the brief of suppression issued by Clement XIV. in 1773,
                    which enjoined them to disperse at oncé; to send back all novices to their
                    houses, and to receive no more members. It is thus clear that the society has
                    always regarded itself as an independent power, ready indeed to co-operate with
                    the papacy so long as their roads and interests are the same, and to avail
                    itself to the uttermost of the many pontifical decrees in its own favour, but
                    drawing the line far short of practical submission when their interests
                    diverge.</p>
                <p>So constituted, with a skilful combination of strictness and laxity, of complex
                    organization with the minimum of friction in working, the society was admirably
                    devised for its purpose of introducing a new power into the church and the
                    world, and for carrying out effectively every part of its vast programme. Thus
                    equipped, its services to Roman Catholicism have been incalculable. The Jesuits
                    alone rolled back the tide of Protestant advance when that half of Europe which
                    had not already shaken off its allegiance to the papacy was threatening to do
                    so, and the whole honours of the counter-Reformation are theirs singly. They had
                    the sagacity to see, and to admit in their correspondence with their superiors,
                    that the Reformation, as a popular movement, was fully justified by the gross
                    ignorance, negligence, and open vice of the Catholic clergy, whether secular or
                    monastic; and they were shrewd enough to discern the only possible remedies. Ata
                    time when primary and even secondary education had in most places <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0678-0649"/> become a mere effete and pedantic adherence to
                    obsolete methods, they were bold enough to innovate, less in system than in
                    materials, and, putting fresh spirit and devotion into the work, not merely
                    taught and catechized in a new, fresh, and attractive manner, besides
                    establishing free schools of good quality, but provided new manuals and
                    schoolbooks for their pupils, which were an enormous advance on those they found
                    in use, so that for nearly three centuries the Jesuits were accounted the best
                    schoolmasters in Europe, as they were, till their forcible suppression the other
                    day, confessedly the best in France,—besides having always conciliated the good
                    will of their pupils by mingled firmness and gentleness as teachers. And,
                    although their own methods have in time given way to further improvements, yet
                    they revolutionized instruction as completely as Frederick the Great did modern
                    warfare, and have thus acted, whether they meant it or not, as pioneers of human
                    progress. Again, when the regular clergy had sunk into the moral and
                    intellectual slough which is pictured for us in the writings of Erasmus and in
                    the powerful satire <hi rend="italic">Epistolae</hi><hi rend="italic">Obscurorum
                    Virorum,</hi> while there was little of a’ better kind visible in the lives of
                    the parochial priesthood, the Jesuits won back respect for the clerical calling
                    by their personal culture and the unimpeachable purity of their lives. These are
                    qualities which they have all along carefully maintained, and probably no body
                    of men in the world has been so free from the reproach of discreditable members,
                    or has kept up an equally high average level of intelligence and conduct. As
                    preachers, too, they delivered the pulpit from the bondage of an effete
                    scholasticism, and reached at once a clearness and simplicity of treatment such
                    as the English pulpit scarcely begins to exhibit till after the days of
                    Tillotson; while in literature and theology they count a far larger number of
                    respectable writers than any other religious society can boast. It is in the
                    mission-field, however, that their achievements have been most remarkable, which
                    might fully justify their taking as their motto—</p>
                <p>“Quae regio in terris nostri non plena laboris ?” Whether toiling amongst the
                    teeming millions of Hindustan and China, labouring amongst the Hurons and
                    Iroquois of North America, governing and civilizing the natives of Brazil and
                    Paraguay, in the missions and “reductions,” or ministering, at the hourly risk
                    of his life, to his coreligionists in England under Elizabeth and James I., the
                    Jesuit appears alike devoted, indefatigable, cheerful, and worthy of hearty
                    admiration and respect.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, two most startling and indisputable facts meet the student who
                    pursues the history of this unique society. The first is the universal suspicion
                    and hostility it has incurred,—not, as might reasonably be expected, merely from
                    those Protestants whose avowed and most successful foe it has been, nor yet from
                    the enemies of all clericalism and religious dogma, to whom it is naturally the
                    embodiment of all they most detest, but from every Roman Catholic state and
                    nation in the world, with perhaps the insignificant exception of Belgium. Next
                    is the brand of ultimate failure which has invariably been stamped on all its
                    most promising schemes and efforts. It controlled the policy of Spain, when
                    Spain was aiming, with good reason to hope for success, at the hegemony of
                    Europe, and Spain came out of the struggle well-nigh the last amongst the
                    nations. It secured the monopoly of religious teaching and influence in France
                    under Louis XIV. and XV. only to see an atheistic revolution break out under
                    Louis XVI. and sweep over the nation after a century of such training. It guided
                    the action of James II., lost the crown of England for the house of Stuart, and
                    brought about the limitation of the throne to the Protestant succession. Its
                    Japanese and Red Indian missions have vanished without leaving a trace behind;
                    its labours in Hindustan did but prepare the way for the English empire there;
                    it was swept out of its Paraguayan domains without power of defence; and, having
                    in our own day concentrated its efforts on the maintenance of the temporal power
                    of the popes, and raised it almost to the rank of a dogma of the Catholic faith,
                    it has seen Rome proclaimed as the capital of united Italy, and a Piedmontese
                    sovereign enthroned in the Quirinal. These two phenomena demand some inquiry and
                    analysis. As regards the former of them, the hostility the Jesuits have
                    encountered has been twofold, political and moral or religious. There has been,
                    from a very early date in their annals, a strong conviction prevalent that the
                    famous motto of the society, “A.M.D.G.” <hi rend="italic">(Ad</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">majorem</hi><hi rend="italic">Dei</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >gloriam),</hi> did not adequately represent its policy and motives, that its
                    first and last aim was its own aggrandizement in power and wealth (for Julius
                    II. had dispensed the general from the vow of poverty, and the colleges also
                    were allowed to hold property), and that it spared no efforts to compass this
                    end, even to the extent of embroiling cabinets, concocting conspiracies,
                    kindling wars, and procuring assassinations. In several of these cases, notably
                    as regards the charges which led to their first expulsion from France and
                    Portugal, inclusive in the latter instance of their exile from Paraguay, the
                    Jesuits are able to make one very telling reply, pleading that motives of
                    statecraft alone, of an unworthy kind, and the evidence of untrustworthy and
                    disreputable agents of their enemies, were suffered to decide the matter. In
                    other cases, as for example the assassination of Henry IV. by Ravaillac, they
                    deny all complicity, and no sufficient proof has ever been adduced against them.
                    But, when full allowance has been made for such rejoinders, there remain several
                    counts of the indictment which are but too clearly made out: as, for instance,
                    their large share, as preachers, in fanning the flames of polemical hatred
                    against the Huguenots under the last two Valois kings, their complicity in the
                    plots against the life of Queen Elizabeth which followed on her excommunication
                    by Pius V.; their responsibility for kindling the Thirty Years’ War; the part
                    they took in prompting and directing the cruelties which marked the overthrow of
                    Protestantism in Bohemia; their decisive influence in causing the revocation of
                    the Edict of Nantes, and the expulsion of the Huguenots from the French
                    dominions; and their accountability for precipitating the Franco-German war of
                    1870. And in regard to a large number of other cases where the evidence against
                    them is defective, it is at least an unfortunate coincidence that there is
                    always direct proof of some Jesuit having been in communication with the actual
                    agents engaged. So it was with the massacre of St Bartholomew, almost
                    immediately preceded by a visit of the Jesuit general, Francis Borgia, to the
                    French court, though there is no further evidence to connect him therewith; so
                    with Châtel and Ravaillac, the unsuccessful and successful assassins of Henry
                    IV.; so with Jaureguay and Balthasar Gerard, who held the like relation to
                    William the Silent, prince of Orange; so (as is more familiarly known) with the
                    accomplices in the Gunpowder Plot. In all these and several other instances, the
                    precautions which would naturally, and even inevitably, be taken by skilled and
                    wary diplomatists for their own protection are sufficient to account for the
                    lack of direct proof against them, but it is not easy to explain the invariable
                    presence of a Jesuit in the background, on any hypothesis which will secure the
                    complete acquittal of the society from charges of the sort. It is sufficient to
                    say here in illustration that the English Roman Catholics under Elizabeth,
                    addressing the pope, with regard to the severe penal laws which oppressed them,
                    laid the whole blame of the Government’s action on the Jesuits, as having
                    provoked <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n679/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0679-0650"/> it by their conspiracies; while the secular
                    priests in England issued in 1601 by the pen of one of their number, William
                    Watson (afterwards executed in 1603), a pamphlet known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Important Considerations,</hi> to the same effect.</p>
                <p>The merited odium which has overtaken the Inquisition, usually officered by
                    Dominicans, has induced the Jesuits, whose own controversial method has for the
                    most part been different, to disclaim all connexion with that tribunal, and to
                    represent their society as free from complicity in its acts. But, in truth, it
                    was Ignatius Loyola himself who procured its erection in Portugal in 1545-6, and
                    F. Nithard, one of the very few cardinals of the society, was inquisitor-general
                    of that kingdom in 1655.</p>
                <p>The charges against the Jesuits on moral and doctrinal grounds are not less
                    precise, early, numerous, and weighty. Their founder himself was arrested more
                    than once by the Inquisition, and required to give account of his belief and
                    conduct. But Loyola, with all his powerful gifts of intellect, was entirely
                    practical and ethical in his range, and had no turn whatever for speculation,
                    nor desire to reason on, much less question, any of the received dogmas of his
                    church. He was therefore acquitted on every occasion, and sagaciously applied
                    for and obtained each time a formally attested certificate of his orthodoxy,
                    knowing well that, in default of such documents, the fact of his arrest as a
                    suspected heretic would be more distinctly recollected by opponents than that of
                    his honourable dismissal from custody. His successors, however, have not been so
                    fortunate. On doctrinal questions indeed, though their teaching on grace,
                    especially in the form given it by Molina, one of their number, was directly
                    Pelagian (the result of reaction from Luther’s teaching, which they had combated
                    in Germany), and condemned by several popes, yet their pertinacity in the long
                    run carried the day, and gained a footing for their opinions which was denied to
                    the opposite tenets of the Jansenists. But the accusations against their moral
                    theology and their action as guides of conduct, nay, as themselves involved in
                    many doubtful transactions, have not been so appeased. They were censured by the
                    Sorbonne as early as 1554, chiefly at the instance of Eus tache de Bellay,
                    bishop of Paris, on grounds of which some were quite true, though others appear
                    to have been at least exaggerations; but they can plead that no other
                    theological faculty of the time joined in the condemnation. Melchior Cano, one
                    of the ablest divines of the 16th century, never ceased to lift up his testimony
                    against them, from their first beginnings till his own death in 1560, and,
                    unmollified by the bribe of the bishopric of the Canaries, which their interest
                    procured for him, succeeded in banishing them from the university of Salamanca.
                    St Charles Borromeo, to whose original advocacy they owed much, and especially
                    the exception made in their favour by the council of Trent (Sess. XXV., xvi.)
                    from the restrictions it laid on other •communities, retracted his protection,
                    and expelled them from the colleges and churches which they occupied in his
                    diocese and province of Milan,—a policy wherein he was followed in 1604 by his
                    cousin and successor, the equally saintly Cardinal Frederick Borromeo. The
                    credit of the society was, however, far more seriously damaged by the
                    publication at Cracow in 1612 of an ingenious forgery (whose authorship has been
                    variously ascribed to John Zaorowsky or to Cambilone and Schloss, all
                    ex-Jesuits) entitled <hi rend="italic">Monita Secreta,</hi> professing to be the
                    authoritative secret instructions drawn up by the general Acquaviva and given by
                    the superiors of the company to its various Officers and members, and to have
                    been discovered in MS. by Christian of Brunswick in the Jesuit college at
                    Prague. It is full of suggestions for extending the influence of the Jesuits in
                    various ways, for securing a footing in fresh places, for acquiring wealth, and
                    so forth, all marked with ambition, craft, and unscrupulousness. It had a wide
                    success and popularity, passing through several editions, and, though declared
                    a-forgery by a congregation of cardinals specially appointed to examine into it,
                    has not ceased to be reprinted and credited down to the present day. The truth
                    seems to be that, although both caricature and libel, it was drafted by a shrewd
                    and keen observer, who, seeing what the fathers actually did, travelled
                    analytically backwards to find how they did it, and on what methodical system,
                    conjecturally reconstructing the process, and probably coming very near the mark
                    in not a few details. Later on, a formidable assault was made on their moral
                    theology in the famous <hi rend="italic">Provincial Letters</hi> of Blaise
                    Pascal, eighteen in number, issued under the pen-name of Louis de Montalte, from
                    January 1656 to March 1657. Their wit, irony, eloquence, and finished style have
                    kept them alive as one of the great French classics,—a destiny more fortunate
                    than that of two kindred works by Antoine Arnauld, his collaborator in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Provincial Letters,</hi> namely, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Théologie</hi><hi rend="italic">Morale</hi><hi rend="italic">des Jésuites,</hi>
                    consisting of extracts from writings of members of the society, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Morale Pratique des Jesuites,</hi> made up of narratives
                    exhibiting the manner in which they carried out their own maxims in their
                    personal action. The reply on behalf of the society to Pascal’s charges of lax
                    morality, apart from mere general denials (such as that embodied in F.
                    Ravignan’s name for the <hi rend="italic">Provinciales,</hi> “Le Dictionnaire de
                    la Calomnie ”), is broadly as follows. (1) Ignatius Loyola himself, the founder
                    of the society, had a special aversion from untruthfulness in all its forms,
                    from quibbling, equivocation, or even studied obscurity of language, and it
                    would be contrary to the spirit of conformity with his example and institutions
                    for his followers to think and act otherwise. (2) Several of the cases cited by
                    Pascal are mere abstract hypotheses, many of them now obsolete, argued on simply
                    as matter of intellectual exercise, but having no practical bearing whatever.
                    (3) Even such as do belong to the sphere of actual life are of the nature of
                    counsel to spiritual physicians, how to deal with exceptional maladies, and were
                    never intended to fix the standard of moral obligation for the general public.
                    (4) The theory that they were intended for this latter purpose, and do represent
                    the normal teaching of the Jesuit body, becomes more untenable in exact
                    proportion as this immorality is insisted on, because it is matter of notoriety
                    that the Jesuits themselves have been singularly free from personal, as
                    distinguished from corporate, evil repute, and no one pretends that the large
                    numbers of lay-folk whom they have educated or influenced exhibit any great
                    moral inferiority to their neighbours. The third of these replies is the most
                    cogent as regards Pascal, but the real weakness of his attack lies in that
                    nervous dread of appeal to first principles and their logical results which has
                    been the besetting snare of Gallicanism. Afraid to deal with the fact that the
                    society was on the whole what its founder meant it to be, and was merely
                    carrying out his programme, because that admission would have involved
                    challenging Loyola’s position as a canonized saint, and the action of the Holy
                    See in approving his institute, Pascal was obliged to go on the historically
                    untenable ground that the Jesuits of his day had degenerated from their original
                    standard; and thus he was not at liberty to go down to that principle which
                    underlies the whole theory of probabilism, namely, the substitution of external
                    authority for the voice of conscience. Hence the ultimate failure of his
                    brilliant attack. The same error of complaining against integral parts of the
                    original system as though they were departures from its spirit marks the
                    treatise of the Jesuit Mariana on certain faults in the government of the
                    society, which was published at Bordeaux soon after his death, in Spanish,
                    French, Latin, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n680/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0680-0651"/> and Italian, from a MS. taken from him when he
                    was in prison. The evils he specifies are the spy system (which he declares to
                    be carried so far that, if the general’s archives at Rome should be searched,
                    not one Jesuit’s character would be found to escape), the monopoly of the higher
                    offices in the hands of a small clique, the narrow range of study, and the
                    absence of encouragement and recompense for the best men of the society. But any
                    fair examination of the constitutions will show that all these belong to the
                    original scheme of government, and should have been challenged on that ground,
                    if at all. Yet, on the broad issue, Pascal’s censures have in the main been
                    justified by the subsequent teaching of the society, for the lax casuistry which
                    he held up to ridicule has been formally reproduced in the most modern and
                    popular Jesuit text book on the subject, that of F. Gury, while the works of
                    Liguori and Scavini, though not of direct Jesuit origin, are yet interpenetrated
                    with the same opinions. And the result of dispassionate examination of these and
                    kindred works—always bearing in mind that no Jesuit writings can be published
                    without special licence from the general, after carefuΓ scrutiny and review—is
                    that the three principles of probabilism, of mental reservation, and of
                    justification of means by ends, which collectively make up what educated men
                    intend by the term “Jesuitry,” are recognized maxims of the society. As the last
                    of these three is at once the most odious in itself and the charge which is most
                    anxiously repelled, it is well to cite three leading Jesuit theologians in
                    proof. Busembaum, whose <hi rend="italic">Medulla</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Theologis</hi> has been more than fifty times printed, and lately by the
                    Propaganda itself, lays down the maxim in the following terms: “Cum finis est
                    licitus, etiam media sunt licita,” and, “Cui licitus est finis, etiam licent
                    media.” Layman, similarly, in his <hi rend="italic">Theologia Moralis,</hi> “Cui
                    concessus est finis, concessa etiam sunt media ad finem ordinata;” and Wagemann,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Synopsis Theologiae Moralis,</hi> yet more tersely,
                    “Finis determinat probitatem actus.” In point of fact, many rules of conduct
                    based on these three principles have gradually percolated, as might have been
                    expected, into popular catechisms, and so have weakened the plea that we are
                    dealing only with technical manuals for a professional class; while the
                    plausible defence from the fair average honesty and morality of the lay-folk
                    taught by a clergy which uses these manuals, amounts simply to a confession that
                    the ordinary secular conscience is a safer guide in morals than a Jesuit
                    casuist, since the more nearly the code deducible from his text-books is
                    conformed to the more widely must the pupil diverge from all accredited
                    ethics.</p>
                <p>Two causes have been at work to produce the universal failure of the great
                    company in all its plans and efforts. And first stands its lack of powerful
                    intellects. Nothing can be wider from the truth than the popular conception of
                    the ordinary Jesuit as a being of almost superhuman abilities and universal
                    knowledge. The company is without doubt a <hi rend="italic">corps &lt;T
                    elite,</hi> and an average member of it is of choicer quality than the average
                    member of any equally large body, besides being disciplined by a far more
                    perfect drill. But it takes great men to carryout great plans, and of great men
                    the company has been markedly barren from almost the first. Apart from its
                    mighty founder, and his early colleague Francis Xavier, there are absolutely
                    none who stand in the very first rank. They have had, no doubt, able
                    administrators, like Acquaviva; methodical and lucid compilers, like the
                    Bollandists and Cornelius a Lapide; learned and plausible controversialists,
                    like Bellarmine; elegant preachers, as Bourdaloue, Segneri, and Vieyra;
                    distinguished mathematicians,like Le Seur, Jacquier, and more lately Secehi; but
                    even their one boldest and most original thinker, Denis Petau, has produced no
                    permanent influence over the current of human thought. They have had no Aquinas,
                    no Anselm, no Bacon, no Richelieu. Men whom they trained and who broke loose
                    from their teaching, Pascal, Descartes, Voltaire, have powerfully affected the
                    philosophical and religious beliefs of great masses of mankind, but respectable
                    mediocrity is the brand on the long list of Jesuit names in the catalogues of
                    Alegambe and De Backer. This result is due chiefly to the destructive process of
                    scooping out the will of the J esuit novice, to replace it with that of his
                    superior (as a watchmaker might fit a new movement into a case), and thereby
                    annihilating in all instances those subtle qualities of individuality and
                    originality which are essential to genius. Men of the highest stamp will either
                    refuse to submit to the process, or will come forth from the mill with their
                    finest qualities pulverized and useless. Nor is this all. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Patio Studiomιm,</hi> as devised by Acquaviva, and still followed in the
                    collèges of the society, lays down rules which are incompatible with all breadth
                    and progress in the higher forms of education. True to the anti-speculative and
                    traditional side of Loyola’s mind, it prescribes that even where religious
                    topics are not in question, the teacher is not to permit any novel opinions or
                    discussions to be mooted; nor to cite himself, or allow others to cite, the
                    opinion of an author not of known repute; nor to teach or suffer to be taught
                    anything contrary to the prevalent opinions of acknowledged doctors current in
                    the schools. Obsolete and false opinions are not to be mentioned at all, even
                    for refutation, nor are objections to received teaching to be dwelt on at any
                    length. The professor of Biblical literature is always to support and defend the
                    Vulgate reading, and to cite the Hebrew and Greek only when they can at least be
                    reconciled therewith; while all versions except the LXX. (which is to be spoken
                    of respectfully) are to be passed over entirely, save when they help to confirm
                    the Vulgate text. In philosophy, Aristotle is to be always followed, and Aquinas
                    generally, care being taken to speak respectfully of him even when abandoning
                    his opinion. It is not wonderful that, under such a method of training, highly
                    cultivated commonplace should be the inevitable average result, and that in
                    proportion as Jesuit power has become dominant in Latin Christendom, the same
                    doom of intellectual sterility, and consequent loss of influence with the higher
                    and thoughtful classes, has spread from the part to the whole. The second cause
                    which has blighted the efforts of the company is the lesson, too faithfully
                    learnt and practised, of making its corporate interests the first object at all
                    times and in all places. The most brilliant exception to this rule is found in
                    some of the foreign missions of the society, and notably in that of St Francis
                    Xavier. But Xavier quitted Europe in 1541, before the new society had hardened
                    into its final mould, and never returned. His work, so far as we can gather from
                    contemporary accounts, was not done on the true Jesuit lines, though the company
                    has reaped all its credit; and it is even possible that had he succeeded Loyola
                    as general of the Jesuits the institute might have been seriously and
                    healthfully modified. It would almost seem that careful selection was made of
                    the men of greatest piety and enthusiasm, such as Anchieta, Baraza, and Brebeuf,
                    whose unworldliness made them less apt for the diplomatic intrigues of the
                    society in Europe, to break new ground in the various foreign missions, where
                    their successes would throw lustre on the society, and their scruples need never
                    come into play. But such men are rare, and as they died off, their places had to
                    be filled with more sophisticated and ordinary characters, whose one aim was to
                    increase the power and resources of the society. Hence the condescension to
                    heathen rites in Hindustan and China. The first successes of the Indian mission
                    were entirely amongst the lowest class; but when Robert de’ Nobili, to win the

                    in 1605 —a step sanctioned by Gregory XV. in 1623—the fathers who followed his
                    example pushed the new caste-feeling so far as absolutely to refuse the
                    ministrations and sacraments of religion to the pariahs, lest the Brahman
                    converts should take offence,—an attempt which was reported to Rome by Norbert,
                    a Capuchin, and by the bishop of Rosalia, and was vainly censured in the
                    pontifical briefs of Innocent X. in 1645, Clement IX. in 1669, Clement XII. in
                    1734 and 1739, and Benedict XIV. in 1745. The Chinese rites, assailed with equal
                    unsuccess by one pope after another, were not finally put down until 1744, by a
                    bull of Benedict XIV. For Japan, where their side of the story is that best
                    known, we have a remarkable letter, printed by Wadding, addressed to Paul V. by
                    Soleto, a Franciscan missionary, who was martyred in 1624, in which he complains
                    to the pope that the Jesuits had systematically postponed the spiritual welfare
                    of the native Christians to their own convenience and advantage, while, as
                    regards the test of martyrdom, no such result had followed on their teaching,
                    but only on that of the other orders who had undertaken missionary work in
                    Japan. Again, even in Paraguay, the most promising of all Jesuit undertakings,
                    the evidence shows that the fathers, though civilizing the Guarani population
                    just sufficiently to make them useful and docile servants, happier, no doubt,
                    than they were before or after, stopped short there, and employed them simply in
                    raising produce to be traded with for the interests of the society, in
                    accordance with a privilege conferred on them by Gregory XIII., licensing them
                    to engage in commerce.</p>
                <p>These examples are sufficient to explain the final collapse of so many promising
                    efforts. The individual J esuit might be, and often was, a hero, saint, and
                    martyr, but the system of which he was a part, and which he was obliged to
                    administer, is fundamentally unsound, and in contravention of inevitable laws of
                    nature, so that his noblest toils were foredoomed to failure, save in so far as
                    they tended to ennoble and perfect himself, and offered a model for others to
                    imitate.</p>
                <p>The influence of the society since its revival in Latin Christendom has not been
                    beneficial. It presents the seeming paradox of the strictest and most
                    irreproachable body amongst the Roman clergy doing nothing to raise the general
                    standard of clerical morals; of that which is collectively the best educated
                    order setting itself to popularize merely emotional and material cults, to the
                    practical neglect and disparagement of more spiritual agencies; of the most
                    intellectual religious teachers deliberately eviscerating the understanding, and
                    endeavouring to substitute mechanical submission to a word of command for
                    intelligent and spontaneous assent to reasonable argument. And yet in all this
                    they are but carrying out the fatal principles of the original institute. True
                    to the teaching of that remarkable panegyric on the society, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Imago</hi><hi rend="italic">Primi</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    (probably written by John Tollenarius in 1640), they have identified the church
                    with their own society, and have considered only what mode of action would make
                    it more easily governed in the same spirit. It is thus for the advantage of such
                    a scheme that laymen should reason as little as possible on questions of
                    theology, that the fathers of the company should hold an acknowledged position
                    of moral and intellectual superiority to the ordinary secular clergy, that all
                    the threads of ecclesiastical authority should be gathered up into one hand, and
                    that one hand in the stronger grasp of the society—a policy modelled exactly on
                    the lines of the concordat of Napoleon I. with Pius VII. Hence the long
                    preparation and elaborate intrigues which issued in the Vatican decrees of papal
                    infallibility and immediate jurisdiction in all dioceses, the ultimate issues of
                    which are still hidden in futurity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">History.</hi></p>
                <p>Such being in outline the constitution and character of the Company of Jesus, it
                    remains to summarize its historical career. Don Inigo de Loyola, a nobleman of
                    Guipuzcoa, brave and accomplished, but unversed in letters, was severely wounded
                    at the siege of Pampeluna in 1521, when he was thirty years of age. Sent to his
                    father’s castle by his chivalrous captors, he was induced by the reading of some
                    pious books, intended to divert the tedium of illness, to devote himself to a
                    religious life. Quitting his home, he betook himself first to Montserrat and
                    thence, in the garb of a pilgrim, to Manresa, a small town near Barcelona,
                    whence, after serving for a time in the hospital, he withdrew to a cavern close
                    at hand, where, amidst the practice of various austerities, he made the first
                    draft of his famous <hi rend="italic">Spiritual Exercises,</hi> a work which,
                    often retouched and amplified in his later years, is one of the chief
                    authoritative formularies of his society. Thence he proceeded by way of
                    Barcelona to sail for Italy, and, after visiting Rome and Venice, he made a
                    pilgrimage to Jerusalem, intending if possible to establish a missionary society
                    there for the conversion of the Mahometans. Compelled to withdraw by the
                    provincial of the Franciscans, who feared a collision with the Turkish
                    authorities, Loyola returned to Spain, and at thirty-three years of age attended
                    school at Barcelona to acquire the rudiments of Latin, spending two years there
                    between his studies and such missionary work as was possible for him. He then
                    removed in 1526 to the newly founded university of Alcala, where he first began
                    to gather round him a little band of fellowworkers, holding religious
                    conferences amongst the students, and giving private instruction besides to
                    various townsfolk. This conduct drew on him the suspicions of the Inquisition,
                    but after a short imprisonment he was released, and migrated to Salamanca,
                    whither two of his friends had preceded him. Here he was again thrown into
                    prison on suspicion of heresy, and formed the plan of going to Paris on
                    recovering his liberty, as a place where he could have more freedom of action,
                    superior teaching, and a greater likelihood of finding able recruits in so
                    central and populous a city for the society he was preparing to found. He
                    reached Paris in 1528, and entered at the college of St Barbara in the
                    university. Not until his sixth year of residence did he attempt the regular
                    organization of the most promising of the young men whom he drew around him. It
                    was in July 1534 that he opened his plans to them for starting a missionary
                    society to work in the Holy Land, and the actual vows, binding the new
                    companions to one another and to the sort of life they contemplated, or to
                    direct service of the pope, should that prove impracticable, were taken in the
                    crypt of Notre Dame de Montmartre on August 15, 1534, by Ignatius Loyola
                    himself; Peter Faber or Le Fèvre, a Savoyard; Francis Xavier, Diego Laynez,
                    Alfonso Salmeron, Nicolas Alfonso de Bobadilla, Spaniards; and Simon Rodriguez,
                    a Portuguese. With his usual practical foresight, Loyola postponed the execution
                    of their scheme till January 25, 1537, and provided for its possible
                    modification or abandonment. Three more disciples speedily joined the infant
                    society, Jean Codure, Claude le Jay, and Paschase Brouet. In March 1535 Loyola
                    quitted Paris, committing his society to Faber, the eldest, and betook himself
                    to Spain, where he remained a few months, and then proceeded to Venice, whence
                    he wrote to summon his companions to join him. They left Paris on November 15,
                    1536, and reached Venice on January 6, 1537, where their leader had already
                    gained three fresh recruits, Hosez ana the two brothers D’Eguia. Remaining in
                    Venice himself for prudential reasons, he sent all the others to Rome to solicit
                    from Paul 111, leave to go as missionaries to Jerusalem. They were aided in
                    their application by Pedro Ortiz, the emperor’s envoy, and readily obtained the
                    desired permission, with further licence to be ordained priests by any bishop,
                    on being duly qualified.</p>
                <p>Returning to Venice, they were ordained on St John Baptist’s Day, 1537, along
                    with Loyola himself, by Vincenzio (or Antonio) Nigu-santi, bishop of Arba. A war
                    which broke out between Turkey and Venice made the intended journey to Palestine
                    impracticable; and accordingly Loyola, Faber, and Laynez betook themselves to
                    Rome, while the others dispersed themselves through the chief university towns
                    of North Italy, and began their work as home missionary preachers; and it was
                    immediately before they separated on this occasion, at Vicenza in November 1537,
                    that Loyola announced his intention that their fellowship should henceforward be
                    known as the “Company of Jesus,” and that, abandoning their original plan of a
                    purely Oriental mission, they should offer themselves to the pope as a special
                    militia. It may be here remarked that the more popular name “Jesuits” seems to
                    have been first used by Calvin, and it appears also in the register of the
                    parliament of Paris as early as 1552, while the enemies of the society in Spain
                    usually spoke of its members as “Inigistas,” after the name of its founder.</p>
                <p>On their arrival at Rome, the three Jesuits weιe favourably received by Paul
                    III., who at once appointed Faber to the chair of Biblical exegesis, and Laynez
                    to that of scholastic theology, in the collegeof Sapienza. But they encountered
                    much opposition, and were even charged with heresy, nay, when this accusation
                    had been disposed of, there still were difficulties in the way of starting any
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n682/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0682-0653"/> new order. Despite the approval of Contarini, and
                    the goodwill of the pope himself (who is said to have exclaimed, on perusing
                    Loyola’s papers, “The finger of God is here”), there was a strong and general
                    feeling that the monastic system had broken down utterly, and could not be
                    wisely developed further. Cardinal Guidiceioni, one of a committee of three
                    appointed to examine the draft constitutions, was known to advocate the
                    abolition of all existing orders save four, which were to be remodelled and put
                    under strict control. And it was that very year, 1538, that a committee of
                    cardinals, consisting of Reginald Pole, Contarini, Sadolet, Caraffa (afterwards
                    Paul IV. ), Fregoso, Aleander, and Badia, had just reported to the pope that the
                    conventual orders were such a scandal to Christendom that they should be all
                    abolished—“<hi rend="italic">abolendos putamus</hi><hi rend="italic">omnesT</hi>
                    Not only so, but, when greater strictness of rule and of enclosure seemed the
                    most needful reforms in communities which had become too secular in tone, the
                    proposal of Loyola to make it a first principle that the members of his new
                    institute should mix freely with the world, and be as little marked off as
                    possible externally from secular life and usages, ran counter to all tradition
                    and prejudice, save that Caraffa’s then recent order of Theatines, from which
                    Loyola copied some details, had taken some steps in the same direction.</p>
                <p>Loyola and his companions, however, had little doubt of ultimat success, and so
                    bound themselves, on April 15, 1539, to obey any superior chosen from amongst
                    their body, and added on May 4 certain other rules, the most important of which
                    was the vow of’ special allegiance to the pope for mission purposes, to be taken
                    by all members of the society. But Guidiceioni, on a careful study of the
                    papers, changed his mind,—partly, it is supposed, because of the strong interest
                    in the new scheme exhibited by the king of Portugal, who instructed his
                    ambassador to press it on the pope, and to ask Loyola himself for some priests
                    of his society for mission work in Portugal and its Indian possessions, and
                    accordingly Xavier and Rodriguez were sent to the king in March 1540. And on
                    September 27, 1540, the bull <hi rend="italic">Regimini militantis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ecclesiae</hi> was published, confirming the new order, but
                    limiting its members to sixty, a restriction which was removed by a later bull
                    in March 1543. In the Latin translation of the original draft constitutions,
                    approved by the pope, the word <hi rend="italic">comρania</hi> was represented
                    by <hi rend="italic">societas,</hi> though <hi rend="italic">cohors</hi> or some
                    such military term would have more exactly reproduced the founder’s idea, and
                    thus the Jesuit body is known indifferently as “Company” or “Society,” while the
                    title “Order” is never officially given to it. This title was finally settled by
                    Gregory XIV. in a bull of June 28, 1594.</p>
                <p>On April 7, 1541, Loyola was unanimously chosen superior. His refusal of this
                    post was overruled, so he entered on his new office on April 13, and on April 15
                    the newly constituted society took its formal corporate vows as a religious
                    order in the church of St Paul-without-the-Walls. The general entered on his
                    duties by holding public catechizings in Sta Maria in Strata for eight and forty
                    days, a precedent followed ever since by his successors in office. Scarcely was
                    the society launched when its members dispersed in various directions to their
                    new tasks. Salmeron and Brouet were sent, clothed with the powers of papal
                    legates, on a secret mission to Ireland, to encourage the native clergy and
                    people in resistance to the religious changes introduced by Henry VIII.;
                    Bobadilla went to Naples; Faber, first to the diet of Worms, and then to Spain;
                    Laynez and Le Jay to Germany, while their general busied himself in founding the
                    convent of St Martha at Rome for female penitents, and that of St Catherine for
                    unprotected young women, as also in perfecting the original draft of the
                    constitutions, a task he did not finish till 1550. Success crowned these first
                    efforts, and the earliest college of the society was founded at Coimbra in 1542
                    by King John III. of Portugal, who secured the appointment of Simon Rodriguez as
                    its rector. It was designed as a training-school to feed the Indian mission, of
                    which Francis Xavier had already taken the oversight, while a seminary at Goa
                    was the second institution founded out of Rome in connexion with the society. In
                    Spain, national pride in the founder aided their cause almost as much as royal
                    patronage in Portugal, and the next house of the society after Goa was opened at
                    Gandia under the protection of its duke, F rancis Borgia; in Germany they were
                    eagerly welcomed as the only persons able to meet the Lutherans on equal terms;
                    and only in France, of the countries still belonging to the Roman communion, was
                    their advance checked, owing to political distrust of their Spanish origin,
                    together with the hostility of the Sorbonne and the bishop of Paris. However,
                    after many difficulties, they succeeded in getting a footing through the Help of
                    Duprat, bishop of Clermont, who founded a college for them in 1545 in the town
                    of Billom, besides making over to them his house at Paris, the Hôtel de
                    Clermont, which became the nucleus of the afterwards famous college of
                    Louis-le-Grand, while a formal legalization was granted to them by the

                <p>In Rome, Paul III.’s favour did not lessen. He bestowed on them the church of St
                    Andrea, where now Cardinal Alessandro Farnese’s stately erection, the Gesù,
                    stands, and conferred on them at the same time the more valuable privilege of
                    altering their own statutes, besides two others procured in 1546, which Loyola
                    had still more at heart, as touching the very essence of his institute, namely,
                    exemption from ecclesiastical offices and dignities, and from the task of actin»
                    as directors and confessors to convents of nuns. The former of these measures
                    effectually stopped any drain of the best members away from the society, and
                    limited their hopes within its bounds, by putting them more fully at the
                    general’s disposal, especially as it was provided that the final vows could not
                    be annulled, and that only the joint action of the general and the pope could
                    dismiss a professed member from the society. The regulation as to convents seems
                    due partly to a desire to avoid the worry and expenditure of time involved in
                    the discharge of such offices, and partly to a conviction that penitents of the
                    kind would be of no effectual use to the society; whereas Loyola, against the
                    wishes of several of his companions, laid much stress on the duty of accepting
                    the post of confessor to kings, queens, and women of high rank, when opportunity
                    presented itself. And the year 1546 is notable in the annals of the society as
                    that in which it embarked on its great educational career, especially by the
                    annexation of free day-schools to all its colleges.</p>
                <p>The council of Trent did much to increase the reputation of the new society, for
                    the pope chose three of its members, Laynez, Faber, and Salmeron, to act as his
                    theologians in that assembly, and they had no little influence in framing its
                    dogmatic definitions and decrees. In 1548 the company received a valuable
                    recruit in the person of Francis Borgia, duke of Gandia, afterwards third
                    general, while two important events marked 1550,—the foundation of the Collegio
                    Romano, and a fresh confirmation of the society by pope Julius III. The German
                    college, for the children of poor nobles, was founded in 1552, and in tlιe same
                    year Loyola firmly settled the discipline of the society by putting down with
                    promptness and severity some attempts at independent action on the part of
                    Rodriguez at Coimbra; while 1553 saw the despatch of a mission to Abyssinia, and
                    the first quarrel of the society with the pope, who thought that the Spanish
                    Jesuits were taking· part with the emperor against the Holy See, but was
                    reconciled by the good offices of Ferdinand, king of the Romans. Paul IV. (whose
                    election at first alarmed the Jesuits, for they had found him not very friendly
                    as Cardinal Caraffa) proved as favourable to them as his predecessors; and, when
                    Ignatius Loyola died in 1556 under his pontificate, the society already counted
                    forty-five professed fathers and two thousand ordinary members, distributed over
                    twelve provinces, with more than a hundred colleges and houses. After two years’
                    interregnum, Laynez, who had acted as vicar in the meanwhile, was elected
                    general in 1558, and was successful in a straggle with the pope, who desired to
                    enforce the recitation of the breviary on tbe society, and to limit the tenure
                    of tbe generalship to a term of three years, but could effect neither object.
                    Laynez also succeeded in increasing further the already enormous powers of the
                    general by adding these four clauses to the constitutions :—that the general
                    alone can make contracts binding the society; that he can authoritatively gloss
                    and interpret the rules and laws, can enact new or repeal old laws, and may have
                    prisons for the incarceration of refractory members. He took a leading part in
                    the colloquy of Poissy in 1561 between the Catholics and Huguenots, and
                    obtained, as already said, a legal footing from the states-gencral for colleges
                    of the society in France. He died in 1564, leaving the society increased to
                    eighteen provinces, with a hundred and thirty colleges, and was succeeded by
                    Francis Borgia. It was during his generalship that the greatest favour yet
                    vouchsafed the company was bestowed by Pius V., who not only confirmed by bull
                    all former privileges, and extended to it further every privilege that had been
                    or might afterwards be granted to any order with vows of poverty, but also
                    decreed that these letters should at no time be capable of being revoked,
                    limited, or derogated from by the Holy See, nor be included within any
                    revocation of similar or dissimilar privileges, but be for ever excepted
                    therefrom. It was a trifling set-off to such a grant that the pope in 1567 again
                    enjoined the lathers to recite the canonical hours in choir, and to admit only
                    the professed to priest’s orders, especially as Gregory XIII. rescinded both
                    these injunction's in 1573; and indeed, as regards the hours, all that Pius V.
                    was able to obtain was the nominal concession that the breviary should be
                    recited in the professed houses only, and that not of necessity by more than two
                    persons at a time. Eberhard Mercurian, a Fleming, succeeded Borgia in 1572
                    (being forced on the company by the pope, in preference to Polanco, Loyola’s
                    secretary and then vicar-general, who was rejected partly as a Spaniard, and
                    still more because he was a “New Christian” of Jewish origin, and therefore
                    objected to in Spain itself), and was in turn followed by Claudio Acquaviva, an
                    able and strong-willed man, who sat from 1581 to 1615, a time almost exactly
                    coinciding with the high tide of the great and successful counter-Reformation
                    movement, chiefly due to the Jesuits, which had begun under Borgia. It was,
                    however, during his generalship that the company’s evil reputation began to
                    eclipse its good report, that they first had the pope their avowed enemy, and
                    that they were driven from England (whither they had come chiefly from the
                    seminary founded at Douay by Cardinal Allen in 1568).</p>

                <p>once in 1581, and again in 1601, as conspirators against the life of Queen
                    Elizabeth, and later again for their share in the Gunpowder Plot; from France as
                    accomplices in the attempt of Châtel to assassinate Henry IV.; and from Antwerp
                    as having resisted the pacification of Ghent. It is true that the edict of the
                    parliament of Paris in 1594, which banished them from France, was revoked in
                    1603, by desire of Henry IV., who permitted them to return under conditions; and
                    this fact has been much τelied on by Jesuit writers in proof of their innocence
                    of all complicity in ChateΓs plot. But as Sully has recorded for us that Henry
                    declared his only motive to be the expediency of not driving them into a corner,
                    and so inducing them to murder him through despair or revenge, and that his only
                    hope of tranquillity lay in appeasing them, his conduct dees not tell much in
                    their favour.</p>
                <p>It was also during Acquaviva’s generalship that Philip II. of Spain complained
                    bitterly of the company to Pope Sixtus V., and encouraged him in those plans of
                    reform which were cut short by his death in 1590, and also that the
                    long-protracted discussions on grace, wherein the Dominicans contended against
                    the Jesuits, were carried on at Rome, with little practical result, by the
                    Congregation <hi rend="italic">Ba</hi><hi rend="italic">Auxiliis,</hi> which
                    began to sit in 1598, and continued till 1607. He saw too the expulsion of the
                    Jesuits from Venice in 1606 for siding with Paul V. when he placed the republic
                    under ξ∣n interdict, but did not live to see their recall, which took place at
                    the intercession of Louis XIV. in 1657. But the concessions made to the company
                    by Gregory XIV., successor of Sixtus V., during his short reign of twelve
                    months, almost seemed to compensate for all these troubles; for he not only
                    confirmed all existing privileges, but conferred also that of being able to
                    expel members of the society without any form of trial, or even documentary
                    procedure, besides denouncing excommunication against every one save the pope or
                    his legates who directly or indirectly infringed the constitutions of the
                    society, or attempted to bring about any change therein.</p>
                <p>Under Vitelleschi, Acquaviva’s successor, the first centenary of the society was
                    held on September 25, 1639, the hundredth anniversary of the verbal approbation
                    given to the draft constitutions by Paul III., and there were then thirty-six
                    provinces, with eight hundred houses, containing fifteen thousand Jesuits. It
                    was in the following year that the great controversy which raged for a century
                    in the Latin Church broke out by the posthumous publication of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Augustinus</hi> of Cornelius Jansen, bishop of Ypres, in which the
                    Jesuits took the leading part, and finally secured the victory for their
                    teaching throughout the Roman obedience. It was in this same year 1640 that,
                    considering themselves ill-used by the countduke Olivarez, prime minister of
                    Philip IV. of Spain, they powerfully aided the revolution which placed the duke
                    of Braganza on the throne of Portugal, and their services were rewarded with a
                    practical control of ecclesiastical and almost of civil affairs in that kingdom,
                    which lasted for more than a hundred years.</p>
                <p>The society also gained ground steadily in France, for, though held in check
                    during Richelieu’s life, and little more favoured by Mazarin, yet from the
                    moment Louis XIV. assumed the reins of government, their star was in the
                    ascendant, and Jesuit confessors, the most celebrated of whom were La Chaise and
                    Letellier, guided the policy of the king, not hesitating to take his side in his
                    quarrel with the Holy See, which nearly resulted in a schism, nor to sign the
                    Gallican articles. How their hostility to the Huguenots forced on the revocation
                    of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, and their war against Jansenism did not cease
                    till the very walls of Port Royal were demolished in 1710, even to the abbey
                    church itself, and the bodies of the holy dead taken with every mark of insult
                    from their graves, and literally flung to the dogs to devour, is well known.
                    But, while thus gaining power in one direction, the company was losing it in
                    others. The Japanese mission had vanished in blood by 1651, and, though many
                    Jesuit fathers and their converts died bravely as martyrs for the faith, yet it
                    is impossible to acquit them of a large share in the causes of that overthrow.
                    And it was about this same period that the grave scandal of the Chinese and
                    Malabar rites, already referred to, began to attract attention in Europe, and to
                    make thinking men ask seriously whether the Jesuit missionaries taught anything
                    which could be fairly called Christianity at alh When it is remembered, too,
                    that they decided in a council at Lima that it was inexpedient to impose any act
                    of Christian devotion except baptism on their South American converts, without
                    the greatest precautions, on the ground of intellectual difficulties, it is not
                    wonderful that this doubt was not satisfactorily cleared up, notably in face of
                    the charges brought against the society by Bernardin de Cardonas, bishop of
                    Paraguay, and the saintly Palafox, bishop of Angelopolis in Mexico, whom they
                    persecuted till he had to fly for his life, and could be protected by the pope
                    himself only by his translation to a European see. As regards their North
                    American work, the Abbé Badiche, continuator of Helyot, pays the Jesuits the
                    doubtful compliment of saying that the Red Indian tribes which accepted the
                    gospel with joy, “learned to mingle Jesus Christ and France together in their
                    affection.”</p>
                <p>The seeds of decay were already germinating within the company itself. A
                    succession of devout but incapable generals after the death of Acquaviva saw the
                    gradual secularization of tone by the flocking in of recruits of rank and
                    wealth, desirous to share in the glories and influence of the company, but not
                    well adapted to increase them, and too readily admitted on merely temporal
                    grounds; while the old strict discipline was relaxed, as the professed fathers
                    gradually encroached on the general’s authority, till they went the length, in
                    1661, of appointing a vicar-general with powers which practically superseded
                    those of tire general, Goswin Nickel, whom they did not think it expedient to
                    depose formally. And, though the political weight of the company continued to
                    increase in the cabinets of Europe, yet it was being steadily weakened
                    internally. They abandoned, too, the system of free education, which had won
                    them so much influence and honour; by attaching themselves exclusively to the
                    interests of courts, they lost favour with the middle and lower classes; and,
                    above all, their monopoly of power and patronage in France, with the fatal use
                    they had made of it, drew down the bitterest hostility upon them. It was indeed
                    to their credit that the Encyclopedists attacked them as the foremost
                    representatives of Christianity, but they are accountable in no small degree for
                    the unfavourable opinion of the nature and merits of Christianity itself which
                    their opponents entertained. But that part of the policy of the company which
                    proved most fatal to it, and served as the pretext of the attacks before which
                    it fell, was its activity, wealth, and importance as a great trading firm, with
                    branch houses scattered over the richest producing countries in the world. Its
                    founder, with a wise instinct, had forbidden the accumulation of wealth; its own
                    constitutions, as revised in the eighty-fourth decree of the sixth general
                    congregation, had forbidden all pursuits of a commercial nature, as also had
                    various popes, rescinding the decree of Gregory XIII.; but nevertheless, the
                    trade went on unceasingly. The first mutterings of the storm which was soon to'
                    break were heard in a severe brief issued in 1741 by Benedict XIV., the most
                    learned and able of the later popes, wherein he denounced the Jesuits as
                    “disobedient, contumacious, captious, and reprobate persons,” and enacted many
                    stringent regulations for their better government; and this was followed up by
                    two bulls, <hi rend="italic">Ex quo</hi><hi rend="italic">singulari</hi> in
                    1742, and <hi rend="italic">Omnium sollicitιcdinum</hi> in 1744, striking at
                    their continued insubordination in the matter of the Chinese rites, which,
                    however, did not save them from an edict of banishment from China itself in
                    1753, and the last of them disappeared thence in 1774.</p>
                <p>The first serious attack came from a country where they had been long dominant.
                    In 1753 Spain and Portugal exchanged certain American provinces with each other,
                    which involved a transfer of sovereign rights over Paraguay, but it was provided
                    that the populations should severally migrate also, that the subjects of each
                    crown might remain the same as before. The inhabitants of the * reductions,”
                    whom the Jesuits had trained in the use of European arms and discipline, rose in
                    revolt, and attacked the troops and authorities. Their previous docility, and
                    their entire submission to the Jesuit missionaries, left no doubt possible as to
                    the source of their rebellion, though direct proof was, as usual, lacking; and
                    the matter was not soon forgotten. In 1757 Carvalho, marquis of Pombal, prime
                    minister of Joseph I. of Portugal, dismissed the three Jesuit chaplains of the
                    king, and named three secular priests in their stead. He next complained to
                    Benedict XIV. that the trading operations of the society hampered the commercial
                    prosperity of the nation, and asked for remedial measures. The pope granted a
                    visitation of the society, and committed it to Cardinal Saldanha, a close
                    intimate of Pombal’s. He issued a severe decree against the Jesuits, and ordered
                    the confiscation of all their merchandise.</p>
                <p>But at this juncture Benedict XIV. died, and was succeeded, much as had happened
                    on several previous occasions, by a pope strongly in favour of the Jesuits,
                    Cardinal Rezzonico, who took the title of Clement XIII. Ponιbal, finding that no
                    help was to be expected from this quarter, adopted other means. The king was
                    fired at and wounded on returning from an assignation with his mistress, the
                    marchioness of Tavora, ßeptember 3, 1758. The duke of Aveiro, the marquis of
                    Tavora, and other persons of high rank were tried and executed for conspiracy,
                    while some of the Jesuits, who had undoubtedly been in communication with them,
                    were charged, on evidence whose value there are no certain means of testing, but
                    which seems very doubtful, with complicity in the attempted assassination.
                    Pombal charged the whole society with its guilt, and, unwilling to await the
                    dubious issue of an application he had made to the pope for licence to try them
                    in the civil courts, whence they were exempt, issued a decree on September 1,
                    1759, ordering their immediate deportation from Portugal and all its
                    dependencies, and their supersession by the bishops in the schools and
                    universities. Ιhose in Portugal were at once shipped to Italy, and such as were
                    in the colonies expelled speedily after. In France, Madame de Pompadour was
                    their enemy,—it is said, because they endeavoured to make her break off her
                    connexion with Louis XV., and refused her absolution on any other terms; but the
                    immediate cause of their ruin was the bankruptcy of F. Lavalette, the Jesuit
                    administrator of Martinique, a daring speculator, who failed for 2,400,000
                    francs, and ruined some French commercial houses ot note. Ricci, then general of
                    the Jesuits, repudiated the debt, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0684-0655"/> alleging lack of authority on Lavalette’s part to
                    pledge the credit of the society, and was sued by the creditors. Losing his
                    cause, he appealed to the parliament of Paris, and it, to decide the issue
                    raised by Ricci, required the constitutions of the Jesuits to be produced in
                    evidence, and affirmed the judgment of the courts below. But the publicity given
                    to a document scarcely known till then (indeed the first authoritative edition
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Constitutions</hi> is that of Prague in 1757) raised
                    the utmost indignation against the company. A royal commission, appointed by the
                    duke of Choiseul to examine the constitutions, convoked a private assembly of
                    fifty-one archbishops and bishops under the presidency of Cardinal de Luynes,
                    all of whom except six voted that the unlimited authority of the general was
                    incompatible with the laws of France, and that the appointment of a resident
                    vicar, subject to those laws, was the only solution of the question fair on all
                    sides. Ricci replied with the historical answer, “Sint ut sunt, aut non sint and
                    after some further delay, during which much interest was exerted in their
                    favour, the Jesuits were suppressed by an edict in November 1764, but suffered
                    to remain on the footing of secular priests, a grace withdrawn in 1767, when
                    they were expelled from the kingdom. In the very same year, Charles III. of
                    Spain, a monarch known for personal devoutness, convinced, on evidence not now
                    forthcoming, that the Jesuits were plotting against his authority, prepared,
                    through his minister D’Aranda, a decree suppressing the society in every part of
                    his dominions. Sealed despatches were sent to every Spanish colony, to be opened
                    on the same day, April 2, 1767, when the measure was" to take effect in Spain
                    itself, and the expulsion was relentlessly carried out, nearly six thousand
                    priests being deported from Spain alone, and sent to the Italian coast, whence,
                    however, they were repelled by the orders of the pope and Ricci himself, finding
                    a refuge atCorte in Corsica, after some months’suffering in overcrowded vessels
                    at sea. The general’s object may probably have been to accentuate the harshness
                    with which the fathers had been treated, and so to increase public sympathy, but
                    the actual result of his policy was blâme for the cruelty with which he enhanced
                    their misfortunes, for the poverty of Corsica made even a bare subsistence
                    scarcely procurable for them there. The Bourbon courts of Naples and Parma
                    followed the example of France and Spain, and Clement XIII. retorted with a bull
                    launched at the weakest adversary, and declaring the rank and title of the duke
                    of Parma forfeit. The Bourbon sovereigns threatened to make war on the pope in
                    return (France, indeed, seizing on the county of Avignon), and a joint note
                    demanding a retractation, and the abolition of the Jesuits, was presented by the
                    French ambassador at Rome on December 10, 1768, in the name of France, Spain,
                    and the Two Sicilies. The pope, a man of eighty-two, died of apoplexy, brought
                    on by the shock, early in 1769. Cardinal Lorenzo Ganganelli, a Franciscan, was
                    chosen to succeed him, and took the name of Clement XIV. He endeavoured to avert
                    the decision forced upon him, but, as Portugal joined the Bourbon league, and
                    Maria Theresa with her son the emperor Joseph II. ceased to protect the Jesuits,
                    there remained only the petty kingdom of Sardinia in their favour, though the
                    fall of Choiseul in France raised the hopes of the society for a time. The pope
                    began with some preliminary measures, permitting first the renewal of lawsuits
                    against the society, which had been suspended by papal authority, and which,
                    indeed, had in no case been ever successful at Rome. He then closed the Collegio
                    Romano, on the plea of its insolvency, seized on the houses at Frascati and
                    Tivoli, and broke up the establishments in Bologna and the Legations at large.
                    Finally, on July 21, 1773, the famous brief <hi rend="italic">Dominus ac
                    Redemptor</hi> appeared, suppressing the Society of Jesus. This remarkable
                    document opens by citing a long series of precedents for the suppression of
                    religious orders by the Holy See, amongst which occurs the ill-omened instance
                    of the Templars. It then briefly sketches the objects and history of the Jesuits
                    themselves. It speaks of their defiance of their own constitution, expressly
                    revived by Paul V., forbidding them to meddle in politics; of the great ruin to
                    souls caused by their quarrels with local ordinaries and the other religious
                    orders, their conformity to heathen usages in the East, and the disturbances,
                    resulting in persecutions of the church, which they had stirred up even in
                    Catholic countries, so that several popes had been obliged to punish them.
                    Seeing then that the Catholic sovereigns had been forced to expel them, that
                    many bishops and other eminent persons demanded their extinction, and that the
                    society had ceased to fulfil the intention of its institute, the pope declares
                    it necessary for the peace of the church that it should be suppressed,
                    extinguished, abolished, and abrogated for ever, with all its rites, houses,
                    colleges, schools, and hospitals; transfers all the authority of its general or
                    officers to the local ordinaries; forbids the reception of any more novices,
                    directing that such as were actually in probation should be dismissed,'and
                    declaring that profession in the society should not serve as a title to holy
                    orders. Priests of the society are given the option of either joining other
                    orders or remaining as secular clergy, under obedience to the ordinaries, who
                    are empowered to grant or withhold from them licences to hear confessions. Such
                    of the fathers as are engaged in the work of education are permitted to
                    continue, on condition of abstaining from lax and questionable doctrines, apt to
                    cause strife and trouble. The question of missions is reserved, and the
                    relaxations granted to the society in such matters as fasting, reciting the
                    hours, and reading heretical books, are withdrawn; while the brief ends with
                    clauses carefully drawn to bar any legal exceptions that might be taken against
                    its full validity and obligation. It has been necessary to cite these heads of
                    the brief, because the apologists of the society allege that no motive
                    influenced the pope save the desire of peace at any price, and that he did not
                    believe in the culpability of the fathers. The categorical charges made in the
                    document, and that in the most solemn fashion, rebut this plea. The pope
                    followed up this brief by appointing a congregation of cardinals to take
                    possession of the temporalities of the society, and armed it with summary powers
                    against all who should attempt to retain or conceal any of the property. He also
                    threw Lorenzo Ricci, the general, into prison in the castle of St Angelo, where
                    he died in 1775, under the pontificate of Pius VI., who, though not unfavourable
                    to the company, and owing his own advancement to it, dared not release him,
                    probably because his continued imprisonment was made a condition by the powers
                    who enjoyed a right of veto in papal elections. In September 1774 Clement XIV.
                    died after much suffering, and the question has been hotly debated ever since
                    whether poison administered by the J esuits was the cause of his death. It is
                    impossible to decide the doubt, as the opinions and evidence on each side are
                    nearly balanced. On the one hand, Salicetti, the pope’s physician, denied that
                    the body showed signs of poisoning, and Tanucci, Neapolitan ambassador at Rome,
                    who had a large share in procuring the brief of suppression, entirely acquits
                    the Jesuits, while F. Theiner, no friend to the company, does the like. On the
                    other hand, Scipio de’ Ricci, bishop of Pistoia, nephew and heir of the
                    unfortunate general, distinctly charges the Jesuits with the crime, as also does
                    Cardinal de Bernis; and the report by the Spanish minister to the court of
                    Madrid, printed by De Potter in his <hi rend="italic">Vie</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">de Sciρion de Ricci,</hi> vol. iii. pp.
                    151-74, contains the noteworthy fact that the date of the pope’s death was
                    predicted beforehand, notably in a statement made by the vicargeneral of Padua
                    to the secretary of the congregation for Jesuit affairs, that several members of
                    the company, believing him to be one of their friends, told him that the pope
                    would die before the end of September.</p>
                <p>At the date of this suppression, the company had 41 provinces and 22,589 members,
                    of whom 11,295 were priests. Far from submitting to the papal brief, the
                    Jesuits, after some ineffectual attempts at direct resistance, withdrew into the
                    territories of the non-Roman-Catholic sovereigns of Russia and Prussia,
                    Frederick II. and Catherine II., both of them freethinkers, who became their
                    active friends and protectors; and the fathers alleged as a principle, in so far
                    as their theology is concerned, that no papal bull is binding in a state whose
                    sovereign has not approved and authorized its publication and execution. Russia
                    formed the headquarters of the company; and two forged briefs were speedily
                    circulated, being dated June 9 and June 29, 1774, approving their establishment
                    in Russia, and implying the repeal of the brief of suppression. But these are
                    contradicted by the tenor of five genuine briefs, all issued in September of
                    that year· to the archbishop of Gnesen, and making certain assurances to the
                    Jesuits, on condition of their complete obedience to the injunctions already
                    laid on them. They also pleaded a verbal approbation by Pius VI., technically
                    known as an <hi rend="italic">Oraculum</hi><hi rend="italic">vivoe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vocis,</hi> but no proof of either· its existence or its validity
                    is forthcoming.</p>
                <p>They elected three Poles successively as generals, taking, however, only the
                    title of vicars, till on March 7,1801, Pius VII. granted them liberty to
                    reconstitute themselves in North Russia, and permitted Karen, then vicar, to
                    exercise full authority as general. On July 30, 1804, a similar brief restored
                    the Jesuits in the Two Sicilies, at the express desire of Ferdinand IV., the
                    pope thus anticipating the further action of 1814, λvhen, by the brief <hi
                    rend="italic">Sollici-tudo omnium</hi><hi rend="italic">Ecclesiarum,</hi> he
                    revoked the action of Clement XIV., and formally restored the society to
                    corporate legal existence, yet not only omitted any censure of his predecessor’s
                    conduct, but all vindication of the Jesuits from the heavy charges in the brief
                    <hi rend="italic">Dominus ac Redemptor.</hi> In France, even after their
                    expulsion in 1765, they had maintained a precarious footing in the country under
                    the partial. disguise and names of “Fathers of the Faith,” or “Clerks of the
                    Sacred Heart,” but were obliged by Napoleon I. to retire in 1804. They
                    reappeared under their true name in 1814, and obtained formal licence in 1822,
                    but became the objects of so much hostility that Charles X. deprived them by
                    ordinance of the right of instruction, and obliged all applicants for licences
                    as teachers to make oath that they did not belong to any. community unrecognized
                    by the laws. They were dispersed again by the revolution of July 1830, but soon
                    reappeared, and, though put to much inconvenience during the latter years of
                    Louis Philippe’s reign, notably in 1845, maintained their footing, recovered the
                    right to teach freely after the revolution of 1848, and gradually became the
                    leading educational and ecclesiastical power in France, notably under the second
                    empire, till they were once more expelled <pb break="no"

                    quietly returning since the execution of those measures. In Spain they came back
                    with Ferdinand VII., but were expelled at the constitutional rising in 1820,
                    returning in 1823, when the duke of Angoulême’s army replaced Ferdinand on his
                    throne; they were driven out once more by Espartero in 1835, and have had no
                    legal position since. In Portugal, ranging themselves on the side of Don Miguel,
                    they fell with his cause, and were exiled in 1834. Russia, which had been their
                    warmest patron, drove them from St Petersburg and Moscow in 1813, and from the
                    whole empire in 1820, mainly on the plea of attempted proselytizing in the
                    imperial army. Holland drove them out in 1816, and, by giving them thus a valid
                    excuse for aiding the Belgian revolution of 1830, secured them the strong
                    position they have ever since held in Belgium. They were expelled from
                    Switzerland in 1847-48 for the part they had taken in exciting the war of the
                    Sonderbund. In South Germany, inclusive of Austria and Bavaria, their annals
                    since their restoration have been uneventful; but in North Germany, owing to the
                    footing Frederick II. had given them in Prussia, they became very powerful,
                    especially in the Rhine provinces, and, gradually moulding the younger
                    generation of clergy after the close of the War of Liberation, succeeded in
                    spreading Ultramontane views amongst them, and so leading up to the difficulties
                    with the civil Government which issued in the Falk laws, and their own expulsion
                    by decree of the German parliament, June 19, 1872. In Great Britain, whither
                    they began to straggle over during the revolutionary troubles at the close of
                    the last century, and where, practically unaffected by the clause directed
                    against them in the Emancipation Act of 1829, their chief settlement has been at
                    Stonyhurst in Lancashire, an estate conferred on them by Mr Weld in 1795, they
                    have been unmolested; but there has been little affinity to the order in the
                    British temperament, and the English province has consequently never risen to
                    numerical or intellectual importance in the society. In Rome itself, its
                    progress after the restoration was at first slow, and it was not till the reign
                    of Leo XII. (1823-29) that it recovered its place as the chief educational body
                    there. It advanced steadily under Gregory XVI., and, though it was at first
                    shunned by Pius IX., it secured his entire confidence after his return from
                    Gaeta in 1849, and obtained from him a special brief erecting the staff of its
                    literary journal, the <hi rend="italic">Civiltà</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    the purpose of teaching and propagating the faith in its pages. How, with this
                    pope’s support throughout his long reign, and the gradual filling of nearly all
                    the sees of Latin Christendom with bishops of their own selection, they
                    contrived to stamp out the last remains of independence everywhere, and to crown
                    the Ultramontane triumph with the Vatican decrees, is matter of familiar
                    knowledge.</p>
                <p>The society has been ruled by twenty-two generals and four vicars from its
                    foundation to the present day; and the most notable fact to signalize with
                    reference to them is that, of all the various nationalities represented in the
                    company, France, its original cradle, has never given it a head, while Spain,
                    Italy, Holland, Belgium, Germany, and Poland were all represented. The numbers
                    of the society at present are not accurately known, but are estimated at about
                    6000 in all parts of the world.</p>
