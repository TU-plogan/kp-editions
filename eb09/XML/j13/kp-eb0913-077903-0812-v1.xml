                <p><label type="entry">JUPITER</label> was the chief god of the Roman state. The
                    great and constantly growing influence exerted from a very early period on Rome
                    by the superior civilization of Greece not only caused a modification of the
                    Roman god after the analogy of Zeus, the supreme deity of the Greeks, but led
                    the Latin writers to identify the one with the other, and to attribute to
                    Jupiter myths which were purely Greek and never belonged to actual Roman
                    religion. The Jupiter of actual worship was a Roman god; the Jupiter of Latin
                        <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n813/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0913-0813-0780"/> literature was more than half Greek. F rom
                    the Latin this composite deity has passed into modern literature, and under the
                    name of Jupiter is understood a god whose character is half Roman half Greek;
                    while the legends, family history, and posterity attributed to him are wholly
                    Greek. The identification was facilitated by the community of character which
                    really belonged to Jupiter and Zeus as the Roman and Greek developments of the
                    original Aryan conception of God; whereas the analogy between the non-Aryan Juno
                    of Rome and the Aryan Hera of Greece was very slight. As we have in the two gods
                    one original form differently developed by Roman and Greek genius, it is
                    impossible to treat the one without frequent reference to the other; but it is
                    equally necessary to treat them separately. The highest religious conceptions of
                    each race are summed up in the characters of Jupiter and Zeus, and an account of
                    them must be in reality an outline of the growth of religious thought among
                    Romans and Greeks.</p>
                <p>Every influence which affected the growth of the Roman state affected also the
                    religion; and along with the development of Rome out of many elements we have a
                    development of the state god Jupiter out of the original Aryan deity. The state,
                    beginning with a mixture of Latin and Sabine population, soon acquired also
                    Etruscan colonists, who were for a time the ruling element in the state; and,
                    although the dynasty was expelled, yet the Etruscan civilization exerted an
                    immense influence on Roman religion. Jupiter, the Vedic <hi rend="italic">dyaus
                        pitar,</hi> invoked by the Greeks as ZeS <hi rend="italic">πατeρ,</hi> was
                    the god both of Latins and Sabines. He was identified with the Etruscan Tina,
                    and acquired something of his character. But another influence was felt at an
                    early period. Greek civilization, spreading from Cumae, revolutionized Etruscan
                    art and modified Etruscan thought. The influence was strongly exerted in Rome
                    also. Under such various influences grew the Roman religion, and it was
                    completed as a national institution when Tarquin, the same king that received
                    into Rome the prophetic books of the Cumaean Sibyl, enthroned Jupiter Optimus
                    Maximus on the Capitoline hill as the guardian and protector of the fully formed
                    Roman state. Many separate cults of Jupiter, originating from different sections
                    of the mixed state, still continued, but were quite overshadowed by the great
                    worship. Several of these worships puzzled the antiquarians of later Rome, and
                    it became a question how far their objects were identical with or distinct from
                    Jupiter. The ceremonial of these ancient cults, of Vejovis the Asylum-god on the
                    Capitol, of Jupiter Stator on the Palatine, of Dius Fidius or Semo Sancus on the
                    Aventine, of Consus the god of good counsel who ruled in the lower world in the
                    Circus, and of many others, would throw much light on the beginnings of the
                    Roman state; but our information on the subject is very scanty. This being the
                    case, we cannot assign to each influence its exact share in developing the Roman
                    conception, though certain elements may be distinguished as more primitive than
                    others. It is also impossible to distinguish accurately the different cults of
                    Jupiter.</p>
                <p>The original naturalistic element, the Graeco-Italian god whose power is embodied
                    in the phenomena and the cyclic changes of the heavens, never disappeared.
                    Jupiter or Diespiter is under various epithets, Lucetius, Pluvius, &amp;c., the
                    god of clear and clouded sky, of light and darkness, of thunder and rain. By the
                    proper ceremonies he can be drawn down in lightning to the earth, as Elicius and
                    Indiges, to supply it with rain and springs. Every place which he strikes with
                    the lightning is marked as his own, and is surrounded with a wall to keep off
                    the profane from holy ground. As Averruncus and Depulsor, Jupiter protects men
                    from the effects of the portents that he himself sends from heaven. Through such
                    portents he also reveals his will to men, and proper interpretation of them will
                    enable men to walk securely before heaven. There can be little doubt that this
                    character as revealer of fate is almost wholly Etruscan, as all the rules of
                    interpretation came from that people. A stone, the symbol of the thunderbolt,
                    was the old symbol of the god, and never became wholly obsolete; hence the
                    phrase <hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic">Jovem lapidem jurare.</hi>
                    Among trees the oak, among birds the woodpecker, were originally sacred to him;
                    but afterwards the eagle and other symbols were, under Greek influence,
                    associated witlι Jupiter Capitolinus. The identity of many of these attributes
                    with those of the Greek Zeus is obvious. Equally striking is the double
                    character of god both among the dead and among the living which originally
                    belonged to both gods, and was from different causes lost sight of in both
                    cases. In Rome Etruscan influence changed the old views about the nature of the
                    future world; and only some ceremonies, understood by neither priests nor
                    people, preserved the original idea. In nothing was Etruscan influence more
                    conspicuous at Rome than in the gloomy views of the future world that it
                    introduced. The priest of Jupiter, <hi rend="italic">flamen Dialis,</hi> might
                    not touch a corpse; if his wife, the <hi rend="italic">flaminica,</hi> died he
                    lost his office. His life was complicated by a multitude of prohibitions: he
                    must not touch a dog or a she-goat, nor see an army, nor take off his pointed
                    cap, nor leave the city for a night, and so on. Violation of any rule, even by
                    accident, entailed impurity on himself and on the whole state, and in some cases
                    made him forfeit his office.</p>
                <p>A moral side in the Roman conception of God is apparent at a very early period,
                    and probably was never wholly wanting. Jupiter is the fatherly ruler of mankind:
                    he protects all the higher elements of human society, guards the sanctity of
                    oaths, the rights of strangers and suppliants, the unity of the state, and the
                    intercourse with other peoples. When a foreign state had injured Rome, it was
                    forbidden to begin war without a formal declaration by the fetiales or heralds,
                    the ministers of Jupiter. Headed by the <hi rend="italic">pater</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">patratus populi</hi><hi rend="italic">Pomαni,</hi> they
                    appealed to Jupiter to witness that they had been wronged, and denounced ruin on
                    the wrong-doers. Having thus through his representative on earth solemnly warned
                    the guilty, the god as Victor led his people to conquest. When the army
                    returned, their entry was a religious ceremonial in honour of Jupiter. The
                    general, as representative of Jove, was borne on a gilded chariot drawn by four
                    white horses through the Porta Triumphalis to the temple on the capitol, where
                    he offered a solemn sacrifice to the god, and laid on his knees the victor’s
                    laurels. In the ceremony the victorious general was invested with the purple
                    toga, the tunica palmata, the sceptre and crown of gold, which belong to a god
                    not to a man; while the four-horse chariot itself is the symbol of apotheosis.
                    So the <hi rend="italic">spolia opima</hi> were dedicated by the general who won
                    them to Jupiter Feretrius in the CapitoL Also to Jupiter, as supreme god of the
                    state, the consuls sacrificed when they assumed office, and the young men when
                    they put on the toga virilis. The Ides of the month were always sacred to
                    Jupiter.</p>
                <p>The chief festivals celebrated in honour of Jupiter were the Ludi Romani and the
                    Ludi Magni, the Ludi Capitolini instituted in honour of the deliverance of Rome
                    from the Gauls, and the Ludi Plebeii instituted to commemorate the
                    reconciliation between the two orders in the state. In all of them there was
                    included a feast of the magistrates and senators in the Capitol, to which the
                    three deities, Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, were invited, and places were left
                    for them. Outside of Rome the chief cultus of Jupiter was that on the Alban
                    mount, where Jupiter Latiaris had been the god who guarded the league of the
                    thirty Latin cities. When Rome destroyed, or rather absorbed, this <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n814/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0913-0814-0781"/> league, she kept up the worship that had
                    hallowed it. The Feriae Latinae were celebrated every year by the consuls on a
                    day appointed by themselves before they went forth to war. Accompanied by
                    representatives of the Latin cities, they offered a sacrifice of white oxen to
                    Jupiter. Other festivals of Jupiter show his old character as patron of
                    agriculture, especially the different feasts called Vinalia; in this character
                    Liber, who was once only a form of Jupiter, had almost entirely supplanted him.
                    The word <hi rend="italic">liber,</hi> originally an epithet of the chief god,
                    gradually acquired distinct personality, and became the name of a god who was
                    assimilated to the Greek Dionysus.</p>
                <p>The Romans had in themselves none of the anthropomorphic Greek spirit: while
                    Greek gods were concrete personal beings, Roman gods were almost pure
                    abstractions. The personal element was not wholly wanting, for the gods were
                    conceived as distinguished by sex, and as possessing names which must be
                    concealed lest enemies should know and use them. But to the Roman the gods were
                    little more than spiritual principles of earthly things; each man had his <hi
                        rend="italic">genius,</hi> the wood had its Silvanus. There was no
                    mythology,—no marriages and births of gods, no family relationships. But when
                    Greek influence became powerful, and the Italian deities Saturnus and Ops had
                    been identified with Cronos and Rhea, Jupiter like Zeus was called their son,
                    and the Greek tales about the conduct of Zeus to his parents were applied to the
                    Latin god. On the Capitol Jupiter was enthroned between Juno on the left and
                    Minerva on the right. The two goddesses now became his wife and his daughter. In
                    like manner the Roman poets attributed to Jupiter all the legends about Zeus,
                    and invented new tales and new amours on Italian soil after the analogy of the
                    Greek. The artistic rendering of the conception of Jupiter is wholly borrowed
                    from the Greek, and can be dealt with only in treating of the Greek deity. The
                    first temple on the Capitol was built after the Etruscan model; but, when it was
                    destroyed in 83 B.c., it was rebuilt in Greek style. (w. <hi rend="smallcaps">μ.
