                    embraces a large part of the high dorsal bridge in the Rechna Doâb; thence it
                    stretches across the Chenab into the wedge of land between that stream and the
                    Jhélum, whose waters unite a few miles below the town of Jhang; while westward
                    again the boundary runs beyond the joint river, far into the heart of the Sind
                    Sâgar Doâb. The Ravi also bounds the district for a few miles along its southern
                    edge. So artificial a tract can hardly be said to possess any common natural
                    features of its own. Along the banks of the river strips of comparatively
                    fertile lowland support a dense population.</p>
                <p>At the census of 1868 the population was 348,027 (193,624 males and 154,403
                    females). The Mahometans numbered 270,819; Hindus, 57,297; Sikhs, 2994; and
                    “others,” 16,917. Only three towns contain a population exceeding 5000—Jhang,
                    9124; Maghiâna, 10,525; and Chiniot, 11,477. The area under cultivation in 1873
                    amounted to 241,325 acres, out of an assessed total of 3,650,867 acres. No crops
                    can anywhere be grown without irrigation. Wheat, barley, gram, <hi rend="italic"
                    >sarsοη, china,</hi><hi rend="italic">joâr,</hi> maize, and cotton form the
                    staples of the district. Grain is imported. Country cloth is manufactured at
                    Jhang and Maghiâna, and bought up by the Po-winda merchants of Afghanistan.
                    Manufactures of gold and silver lace also exist. The principal road from Mùltân
                    to Wazirâbâd passes through the chief towns in the district. A bridge of boats
                    is in course of construction (1875) across the united stream of the Jhelum and
                    the Chenâb. Both rivers are navigable. The total revenue for 1873 was £49,302.
                    The police force in 1872 numbered 503 mem In 1872 there were 32 Government and
                    123 native schools, with a joint roll of 3696 pupils. The district bears a good
                    reputation for healthiness. Small-pox and fever form the most prevalent
                    diseases. The average rainfall for the seven years ending 1872-73 was 10 inches.
                    There are seven charitable dispensaries.</p>

                <p>The district of Jhang possesses unusual historical interest from the presence
                    within its borders of the rains which crown the rocky eminence of Sanglawala
                    Tiba. This site has been identified with the Sakala of the Brahmans, the Sagal
                    of Buddhism, and the Sangala of Alexander’s historians. In modern times the
                    history of Jhang centres in the famous family of Sials, who exercised an
                    extensive sway over a large tract between Shahpur and Mιiltan, with little
                    dependence on the imperial court at Delhi, until they finally fell before the
                    all-absorbing power of Ranjit. Sinh. The Sials of Jhang are Mahometans of Rajput
                    descent, whose ancestor, Rai Shankar of Dâranagar, emigrated early in the 13th
                    century from the Gangetic Doâb to Jaunpur. In the beginning of the present
                    century "the maharaja Ranjιt Sinh invaded Jhang, and captured the Sial
                    chieftain’s territories. He recovered a small portion afterwards, which he λvas
                    allowed to retain on payment of a yearly tribute. In 1847, after the
                    establishment of the British agency at Lahore, the district came under the
                    charge of the British Government; and in 1848 Ismail Khan, the Sial leader,
                    rendered important services against the rebel chiefs, for which he received a
                    pension. During the mutiny of 1857 the Sial leader again proved his loyalty by
                    serving in person on the British side. His pension was afterwards increased, and
                    he obtained the title of Khan Bahadur, with a small <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Jhang,</hi> a municipal town in the above district. The
                    sister town of Maghiâna, containing the civil station for the district, lies 3
                    miles south of Jhang, and has a population of 10,525 persons. They form together
                    a single municipality, and may be regarded as practically one town, situated in
                    31° 16' 16" N. lat., and 72° 21' 45" E. long., about 3⅛ miles to the west of the
                    present bed of the Chenab. Jhang itself lies on the lowland, a little apart from
                    the regular lines of trade, and since the removal of the Government offices to
                    Maghiâna, has yielded its commerce and importance to its younger rival. Founded
                    by Mal Khân, a Siâl chieftain, in 1462, it long formed the capital of a native
                    Mahometan state. The population of Jhang proper in 1868 was 9124, comprising
                    4568 Hindus, 4244 Mahometans, 129 Sikhs, 12 Christians, and 171 “others.”
