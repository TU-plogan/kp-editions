                    Jewess ”), to whom the last nine of its sixteen chapters relate. In the
                    Septuagint and Vulgate it immediately precedes Esther, and along with Tobit
                    comes after Nehemiah; in the English Apocrypha it is placed between Tobit and
                    the apocryphal additions to Esther. The argument of the book is briefly as
                    follows. In the twelfth year of his reign Nebuchadnezzar, who is described as
                    king of Assyria, having his capital in Nineveh, makes war against Arphaxad <hi
                    rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the district Arrhapachitis), king of Media, and
                    overcomes him in his seventeenth year. He then despatches his chief general
                    Holofernes to take vengeance on the nations of the west who had withheld their
                    assistance. This expedition has already succeeded in its main objects when
                    Holofernes proceeds to attack Judaea. The children of Israel, who are described
                    as having newly returned from captivity, are apprehensive of a desecration of
                    their sanctuary, and resolve on resistance to the uttermost. The inhabitants of
                    Bethulia (Betylûa) and Betomestham in particular (neither place can be
                    identified), directed by Joachim the high priest, guard the mountain passes near
                    Dothaim, and place themselves under God’s protection. Holofernes now inquires of
                    the chiefs who are with him about the Israelites, and is answered by Achior the
                    leader of the Ammonites, who enters upon a long historical narrative showing the
                    Israelites to be invincible except when they have offended God. For this Achior
                    is punished by being handed over to the Israelites, who lead him to the governor
                    of Bethulia. Next day the siege begins, and after forty days the famished
                    inhabitants urge the governor Ozias to surrender, which he consents to do unless
                    relieved in five days. Judith, a beautiful and pious widow of the tribe of
                    Simeon, now appears on the scene with a plan of deliverance. Wearing her rich
                    attire, and accompanied by her maid, who carries a bag of provisions, she goes
                    over to the hostile camp, where she is at once conducted to the general, whose
                    suspicions are disarmed by the tales she invents. After four days Holofernes,
                    smitten with her charms, at the close of a sumptuous entertainment invites her
                    to remain within his tent over night. No sooner is he overcome with sleep than
                    Judith, seizing his sword, strikes off his head and gives it to her maid; both
                    now leave the camp (as they had previously been accustomed to do, ostensibly for
                    prayer) and return to Bethulia, where the trophy is displayed amid great
                    rejoicings and thanksgivings. Achior now publicly professes Judaism, and at the
                    instance of Judith the Israelites make a sudden onslaught on the enemy, who at
                    once give way, leaving immense spoil in the hands of the victors. Judith now
                    sings a song of praise, and all go up to Jerusalem to worship with sacrifice and
                    rejoicing. The book concludes with a brief <pb break="no"

                <p>Formerly the majority of interpreters were inclined to assign a strictly
                    historical character to the foregoing narrative, although its historical,
                    chronological, and even geographical difficulties were not overlooked; but this
                    view has to a large extent been superseded by that of most recent critics, who,
                    following Buddaeus, regard it as a romance written with a patriotic and moral
                    purpose by some imperfectly informed Jew of the Maccabaean period who wished to
                    raise the zeal of his compatriots to the fighting point on behalf of their
                    religion and worship against an overbearing enemy. Volkmar stands alone in
                    treating it as a veiled account of the campaigns of Trajan and his generals
                    against the Parthians and Jews.</p>
                <p>According to Origen the book was unknown to the Jews, and did not exist in
                    Hebrew. The extant Greek text, however, which exists in three divergent
                    recensions, shows unmistakable traces of a Hebrew original, even apart from
                    certain expressions which can only be explained as ignorant mistranslations. But
                    that original must have differed considerably from the Chaldee text which lay
                    before Jerome, and was used by him for his new Latin version.</p>
                <p>The first express reference to Judith occurs in Clement of Rome (1 <hi
                    rend="italic">Ad Cor.,</hi> cap. 55); it is cited as Scripture by Clement of
                    Alexandria, Tertullian, Ambrose, and Augustine, and was recognized as canonical
                    by the council of Carthage, and by Innocent I. of Rome.</p>
