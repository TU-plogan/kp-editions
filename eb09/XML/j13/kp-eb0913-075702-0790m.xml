                    farther west. The aspect of Juan Fernandez is beautiful and striking; only 13
                    miles in length by 4 in width, it consists of a series of precipitous rocks
                    rudely piled into irregular blocks and pinnacles. The highest of these masses
                    (about 3000 feet), a fine object from the anchorage, is called, from its massive
                    form, <hi rend="italic">El Yunque,</hi> the Anvil; it appears to be
                    inaccessible. Any attempt to scale the higher peaks of the island is dangerous;
                    the soil is very light and shallow, and the vegetation mostly a shrubby under
                    growth, and on any attempt to pull oneself up by the help of this, the whole is
                    apt to give way, and climber and shrubs are precipitated together down the
                    cliffs. The rocks are trap-tuffs, basalts, and greenstones, and the island seems
                    to date back to the older trappean series. There is a doubtful story of light
                    having been seen emanating from one of the higher peaks; but it seems likely
                    that, if Juan Fernandez was ever a subaerial volcanic cone, its fires have been
                    long extinguished. Small indentations are found all round the island, but
                    Cumberland Bay on the north side is the only good anchorage, and even there,
                    from the great depth of water, there is some difficulty and risk.</p>
                <p>A wide valley collecting streams from several of the ravines on the north side of
                    the island opens into Cumberland Bay, and is partially enclosed and cultivated;
                    and the settlement, consisting of some thirty or forty dilapidated Chilian huts,
                    faces the anchorage. As seen from the bay the mountains seem covered with
                    foliage to the sky-line, except where precipitous faces of rock—basalt and
                    greenstone—form a beautiful contrast to the luxuriant somewhat pale vegetation
                    so characteristic of an island in the warmer temperate zone.</p>
                <p>The flora and fauna of Juan Fernandez are in most respects Chilian,—the
                    opportunities of immigration from any other direction being specially difficult,
                    for nearly constant currents set from the south-west, a direction in which there
                    is no land nearer than the antarctic continent. There are few trees on the
                    island, and these are chiefly in inaccessible situations, the timber near the
                    shore having been almost entirely cut down for fire-wood. Most of the valuable
                    indigenous trees have been exterminated; the sandal-wood, which the earlier
                    navigators found one of the most valuable products of the island, is now
                    confined to almost inaccessible places, while the other prominent indigenous
                    forms, a native palm <hi rend="italic">lfjeroxylon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >australe)</hi> and two tree-ferns, may be counted on the fingers as they raise
                    their feathery heads over some overhanging crag or precipitous ravine. The steep
                    paths up the hills are bordered by a thicket of flowering shrubs and herbs
                    chiefly of South American origin. One of the most prominent of the latter <hi
                    rend="italic">{Gunnera chileηsis)</hi> expands its gigantic rhubarb-like leaves
                    to an enormous size, while the procumbent rhizomes creep along the ground,
                    throwing up leaf-stalks 8 and 10 feet in height, and forming with the leaves,
                    which frequently measure 15 feet across, a canopy under which one can ride
                    easily on the small Chilian horses. There are twenty-four species of ferns on
                    the island, and of these four are special to it; so great a prevalence of ferns
                    gives quite a character to the island flora.</p>
                <p>The fauna of Juan Fernandez is likewise fairly rich and very special. There are
                    no indigenous land mammals on the island. Pigs, which have long since become
                    wild and numerous, were left by the earlier navigators, and wild goats imported
                    in the same fashion are now abundant, and their flesh is excellent.
                    Sea-elephants and fur-seals were at one time plentiful upon Juan Fernandez, and
                    are still found in some numbers at Mas-a-Fuera. There are, besides the <hi
                    rend="italic">Accipitres</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Natatores,</hi> four
                    land birds on Juan Fernandez (and four somewhat different on Mas-a-Fuera).</p>

                <p>Ths four Juan Fernandez birds are a thrush, a tyrant, and two humming-birds <hi

                    are special to the island, and the latter has the great peculiarity of having
                    the male of a bright cinnamon colour while the female is green. Both sexes are
                    green in <hi rend="italic">E. galerites.</hi> Of the shrubs in the jungle
                    bordering the ravine, there seems scarcely a plant of myrtle, or of a
                    bignoniaceous plant with long dark bells associated with the myrtle, which is
                    not inhabited by a pair of humming birds, so that the whirring and buzzing of
                    the brilliant flutterers over the flowers is singularly attractive.</p>
                <p>Juan Fernandez was discovered by a Spanish pilot of that name (who was also the
                    discoverer of the island of Mas-a-Fuera) in 1563. Fernandez obtained from the
                    Spanish Government a grant of the islands, where he resided for some time,
                    stocking them with goats and pigs. He soon, however, appears to have abandoned
                    his possessions, which were afterwards for many years only visited occasionally
                    by fishermen from the coasts of Chili and Peru, who found the sea round the
                    island well stocked with fish. In 1616 Le Maire and Schonten called at Juan
                    Fernandez for water and fresh provisions. Pigs and goats were then abundant on
                    the island, and the valleys coming down to the anchorage λvere filled with
                    herbage and the sea with excellent fish. Sandal-wood was plentiful, and near the
                    anchorage there was a grove of wild quince trees. The fleet under the command of
                    Admiral ΓErmite next visited the island. Three soldiers and three gunners
                    remained behind when the fleet left; what became of these is altogether unknown.
                    In the year 1668 the buccaneer Sharp anchored off Juan Fernandez, •at first
                    apparently on the south side of the island and afterwards in Cumberland Bay. At
                    the time of his visit seals and sea-lions frequented the shores in large
                    numbers, and pigs, the descendants of those originally imported by Fernandez,
                    were so abundant that a hundred were salted down in addition to those killed for
                    immediate use. At the end of 1687 five men voluntarily remained at Juan
                    Fernandez from another buccaneer commanded by Captain Edward Davis. They
                    remained on the island until October 1690, when the English ship “Welfare,”
                    Captain John Story, took them off.</p>
                <p>In February 1700 Dampier called at Juan Fernandez, and whilst there Captain
                    Straddling of the “Cinque Porte” galley quarrelled with his men, forty-two of
                    whom deserted but were afterwards taken on board by Dampier; five seamen,
                    however, remained on shore. In October 1704 the “Cinque Porte” returned and
                    found two of these men, the others having been apparently captured by the
                    French. On this occasion Captain Straddling had a disagreement with his master,
                    Alexander Selkirk, who insisted upon being put on shore rather than serve longer
                    with Straddling. Selkirk’s desire was complied with, and he was sent on shore
                    with a few ordinary necessaries. Before the ship left he begged to be
                    readmitted; but this was refused, with the curious result that, with little
                    merit of his own, Selkirk has become a hero for all time, and “Robinson
                    .Crusoe’s Island” the cynosure of all boys’ eyes. It is extremely improbable
                    that Alexander Selkirk ever actually placed his journal in the hands of Defoe,
                    but his story excited some public interest, and in catering for the public
                    amusement that prince of raconteurs was most likely to have adopted Selkirk’s
                    tale for combination-with •other material in one of his wonderful “realistic
                    novels.” Many -of the incidents in the <hi rend="italic">Adventures of Robinson
                    Crusoe</hi> are evidently inconsistent with the narrative of Selkirk, and are
                    undoubtedly taken from other sources; fcr example, the footprint on the sand,
                    and the decidedly tropical description of “Robinson Crusoe’s Island,” would
                    agree better with one of the outlying islands of the West Indies. Alexander
                    Selkirk was relieved from -what appears to have been a by no means unbearable
                    exile in 1709 by the ship “Duke,” Captain Wood Rogers, and in 1868 the officers
                    of II.M.S. “Topaze” erected a tablet at a point on the hill road called
                    “Selkirks Look-out,” just where in a gap in the trap rock a magnificent view may
                    be had of the whole island, •and of the sea north and south, over which the
                    exile must have often and eagerly watched for an approaching sail. It bears the
                    following inscription :—“In memory of Alexander Selkirk, mariner, a native of
                    Largo in the county of Fife, Scotland, who was on this island in complete
                    solitude for four years and four months. He was landed from the ‘ Cinque Porte ’
                    galley, 96 tons, 16 guns, 1704 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>, and was taken off
                    in the ‘Duke’ privateer, 12th February 1709. He died lieutenant of the ‘
                    Weymouth,’ 1723 A.D., aged forty-seven years. This tablet is erected near
                    Selkirk’s look-out by Commodore Powell and officers of H.M.S. ‘Topaze,’ 1868 A.
                    D.”</p>
                <p>After Selkirk’s relief, visits, especially from buccaneers, to the island of Juan
                    Fernandez became more frequent. In June 1741 Commodore Anson anchored in
                    Cumberland Bay in the “Centurion.” During Anson’s stay the “Trial” visited
                    Mas-a-Fuera, and found the anchorage more exposed than at Juan Fernandez.
                    Anson‘found vegetables, of which the scurvy-stπιck crew of the “Centurion” stood
                    greatly in need, much as formerly,—the cabbage palm, celery, water-cresses, and
                    radishes being abundant. After having added to the resources of the island by
                    sowing the stones of fruit trees and garden seeds, some of which did well, Anson
                    continued his voyage in September. On Anson’s return home it was proposed to
                    form an English settlement on Juan Fernandez, but the Spaniards hearing that the
                    matter had been mooted in England gave orders to occupy the island, and it was
                    garrisoned accordingly in 1750. Carteret first observed this settlement in May,
                    1767, and on account of the hostility of the Spaniards preferred to put in at
                    Mas-a-Fuera.</p>
                <p>After the revolutionary wars Juan Fernandez passed into the possession of the
                    Chilians, and has remained theirs ever since. Shortly after 1818 it was used as
                    a state prison by the Chilian Government. In 1820 there appear to have been 300
                    convicts on the island, with 100 regular troops. In that year the island was
                    swarming with wild horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats, and vegetables and
                    fruit were in abundance. In 1830 Juan Fernandez was visited by Captain King in
                    H.M.S. “Adventure.” There were then no convicts on the island. There was a small
                    garrison of forty persons, and provisions were scarce. In 1833 Juan Fernandez
                    was again used as a convict station by the Chilians. In 1835 the island appears
                    to have been governed by a Mr Sutcliffe, an Englishman in the Chilian service.
                    He was present when an earthquake took place on the 20th February of that year,
                    of which he gives a description.</p>
                <p>In November 1875 H.M.S. “Challenger,” Captain F. T. Thomson, called at Juan
                    Fernandez for two days, lying as usual in Cumberland Bay.</p>
                <p>Shortly after 1835 Juan Fernandez was abandoned as a convict settlement, and
                    since that time it has been leased by the Chilian Government to such as cared to
                    occupy it for the supply of whalers and other passing ships, and for such
                    remains of sea-lion hunting and fur-sealing as still exist. The speculation does
                    not appear to be very profitable; and the island is likely to be by and by left
                    so far as may be in the busier world of to-day to its pristine solitude. (C. W.
