                    38). On the death of Moses he assumed the leadership to which he had previously
                    been designated by his chief, and the book known by his name is entirely
                    occupied with details of the manner in which he carried out the task thus laid
                    to his hand,—that of taking possession of the land of Canaan. On the completion
                    of the reconnaissance by the two spies, he left Shittim with his army, preceded
                    by the priest-borne ark of the covenant. The Jordan having been miraculously
                    crossed, his first encampment was at Gilgal. Jericho and Ai soon fell into his
                    hands, and the people of Gibeon became vassals. In the neighbourhood of Gibeon
                    the five kings of the Amorites were crushed in a decisive battle in which the
                    very elements conspired to favour the invader, and (to use the poetical language
                    of the book of Jashar) “the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people
                    had avenged themselves upon their enemies.” The victorious arms of Israel were
                    now directed northwards against a league of Canaanite potentates under the
                    hegemony of Jabin, king of Hazor; anticipating the attack of the enemy, Joshua
                    surprised and crushed them at the waters of Merom, Hazor itself being taken and
                    burnt. Thus far the first twelve chapters of the book of Joshua; the remaining
                    twelve describe the partition of the (conquered and unconquered) country among
                    the twelve tribes, and conclude with a resumé of his parting exhortations. At
                    the age of one hundred and ten he died and was buried in this inheritance in
                    Timnath-serah, in the territory of Ephraim. For the book of Joshua, an integral
                    part of that part of the Old Testament sometimes spoken of as Hexateuch, the
                    reader is referred to the heading <hi rend="smallcaps">Pentateuch.</hi></p>
                <p>Critical investigation has shown that the history or Joshua as now sketched is a
                    composite narrative, made up mainly from the two Elohistic (or, as they are now
                    generally called, the Elohistic and the Levitical) documents. Fragments of an
                    account of the conquest of Canaan older than either of these writings are
                    preserved in the book of Judges, and it is generally recognized by recent
                    inquirers that the progress of the Israelites was much slower and their action
                    less united than appears on the face of the book of Joshua as we now read it,
                    the statistics of the Levitical record in particular applying properly to a much
                    later date. From this point of view Joshua appears rather as the leader of
                    Ephraim than of all Israel. He is for the north what Caleb was for the south.
