                    Jesus; he himself was perhaps related to Annas the high priest (John xviii. 15,
                    16). It seems to have been when attending as a disciple the preaching of John
                    the Baptist at Bethany beyond Jordan that he first became personally acquainted
                    with our Lord (John i. 35 <hi rend="italic">sq.);</hi> his “call” to follow Him
                    occurred simultaneously with that addressed to his brother and to Andrew and
                    Peter (Mark i. 19, 20). He speedily took his place among the twelve apostles,
                    sharing with James the title of Boanerges (“sons of thunder”), became a member
                    of that inner circle to which, in addition to his brother, Peter alone belonged,
                    and ultimately was recognized as the disciple <hi rend="italic">par
                    excellence</hi> whom Jesus loved, a distinction usually attributed to his
                    amiability and gentleness of character, but much less probably due to any
                    special sweetness of temperament (see Luke ix. 5 4; Mark iii. 17, ix. 38) than
                    to a quickness and depth of insight which enabled him to enter more fully than
                    his companions into the larger and wider-reaching views of his Master. After the
                    departure of Jesus John remained at Jerusalem, where he was one of the most
                    prominent among those who bore personal testimony to the fact of the
                    resurrection; we find him for a short time in Samaria (Acts viii. 14, 25) after
                    the martyrdom of Stephen, but on Paul’s second visit to the Jewish capital (Gal.
                    ii. 9) John was again there. His subsequent movements are obscure, but he can
                    hardly have been in Jerusalem at the time of Paul’s last visit there in 58
                    A.D.</p>
                <p>At this point the history of the apostle is taken up by ecclesiastical tradition.
                    Polycrates, bishop of Ephesus, 106 A.D. (in Euseb., <hi rend="italic">H.E.,</hi>
                    iii. 31; v. 24), attests that John “who lay on the bosom of the Lord” died at
                    Ephesus; and, though this evidence is weakened by the legendary trait that he
                    “ιvas a priest wearing the π∈ταλoe” or gold plate that distinguished the
                    high-priestly mitre, it is fair to infer that the grave of the apostle was
                    already shown (comp. <hi rend="italic">H. E.,</hi> iii. 39). Irenaeus in various
                    passages of his works confirms this tradition. He says that John lived up to the
                    time of Trajan, and published his Gospel in Ephesus. Irenaeus also identifies
                    the apostle with John the disciple of the Lord, who wrote the Apocalypse under
                    Domitian, whom his teacher Polycarp had known personally, and of whom Polycarp
                    had much to tell. These traditions are accepted and enlarged by later authors,
                    Tertullian adding that John was banished to Patmos after he had miraculously
                    survived the punishment of immersion in boiling oil. As it is evident that
                    legend was busy with John as early as the time of Polycrates, while Irenaeus’s
                    view that the Apocalypse was written under Domitian is inconsistent with the
                    internal evidence offered by that book, the real worth of these traditions
                    requires to be tested by examination of their ultimate source. This inquiry has
                    been pressed upon scholars since the apostolic authorship of the Apocalypse or
                    of the Fourth Gospel or of both these works has been disputed. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Gospels</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Revelation.</hi> The
                    question is not strictly one between advanced and conservative criticism, for
                    the Tübingen school recognized the Apocalypse as apostolic, and found in it a
                    confirmation of John’s residence in Ephesus. On the other hand, Lützelberger
                    (1840), Keim <hi rend="italic">(Jesu v. Nαz.,</hi> vol i,, 1867), Holtzmann (in
                    <hi rend="italic">Bibel-Lex., s.υ.),</hi> Scholten <hi rend="italic">{Theol.
                    Tijdseh.,</hi> 1871), and other recent writers wholly reject the tradition,
                    while it has able defenders in Steitz <hi rend="italic">(Stud. u. Krit.,</hi>
                    1868), Hilgenfeld <hi rend="italic">(Eiηl.,</hi> 1875, p. 394 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sg.∙,Z.f. IV. T.</hi> 1872, 1877), and Lightfoot <hi rend="italic">{jContemp.
                    Rev.,</hi> 1875, 1876).</p>
                <p>The opponents of the tradition lay weight on the absence of positive evidence
                    before the latter part of the 2d century, especially in Papias, and in the
                    epistles of Ignatius and of Irenaeus’s authority Polycarp. But they also find it
                    necessary to assume that Irenaeus mistook Polycarp, and that John “the disciple
                    of the Lord,” who was known to the latter, was not the apostle but a certain
                    presbyter John of whom we hear from Papias. This view would be at once refuted
                    if we could hold with some scholars that the presbyter is but another name for
                    the apostle. This identification had already supporters in the time of Jerome
                    (<hi rend="italic">Vir. III.,</hi> 9; comp. Usener, <hi rend="italic">Zeta
                    S.</hi><hi rend="italic">Timothei,</hi> Bonn, 1877), but seems inconsistent with
                    a fair reading of the words of Papias. It is therefore very possible that some
                    things which Irenaeus in his later years supposed Polycarp to have related of
                    the apostle really belong to the other John (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Gospels,
                    x.</hi> 820); but it is a much stronger thing to assume that he was mistaken in
                    supposing that Polycarp had conversed with the apostle at all. An altogether
                    independent and apparently inconsistent tradition that John was killed by the
                    Jews is given on the authority of Papias by Georgius Hamartolus in the 9th
                    century.</p>
