                    roused the resentment of the natives, and he was recalled in disgrace. In the
                    last revolt of Richard against Henry, John was base enough to join with his
                    father’s enemies. This treachery was the death-blow of Henry II. (1189).
                    Richard, on his accession, made the most ample provision for John, giving him
                    several English counties, and marrying him to the heiress of the great earldom
                    of Gloucester. But he had so little trust in his brother’s character that,
                    before his own departure on the third crusade, he bound John to stay away from
                    England for three years. At the end of the term John returned, and harassed
                    Richard’s justiciar, William Longchamp. The unpopularity of Longchamp enabled
                    John, aided by the archbishop of Rouen, to lead a revolutionary movement by
                    which Longchamp was deprived of the justiciarship, and John recognized as <hi
                    rend="italic">summus</hi><hi rend="italic">rector</hi> of the kingdom; but the
                    real power remained with the archbishop of Rouen. When the news of the king’s
                    captivity arrived, John entered into an active alliance with Philip II. of
                    France, Richard’s malignant enemy, and tried to seize the reins of government,
                    asserting that the king was dead. But he was baffled by the fidelity of
                    Richard’s ministers and mother, and at Richard’s return his castles had to be
                    surrendered to the king. Richard treated John with great generosity, and for the
                    rest of his reign John gave no further trouble. Richard on his deathbed declared
                    John his heir, The principle of primogeniture, now generally adopted, would have
                    pointed out Arthur of Brittany, son of John’s elder brother Geoffrey, as the
                    heir, and Philip II. made himself the champion of Arthur. John made fresh
                    enemies by divorcing his wife, and marrying Isabella, heiress of the count of
                    Angoulême, who was already betrothed to the Count of La Marche. The anger of the
                    La Marche family caused a fresh outbreak of war, in which Arthur became
                    involved. In a misguided attempt to capture his grandmother Eleanor, in the
                    castle of Mirabeau, he was defeated and taken prisoner by John, who marched with
                    great swiftness to his mother’s aid. Arthur now disappears from history; and,
                    though there is no certain information about his death, it was generally
                    believed at the time that John murdered him. Philip’s court of peers declared
                    John guilty, and sentenced him to forfeiture. John abandoned himself to
                    pleasure, and made no attempt to defend his dominions; he showed such complete
                    indifference, while Philip was reducing castle after castle in Normandy, that it
                    was said he was spell-bound by witchcraft. In 1204 all Normandy was lost. Anjou,
                    Maine, and part of Aquitaine soon followed the fate of Normandy; John made only
                    feeble or abortive attempts to save them. In 1205 his great quarrel with the
                    church began. The monks of Canterbury had elected their sub-prior to the
                    archbishopric, and John had nominated a minister of his own: all parties
                    appealed to Pope Innocent IIΓ., who took the matter into his own hands, and
                    ordered the convent proctors to elect Stephen Langton, an Englishman already
                    distinguished by learning and character. John’s refusal to accept Langton
                    brought sentence of interdict on his kingdom (1208). He was personally
                    excommunicated in 1209, and in 1211 the pope issued a bull deposing him from his
                    throne; the execution of the decree was committed to Philip, who prepared to
                    invade England. John at last gave way, moved chiefly by a prophecy that on the
                    next Ascension Day he would be no longer king. He made an abject submission to
                    the papal legate Pandulph, agreeing to hold his kingdom henceforth as a
                    tributary fief of the popedom. Thus the ecclesiastical difficulty was settled,
                    but now John had to settle a quarrel with his own people. He had incurred their
                    hatred by his personal vices, by his cruelty and perfidy, of which the supposed
                    murder of Arthur was only one instance among many, and by his exaction of taxes
                    greatly in excess of the customary rates. The barons of the north began the
                    quarrel by refusing to <pb break="no"

                    he planned immediately after his absolution, alleging that their tenures did not
                    oblige them to service abroad. Langton restrained the king from doing immediate
                    vengeance on the barons, and in the meantime an important assembly was held at
                    St Albans (the first -to which representatives from the towns are known to have
                    been summoned), at which the justiciar promised in the king’s name that the laws
                    of Henry I. should be observed. At an assembly at St Paul’s the same year,
                    Langton, who was the moulding spirit of the movement, produced the charter of
                    Henry I., which became the basis of Magna Charta. John was now bent on trying to
                    knit together the Germanic confederacy against Philip, which had been originated
                    by Richard. He showed both policy and energy in this matter, but the barons of
                    Poitou failed him at the critical moment of the war, and his nephew the emperor
                    Otho was utterly defeated by Philip at Bouvines. John was forced to conclude the
                    peace of Chinon (1214), by which he ceded to Philip all bis claims on lands
                    lying north of the Loire. He had scarcely returned to England when his barons
                    formed a confederacy against him at Bury St Edmunds. He attempted to bribe the
                    clergy by granting them free election; but they stood firm to the national
                    cause. The city of London gave its adhesion to the barons, and John found
                    himself abandoned by all. He was obliged to grant the demands of the barons, and
                    to sign (at Runnymede, June 15, 1215), the Great Charter, which for two hundred
                    years was to be the watchword of English freedom. John signed the charter
                    without the least intention of keeping it, and he found a powerful ally in his
                    new master Innocent III., who issued a bull against the charter, and suspended.
                    Langton. Langton went to Rome to appeal, and the patriot party was thus deprived
                    of its wisest leader. War soon broke out again, but John was able to obtain a
                    host of foreign mercenaries, and the barons were driven to make alliance with
                    France. Louis, son of Philip II., arrived in England in May 1216, and John’s
                    unusual audacity and success deserted him at once. In three months the greater
                    part of the country was in the hands of Louis. Yet the national mistrust of the
                    foreigner was already causing a reaction in favour of John, when in marching
                    across the Wash he met with the accident which led to his death. He was
                    overtaken by the tide, lost all his baggage and treasure, and narrowly escaped
                    himself. Vexation and fatigue, aggravated by excess in eating and drinking,
                    brought on an attack of dysentery; with difficulty he reached Newark, where he
                    died October 19, 1216.*</p>
                <p>The reign of John is a turning point in English history, and marks the beginning
                    of a new era. (1) The separation of Normandy insured the free development of
                    English life, and the absorption of the Norman nobility in the English people.
                    (2) Magna Charta marks the first united attempt of the English people to limit
                    the power of the king. Hitherto the people had been the allies of the royal
                    power against the baronage; for the two following centuries they are leagued
                    with the baronage and the church against royal tyranny. (3) The surrender of
                    John’s kingdom to the pope, followed by the opposition of Innocent to English
                    freedom and the papal exactions of the next reign, caused a change of feeling
                    towards the papacy, and led to the antiRoman legislation which went on from the
                    reign of Edward I. till the Reformation. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. s.
