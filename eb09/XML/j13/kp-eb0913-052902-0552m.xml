                    Pernambuco, its botanical source being then unknown. When examined by Professor
                    Bâillon, the fragments of leaves were found to belong to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pilocarpus pennatifοlius,</hi> Lem., of the natural order <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pùtaceae.</hi> About the same time Holmes found that the commercial drug in
                    England consisted also to some extent of <hi rend="italic">P. Selloanus,</hi>
                    Engl., and his statement was afterwards confirmed by Bâillon, and also by
                    Balansa, the latter of whom observed that species to be employed in Asuncion,
                    and collected for exportation to Europe. <hi rend="italic">P. pennatifοlius</hi>
                    is a slightly branched shrub about 10 feet high, growing in the eastern
                    provinces of Brazil. The compound imparipinnate leaves, which are placed
                    alternately on the stem, are often 1∣ feet long, and consist of from 2 to 5
                    pairs of opposite leaflets, the terminal one having a longer pedicel than the
                    others. The leaflets are oval, lanceolate, entire, and obtuse, and often
                    slightly emarginate, from 3 to 4 inches long and 1 to 1∣ inch broad in the
                    middle. When held up to the light they may be observed to have scattered all
                    over them numerous pellucid dots or receptacles of secretion immersed in the
                    substance of the leaf. The leaves in size and texture bear some resemblance to
                    those of the cherry-laurel <hi rend="italic">(Prunus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Laurο-cerasus,</hi> L.), but are less polished on the upper surface. The
                    flowers, which are produced in spring and early summer, are borne on a raceme, 6
                    or 8 inches long, and the fruit consists of 5 carpels, of which not more than
                    two or three usually arrive at maturity. These present the characters of the
                    natural order to which the plant belongs. (See <hi rend="italic">Pharm.
                    Jοum,,</hi> ser. 3, vol. v. p. 582.) <hi rend="italic">P. Selloanus</hi> differs
                    from the above chiefly in the leaves never being hairy and in the longer and
                    more slender pedicels of the flowers. The leaves are the part of the plant
                    usually imported, although occasionally the stems and roots are attached to
                    them. The active principle for which the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >pilocarpine,</hi> suggested by Holmes, was ultimately adopted, was discovered
                    almost simultaneously by Hardy in France and Gerrard in England, but was first
                    obtained in a pure state by Petit of Paris. It is an alkaloid, of a soft viscous
                    character, slightly soluble in water, and very soluble in alcohol, ether, and
                    chloroform. It strongly rotates the plane of polarization to the right, and
                    forms crystalline salts of which the nitrate, hydrochlorate, and phosphate are
                    those chiefly used in medicine. The nitrate and phosphate are insoluble in
                    ether, chloroform, and benzol, while the hydrochlorate and hydrobromate dissolve
                    both in these menstrua and in water and alcohol; the sulphate and acetate being
                    deliquescent are not employed medicinally. The formula of the alkaloid is given
                    by Kingzett as C <hi rend="subscript"> 23</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 34</hi> N
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> + 4H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. The volatile oil contained in the leaves was found
                    by Hardy to be a complex body consisting of <hi rend="italic">pilocarpene,</hi>
                    which is a dextrogyre hydrocarbon, sp. gr. 0 ’ 852, boiling at 178° C. (352° ∙4
                    Fahr.), of another hydrocarbon boiling at 250° C. (492° Fahr.), and a third
                    boiling at a still higher temperature, and forming a colourless transparent
                    solid.</p>
                <p>The physiological action of jaborandi is that of an extremely powerful
                    diaphoretic and sialogogue. It acts as a sedative on the heart, probably
                    influencing the circulation through the terminal branches of the vasomotor
                    nerves, and widening the arteries and lessening their tension. The alkaloid does
                    not cause the nausea and vertigo often resulting from the use of the crude drug.
                    Atropine and pilocarpine have been proved to possess antagonistic and mutually
                    antidotal properties. Jaborandi, in the form of liquid extract, tincture, or
                    alkaloid, has been found useful in some forms of chronic pneumonia, in relieving
                    pleuritic effusion in dropsy, in diabetes insipidus, in Bright’s disease, as a
                    galactogogue, and more recently in diphtheria. In small doses it restrains the
                    perspiration of phthisis. It has also been proposed as a remedy for hydrophobia.
                    As a mydriatic pilocarpine is said to possess an advantage over eserine,
                    inasmuch as it contracts the pupil of the eye to an equal extent, while it
                    produces less irritation of the conjunctiva, less supraorbital pain, and less
                    spasm of the accommodating apparatus.</p>
                <p>According to Peckolt the following are known in some of the Brazilian provinces
                    as jaborandi :— <hi rend="italic">Serronia Jaborandi,</hi> Guill., <hi
                    rend="italic">Piper reticτdatum,</hi> L., <hi rend="italic">P. nodulosum,</hi>

                    >Xanthoxylum</hi><hi rend="italic">elegans,</hi> Engl. To these may be added <hi
                    rend="italic">Piper citrifolium,</hi> Lam. Only one of them appears to have
                    undergone chemical examination. In 1875 Parodi isolated from the <hi

                    >jaborandine.</hi> It is slightly soluble in ether, has but a weak affinity for
                    acids, and appears to belong to the piperine group; at the same time a volatile
                    oil of an acrid and biting taste was also obtained from the plant.</p>
