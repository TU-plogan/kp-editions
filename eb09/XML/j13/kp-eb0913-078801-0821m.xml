                    1686, was the earliest in point of time of the line of distinguished botanists
                    of his name. He was the son of Christophe de Jussieu (or Dejussieu), an
                    apothecary of some repute, who published a <hi rend="italic">Nouveau, traité de
                    la thériaque,</hi> Trévoux, 1708. Antoine studied at the university of
                    Montpellier, and travelled with his brother Bernard through Spain, Portugal, and
                    southern France. He came to Paris in 1708, Tournefort, whom he succeeded, dying
                    in that year. His own original publications are not of marked importance, but he
                    edited an edition of Tournefort’s <hi rend="italic">Institutiones rei</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">herbariae,</hi> Paris, 1719, 3 vols. He performed a similar office
                    for a posthumous work of Barrelier, <hi rend="italic">Plantae per</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Galliam, Hispaniam, et Italiam observatae,</hi> &amp;c., Paris,
                    1714. He practised medicine, chiefly devoting himself to the very poor. He died
                    at Paris, 2 2d April 1758.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bernard de Jussieu</hi> (1699-1777), a younger brother
                    of the above, was also born at Lyons, in 1699. He was educated for the medical
                    profession, took his doctor’s degree at Montpellier, and commenced practice in
                    1720, but his sensitive temperament hindered his prosecution of it, and on his
                    brother’s invitation he gladly joined him in Paris in 1722. He succeeded
                    Vaillant as subdemonstrator of plants in the Jardin du Roi, and his principal
                    duties consisted in superintending the herbor-izations of the students. His
                    knowledge of plants and even of non-botanical subjects was so great that he
                    readily detected and named the component parts of made-up plants which were
                    sometimes submitted to him. It is reported that at one of these excursions,
                    whilst Linnaeus was his guest, the students having brought some such counterfeit
                    to be named by the young Swede, his reply was “Aut Deus, aut D. de Jussieu.” In
                    1725 he brought out a new edition of Tournefort’s <hi rend="italic">Histoire des
                    plantes qui naissent aux environs de Paris,</hi> in 2 vols., which was
                    afterwards translated into English by John Martyn,—the original work being
                    incomplete. In the same year he was admitted into the Académie des Sciences, and
                    communicated several papers to that body. Long before Tremblay published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">des polypes deau douce,</hi> he
                    maintained the doctrine that these organisms were animals, and not the flowers
                    of marine plants, then the current notion; and to confirm his views he made
                    three journeys to the coast of Normandy. Singularly modest and retiring, he
                    published very little, but in 1759 he arranged the plants in the royal garden of
                    the Trianon at Versailles, according to his own scheme of classification. This
                    arrangement is printed in his nephew’s <hi rend="italic">Genera,</hi> pp.
                    lxiii.-lxx., and formed the basis of that work. He cared little for the credit
                    of enunciating new discoveries, so long as the facts themselves were made
                    public. On the death of his brother Antoine, he could not be induced to succeed
                    him in his office, but prevailed upon Lemonnier to assume the higher position.
                    He died at Paris, 6th November 1777.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph de Jussieu</hi> (1704-1779), brother of Antoine
                    and Bernard, was born at Lyons 3d September 1704. Educated like the rest of the
                    family for the medical profession, he accompanied La Condamine to Peru, in the
                    expedition for measuring an arc of meridian, and remained in South America for
                    thirty-six years,, returning to France in 1771. His health having previously
                    failed, his works were never printed, and remain in manuscript. During his long
                    absence, he was a member of the Académie des Sciences, although for thirty-five
                    years he never came near the place where that body held its deliberations.
                    Amongst the seeds he sent to Bernard were those of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heliotropium ρeruviaηum,</hi> Linn., then first introduced into Europe. He died
                    at Paris, 11th April 1779.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Antoine Laurent de Jussieu</hi> (1748-1836), nephew of
                    the three preceding, was born at Lyons on 12th April 1748. Called to Paris by
                    his uncle Bernard, and carefully trained by him for the pursuits of medicine and
                    botany, he largely profited by the opportunities afforded him. Gifted with a
                    tenacious memory, and the power of quickly grasping the salient points of
                    subjects under observation, he steadily worked at the improvement of that system
                    of plant-arrangement which had been sketched out by his uncle. In 1789 was
                    issued his <hi rend="italic">Genera plantarum secundum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ordines naturales disposita, juxta methodum in horto regio Parisiensi exaratam,
                    anno</hi> MDCCLXXiv, Paris, 8vo. The influence of this volume is briefly noticed
                    in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Botany,</hi> vol. iv. p. 80; it formed the
                    foundation on which modern classification was afterwards built; more than this,
                    it is certain that Cuvier derived much help in his zoological classification
                    from its perusal. Hardly had the last sheet passed through the press, when the
                    French Revolution broke out, and the author was installed in charge of the
                    hospitals of Paris. The Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle was organized on its present
                    footing mainly by him in 1793, and he selected for its library everything
                    relating to natural history from the vast materials obtained from the convents
                    then broken up. He continued as professor of botany there from 1770 to 1826,
                    when his son Adrien succeeded him. Besides the <hi rend="italic">Genera,</hi> he
                    produced nearly sixty memoirs on botanical topics. He died at Paris, 17 th
                    September 1836.</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="smallcaps">Adrien (Laurent Henri) de Jussieu</hi> (1797— 1853), son
                    of Antoine Laurent, was born at Paris 23d December 1797. Although his youth was
                    delicate, he displayed the qualities of his family in his thesis for the degree
                    of M.D., <hi rend="italic">De Euphorbiacearum</hi><hi rend="italic">generibus
                    medicisque</hi><hi rend="italic">earundem</hi><hi rend="italic">viribus
                    tentamen,</hi> Paris, 1824. He was also the author of valuable contributions to
                    botanical literature oh the <hi rend="italic">Putaceae, Meliaceae,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Mdlpighiaceae,</hi> respectively, of “Taxonomie” in the <hi

                    rend="italic">Botam ique,</hi> which reached nine editions, and has been
                    translated into the principal languages of Europe. He also edited his father’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Introductio</hi><hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >historiam</hi><hi rend="italic">plantarum,</hi> issued at Paris, without
                    imprint or date, it being a fragment of the intended second edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Genera,</hi> which Antoine Laurent did not live to complete. He
                    died at Paris, 29 th June 1853, leaving two daughters, but no son, so that with
                    him closed the brilliant botanical dynasty.</p>
                <p>VI. <hi rend="smallcaps">Laurent (Pierre) de Jussieu</hi> (1792—1866). This
                    miscellaneous writer, nephew of Antoine Laurent, was born at Villeurbanne, 7th
                    February 1792. <hi rend="italic">Simon de Nantua,</hi><hi rend="italic">au le
