                    a law according to which “the prince” is at liberty to alienate in perpetuity
                    any portion of his inheritance to his sons; but if he give a gift of his
                    inheritance to any other of his subjects, then the change of ownership holds
                    good only till “the year of liberty” (TΓ∏iΙ TW), after which the alienated
                    property returns to its original possessor, the prince. This restriction upon
                    the transfer of real property is applied to a greatly enlarged class of persons
                    and cases in Lev. xXv. 8-55, which is by far the most important passage relating
                    to this subject. It is again referred to in Lev. xxvii. 17-25, and the only
                    other allusion to it in the Pentateuch occurs in Numb, xxxvi. 4. According to
                    Lev. xxv. 8-12, at the completion of seven sabbaths of years, the trumpet of the
                    jubilee (∏^∙1"∣^∣ ΠS1B*) is to be sounded “throughout the land,” on the tenth
                    day of the seventh month, i.i., on the great day of atonement. The fiftieth year
                    thus announced is to be “hallowed,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> liberty ("ΠT∣)
                    is to be proclaimed everywhere to every one, and the people are to return “every
                    man unto his possession and unto his family.” The year in other respects is to
                    resemble the sabbatical year; there is to be no sowing, nor reaping that which
                    grows of itself, nor gathering of grapes. Coming to fuller detail,—as regards
                    real property (Lev. xxv. 13—34), the law is that if any Hebrew under pressure of
                    necessity shall alienate his property he is to get for it a sum of money
                    reckoned according to the number of harvests to be reaped between the date of
                    alienation and the first jubilee year; should he or any relation desire to
                    redeem the property before the jubilee, this can always be done by repaying the
                    value of the harvests between the redemption and the jubilee. The fundamental
                    principle is that “the land shall not be sold so as to be quite cut off, for it
                    is mine, and ye are strangers and sojourners with me.” The same rule applies to
                    dwelling-houses of unwalled villages; the case is different, however, as regards
                    dwelling-houses in walled cities. These may be redeemed within a year after
                    transfer, but if not redeemed within that period they continue permanently in
                    possession of the purchaser. An exception to this last rule is made for the
                    houses of the Levites in the Levitical cities. As regards property in slaves
                    (Lev.∙χxv. 35-55), the Hebrew whom necessity has compelled to sell himself into
                    the service of his brother Hebrew is to be treated as a hired servant and a
                    sojourner, and to be released absolutely at the jubilee; non-Hebrew bondmen on
                    the other hand are to be bondmen for ever. But the Hebrew who has sold himself
                    to a stranger or sojourner is entitled to freedom at the year of jubilee, and
                    further is at any time redeemable by any of his kindred,— the redemption price
                    being regulated by the number of years to run between the redemption and the
                    jubilee, according to the ordinary wage of hired servants. So much for the
                    Levitical law; as regards its observance, the evidence of history is not
                    voluminous, but Jer. xxxiv. 14 seems to show conclusively that in his time at
                    least the law acknowledged by the prophets was that described in Deut, xv.,
                    according to which the rights of Hebrew slave-holders over their compatriots
                    were invariably to cease seven years after they had been acquired. After the
                    exile the law of Lev. XXV. was also certainly disregarded; the Talmudists and
                    Rabbins are unanimous that although the jubilee years were “reckoned” they were
                    not observed.</p>

                    word 5⅛' in Exod. xix. 13, Josh. vi. 5, makes it probable that the name is
                    derived from the trumpet sound with which the jubilee was to be proclaimed; and
                    it is not impossible that the old Jewish traditional view is right <pb

                    a probable confirmation in Phoenician—and then, by abbreviation for Ss' pp, a
                    trumpet of ram’s horn. See Dillmann on Exod. xix. 13. If the law of the jubilee
                    is posterior to the time of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, and was not enforced after the
                    exile, the practical difficulties of the institution, especially in its
                    connexion with the sabbatical year, call for no remark. Older theologians, by
                    whom all the Pentateuchal laws were regarded as homogeneous parts of a single
                    practical scheme, spent much ingenuity on the explanation of the year of
                    jubilee. Thus Scaliger and many others sought to identify it with the seventh
                    sabbatical year, and so to avoid a succession of two years in which agriculture
                    was suspended. The most ingenious form of this attempt is the theory of Franke

                    year period, and connects it with the intercalation necessary to re-establish
                    the correspondence of the lunar and solar years.</p>
