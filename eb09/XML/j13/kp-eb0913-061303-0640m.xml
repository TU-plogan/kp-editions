                <p><label type="entry">JEFFERSON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label>
                    (1743-1826), the third president of the United States, and the most conspicuous
                    apostle of Democracy in America, was born April 2, 1743, at Shadwell, Albemarle
                    county, in the State of Virginia, a region of which his father Peter Jefferson,
                    an obscure and unlettered planter, was the third or fourth settler. -</p>
                <p>At the early age of five years Thomas was sent to an English school, and from
                    that time until he finished his studies at William and Mary’s College in 1762
                    appears to have enjoyed superior educational advantages, and to have turned them
                    all to good account. He carried with him from college, at nineteen, a tolerably
                    thorough reading knowledge of the Latin, Greek, and French languages, to which
                    he added a familiarity with the higher mathematics and natural sciences only
                    possessed at his age by men who have, as he had, a rare natural faculty for the
                    prosecution of those studies. Soon after leaving college he entered the law
                    office of Mr George Wythe, then at the head of the Virginia bar, and withal,
                    Jefferson being judge, “the best Latin and Greek scholar in the State.” In Mr
                    Wythe he found a “faithful and beloved mentor in youth and most affectionate
                    friend through life.” In 1767, after five years’ close application to the study
                    of his profession, he was admitted to the bar. The death of his father in 1757
                    left Thomas, who was the eldest son, heir to the estate on which he was born,
                    and which yielded him an income of about £400 a year, a sum in those days
                    sufficient to gratify all his tastes, and to give him, as he matured, the
                    position of an independent country gentleman. At the time of his admission to
                    the bar he is described by his contemporaries as 6 feet 2 inches in height,
                    slim, erect as an arrow, with angular features, a very ruddy complexion, an
                    extremely delicate skin, full deep-set hazel eyes, and sandy hair, an expert
                    musician (the violin being his favourite instrument), a good dancer, a dashing
                    rider, and a proficient in all manly exercises. He was, and continued through
                    life, frank, earnest, cordial, and sympathetic in his manner, full of confidence
                    in men, and sanguine in his views of life.</p>
                <p>Though mostly known to fame as a statesman, Jefferson’s success as a lawyer
                    showed that the bar had no rewards which were not fairly within his reach. He
                    had sixty-eight cases before the chief court of the province the first year of
                    his practice, and nearly twice that number the second. In the fourth, his
                    register shows that he was employed in four hundred and thirty cases. During the
                    eight years that he continued in active practice his income had enabled him to
                    live like a gentleman, and to add a few hundred acres to his landed estate from
                    time to time, until his inheritance of 1900 acres had become, in 1774, 5000
                    acres, and all paid for. But, while fired with the Virginian passion of the
                    period for acquiring land, Jefferson does not appear to have shared the passion
                    which usually accompanied it, of multiplying slaves to clear and till it. He was
                    one of the first of English-speaking statesmen with foresight enough to discover
                    the thunders with which the dark cloud of slavery was charged, and with courage
                    enough to warn his countrymen against them. It does not appear that he ever
                    acquired any slaves by purchase and as an investment.</p>
                <p>In 1767 Governor Fauquier, the colonial governor of Virginia, died. The arrival
                    of the new governor, Baron de Botetourt, in October 1768, was followed,
                    according to usage, by the dismissal of the House of Burgesses, and a new
                    election was ordered. Jeffer son, offering himself as a candidate, was elected
                    from the county of Albemarle, and continued to be annually re-elected until the
                    House of Burgesses was closed by the revolution. His public career began, like
                    that of some of the greatest parliamentarians before <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n641/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0641-0614"/> him, in a mortifying failure. Tn conformity with
                    a usage brought from the mother country of selecting one of the younger members
                    to draft the reply to the governor’s speech, this complimentary duty was
                    devolved upon Jefferson. He confined himself too closely for the taste of the
                    committee to the language of the resolutions which he was expected to amplify
                    and glorify. His address was rejected, and the duty of preparing a substitute
                    was confided to another member. This humiliation doubtless had some share in
                    giving to his pen the parliamentary distinction usually won only by the tongue;
                    for he was no orator—indeed, though one of the foremost members of several
                    deliberative bodies in his time, he can fairly be said to have never made a
                    speech.</p>
                <p>Jefferson’s legislative duties were not destined to detain him long from his
                    profession. The king having abandoned the policy of levying internal taxes, and
                    directed instead that a duty upon certain leading articles of foreign commerce
                    should be levied at the custom-houses in the colonies, in the spring of 1769 a
                    messenger arrived at Williamsburg, then the seat of government of Virginia,
                    announcing to the House of Burgesses the firm resolve of Massachusetts to resist
                    these duties by all constitutional means, and asking the concurrence and
                    co-operation of Virginia. On the third day of the session of the House of
                    Burgesses four resolutions were adopted with substantial unanimity, in harmony
                    with those adopted by Massachusetts. The first declared against taxation without
                    representation; the second, that the colonies may concur and co-operate in
                    seeking redress of grievances; the third, that sending accused persons away from
                    their country for trial is an inexpressible complexity of wrong; the fourth,
                    that they should send an address on these topics to the “father of all his
                    people,” beseeching his “royal interposition.” On the following day, and without
                    waiting for an official copy of these resolutions to reach him, Governor
                    Botetourt dissolved the House of Burgesses.</p>
                <p>Thus in five days terminated, for the present, Jefferson’s career as a
                    legislator. But, though brief and crowned with no results to satisfy his
                    ambition, history does not pronounce his first experience as a legislator
                    inglorious, for it was illustrated by an effort, which was not the less
                    honourable to him because it was unsuccessful, to ameliorate the condition of
                    the African bondmen in Virginia. The law of those days forbade the manumission
                    of a slave, except upon the condition that he was immediately sent out of the
                    State. Jefferson desired the repeal of this law. His efforts were not only
                    unsuccessful, but they developed such a state of feeling upon the subject as to
                    bring into grand relief the courage which even at that early day ventured, to
                    propose such a measure.</p>
                <p>The day after the House of Burgesses dispersed, its members met at a public hall
                    in the Raleigh Tavern in Williamsburg, and, following the example of
                    Massachusetts, resolved, with a near approach to unanimity—(1 ) to be more
                    saving and industrious; (2) never to buy any article taxed by parliament for
                    revenue, except low qualities of paper which they could not dispense with, nor
                    (3) to import any article from Britain or in British ships if they could help
                    it, until the offensive Act was repealed; and (4) to save all their lambs for
                    wool. Every man who signed the agreement was re-elected, and every man who
                    refused lost his election.</p>
                <p>On February 1, 1770, while Jefferson and his mother were absent from home, his
                    house was burned down. He had, however, already begun clearing the grounds and
                    preparing for the erection of a new residence at Monticello, which occupied no
                    inconsiderable portion of his time and thoughts for the next two years, and
                    which was destined' to become, for more than half a century, the most
                    distinguished seat of private hospitality in America. On the 1st of January 1772
                    he married Martha Skelton, a widowed daughter of a wealthy neighbour and
                    associate at the bar of Williamsburg, of large fortune in lands and slaves. The
                    lady was very handsome, childless, fond of music, twenty-three; she proved to
                    him a loving and devoted wife, and was the centre of a domestic circle the joys
                    of which seemed only to be intensified and consecrated by the distractions of
                    his public life.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1773 Jefferson was appointed by the House of Burgesses a member
                    of “a Committee of Correspondence and Inquiry for the Dissemination of
                    Intelligence between the Colonies.” The appointment of this committee responded
                    to the necessity then beginning to be felt by all the colonies of making common
                    cause against the pretensions of the Crown, and looked to a convention in which
                    their united purposes might find expression. The resolutions which gave birth to
                    this committee provoked an immediate dissolution of the House, but its members
                    were all re-elected. Soon after they had resumed their sittings in the following
                    spring, news reached them of what is known in history as “The Boston Port Bill,”
                    by which the chief port of Massachusetts was to be closed to commerce on the 1st
                    of June of that year (1774). The House of Burgesses thereupon set apart that day
                    for fasting, humiliation, and prayer, thereby provoking from the governor
                    another dissolution, May 20, 1774. This immediately led to the selection of
                    delegates from the several counties to meet at Williamsburg in August, to
                    consider the state of the colony, and to provide for an annual congress of the
                    colonies. Jefferson was chosen a delegate to the State Convention, but, owing to
                    sudden indisposition which overtook him on his way, was unable to attend. His
                    influence there, however, was not to be wanting, for much of the interval
                    between the dissolution of the House and the meeting of the Convention was
                    devoted to the consideration and preparation of a series of instructions for the
                    deputies who were to be sent to the General Congress, which was to meet at
                    Philadelphia in September. In these instructions, which he had intended himself
                    to propose, could he have been present, he maintained <hi rend="superscript">
                    ζ</hi> ‘ that the relation between Great Britain and these colonies was exactly
                    the same as that of England and Scotland after the accession of James and until
                    the Union, and the same as her present relations with Hanover,—having the same
                    executive chief, but no other necessary political connexion; and that our
                    emigration to this country gave no more rights over us than the emigration of
                    the Danes and Saxons gave to the present authorities of the mother country over
                    England.” These instructions, though too radical then for the purpose for which
                    they were designed, were laid upon the table of the delegates, read by many, and
                    published in a pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic">A Summary View of the Rights
                    of America,</hi> and extensively circulated. It ran through edition after
                    edition in England, after receiving such modifications (attributed to the pen of
                    Burke) as adapted it to the purposes of the Opposition; and it procured for its
                    author, to use his own language, “the honour of having his name inserted in a
                    long list of proscriptions enrolled in a bill of attainder commenced in one of
                    the two Houses of Parliament, but suppressed in embryo by the hasty course of
                    events.” This paper placed Jefferson among the leaders, if not at the head of
                    the revolutionary movement in America—events rapidly ripening in the public mind
                    its novel and startling doctrines. The Declaration of Independence two years
                    later, of which he asked that his tombstone should testify as the greatest
                    achievement of his life, was but a perfected transcript of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Summary View.</hi></p>
                <p>Jefferson was the leading spirit in the succeeding sessions of the Virginia
                    Convention; he was one of a committee of thirteen appointed to report a plan for
                    arming Virginia ∙ <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> he was named a delegate to the
                    General Congress, where he took his seat eight days after Colonel George
                    Washington had been appointed by Congress commander-in-chief of the armies of
                    the colonies; and he was placed upon the committee to draw up a statement of the
                    causes which had impelled the colonies to take up arms against the mother
                    country, and upon another committee to report on Lord North’s “conciliatory
                    proposition.” In the winter of 1775-6 disastrous news arrived from England. The
                    king in opening parliament had denounced the colonists as rebels, and
                    recommended decisive coercive measures against them; and this was promptly
                    followed by a law authorizing the confiscation of American vessels and cargoes,
                    and those of all nations found trading in American ports, and the impressment of
                    American crews into the British navy. This measure and the large vote by which
                    it was passed instantly crystallized the colonies, and on the 11th June 1776
                    Congress appointed Jefferson, Adams, Franklin, Sherman, and Livingston to
                    prepare a Declaration of Independence.</p>
                <p>Jefferson at the request of his associates prepared a draft of the Declaration,
                    which, after two or three verbal corrections by them, was taken up for
                    consideration in the House on the 2d of July. In the debate on the Declaration
                    Jefferson took no part, “thinking it a duty to be on that occasion a passive
                    auditor of the opinions of others, more impartial judges than he could be of its
                    merits and demerits.” Two or three expressions had been used which gave offence
                    to some members: the words “Scotch and other foreign auxiliaries” were resented
                    by some delegates of Scottish birth; and the strictures on the king’s repeated
                    veto of colonial laws repealing the law which permitted the slave trade were
                    disapproved by some of the southern delegates.</p>
                <p>On the evening of the 4th of July 1776 the Declaration was reported back from the
                    committee of the whole House, and agreed to. Circumstances have given an
                    historical importance to this document somewhat disproportioned to its merits as
                    a statement of the grievances of the colonies; for it seemed to be the weapon
                    that dismembered a great empire, and that gave birth to a nation of unlimited
                    possibilities; it gave guarantees for the fame of its author which are possessed
                    by no other production of an American pen; for more than a century it has been
                    read to assembled multitudes in every considerable town in the United States on
                    the anniversary of its adoption; and its style and sentiments have been the
                    model for every people which since that time has sought to assert for itself the
                    right of self-government.</p>
                <p>Jefferson continued to participate actively in the efforts to organize the
                    government of the confederation, and prepare it for the life and death straggle
                    which was impending, until the 2d of September, when he resigned, to take his
                    seat in the legislature of Virginia, to which he had been elected, and where he
                    thought his services would be most needed. “When I left Congress in ’76,” he
                    says in his autobiography, “it was in the persuasion that our whole code must be
                    reviewed, adapted to our republican form of government, and, now that we had no
                    negatives of councils, governors<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n642/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0642-0615"/>, or kings to restrain us from doing right, that
                    it be corrected in all its parts with a single eye to reason and the good of
                    those for whose government it was framed.” To this task he now devoted himself
                    Of the various measures introduced in furtherance of this purpose he says: “I
                    considered four, passed or reported, as forming a system by which every fibre
                    would be eradicated of ancient or future aristocracy, and a foundation laid for
                    a government truly republican.” These were—the repeal of the laws of entail, the
                    abolition of primogeniture and equal partition of inheritances, the restoration
                    of the rights of conscience and relief of the people from taxation for the
                    support of a religion not theirs, and a system of general education. He tried to
                    add to these, but without success, the introduction of trial by jury into the
                    courts of chancery, and to provide for the gradual emancipation of the slaves.
                    He did, however, introduce a bill, which passed without opposition, forbidding
                    the further importation of slaves into the State—the only important change
                    effected in the slave system of Virginia during the revolutionary period. The
                    importance he attached to his work in Virginia at this time he showed by
                    resigning his seat in Congress, and by declining the appointment tendered him by
                    Congress in 1776, to go with Franklin to Faris, to assist in negotiating
                    treaties of commerce and alliance with France.</p>
                <p>In the third year of the war (1779), and just as the darkest and most threatening
                    clouds were gathering over Virginia, Jefferson was elected governor. The enemy
                    had decided to carry the war into the south. The commonwealth was almost
                    defenceless, all her military resources having been exhausted in sustaining
                    Washington’s policy of driving the enemy out of the north. Arnold entered
                    Richmond, recently become the capital, on the 5th of January 1781, and ravaged
                    the place. The legislature, which had taken refuge at Charlottesville, were
                    pursued and dispersed by Tarleton, who immediately sent a party to capture
                    Jefferson at Monticello. He narrowly escaped, his pursuers being in sight of him
                    as he mounted his horse and rode off to join his family. Though Monticello was
                    spared by Tarleton’s order, Jefferson’s estate of Elk Hill, on the James river,
                    was less fortunate. It was completely despoiled by the orders of Cornwallis. It
                    was natural that the ineffectual resistance made to the enemy in Virginia should
                    have exposed the governor’s conduct to criticism, for few knew, as he did, that
                    a more effective defence was impossible without weakening the northern army, and
                    totally disarranging the plans upon which the commander-in-chief wisely relied
                    for the ultimate success of the national defence. An investigation of his
                    conduct was threatened; but when it was ascertained that he had been acting in
                    harmony with the policy of Washington, the investigation was not only abandoned
                    but the legislature shortly after the expiration of his term of office resolved
                    unanimously ‘ ‘ That the thanks of the general assembly be given to our former
                    governor, Thomas Jefferson, for his impartial, upright, and attentive
                    administration while in office. The assembly wish to declare in the strongest
                    manner the high opinion which they entertain of Mr Jefferson’s ability,
                    rectitude, and integrity as chief magistrate in this commonwealth, and mean, by
                    thus publicly avowing their opinion, to obviate and to remove all unmerited
                    censure.” Jefferson became sensible that in the exhausted condition of Virginia,
                    without money, without equipment, without troops, without any currency except
                    the products of the soil, no governor not a trained soldier could hope to retain
                    the confidence of the people during the crisis, and therefore he determined to
                    decline re-election.</p>
                <p>In 1782 he was summoned by Congress to act as one of the plenipotentiaries to
                    negotiate a treaty of peace with the mother country, but the business was found
                    to be so far advanced before he was ready to sail that his appointment was
                    recalled, and we find him at the following winter session again occupying his
                    seat in Congress, where, as chairman of the committee to which it was referred,
                    he reported the definitive treaty of peace with England. At the succeeding
                    session he introduced an elaborate report, and secured the adoption of the
                    system of coinage which is still in vogue in the United States/ In the same
                    session he drafted the report of a plan for the government of the vast territory
                    lying to the northwest of the Ohio river, which Virginia had ceded to the
                    Federal Government in 1780. Among other provisions which he suggested, and which
                    were adopted, was one big with a rebellion of far more threatening proportions
                    than that which its author had just assisted in bringing to a successful issue.
                    The clause in question provided “that after the year 1800 of the Christian era
                    there shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in any of the said
                    States, otherwise than in punishment of crimes whereof the party shall be duly
                    convicted to have been personally guilty.” It was the attempt to organize States
                    from this territory in defiance of this restriction that led to the war of 1861,
                    and to the final, though costly, vindication of Jefferson’s sagacity and
                    forecast in 1783.</p>
                <p>In 1784 Jefferson was again commissioned by Congress as minister plenipotentiary,
                    this time to assist Franklin and Adams in negotiating treaties of commerce with
                    European states. He joined his associates in Paris in July. The mission upon
                    which he was sent proved somewhat premature. Jefferson, wisely judging that
                    fuller and more correct information about America must precede any successful
                    attempts to deal with European states to advantage, printed at his own expense,
                    and distributed among his friends, some <hi rend="italic">Noles on
                    Virginia,</hi> which he had prepared two years before. It was in these notes
                    that the oft-quoted passage occurs: “I tremble for my country when I think that
                    God is just; that his justice cannot sleep for ever; that, considering numbers,
                    nature, and natural means only, a revolution of the wheel of fortune, an
                    exchange of situations, is among possible events; that it may become probable by
                    supernatural interference. The Almighty has no attribute that can take sides
                    with us in such a contest.” A very bad translation of a copy of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Notes</hi> which had found its way to France having made its
                    appearance in Paris, Jefferson felt he had no longer any motive for trying to
                    limit their usefulness to the few discreet friends to whom he had addressed
                    them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Jefferson took a
                    very modest view of this book, and in a purely literary point of view he could
                    not afford to take any other; but it was so thoroughly saturated with
                    democratic-republican ideas, of which he was then the most complete living
                    exponent, with the possible exception of Franklin, that it was widely and
                    eagerly read, and no doubt did much to relax the . hold the doctrines of divine
                    right and of passive obedience had upon the educated classes of France, and
                    measurably contributed to precipitate the great popular uprising in that
                    kingdom, with which Europe was sυon to be convulsed.</p></note></p>
                <p>In January 1785 Dr Franklin, after eight years’ residence at the French court,
                    pressed his application to be relieved, and Jefferson was selected, as he
                    gracefully put it in presenting his letters of credence, “to succeed him, for no
                    one could <hi rend="italic">replace</hi> him.” Jefferson was exceedingly popular
                    as a minister, and was fortunate in securing several important modifications of
                    the French tariff in the interests of American commerce.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1789 Washington, who had been elected president of the United
                    States under the new constitution, gave Jefferson leave of absence, and soon
                    after his arrival in America, “as well from motives of private regard as a
                    conviction of public propriety,” tendered him the office of secretary of state.
                    Reluctant as Jefferson was to leave Paris, he yielded at once to the wishes of
                    the president, and entered upon the duties of his new office in March 1790.
                    Alexander Hamilton, who was the head of the Federal party as distinguished from
                    the Democratic, of which Jefferson was the most conspicuous representative, was
                    appointed the secretary of the treasury. They represented the two great schools
                    of political thought which contended for mastery in American politics, not only
                    during Washington’s administration, but for the succeeding sixty years, and
                    until their differences were merged in the graver and more absorbing issues that
                    grew out of the conflict between free and servile labour. Jefferson was an
                    advocate of State sovereignty and of decentralization. He was strongly opposed
                    to the leading features of the British constitution, and in cordial sympathy
                    with the new school of politics which had recently begun to be felt in the
                    government of France. His five years’ residence in that country had greatly
                    strengthened him in these views, and they more or less affected his treatment of
                    all questions that came before him as a cabinet minister. Hamilton’s great fear,
                    on the other hand, was thàt the central government under the new constitution
                    would be too weak, and he favoured all measures that tended to exalt and
                    strengthen the executive, and to bring the government more in harmony with that
                    of England. Washington very prudently gave the victory to the partisan of
                    neither theory, though his sympathies were supposed to be more frequently with
                    the Federal than with the Republican leader.</p>
                <p>The most perplexing questions which occupied Jefferson’s attention as secretary
                    of state grew out of the war declared by France in 1793 against Holland and
                    Great Britain. What should be the neutral policy and what were to be insisted
                    upon as the neutral rights of the United States? Upon this question both parties
                    put forth their whole strength. The Republicans, under Jefferson’s lead, pretty
                    generally sympathized with the French, and were inclined to authorize privateers
                    to be fitted out in American ports to cruise against English vessels. This
                    policy was energetically and wisely resisted by the Federalists, who were for
                    peace with all and entangling alliances with none. Jefferson advocated the
                    propriety of receiving a diplomatic representative from the French republic. In
                    this his advice prevailed, and Genest was promptly sent as minister. With more
                    zeal than discretion he proceeded at once to fit out privateers, and empower
                    French consuls in the United States to organize courts of admiralty to condemn
                    prizes. This led to heated discussions in the cabinet, and finally to the recall
                    of Genest. Partly from discontent with a position in which he did not feel that
                    he enjoyed the absolute, which meant pretty much the exclusive, confidence of
                    the president, and partly because of the embarrassed condition of his private
                    affairs, due mainly to the ravages of war, Jefferson resigned his seat in the
                    cabinet December 31, 1793, and retired to Monticello. There he remained till the
                    fall of 1796, when he was made vice-president at the election which called John
                    Adams to the presidency. The duties of this position being limited to presiding
                    over the Senate during its sessions, Jefferson spent most of the four years of
                    his official term in improving his estate, and by his counsels directing the
                    policy of the party of which he was the acknowledged leader. The excesses of the
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n643/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0643-0616"/> Reign of Terror had worked a formidable reaction
                    in America against the sympathizers with revolutionists in France. This, with
                    the aggressive policy of the Directory, and the insulting reception given to the
                    American envoys in Paris, for a time paralysed the Republican party. President
                    Adams, mistaking the resentment felt in the United States towards France for a
                    popular reaction there against republicanism, was betrayed into a series of
                    ill-considered measures, which were not long in telling upon the fortunes of his
                    party. Among these measures the most unfortunate perhaps were the alien and
                    sedition laws, the former empowering the president to expel from the country
                    such aliens as he should deem dangerous, and the latter punishing as sedition,
                    with tine and imprisonment, the printing or uttering malicious charges against
                    the president or Congress. The Republicans commenced an active agitation against
                    the laws throughout the country, which, co-operating with a strong and popular
                    sympathy with the Republican doctrines, finally resulted in the election of
                    Jefferson and Burr, the candidates of the Republican party, as president and
                    vice-president, and the defeat of Adams and Pinckney the candidates of the
                    Federalists. Washington having died only a few months before, this election
                    proved the <hi rend="italic">coup de grace</hi> of the Federal party, and
                    established Jeffersonian Republicanism as the permanent policy of the country.
                    Jefferson entered upon the duties of the presidency on the 4th of March 1801,
                    and was reelected for the term commencing March 4, 1805, by 143 out of 176
                    electoral votes. His administration of twice four years was characterized by the
                    simplicity which distinguished his conduct in private life. He eschewed all pomp
                    and ceremony designed artificially to distinguish the president from the people.
                    His dress “was of plain cloth” on the day of his inauguration. Instead of
                    driving to the capital in a coach and six as had been the practice, he rode
                    there on horseback, without a guard or even a servant in his train, dismounted
                    without assistance, and hitched the bridle of his horse to a fence. Instead of
                    opening Congress in the English fashion, with a speech to which a formal reply
                    was expected, he sent his message by a private hand. Court etiquette was
                    practically abolished, and the weekly levee with it. The code of precedence was
                    essentially modified. Titles of honour were not recognized as such.
                    “Excellency,” “Honourable,” and even “Mr,” were distasteful to him. Between the
                    President and governors of States he recognized no difference in rank, each
                    being the supreme head of an independent state. “If it be possible,” he said,
                    “to be certainly conscious of anything, I am conscious of feeling no difference
                    between writing to the highest and lowest being on earth.”</p>
                <p>In public official station he regarded himself purely as a trustee for the
                    public. He discontinued the practice of sending ministers abroad in Government
                    vessels, nor would he have his birthday celebrated by state balls; he refused to
                    appoint days of fasting and thanksgiving on the ground that they were religious
                    rites, and no recommendation from him, therefore, could make them more or less
                    binding upon the conscience. To secularize and republicanize the Government were
                    the paramount purpose and the distinguishing feature of his administration. His
                    cabinet, of which Madison and Gallatin were the pillars, was in thorough
                    sympathy with Jefferson in his general policy, and its perfect harmony was
                    uninterrupted. He gave his ministers his entire confidence. “If I had the world
                    to choose from,” he once said, “I could not change one of my associates to my
                    better satisfaction.” The first important act of his administration was to send
                    four of the six vessels constituting the so-called navy of the republic to the
                    Mediterranean to exterminate the Algerine pirates who for half a century had
                    preyed upon the commerce of the world, thus initiating a series of events which
                    in a few years rendered the commerce of the Mediterranean as safe as that of the
                    English Channel. Possessed with a conviction of the supreme commercial
                    importance of New Orleans, he directed negotiations to be opened with the French
                    Government, which resulted in the purchase for $15,000,000 of the territory of
                    Louisiana, which had been ceded by Spain to France. Though the constitutional
                    power under which this important transaction was consummated was far from clear,
                    neither its validity nor its wisdom was ever seriously questioned; and it is now
                    justly regarded by his countrymen as the crowning achievement of his
                    administration,and none the less meritorious for the responsibility he
                    deliberately assumed in bringing it to pass. The remainder of his administration
                    derives most of its historic importance from his unsuccessful attempt to convict
                    Aaron Burr, the late vice-president, of having engaged in treasonable projects
                    in the south-west, and from his efforts to maintain, without war, the rights of
                    neutrals on the high seas. Among the less conspicuous tlιough scarcely less
                    important measures of his administration were the careful exploration of the
                    Western Territories; reducing the public debt, and practically extirpating from
                    the country the then not unpopular delusion that a national debt is a national
                    blessing; fortifying the seaports; reorganizing and rearming the militia;
                    diminishing the taxes; and extinguishing the Indians’ titles by fair purchase,
                    and promoting their emigration beyond the Mississippi. On the 4th of March 1809
                    he retired from the presidency, after an almost continuous public service of
                    over forty years. He was pressed to allow himself to be re-elected for a third
                    term, but refused unconditionally, though the legislatures of five States
                    formally requested him to be a candidate.</p>
                <p>Jefferson, whose private fortune had been seriously compromised by the
                    interruptions of foreign commerce before and during his administration, and by
                    the expenses incident to his representative position, lived seventeen years
                    after his retirement, and to the last was the most considerable personage in the
                    United States. His immediate successors in the presidency for the next sixteen
                    years were his pupils and devoted personal friends, and rarely ventured upon any
                    important step without the support of his approval. The employments of his
                    closing years were in harmony with the dignified and patriotic purposes of his
                    active life. Nothing that concerned the welfare of the country was a matter of
                    indifference to him. He urged successfully the foundation of a university, and
                    became one of its most efficient trustees. His correspondence during this period
                    is regarded as one of the most interesting and instructive contributions to the
                    early literature of the United States. He had inherited a wonderful constitution
                    and herculean strength, neither of which did he ever abuse.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1826 the decline of his strength, which had been gradually
                    increasing for two or three years, became more rapid, and on the 4th of July he
                    expired, in the eighty-third year of his age. John Adams, his predecessor in the
                    presidency, by an impressive coincidence, died on the same day,—the fiftieth
                    anniversary of an event imperishably associated with the names of both and with
                    the fortunes of a nation.</p>
