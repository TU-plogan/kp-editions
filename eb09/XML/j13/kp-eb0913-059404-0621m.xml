                    botanicallyJhsτn⅛ιiW2, a genus of shrubs or climbers constituting the principal
                    part of the natural order <hi rend="italic">Jasminaceae,</hi> and comprising
                    about sixty species, of which forty or more occur in the gardens of Britain. The
                    plants of the genus are mostly natives of the warmer regions of the Old World,
                    but there are one or two South American species. The leaves are pinnate or
                    ternate, or sometimes apparently simple, consisting of one leaflet, articulated
                    to the petiole. The flowers, usually white or yellow, are arranged in terminal
                    or axillary panicles, and have a tubular 5- or 8-cleft calyx, and a cylindrical
                    corollatube, with a spreading limb, two included stamens, and a two-celled
                    ovary.</p>
                <p>The name is derived from the Persian <hi rend="italic">ydsmin.</hi> Linnaeus

                    resemblance to that of the violet; it is in fact so peculiar as to be
                    incomparable, and is probably the only floral perfume which cannot be imitated
                    by art. The common white jasmine, <hi rend="italic">Jasminum officinale,</hi>
                    one of the best known and most highly esteemed of British hardy ligneous
                    climbers, is said to be a native of India, and to have been introduced about the
                    middle of the 16 th century. In the centre and south of Europe it is thoroughly
                    acclimatized. Although it grows to the height of 12 and sometimes 20 feet, its
                    stem is feeble and requires support; its leaves are opposite, pinnated, and dark
                    green, the leaflets are in three pairs, with an odd one, and are pointed, the
                    terminal one larger and with a tapering point. The fragrant white flowers bloom
                    from June to October; and, as they are found chiefly on the young shoots, the
                    plant should only be pruned in the autumn. Varieties with golden and
                    silver-edged leaves and one with double flowers are known.</p>
                <p>The Zambak or Arabian jasmine, <hi rend="italic">&lt;7asmiηum Sambac,</hi> is an
                    evergreen white-flowered climber, 6 or 8 feet high, introduced into Britain in
                    the latter part of the 17th century. Two varieties introduced somewhat later are
                    respectively 3-leaved and double-flowered, and these, as well as that with
                    normal flowers, bloom throughout the greater part of the year. On account of
                    their exquisite fragrance the flowers are highly esteemed in the East, and are
                    frequently referred to by the Persian and Arabian poets. An oil obtained by
                    boiling the leaves is used to anoint the head for complaints of the eye, and an
                    oil obtained from the roots is used medicinally to arrest the secretion of milk.
                    The flowers of one of the double varieties, known as “Moogree,” are held sacred
                    to Vishnu, and used as votive offerings in Hindu religious ceremonies. In China
                    the flowers of this plant, under the name of “Mo-le-hwa,” are used for scenting
                    tea. The Spanish, or Catalonian jasmine, <hi rend="italic">J. grandi-flomιm</hi>
                    (fig. 2), which grows wild on the island of Tobago, is very like <hi
                    rend="italic">J. officinale,</hi> but differs in the size of the leaflets; the
                    branches are shorter and stouter, and the flowers very much larger, and reddish
                    underneath. By grafting it on two-year-old plants of <hi rend="italic">J.
                    officinale,</hi> an erect bush about 3 feet high is obtained, requiring no
                    supports. In this way it is very extensively cultivated at Cannes and Grasse, in
                    the south of France; the plants are set in rows, fully exposed to the sun; they
                    come into full bearing the second year after grafting; the blossoms, which are
                    very large and intensely fragrant, are produced from July till the end of
                    October, but those of August and September are the most odoriferous. An acre of
                    land is said to yield about 500 tt&gt; of blossoms during the season, value £25
                    to £35. The aroma is extracted by the process known as “enfleurage,” <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> absorption by a fatty body, such as purified lard or
                    olive oil. Square glass trays framed with wood about 3 inches deep are spread
                    over with grease about half an inch thick, in which ridges are made to
                    facilitate absorption, and sprinkled with freshly gathered flowers, which are
                    renewed every morning during the whole time the plant remains in blossom; the
                    trays are piled up in stacks to prevent the evaporation of the aroma; and
                    finally the pomade is scraped off the glass, melted at as low a temperature as
                    possible, and strained. When oil is employed as the absorbent, coarse cotton
                    cloths previously saturated with the finest olive oil are laid on wire-gauze
                    frames, and repeatedly covered in the same manner with fresh flowers; they are
                    then squeezed under a press, yielding what is termed “huile antique au jasmin.”
                    3 lb of flowers will perfume 1 lb of grease,—this is exhausted by maceration in
                    1 pint of rectified spirit to form the “extract.”</p>
                <p>An essential oil is distilled from jasmine in Tunis and Algeria, but its high
                    price prevents its being used to any extent. The East Indian oil of jasmine is a
                    compound largely contaminated with sandalwood-oil. The distinguishing characters
                    of <hi rend="italic">J. odoratissimum</hi> consist principally in the alternate,
                    obtuse, ternate, and pinnate leaves, the 3-flowered terminal peduncles, and the
                    5-cleft yellow corolla with obtuse segments. The flowers have the advantage of
                    retaining when dry their natural perfume, which is suggestive of a mixture of
                    jasmine, jonquille, and orange-blossom. In China the <hi rend="italic">J.
                    paniculatum</hi> is cultivated as an erect shrub, known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sieu-hinghwa;</hi> it is valued for its flowers, which are used with those of
                    <hi rend="italic">J. Sambac,</hi> in the proportion of 10 lb of the former to 30
                    lb of the latter, for scenting tea—40 ft&gt; of the mixture being required for
                    100 lb of tea. The “narrow leaved jasmine,” &lt;Λ <hi rend="italic"
                    >angustifolium,</hi> is a beautiful evergreen climber 10 to 12 feet high, found
                    in the Coromandel forests, and introduced into Britain during the present
                    century. Its leaves are of a bright shining green; its large terminal flowers
                    are white with a faint tinge of red, fragrant, and blooming throughout the year.
                    The bitter root, ground small and mixed with lime-juice and root of <hi
                    rend="italic">Acorus Calamus,</hi> is considered in India a good remedy for
                    ringworm and herpes. In Cochin China a decoction of the leaves and branches of
                    J∙ <hi rend="italic">nervosum</hi> is taken as a blood-purifier; and the bitter
                    leaves of J^. <hi rend="italic">floribundum</hi> (called in Abyssinia
                    “Habbez-zelim ”) mixed with Kousso is considered a powerful anthelmintic,
                    especially for tape-worm; the leaves and branches are added to some fermented
                    liquors to increase their intoxicating quality. In Sierra Leone a poultice made
                    with the leaves of <hi rend="italic">J. ηoctiflorum</hi> is applied to ulcers.
                    The leaves of <hi rend="italic">J.</hi><hi rend="italic">hirsutum</hi> boiled in
                    oil are applied in India and China in cases of ophthalmia, and its root is said
                    to be a really good remedy for snake bites. In Catalonia and in Turkey the wood
                    of the jasmine is made into long, slender pipestems, highly prized by the Moors
                    and Turks. Syrup of jasmine is made ⅛&gt;y placing in a jar alternate layers of
                    the flowers and sugar, covering the whole with wet cloths and standing it in a
                    cool place; the perfume is absorbed by the sugar, which is converted into a very
                    palatable syrup.</p>
