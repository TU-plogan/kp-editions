                    virtual government of the kingdom; and the king, in order tα secure the safety
                    of the surviving son, resolved in 1405 to place him under the protection of the
                    king of France. The prince, however, on his way thither fell into the hands of
                    the English, and Henry IV. determined not to admit him to ransom. On the death
                    of his father, April 13, 1406, James became nominal sovereign, but, as he was
                    still retained in captivity in England, the duke of Albany continued regent, and
                    was succeeded, on his death in 1419, by his son Murdock At first James was
                    confined in the Tower of London, but in 1407 he was removed to the castle of
                    Nottingham, where he enjoyed as much liberty as was compatible with detention,
                    and was treated in all respects by his governor, Sir John Pelham, as a member of
                    the household. The physical and intellectual training begun at St Andrews under
                    Bishop Wardlaw was completed by the most accomplished tutors, so that he not
                    only attained to high proficiency in all kinds of manly sports, but reached
                    perhaps a more varied and thorough culture than any of his contemporaries. His
                    figure was not much if at all above the middle height, and, though thickset, was
                    finely proportioned. His agility was no less remarkable than his strength; he
                    not only excelled in throwing the hammer and putting the stone, but in all kinds
                    of athletic feats demanding suppleness of limb and quickness of eye. As regards
                    his intellectual attainments he is reputed to have been well acquainted with
                    philosophy, and it is evident from his subsequent procedure as a sovereign that
                    he had made a special study of jurisprudence; while, besides being a proficient
                    in instrumental and vocal music, he cultivated the art of poetry with a success
                    not surpassed by any previous English writers with the exception of his models
                    Gower and Chaucer. Henry V., on succeeding his father in 14137 removed James to
                    close confinement in the Tower, but shortly afterwards took him to Windsor, and
                    in 1417, with the view of detaching the Scotch auxiliaries from the French
                    standard, invited him to accompany him in his expedition against France. From
                    this time, and especially after the death of the duke of Albany in 1419, James
                    was treated with much consideration; and, having given a pledge of his friendly
                    intentions towards England by his marriage with Lady Jane Beaufort, February 2,
                    1424, he finally obtained his release in the end of March of the same year, the
                    Scottish nation agreeing to pay a ransom of £40,000». in name of expenses for
                    his maintenance while in captivity.</p>

                <p>With the reign of James L, whose coronation took place at Scone on the 21st May,
                    may almost be said to begin the substitution in Scotland of constitutional
                    sovereignty, regulated by definite principles and laws and modified by a regard
                    to the opinions and interests of the subjects, for the indefinite authority of
                    the king and the arbitrary rule of the nobles. It is true that after his death
                    the lawless contests of the nobles broke out as fiercely as ever, but by his
                    energetic repression of their violence during his lifetime, and more especially
                    by the virtual creation of statute law modelled on that of England, and the
                    additional importance assigned to parliament, the leaven was partly prepared
                    which was to work towards the destruction of their unlicensed influence. During
                    a session of the parliament held at Perth on the 12th March 1425, James suddenly
                    arrested a large number of the nobles, including the duke of Albany and his two
                    sons, whom along with the earl of Lennox he caused to be executed. With similar
                    strategy he at a parliament held at Inverness in 1427 arrested Donald of the
                    Isles and fifty of his chiefs. Donald, however, on making all due submission,
                    received his liberty; but when, in violation of his oath he made an abortive
                    attempt to assert his independence, the king, on his making unconditional
                    surrender, confined him to Tantallon castle. As was natural, the energetic rule
                    of the king, and especially his stringent coercion of the nobles, aroused a
                    secret purpose of revenge; and, acting on the inspiration of the earl of Athole,
                    uncle of the king, Sir Robert Graham and other accomplices, with a band of three
                    hundred Highlanders, suddenly, on the evening of the 20th or morning of the 21st
                    February 1437, entered the apartment of the king in the priory of the Dominicans
                    at Perth, and stabbed him to death with their daggers.</p>
                <p>Although the constitutional reforms introduced by James I., and the general tenor
                    of his reign, showed that in him were united in a rare degree decision in action
                    with far-sighted sagacity, his merits as a statesman have been cast in the shade
                    by his achievements in literature. It is also worthy of mention that it was
                    owing chiefly to his representations when in captivity that the pope was induced
                    to grant a bull for the erection of a university at St Andrews. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Poetical Remains</hi> of James I. were first published in 1783,
                    edited by William Tytler. The principal poems of which he is the reputed author
                    are <hi rend="italic">The King's fluair, Christis Kirk on the Grene,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Peblis to the Play,</hi> and he also wrote several minor
                    pieces. A manuscript of the <hi rend="italic">King's Q</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">uair</hi> formerly belonging to Selden is
                    preserved in the Bodleian library at Oxford. The poem, which *is divided into
                    seven cantos, and is written in the seven-lined stanzas of Chaucer, was composed
                    during his captivity in England, to celebrate his love for the lady whom he
                    afterwards married. It is allegorical in form and somewhat tedious in its minute
                    description of details, but always preserves a smooth and harmonious
                    versification, while it contains many finely imaginative passages inspired by
                    true and tender feeling, and characterized by a charming simplicity and grace
                    akin to those of his master Chaucer. One reason why many have doubted that James
                    could be the author of <hi rend="italic">Christis Kirk on the Grene</hi> is its
                    entire dissimilarity in manner and style to the <hi rend="italic">King's
                    Quair.</hi> Pope’s line, “A Scot will fight for Christ’s Kirk o’ the Green” is
                    sarcastic, but undoubtedly chronicles a fact. The poem is a humorous delineation
                    of a phase of Scotch rustic life, and its spirit and graphic vigour are not
                    unworthy of Burns, who indeed has received from it more than one suggestive
                    hint, and in <hi rend="italic">The Holy Fair</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
                    Ordination</hi> has imitated its refrain. The oldest evidence for assigning it
                    to James I. is that of the Bannatyne MS. collection made by George Bannatyne in
                    1568; and, if this evidence is not conclusive for James I., it is so against
                    Janies V., the only other probable author. There is no printed edition earlier
                    than 1663. Since then several separate editions have appeared, and it has also
                    been printed along with <hi rend="italic">The Gaberlunzie Man</hi> as the work
                    of James V. That James I. was the author of the poem receives a certain amount
                    of corroboration from its resemblance in subject and style to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peblis to the Play,</hi> the first words of which are quoted by John Major in
                    describing a ballad which he attributes to James.</p>
                <p>The contemporary authorities on the reign of James I. are principally Wyntoun’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Crοηykil,</hi> and Bower’s continuation of Fordun’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Scοtοchrοnicοn.</hi> To the succeeding century belong the
                    histories of John Major, Hector Boece,, and Bishop Lesley. The modern histories
                    of Pinkerton, Tytler, and Burton are of course well known. In regard to
                    questions connected with his character as an author, see Sibbald’s <hi
