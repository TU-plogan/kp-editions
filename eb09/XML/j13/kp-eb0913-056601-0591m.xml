                    published in 1640, is a work in three folio volumes. The first of these is
                    devoted to an historical exposition of the Pelagian and Massilian
                    (semi-Pelagian) heresies; the second sets forth the Augustinian doctrine as to
                    the state of innocence and the fallen state; while the third treats, in ten
                    books, of the grace of Christ the Saviour. The sting of the work is to be found
                    mainly in the epilogue, which draws a parallel, in various particulars, between
                    the errors of the Massilians and those “recentiorum quorundam,” the Jesuits
                    being referred to. Its bearing upon previous controversy had become well known
                    long before its publication; and while it was still in the press at Louvain
                    strenuous efforts were made by the Jesuit party there, through the papal
                    internuncio, to induce the university to prohibit its appearance, on the ground
                    that various popes had forbidden that anything should be written on the delicate
                    subject of the grace of God without express papal permission. These efforts not
                    only failed to attain their immediate object, but had the effect of greatly
                    stimulating public interest in the <hi rend="italic">Augustinus</hi> when it
                    appeared; and as soon as it arrived in Paris it was forthwith reprinted with the
                    written approval of six of the most eminent doctors of the faculty of theology
                    there. In 1641 the reading of the book, thus flung into the arena of theological
                    controversy and ecclesiastical intrigue, was prohibited by the Inquisition; no
                    opinion, however, was pronounced as to its doctrine, and the counter-agitation
                    of the Jesuits in relation to it was condemned as inconsistent with the spirit
                    of the papal injunctions already referred to. But the dispute did not admit of
                    being thus quietly repressed, and accordingly, in 1643, the bull <hi
                    rend="italic">In emiηeιιti</hi> of Urban VIII. was published, renewing and
                    confirming the constitutions of Pius V. and Gregory XIII., as well as the
                    decrees of Paul V. and of himself, and forbidding the reading of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Augustinus,</hi> not only on the ground that its appearance had
                    not been sanctioned, but also because it contained various errors. This bull
                    encountered a very general resistance in the Netherlands, on the part both of
                    the university of Louvain and of the clergy at large; but ultimately, through
                    the intervention of the Spanish Government, it was accepted (1651), subscription
                    to it, however, not being insisted on. At the Sorbonne also it was badly
                    received, and the dissatisfaction it had caused in France found expression in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Apology for Jansen</hi> by Arnauld in 1644, which was
                    followed by a second in 1645. The strength of these <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apologies</hi> lying largely in the fact that no particular doctrines of
                    Jansenius had been condemned as heretical in the papal bull, the Jesuits,
                    inflexible in their determination to secure the effectual condemnation of a book
                    which told so powerfully against their distinctive theology, immediately set
                    about obviating this weakness in their attack, and various attempts were
                    accordingly made to formulate, in the shape of definite propositions, the heresy
                    which they believed to exist. In 1646 eight such propositions were stated by
                    Habert, “théologal” of Notre Dame, to be submitted to the judgment of the pope;
                    subsequent successive adjustments reduced them in 1650 to five, which in the
                    name of eighty-five French prelates were forwarded for condemnation to Rome.
                    They were as follows :—(1) There are some commandments<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n592/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0592-0567"/> of God which just men, although willing and
                    anxious to obey them, are unable with the strength they have to fulfil, and the
                    grace by which they might fulfil them is also wanting to them; (2) in the state
                    of fallen nature inward grace is never resisted; (3) in the fallen state merit
                    and demerit do not depend on a liberty which excludes necessity, but on a
                    liberty which excludes constraint; (4) the semi-Pelagians admitted the necessity
                    of an inward prevenient grace for the performance of each particular act, and
                    also for the first act of faith, and yet were heretical inasmuch as they
                    maintained that this grace was of such a nature that the will of man was able
                    either to resist or obey it; (5) it is semi-Pelagian to say that Christ died or
                    shed His blood for all men without exception. The pope long resisted the
                    pressure with which he was urged to pronounce upon these theses in an adverse
                    sense; it is easy to understand why he should steadily have inclined to the old
                    and simple expedient of enjoining silence upon disputants on either side of the
                    controversy; for, if the Jansenist propositions had a Calvinistic ring about
                    them, there was no denying that they also admitted of au Augustinian and
                    therefore presumably of au orthodox interpretation. At length, however (May
                    1653), Innocent X. in the bull entitled <hi rend="italic">Cum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">occasione impressionis libri</hi> pronounced the first four points
                    heretical, while the fifth was declared to be false, with the addition that, if
                    it was intended to convey the meaning that Christ died only for the elect, it
                    was impious and blasphemous as well as heretical. This bull was accepted and
                    promulgated in France and the Netherlands with the royal consent, and the
                    victory of the Jesuits was quite decisive. The Jansenists still seemed indeed to
                    have one line of defence left to them; they expressed themselves willing to
                    condemn the five propositions in their heretical sense, but not as propositions
                    of Jansen. This position, however, ceased to be tenable when, in September 1654,
                    the pope declared that the propositions were found in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Augustinus</hi> of Jansen, and that their condemnation, as doctrines of Jansen,
                    was imperative. Arnauld nevertheless, with whom were the other Port Royalists
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Port Royal),</hi> refused to yield. In the second of
                    his “Letters” to a person of quality (the Due de Luines), he argued that, while
                    the Holy See had authority to decide with respect to doctrine, and every good
                    Catholic owed submission not only “de respect” but also “de croyance” to such
                    determinations, yet it might be mistaken on the question of “fact” whether a
                    given book contained certain statements or not. The commotion which ensued
                    called forth in January 1656 the first and second of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Provincial Letters</hi> of Pascal, but these brilliant controversial efforts
                    did not suffice to avert the expulsion of Arnauld from the Sorbonne (31st
                    January 1656). In the following year the theological faculty of Paris drew up a
                    formula avowing full acceptance of the bull of Alexander VIL, in which it had
                    been specifically declared that the five propositions contained <hi
                    rend="italic">de facto</hi> Jansenist error. This document, sanctioned by the
                    king in 1661, the clergy and all inmates of conventual establishments were
                    called upon to sign, all who refused being treated as heretics. The leading
                    Jansenists were compelled to go into hiding, and the nuns of Port Royal were
                    subjected to imprisonment and other harsh treatment. Many of the clergy, with
                    whom were four bishops, persisted in their refusal to sign, until at last, in
                    September 1668, the compromise called the “peace of Clement IX.” was arranged,
                    in virtue of which, by the omission of a single word (“purement”), assent was no
                    longer required to the proposition that Jansen had actually taught the five
                    propositions in a “purely” heretical sense. The respite from controversy and
                    persecution thus secured was not of long duration. The Jesuits were quite unable
                    to make a moderate use of the power of which they were now so fully ascertained.
                    Arnauld was driven into Holland, where he found congenial society and apt
                    disciples in Catholic circles, and particularly at Delft. In 1705 a bull was
                    obtained from Clement XL in which the heretical character of Jansen’s teaching,
                    in Jansen’s sense, was authoritatively asserted, and thus the peace of Clement
                    IX. was destroyed. This measure ultimately led, in 1710, not only to the
                    breaking up of the establishment at Port Royal, but also to the destruction of
                    the very buildings. Louis XIV. was further induced to approach the pope for a
                    decision upon the doctrine contained in Quesnel’s <hi rend="italic">Deflexions
                    morales</hi><hi rend="italic">sur le</hi><hi rend="italic">Nouveau
                    Testament,</hi> a work of practical edification, which, published in 1693—94,
                    had attained great popularity in France, and been recommended by many bishops,
                    including the cardinal-archbishop of Paris, De Noailles, but was suspected of
                    latent Jansenism. In this way the bull <hi rend="italic">Unigenitus</hi> (1713)
                    was obtained, in which no fewer than one hundred and one propositions taken from
                    Quesnel were condemned as erroneous and heretical. The result was to divide the
                    French Church into two parties, the acceptants or constitutionists, and the
                    appellants or anti-constitutionists; but again the Jesuit influence was able to
                    secure the ultimate defeat (1728) of Nôailles and his party, and in 1730 the
                    bull was formally registered as the law of the kingdom. Oppressed Jansenism now
                    changed its method of defence. Reports of miracles wrought in the cemetery of St
                    Medard, Paris, at the grave of François de Paris, a young Jansenist deacon who
                    had died in 1727, began to be circulated; and the spot became a pilgrimage
                    centre daily visited by thousands of fanatics. It was in vain that the place was
                    walled up (giving occasion to the witty epigram “De par le Roi, défense à Dieu
                    De faire miracle en ce lieu ”); portions of earth which had been taken from the
                    grave were equally efficacious, and the number of convulsionary prophets of
                    coming ruin to the state and church continued to increase. Repression by
                    imprisonment and other violent means was vainly attempted; but as the novelty of
                    the movement wore off the excitement gradually died down; and after the middle
                    of the 18th century, the appellants or Jansenists of France ceased to make any
                    figure in the public view. Their cause may be said to have been buried in the
                    grave of François de Paris. In Holland the history of the disciples of Jansen
                    followed a different course. The Catholics there, though steadfastly refusing to
                    be called Jansenists, became deeply imbued with his views; at their head was the
                    archbishop of Utrecht, who on this account was deprived by the pope in 1704. In
                    1723 the chapter there secured the consecration of a successor (which the pope
                    had steadily refused) by an appellant bishop; in similar circumstances bishops
                    were consecrated at Haarlem and Deventer also, and the separatist church thus
                    constituted still subsists, though its members in 1869 were under 6000. Its
                    adherents claim to be disciples of St Augustine and members of the Catholic
                    Church, of which they recognize the pope as the visible head, although they deny
                    his infallibility.</p>
