                    may be classed either (a) according to their material, as in stone or brick,
                    wood, or metal; or (δ) according to their object, to prevent leakage of air,
                    steam, or water, or to transmit force, which may be thrust, pull, or shear; or ’
                    (c) according as they are stationary or moving (“working” in technical
                    language). Many joints, like those of shipplates and boiler-plates, have
                    simultaneously to fulfil both objects mentioned under (δ).</p>
                <p>All <hi rend="italic">stone</hi> joints of any consequence are stationary. It
                    being uneconomical to dress the surfaces of the stones resting on each other
                    smoothly and so as to be accurately flat, a layer of mortar or other cementing
                    material is laid between them. This hardens and serves to transmit the pressure
                    from stone to stone without its being concentrated at the “high places.” If the
                    ingredients of the cement are chosen so that when hard the cement has about the
                    same coefficient of compressibility as that of the stone or brick, the pressure
                    will be nearly uniformly distributed. The cement also adheres to the surfaces of
                    the stone or brick, and allows a certain amount of tension to be borne by the
                    joint. It likewise prevents the stones slipping one on the other, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it gives the joint very considerable shearing strength.
                    The composition of the cement is chosen according as it has to “set” in air or
                    water. The joints are made impervious to air or water by “pointing” their outer
                    edges with a superior quality of cement.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wood</hi> joints are also nearly all stationary. Lignum vitae
                    is still used by engineers for the one half of some special working joints, but
                    even in these few instances its use is rapidly dying out. Wood joints are made
                    partially fluid-tight by “grooving and tenoning,” and by “caulking” with oakum
                    or similar material. If the wood is saturated with water, it swells, the edges
                    of the joints press closer together, and the joints become tighter the greater
                    the water-pressure is which tends to produce leakage.</p>
                <p>Relatively to its weaker general strength, wood is a better material than iron so
                    far as regards the transmission of a thrust past a joint. So soon as a heavy
                    pressure comes on the joint all the small irregularities of the surfaces in
                    contact are crushed up, and there results an approximately uniform distribution
                    of the pressure over the whole area <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> if there be no
                    bending forces), so that no part of the material is unduly stressed. To attain
                    this result the abutting surfaces should be well fitted together, and the bolts
                    binding the pieces together should be arranged so as to ensure that they will
                    not interfere with the timber surfaces coming into this close contact.</p>
                <p>Owing to its weak shearing strength on sections parallel to the fibre, timber is
                    peculiarly unfitted for tension joints. If the pieces exerting the pull are
                    simply bolted together with wooden or iron bolts, the joint cannot be trusted to
                    transmit any considerable force with safety. The stresses become intensely
                    localized in the immediate neighbourhood of the bolts. A tolerably strong timber
                    tension-joint can, however, be made by making the two pieces abut, and
                    connecting them by means of iron plates covering the joint and bolted to the
                    sides of the timbers by bolts passing through the wood. These plates should have
                    their surfaces which lie against the wood ribbed in a direction transverse to
                    the pull. The bolts should fit their holes slackly, and should be well tightened
                    up so as to make the ribs sink into the surface of the timber. There will then
                    be very little localized shearing stress brought upon the interior portions of
                    the wood.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Metal Joints.—</hi> Iron and the other commonly used metals
                    possess in variously high degrees the qualities desirable in substances out of
                    which joints are to be made. The joint ends of metal pieces can easily be
                    fashioned to any advantageous form and size without waste of material. Also
                    these metals offer peculiar facilities for the cutting of their surfaces at a

                    over their whole areas of surfaces placed against each other. This is of the
                    highest importance, especially in joints designed to transmit force.</p>

                <p>Wrought iron and mild steel are above all other metals suitable for tension
                    joints where there is not continuous rapid motion. Where such motion occurs, a
                    layer, or, as it is technically termed, a “bush,” of brass is inserted
                    underneath the iron. The joint then possesses the high strength of a wrought
                    iron one and at the same time the good frictional qualities of a brass
                    surface.</p>
                <p>Where the running speed is high and the intensity of pressure can be made small
                    by adopting large bearing surfaces, cast iron is now increasingly preferred for
                    pressure joints. But when, owing to want of space or for other reasons, the
                    bearing surface cannot be made large in proportion to the thrust to be
                    transmitted, gun-metal, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the toughest quality of
                    brass, should be used if the speed be high, and steel if the speed be small.</p>
                <p>Leakage past moving metal joints can be prevented by cutting the surfaces very
                    accurately to fit each other. Steam-engine slide-valves and their seats, and
                    piston “packing-rings” and the cylinders they work to and fro in, may be cited
                    as examples. A subsidiary compressible “packing” is in other situations
                    employed, an instance of which may be seen in the “stuffing boxes” which prevent
                    the escape of steam from steam-engine cylinders through the piston-rod hole in
                    the cylinder cover.</p>
                <p>Fixed metal joints are made fluid tight—(a) by caulking a rivetted joint, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> by hammering in the edge of the metal with a
                    square-edged chisel (the tighter the joint requires to be against leakage the
                    closer must be the spacing of the rivets—compare the rivet-spacing in bridge,
                    ship, and boiler-plate joints); (&amp;) by the insertion between the surfaces of
                    a layer of one or other of various kinds of cement, the layer being thick or
                    thin according to circumstances; (c) by the insertion of a layer of soft solid
                    substance called “packing” or “insertion.” A special kind of indiarubber and
                    canvas sheet is prepared for this purpose. A very effective species of
                    “insertion” is thin copper gauze. Sometimes a single round of thick copper wire
                    laid in opposite grooves cut on joint-surfaces serves the purpose.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Principles of the Strength of Joints.—</hi> The conditions
                    of strength of cemented and glued joints are too obvious to require description.
                    It may, however, be mentioned that in most cases the joint is stronger the
                    thinner the layer of cementing material interposed between the surfaces.</p>
                <p>Nearly all other joints are formed by cutting one or more holes in the ends of
                    the pieces to be joined, and inserting in these holes a corresponding number of
                    pins. The word “pin” is technically restricted to mean a cylindrical pin in a
                    movable joint. The word “bolt” is used when the cylindrical pin is screwed up
                    tight with a nut so as to be immovable. When the pin is not screwed, but is
                    fastened by being beaten down on either end, it is called a “rivet.” The pin is
                    sometimes rectangular in section, and tapered or parallel lengthwise. “Gibs” and
                    “cottars” are examples of the latter. It is very rarely the case that fixed
                    joints have their pins subject to simple compression in the direction of their
                    length. They are, however, frequently subject to simple tension in that
                    direction. A good example is the joint between a steam cylinder and its cover.
                    Here the bolts have to resist the whole thrust of the steam, and at the same
                    time to keep the joint steam-tight.</p>
                <p>If D be the cylinder diameter, <hi rend="italic">ί</hi> the thickness of the
                    flange of the cover, and <hi rend="italic">η</hi> the number of bolts used, it
                    can be shown that the amount the flange rises between the bolts by bending is
                    proportional to &gt; where <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is the steam pressure per
                    unit area. If the same degree of tightness be desired for all sizes of
                    cylinders, this deflexion should be the same for all. The spacing of the bolts
                    is proportional to — , and, therefore, we should have the spacing oc <hi
                    rend="italic">flp~i.</hi> If then the total bolt area is made proportional to
                    the total steam pressure, it would follow that the diameter of bolt α p&lt;h⅛⅛.
                    Again, if <hi rend="italic">t</hi> were reckoned in accordance with the shearing
                    force of the steam on the circular section of the cover at the circumference of
                    the cylinder, <hi rend="italic">ι.e., texpD,</hi> we would have spacing α p⅛1,
                    and bolt diam. « p⅛l,</p>
                <p>For reasons connected with technical difficulties in the foundry, <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> is made larger in proportion to D than this rule indicates
                    for the smaller sizes of cylinders; and, therefore, the spacing and the bolt
                    diameter are not made to increase quite so rapidly as the ∣ and g powers of
                    D.</p>
                <p>No moving joints have their pins exposed to simple stress on sections transverse
                    to the pins’ axes. The pins of such joints have these transverse sections
                    subjected to shearing and bending stresses, and the sections parallel to the pin
                    axes to compressive stress.</p>
                <p>The simplest case by which the subject can be illustrated is that in which a
                    cylindrical pin passes through the ends of two links—one forked, and the other
                    simple and lying between the branches of the fork of the other.</p>
                <p>Let the accompanying diagram represent the end of the unforked link. The width of
                    the link parallel to CC' is taken as unity, and the letters on the figure
                    indicate the ratios of the respective dimensions to this width. Let <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> represent the ratio of the thickness, perpendicular to the
                    paper, of the “eye” to the thickness in the same direction of the main body of
                    the link at D. Let also /be the intensity of uniform tensive stress on the
                    section at D. Evidently no pressure comes on the under side of the pin below
                    CC'. The whole pull at D is passed round half on each side of the pin, and is
                    delivered to the upper side of the pin, on which it produces compression. Since
                    the side sections <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> through which the pull passes, lie
                    out of the direct line of that pull, the stress is much higher on the parts of
                    these sections towards the centre line DD' than on those further off. The lines
                    of force crowd as close as possible together near the surface of the pin, i.e.,
                    towards the main line DD' of the pull. In other words, the inequality of stress
                    is occasioned by the bending moments due to the centre of force not passing
                    through the centres of gravity of area of the sections. The inequality begins at
                    the root of the widening out of the link to form the eye, and reaches its
                    maximum at CC'.</p>
                <p>The bending moment at CC' and the stress caused by it at the edge of the section
                    can be found by the help of the ordinary theory of elasticity. The best method
                    of doing so is to calculate the amount by which the portion of the eye below CC'
                    is bent by the forces applied to it. In the equations the bending moment at CC'
                    is inserted as an unknown quantity. The section on DD' remaining unmoved, each
                    element of the linear deflexion is resolved parallel to CC', and the integral
                    from DD' up to CC' of all these components parallel to CC' is equated to zero,
                    the resultant deflexion at C in the direction of <hi rend="smallcaps">CC</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript smallcaps"> λ</hi> being evidently nil. This equation gives
                    value of the bending moment at CC', and from it the correspond stress is
                    obtained.</p>
                <p>If the section at D be rectangular, as also that at CC', then the average tensive
                    stress on <hi rend="italic">t</hi> is</p>
                <p>∙^^ <hi rend="superscript"> x</hi> ∙⅛ ’</p>
                <p>and the extra stress caused at the edge of the section by the bending moment

                <p>The total maximum stress is, therefore, <hi rend="superscript"> z+r</hi> ⅛d <hi

                <p>In working joints the frictional resistance to rotation throws more than half the

                <p>The stresses on the portion of the eye lying above CC' are complicated by the

                    and the joint a motionless one. It increases from zero at CC' to a maximum at
                    the line DD'. At this point the intensity of the surface pressure is, according
                    to an approximate theoretic estimate, about A, or 1∣ τr times greater than if
                    the whole pull were evenly distributed over the projection on CC' of the upper
                    half surface of the pin. It has often been fallaciously imagined that the
                    central section i <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is exposed to severe shearing
                    stress. From the symmetry of the case, however, it is evident that on this
                    section’the shear is zero. The maximum shear occurs on a section nearly parallel
                    to DD', and somewhat less than ⅜&lt;Z distant from DD'. The exact position of
                    this section of maximum shear depends upon the dimension-ratio <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> which is
                    usually made considerably greater than <hi rend="italic">t.</hi></p>
                <p>The pin surface pressure has transverse components parallel to CC', which produce
                    tension and a bending moment on the section <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> A theoretical
                    approximation to this bursting pressure is A <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> or
                    about 7Γ</p>
                <p>⅛, of the whole pull exerted by the link, and the line of the resultant (parallel
                    to CC') is situated ⅜d distant from the centre of the pin. A small portion of
                    this is borne by the central section on DD' of the main part of the link below
                    CC', but by far the larger part is borne by the section marked <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> If it were

                <p>thrown on this section due to—first, the resultant of the pin-surface-o
                    pressure-components parallel to DD', which lies at — <hi rend="italic">d,</hi>
                    or about 3π</p>
                <p>⅜tζ from the line DD'; and, second, the stress at the section CC'. Adding all
                    these together, there is obtained an approximation to the actual tension
                    parallel to CC' on the lower edge of the section i <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>,
                    namely,</p>

                <p>The shearing and bending stresses upon the pin itself depend upon whether one of
                    the links is forked or both are simple; and also greatly upon the exactitude
                    with which the pin fits the holes.</p>
                <p>When the link exerts a thrust instead of a pull through the joint, a similar
                    investigation of the state of stress may be made.</p>
                <p>A couple of plates joined together by a single row of rivets may, so far as
                    concerns the sections lying between the rivets, be looked upon as a number of
                    flat links laid side by side with their eyes of equal width with the body of the
                    link.</p>
                <p>We may therefore apply the first of the above equations for∕+∕" to find the
                    stress close to the rivets on the section coinciding with the line of the
                    rivets. To adapt the formula to this case, it is only necessary to put 6=1 and Z
                    = ⅜( 1 <hi rend="italic">-d).</hi> The formula thus derived, however, gives
                    results probably considerably higher than those actually occurring, because of
                    the strips into which the plate has been supposed to be divided, acting on each
                    other in such a way as to produce bending moments partly neutralizing the above
                    increase of stress.</p>
                <p>The strip of metal between the rivets and the edge of the plate is in the
                    condition of a continuous beam supported by tbe rivets. The maximum moment
                    occurs just over the rivets, and is nearly the same as if the load were
                    uniformly distributed over the length of the beam. If i <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> be the ratio to the rivet-spacing of the distance of the edge of the
                    plate to the rivet hole, the supposition of uniformity of distribution of load
                    gives the equation ∕'=∕-A for the maximum stress on a section perpendicular to
                    the plate edge. To rnake∕=∕ it is necessary to make i <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> = <hi rend="smallcaps">λ</hi><hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> v</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">∕o</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> -</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">5 = O∙7.</hi> The edge of the plate will then be amply strong
                    enough to resist the greatest shear to which it is anywhere exposed.</p>
                <p>When there are two or more rows of rivets the investigation of the stress is
                    quite similar to the above.</p>
                <p>In joints where the movement is rapid and continuous, the size of the pin is
                    determined by considerations of durability against wear. The metal wears rapidly
                    if the bearing surfaces are not well lubricated. The lubricant is pressed out
                    from between these surfaces if the intensity of pressure exceeds a limit
                    determined by the character of the lubricant. The size of the pin must be
                    sufficient to prevent this limiting pressure being reached. Even before the oil
                    is wholly squeezed out the friction becomes so great qs to heat the metal
                    surfaces to a high temperature, which hastens the evaporation of the remaining
                    oil. In order to ensure that the temperature may be kept low by the continuous
                    dissipation of the heat generated, some engineers design the bearing surface in
                    proportion to the product of the pressure and the speed, so as to allow a
                    certain area of “conducting surface” for each unit of heat generated per second.
