                <p><label type="entry">JOEL</label>. The second book among the minor prophets is
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">The word of Jehovah that came to Joel the son of
                    Pethuel,</hi> or, as the Septuagint, Latin, Syriac, and other versions read, <hi
                    rend="italic">Bethuel.</hi> Nothing is recorded as to the date or occasion of
                    the prophecy, which presents several peculiarities that aggravate the difficulty
                    always felt in interpreting an ancient book when the historical situation of the
                    author is obscure. Most Hebrew prophecies contain pointed references to the
                    foreign politics and social relations of the nation at the time. In the book of
                    Joel there are only scanty allusions to Phoenicians, Philistines, Egypt, and
                    Edom, couched in terms applicable to very different ages, while the prophet’s
                    own people are exhorted to repentance without specific reference to any of those
                    national sins of which other prophets speak. The occasion of the prophecy,
                    described with great force of rhetoric, is no known historical event, but a
                    plague of locusts, perhaps repeated in successive seasons; and even here there
                    are features in the description which have led many expositors to seek an
                    allegorical interpretation. The most remarkable part of the book is the
                    eschatological picture with which it closes; and the way in which the plague of
                    locusts appears to be taken as foreshadowing the final judgment—the great day or
                    assize of Jehovah, in which Israel’s enemies are destroyed—is so unique as
                    greatly to complicate the exegetical problem. It is not therefore surprising
                    that the most various views are still held as to the date and meaning of the
                    book. Allego rists and literalists still contend over the first and still more
                    over the second chapter, and, while the largest number of recent interpreters
                    accept Credner’s view that the prophecy was written in the reign of Joash of
                    Judah, a rising and powerful school of critics follow the view suggested by
                    Vatke <hi rend="italic">(Bib. Theol.,</hi> p. 462 sg.), and reckon Joel among
                    the post-exile prophets. Other scholars give yet other dates: see the
                    particulars in the elaborate work of Merx, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Prophetie</hi><hi rend="italic">des Joels</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >-und ihre Ausleger,</hi> Halle, 1879. The followers of Credner are literalists;
                    the opposite school of moderns includes some literalists (as Duhm), while others
                    (like Hilgenfeld, and in a modified sense Merx) adopt the old allegorical
                    interpretation which treats the locusts as a figure for the enemies of
                    Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>The reasons for placing Joel either earlieι or later than the great series of
                    prophets extending from the time when Amos first proclaimed the approach of the
                    Assyrian down to the Babylonian exile are cogent. In Joel the enemies of Israel
                    are the nations collectively, and among those specified by name neither Assyria
                    nor Chaldaea finds a place. This circumstance might, if it stood alone, be
                    explained by placing Joel with Zephaniah in the brief interval between the
                    decline of the empire of Nineveh and the advance of the Babylonians. But it is
                    further obvious that Joel has no part in the internal struggle between spiritual
                    Jehovah-worship and idolatry which occupied all the prophets from Amos to the
                    captivity. He presupposes a nation of Jehovah-worshippers, whose religion has
                    its centre in the temple and priesthood of Zion, which is indeed conscious of
                    sin, and needs forgiveness and an outpouring of the Spirit, but is not visibly
                    divided, as the kingdom of Judah was, between the adherents of spiritual
                    prophecy and a party whose national worship of Jehovah involved for them no
                    fundamental separation from the surrounding nations. The book, therefore, must
                    have been written before the ethico-spiritual and the popular conceptions of
                    Jehovah came into conscious antagonism, or else after the fall of the state and
                    the restoration of the community c√ Jerusalem to religious rather than political
                    existence had decided the contest in favour of the prophets, and of the Law in
                    which their, teaching was ultimately crystallized.</p>
                <p>The considerations which have given currency to an early date for' Joel are of
                    various kinds. The absence of all mention of one great oppressing world-power
                    seems most natural before the westward march of Assyria involved Israel in the
                    general politics of Asia. The purity of the style is also urged, and a
                    comparison of Amos i. 2, Joel iii. 16 (Heb.,iv. 16), and Amos ix. 13, Joel iii.
                    18 (iv. 18), has been taken as proving that Amos knew our book. The last
                    argument might be inverted with much greater probability, and numerous points of
                    contact between Joel and other parts of the Old Testament <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g.,</hi> Joel ii. 2, Exod. x. 14; Joel ii. 3, Ezek. xxxvi. 35; Joel iii. 10,
                    Mic. iv. 3) make it not incredible that the purity of his style—which is rather
                    elegant than original and strongly marked—is in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n738/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0738-0705"/> large measure the fruit of literary culture. The
                    absence of allusion to a hostile or oppressing empire may be fairly taken in
                    connexion with the fact that the prophecy gives no indication of political life
                    at Jerusalem. When the whole people is mustered in chap, i., the elders or
                    sheikhs of the municipality and the priests of the temple are the most prominent
                    figures. The king is not mentioned,— which on Credner’s view is explained by
                    assuming that the plague fell in the minority of Joash, when the priest Jehoiada
                    held the reins of power,—and the princes, councillors, and warriors necessary to
                    an independent state, and so often referred to by the prophets before the exile,
                    are altogether lacking. The nation has only a municipal organization with a
                    priestly aristocracy, precisely the state of things that prevailed under the
                    Persian empire. That the Persians do not appear as enemies of Jehovah and His
                    people is perfectly natural. They were hard masters but not invaders, and under
                    them the enemies of the Jews were their neighbours, just as appears in
                    Joel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On the Authorized
                    Version of ii. 17 it appears that subjection to a foreign power is not a present
                    fact but a thing feared. But the parallelism and ver. 19 justify the now
                    prevalent rendering, “that the heathen should make a mock of them.”</p></note>
                    Those, however, who place our prophet in the minority of King Joash draw a
                    special argument from the mention of Phoenicians, Philistines, and Edomites
                    (iii. 4 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> 19), pointing to the revolt of Edom under
                    Joram (2 Kings viii. 20) and the incursion of the Philistines in the same reign
                    (2 Chron. xxi. 16, xxii. 1). These were recent events in the time of Joash, and
                    in like manner the Phoenician slave trade in Jewish children is carried back to
                    an early date by the reference in Amos L 9. This argument is rather specious
                    than sound. Edom’s hostility to Judah was incessant, but the feud reached its
                    full intensity only after the time of Deuteronomy (xxiii. 7), when the Edomites
                    joined the Chaldaeans, drew profit from the overthrow of the Jews, whose land
                    they partly occupied, and exercised barbarous cruelty towards the fugitives of
                    Jerusalem (Obad. <hi rend="italic">passim;</hi> Mai. i. 2 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.;</hi> Isa. lxiii.). The offence of shedding innocent blood charged on them
                    by Joel is natural after these events, but hardly so in connexion with the
                    revolt against Joram.</p>
                <p>As regards the Philistines, it is impossible to lay much weight on the statement
                    of Chronicles, unsupported as it is by the older history, and in Joel the
                    Philistines plainly stand in one category with the Phoenicians, as slave
                    dealers, not as armed foes. Gaza in fact was a slave emporium as early as the
                    time of Amos (i. 6), and continued so till Roman times.</p>
                <p>Thus, if any inference as to date can be drawn from chap, iii., it must rest on
                    special features of the trade in slaves, which was always an important part of
                    the commerce of the Levant. In the time of Amos the slaves collected by
                    Philistines and Tyrians were sold <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >masse</hi> to Edom, and presumably went to Egypt or Arabia. Joel complains that
                    they were sold to the Grecians (Javan, Ionians).<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The hypothesis of an Arabian Javan, applied

                    and Syrian slaves were exported to the Mediterranean coasts from a very early
                    date, and Isa. xi. 11 already speaks of Israelites captive in these districts as
                    well as in Egypt, Ethiopia, and the East. But the traffic in this direction
                    hardly became extensive till a later date. In Deut, xxviii. 68 Egypt is still
                    the chief goal of the maritime slave trade, and in Ezek. xxvii. 13 Javan exports
                    slaves to Tyre, not conversely. Thus the allusion to Javan in Joel better suits
                    a later date, when Syrian slaves were in special request in Greece.<note

                    part of the Old Testament certainly older than Ezekiel. In Joel it seems to
                    stand as a general representative of the distant countries reached by the
                    Mediterranean (in contrast with the southern Arabians, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sabaeans,</hi> chap. iii. 8), the furthest nation reached by the fleets of the
                    Red Sea. This is precisely the geographical standpoint of the post-exile author
                    of Gen. X. 4, where Javan includes Carthage and Tartessus.</p>
                <p>Finally, the allusion to Egypt in Joel iii. 19 must on Credner’s theory be
                    explained of the invasion of Shishak a century before Joash. From this time down
                    to the last period of the Hebrew monarchy Egypt was not the enemy of Judah.</p>
                <p>If the arguments chiefly relied on for an early date are so precarious or can
                    even be turned against their inventors, there are others of an unambiguous kind
                    which make for a date in the Persian period. It appears from chap. iii. 1, 2
                    that Joel wrote after the exile. The phrase “to bring again the captivity” would
                    not alone suffice to prove this, for it is used in a wide sense, and perhaps
                    means rather to “reverse the calamity;”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Ewald on Jer. xlviii. 47, and Kuenen, <hi rend="italic"

                    the dispersion of Israel among the nations, and the allotment of the Holy Land
                    to new occupants, cannot fairly be referred to any calamity less than that of
                    the captivity. With this the whole standpoint of the prophecy agrees. To Joel
                    Judah 'and the people of Jehovah are synonyms; northern Israel has disappeared.
                    Now it is true that those who take their view of the history from Chronicles,
                    where the kingdom t&gt;f Ephraim is always treated as a sect outside the true
                    religion, can reconcile this fact with an early date. But in ancient times it
                    was not so; and under Joash, the contemporary of Elisha, such a limitation of
                    the people of Jehovah is wholly inconceivable. The earliest prophetic books have
                    a quite different standpoint; otherwise indeed the books of northern prophets
                    and historians could never have been admitted into the Jewish canon. Again, the
                    significant fact that there is no mention of a king and princes, but only of
                    sheikhs and priests, has a force not to be invalidated by the ingenious
                    reference of the book to the time of Joash’s minority and the supposed regency
                    of Jehoiada.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stade not
                    unreasonably questions whether 2 Kings xii. 1-3 implies the paramount political
                    influence of Jehoiada. <hi rend="italic">Op. cit.,</hi> p. 17.</p></note> And
                    the assumption that there was a period before the prophetic conflicts of the 8th
                    century when spiritual prophecy had unchallenged sway, when there was no gross
                    idolatry or superstition, when the priests of Jerusalem, acting in accord with
                    prophets like Joel, held the same place as heads of a pure worship which they
                    occupied after the exile (comp. Ewald, <hi rend="italic">Propheten,</hi> i. 89),
                    is not consistent with history. It rests on the old theory of the antiquity of
                    the Levitical legislation, so that in fact all who place that legislation later
                    than Ezekiel are agreed that the book of Joel is also late. In this connexion
                    one point deserves special notice. The religious significance of the plague of
                    drought and locusts is expressed in chap. i. 9 in the observation that the daily
                    meat and drink offering are cut off, and the token of new blessing is the
                    restoration of this service, chap. ii. 14. In other words, the daily offering is
                    the continual symbol of gracious intercourse between Jehovah and His people and
                    the main office of religion. This conception, which finds its parallel in Dan.
                    viii. 11, xi. 31, xii. 11, is quite in accordance with the later law. But under
                    the monarchy the daily oblation was the king’s private offering, and not till
                    Ezra’s reformation did it become the affair of the community and the central act
                    of national worship (Neh. x. 33 sÿ.).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Joel wrote not only after the exile but after the work of Ezra and Nehemiah may
                    be viewed as confirmed by the allusions to the walls of Jerusalem in chap. ii.
                    7, 9. Such is the historical basis which we seem to be able to lay for the study
                    of the exegetical problems of the book.</p>
                <p>The style of Joel is clear, and his language presents little difficulty beyond
                    the occurrence of several unique words, which in part may very well be due to
                    errors of the text.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n739/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0739-0706"/>
                <p>But the structure of the book, the symbolism, and the connexion of the prophet’s
                    thoughts have given rise to much controversy. It seems safest to start from the
                    fact that the prophecy is divided into two well-marked sections by chap. ii. 18,
                    19a. According to the Massoretic vocalization, which is in harmony with the most
                    ancient exegetical tradition as contained in the LXX., these words are
                    historical: “Then the Lord was jealous, . . . and answered and said unto his
                    people, Behold,” &amp;c. Such is the natural meaning of the words as pointed,
                    and the proposal of Merx to change the pointing so as to transform the perfects
                    into futures, and make the priests pray that Jehovah will answer and deliver the
                    gracious promises that fill the rest of the book, is an exegetical monstrosity
                    not likely to find adherents.</p>
                <p>Thus ths book falls into two parts. In the first the prophet speaks in his own
                    name, addressing himself to the people in a lively description of a present
                    calamity caused by a terrible plague of locusts which threatens the entire
                    destruction of the country, and appears to be the vehicle of a final consuming
                    judgment (the day of Jehovah). There is no hope save in repentance and prayer;
                    and in chap. ii. 12 the prophet, speaking now for the first time in Jehovah’s
                    name, calls the people to a solemn fast at the sanctuary, and invites the
                    intercession of the priests. The calamity is described in the strongest colours
                    of Hebrew hyperbole, and it seems arbitrary to seek too literal atι
                    interpretation of details, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> to lay weight on the
                    four names of locusts, or to take chap. i. 20 of a conflagration produced by
                    drought, when it appears from ii. 3 that the ravages of the locusts themselves
                    are compared to those of fire. But when due allowance is made for Eastern
                    rhetoric, there is no occasion to seek in this section anything else than
                    literal locusts. Nay, the allegorical interpretation, which takes the locusts to
                    be hostile invaders, breaks through the laws of all reasonable writing; for the
                    poetical hyperbole which compares the invading swarms to an army (ii. 4 βg <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>.) would be inconceivably lame if a literal army was
                    already concealed under the figure of the locusts. Nor could the prophet so far
                    forget himself in his allegory as to speak of a victorious host as entering the
                    conquered city like a thief (ii. 9). The second part of the book is Jehovah’s
                    answer to the people’s prayer. The answer begins with a promise of deliverance
                    from famine, and of fruitful seasons compensating for the ravages of the
                    locusts. In the new prosperity of the land the union of Jehovah and His people
                    shall be sealed anew, and so the Lord will proceed to pour down further and
                    higher blessings. The aspiration of Moses (Num. xi. 29) and the hope of earlier
                    prophets (Isa. xxxii. 15, lix. 21; comp. Jer. xxxi. 33) shall be fully realized
                    in the outpouring of the Spirit on all the Jews and even upon their servants
                    (compare Isa. lxi. 5 with lvi. 6, 7); and then the great day of judgment, which
                    had seemed to overshadow Jerusalem in the now averted plague, shall draw near
                    with awful tokens of blood and fire and darkness. But the terrors of that day
                    are not for the Jews but for their enemies. The worshippers of Jehovah on Zion
                    shall be delivered (comp. Obad. ver. 17, whose words Joel expressly quotes in
                    chap. ii. 32), and it is their heathen enemies, assembled before Jerusalem to
                    war against Jehovah, who shall be mowed down in the valley of Jehoshaphat <hi
                    rend="italic">(Jehovah judgetK)</hi> by no human arm but by heavenly warriors.
                    Thus definitively freed from the profane foot of the stranger (comp. Isa. lii.
                    1), Jerusalem shall abide a holy city for ever. The fertility of the land shall
                    be such as was long ago predicted in Amos ix. 13, and streams issuing from the
                    temple, as Ezekiel had described in his picture of the restored Jerusalem (Ezek.
                    xlvii,), shall fertilize the barren Wâdy of Acacias. Egypt and Edom, on the
                    other hand, shall be desolate, because they have shed the blood of Jehovah’s
                    innocents. Compare the similar predictions against Edom, Isa. xxxiv. 9 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.</hi> (Mai. i. 3), and against Egypt, Isa. xix. 5 <hi
                    rend="italic">eq.,</hi> Ezek. xxix. Joel’s eschatological picture appears indeed
                    to be largely a combination of elements from older unfulfilled prophecies. Its
                    central feature, the assembling of the nations to judgment, is already found in
                    Zeph. iii. 8, and in Ezekiel’s prophecy concerning Gog and Magog, where the
                    wonders of fire and blood named in Joel ii. 30 are also mentioned (Ez. xxxviii.
                    22). The other physical features of the great day, the darkening of the lights
                    of heaven, are a standing figure of the prophets from Amos v. 6, viii. 9,
                    downwards. It is characteristic of the prophetic eschatology that images
                    suggested by one prophet are adopted by his successors, and gradually become
                    part of the permanent scenery of the last times; and it is a proof of the late
                    date of Joel that almost his whole picture is made up of such features. In this
                    respect there is a close parallelism, extending to minor details, between Joel
                    and the last chapters of Zechariah.</p>
                <p>That Joel’s delineation of the final deliverance and glory attaches itself
                    directly to the deliverance of the nation from a present calamity is quite in
                    the manner of the so-called prophetic perspective. But the fact that the
                    calamity which bulks so largely is natural and not political is characteristic
                    of the post-exile period. Other prophets of the same age speak much of dearth
                    and failure of crops, which in Palestine then as now were aggravated by bad
                    government, and were far more serious to a small and isolated community than
                    they could ever have been to the old kingdom. It was indeed by no means
                    impossible that Jerusalem might have been altogether undone by the famine caused
                    by the locusts; and so the conception of these visitants as the destroying army,
                    executing Jehovah’s final judgment, is really much more natural than appears to
                    us at first sight, and does not need to be explained away by allegory. The chief
                    argument relied upon by those who still find allegory at least in chap. ii. is
                    the expression '3DÏH, “the Northener,” in ii. 20. In view of the other points of
                    affinity between Joel and Ezekiel, this word inevitably suggests Gog and Magog,
                    and it is difficult to see how a swarm of locusts could receive such a name, or
                    if they came from the north could perish, as the verse puts it, in the desert
                    between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. The verse remains a <hi
                    rend="italic">crux</hi><hi rend="italic">interpretum,</hi> and no exegesis
                    hitherto given can be deemed thoroughly satisfactory; but the interpretation of
                    the whole book must not be made to hinge on a single word in a verse which might
                    be altogether removed without affecting the general course of the prophet’s
                    argument.</p>
                <p>The whole verse is perhaps the addition of an allegorizing glossator. The
                    prediction in ver. 19, that the seasons shall henceforth be fruitful, is given
                    after Jehovah has shown His zeal and pity for Israel, not of course by mere
                    words, but by acts, as appears in verses 20, 21, where the verbs are properly
                    perfects recording that Jehovah hath already done great things, and that
                    vegetation has already revived. In other words, the mercy already experienced in
                    the removal of the plague is taken as a pledge of future grace not to stop short
                    till all God’s old promises are fulfilled. In this context ver. 20 is out of
                    place. Observe also that in ver. 25 the locusts are spoken of in the plain
                    language of chap. i.</p>

                    rend="smallcaps">Hosea.</hi> There are separate commentaries by Credner (Halle,
                    1831), wünsche (Leips., 1872), Merx (Halle, 1879). The last-named gives an
                    elaborate history of interpretation from the Septuagint down to Calvin, and
                    appends the Ethiopie text edited by Dillmann. Of older commentaries the most
                    valuable is Pococke’s (Oxford, 1691). Bochart’s <hi rend="italic"
