                    Christianity became the established religion of Rome.</p>
                <p>Julian lost his mother not many months after he was born. He was only six when
                    his imperial uncle Constantine died; and one of his earliest memories must have
                    been the fearful massacre of his father and kinsfolk, in the interest and more
                    or less at the instigation of the sons of Constantine. Only Julian and his elder
                    brother Gallus were spared, as they were too young to excite the fear or justify
                    the cruelty of the murderers. From this period till his twenty-fifth year Julian
                    passed his life in the closest retirement, jealously watched by the reigning
                    emperor, often under immediate fear of death. He was carefully educated,
                    however, under the supervision of the family eunuch Mardonius, and of Eusebius,
                    bishop of Nicomedia, at Constantinople itself and at various places in Ionia and
                    Bithynia, and afterwards for six years at Macellum, a remote and lonely castle
                    in Cappadocia. He was trained to the profession of the Christian religion; but
                    he became early attracted to the old faith, or rather to the idealized amalgam
                    of paganism and philosophy which was current among his teachers, the
                    rhetoricians. Cut off from all sympathy with the reigning belief by the terrible
                    fate of his family, and with no prospect of a public career, he turned with all
                    the eagerness of an enthusiastic temperament to the literary and philosophic
                    studies of the time. The old Hellenic world had an irresistible attraction for
                    him. Love for its culture was in Julian’s mind intimately associated with
                    loyalty to its religion.</p>
                <p>In the meantime the course of events had left as sole autocrat of the Roman
                    empire his cousin Constantius, who felt himself unequal to the enormous task,
                    and called Julian’s brother Gallus to a share of power. The same turn of affairs
                    brought a great improvement in the condition of J ulian, who was permitted to
                    pursue his studies at Nicomedia. Here he made the acquaintance of some of the
                    most eminent rhetoricians of the time, and here it was that he became confirmed
                    in his secret devotion to the pagan faith. But the downfall of Gallus (354) yet
                    again exposed Julian to the greatest danger. By his rash and headstrong conduct
                    Gallus had incurred the enmity of Constantius and the eunuchs, his' confidential
                    ministers, and was put to death. Julian fell under a like suspicion, and
                    narrowly escaped the same fate. For some months he was confined at Milan, till
                    at the intercession of the empress Eusebia, who always had a kindness for him,
                    he was permitted to retire to Athens (355). The few months he spent here were
                    probably the happiest of his life. Living at the ancient hearth of Grecian
                    culture, and amid the companionship of congenial friends, he found his dearest
                    ambition realized in the enthusiastic study of literature and philosophy.</p>
                <p>But a member of the Roman imperial house could not thus be allowed to escape the
                    public responsibilities connected with his birth. The emperor Constantius and he
                    were now the sole surviving male members of the family of Constantine; and, as
                    the emperor again felt himself oppressed by the cares of government, there was
                    no alternative but to call Julian to his assistance. At the instance of the
                    empress he was summoned to Milan; and there from Constantius, who had been
                    chiefly concerned in the murder of his family, he received the hand of Helena,
                    sister of the emperor, as also the title of Caesar and the government of Gaul.
                    It was with extreme reluctance that Julian entered on his new dignities.
                    Accustomed to a life of quiet study and retirement, he felt timid and awkward in
                    the world of ceremony, suspicion, and intrigue to which he was now introduced,
                    He knew well the danger to which he was exposed from the dark temper of the
                    emperor and the arts of the eunuchs who were all-powerful at the court.</p>
                <p>A task of extreme difficulty also awaited him beyond the Alps. During recent
                    troubles the Alemanni and other German tribes had crossed the Rhine; they had
                    burned Cologne, Treves, Strasburg, and many other flourishing cities, and
                    extended their ravages far into the interior of Gaul. The internal government of
                    the province had also fallen into great confusion. In spite of his inexperience,
                    and by virtue of his native energy and ability, Julian quickly brought affairs
                    into order. He completely overthrew the Alemanni in the great battle of
                    Strasburg (357). The Frankish tribes which had settled on the western bank of
                    the lower Rhine were reduced to submission. Five times in all he crossed the
                    river to overawe the restless tribes beyond. In Gaul he rebuilt the cities which
                    had been laid waste, re-established the administration on a just and secure
                    footing, and as far as possible lightened the taxes, which weighed so heavily on
                    the poor provincials. Paris was the usual residence of Julian during his
                    government of Gaul, and his name has become inseparably associated with the
                    early history of the city.</p>
                <p>The position and reputation of Julian were now established. He was general of a
                    victorious army enthusiastically attached to him, and governor of a province
                    which he had saved from ruin; but he had also become an object of fear and
                    jealousy at the imperial court. It was accordingly <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n802/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0802-0769"/> resolved to weaken his power. A threatened
                    invasion of the Persians was made an excuse for withdrawing some of the best
                    legions from the Gallic army. Julian recognized the covert purpose of this, yet
                    proceeded to fulfil the commands of the emperor. A sudden movement of the
                    legions themselves decided otherwise. At Paris, on the night of the parting
                    banquet, they forced their way into Julian’s tent, and, proclaiming him emperor,
                    offered him the alternative either of accepting the lofty title or of instant
                    death. Julian accepted the empire, and sent an embassy with a deferential
                    message to Constantius. The message being contemptuously disregarded, both sides
                    prepared for a decisive struggle. After a march of unexampled rapidity through
                    the Black Forest and down the Danube, Julian reached Sirmium, and was on the way
                    to Constantinople, when he received news of the death of Constantius at
                    Mompsocrene in Cilicia (361). Without further trouble Julian found himself
                    everywhere acknowledged the sole ruler of the Roman empire.</p>
                <p>Julian had already made a public avowal of paganism, of which he had been a
                    secret adherent from the age of twenty. It was no ordinary profession, but the
                    expression of a strong and even enthusiastic conviction; the restoration of the
                    pagan worship was to be the great aim and controlling principle of his
                    government. His reign was too short to show what precise form the pagan revival
                    might ultimately have taken, how far his feelings might have become embittered
                    by his conflict with the Christian faith, whether persecution, violence, and
                    civil war might not have taken the place of the moral suasion which was the
                    method he originally affected. He issued an edict of universal toleration; but
                    in many respects he used his imperial influence unfairly to advance the work of
                    restoration. In order to deprive the Christians of the advantages of culture,
                    and discredit them as an ignorant sect, he forbade them to teach rhetoric. The
                    symbols of paganism and of the imperial dignity were so artfully interwoven on
                    the standards of the legions that they could not pay the usual homage to the
                    emperor without seeming to offer worship to the gods; and, when the soldiers
                    came forward to receive the customary donative, they were required to throw a
                    handful of incense on the altar. Without directly excluding Christians from the
                    high offices of state, he held that the worshippers of the gods ought to have
                    the preference. In short, though there was no direct persecution, he exerted
                    much more than a moral pressure to restore the power and prestige of the old
                    faith.</p>
                <p>Having spent the winter of 361-2 at Constantinople, Julian proceeded to Antioch
                    to prepare for his great expedition against Persia. His stay there was a curious
                    episode in his life. Strange to say, it is doubtful whether his pagan
                    convictions or his ascetic life, after the fashion of an antique philosopher,
                    gave most offence to the so-called Christians of the dissolute city. They soon
                    grew heartily tired of each other, and Julian took up his winter quarters at
                    Tarsus, from which in early spring he marched against Persia. At the head of a
                    powerful and well-appointed army he advanced through Mesopotamia and Assyria as
                    far ∣as Ctesiphon, near which he crossed the Tigris, in face of a Persian army
                    which he defeated. Misled by the treacherous advice of a Persian nobleman, he
                    desisted from the ∣siege of that great city, and set out to seek the main army
                    lof the enemy under King Sapor. After a long and useless (march into the
                    interior he was forced to retreat, when he 'found himself enveloped and harassed
                    by the whole Persian army, in a waterless and desolate country, and at the
                    hottest season of the year. The Romans repulsed the enemy in many an obstinate
                    battle. In one of these, however, on the 26th of June 363, Julian, who was ever
                    in the front, was mortally wounded. The same night he died in his tent. In the
                    most authentic historian of his reign, Ammianus Marcellinus, we find a noble
                    speech, which, like Socrates in the prison, he is said to have addressed to his
                    afflicted officers. Jovianus was chosen emperor by the army, which was
                    extricated from its perilous situation only by a very disadvantageous
                    treaty.</p>
                <p>From Julian’s unique position as the last champion of a dying polytheism, his
                    character has ever excited interest and been the subject of debate. Authors such
                    as Gregory of Nazianzus have heaped the fiercest anathemas upon him; but a just
                    and sympathetic criticism, like Neander’s, has found many noble qualities in his
                    character and ample excuse for his leanings to a philosophic paganism. In his
                    childhood he had seen his nearest kinsmen massacred by the heads of the new
                    Christian state; till the age of twenty-five he held his life on sufferance, and
                    passed it in obscurity under the most rigid and suspicious surveillance. The
                    only sympathetic friends he met were among the heathen rhetoricians and
                    philosophers; and he found a suitable outlet for his restless and inquiring mind
                    only in the studies of ancient Greece. In this way he was attracted to the old
                    paganism; but it was a paganism idealized by the philosophy of the time, and
                    still further purified by the moral influence of the Christianity which it
                    rejected.</p>
                <p>In other respects Julian was no unworthy successor of the Antonines. Though
                    brought up in a studious and pedantic solitude, he was no sooner called to the
                    government of Gaul than he displayed all the energy, the hardihood, and the
                    practical sagacity of an old Roman. In temperance, self-control, and zeal for
                    the public good, as he understood it, he was unsurpassed. To these Roman
                    qualities he added the culture, literary instincts, and speculative curiosity of
                    a Greek. One of the most remarkable features of his public life was the perfect
                    ease and mastery with which he associated the cares of war and statesmanship
                    with the assiduous cultivation of literature and philosophy. Yet even his
                    devotion to culture was not free from pedantry and dilettantism. His
                    contemporaries observed in him a want of naturalness. He had not the moral
                    health or the composed and reticent manhood of a Roman, or the un-self-conscious
                    spontaneity of a Greek. He could never be at rest; he never could hold his
                    tongue; in the rapid torrent of his conversation he was apt to run himself out
                    of breath; his manner was jerky and spasmodic. He showed quite a deferential
                    regard for the sophists and rhetoricians of the time, and advanced them to high
                    offices of state; there was real cause for fear that he would introduce the
                    government of pedants in the Roman empire. Last of all, his love for the old
                    philosophy was sadly disfigured by his devotion to the old superstitions, and in
                    this respect he little pleased the taste of a judge like Gibbon. He was greatly
                    given to divination; he was noted for the number of his sacrificial victims.
                    Wits applied to him the joke that had been passed on Marcus Aurelius: “The white
                    cattle to Marcus Caesar, greeting. If you conquer, there is an end of us.”</p>
                <p>Julian wrote several works, including—(1) <hi rend="italic">Letters,</hi>
                    eighty-three of which are preserved in the edition of Heyler, Mainz, 1828 (most
                    of these are addressed to men of letters); (2) <hi rend="italic">Orations,</hi>

                    mode of life are jocularly handled. The most important of his works, the Κατά

                    in the refutation by Cyril, latest edition by Neumann, 1881. The best edition of
                    his entire works used to be that of Spanheim, Leipsic, 1696; the most recent is
                    that of Hertlein in the Teubner series, Leipsic, vol. i. in 1875.</p>
                <p>Of the primary sources for Julian’s life and character the most important are his
                    own works; the trustworthy and impartial historian of the period, Ammianus
                    Marcellinus, v. 8-xxv.; the letters and orations of Julian’s much esteemed
                    friend Libanius; and the orations of his severest critic, Gregory of Nazianzus.
