                    September 13, 37, and March 16, 38 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> His early
                    advantages were very considerable. His father Matthias belonged to one of the
                    best priestly families in the city, while on his mother’s side he was descended
                    from Jonathan, the first Hasmonean high priest. The position of his parents
                    procured for him a careful education, and such was his progress (at least if his
                    own account of himself is to be believed) that at the age of fourteen he was
                    often consulted by the high priests and prominent citizens on difficult points
                    of Jewish law. At sixteen he resolved upon an experimental study of the
                    doctrines of the three leading sects, or schools of philosophy, as he prefers to
                    consider them; and, hearing that Banus, a celebrated Essene, was living in the
                    wilderness with the rigorous asceticism of a hermit, he joined him and remained
                    under his teaching for three years. Returning to Jerusalem at the age of
                    nineteen, he definitively joined the Pharisees, to whom he continued ever after
                    to adhere. In 64 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> (aet. 26) he undertook a journey
                    to Rome to intercede for some priests of his acquaintance whom Felix the
                    procurator had sent thither as prisoners to be tried on some trifling charges.
                    Landing safely at Puteoli after a narrow escape from death by shipwreck in the
                    Adriatic, he gained the friendship of Alityrus, a famous Jewish mime of the day,
                    and a favourite of Nero; by this means he not only obtained the pardon of his
                    friends, but was also loaded with many valuable gifts by the empress Poppaea. On
                    reaching Judaea again he found his countrymen bent at all hazards on throwing
                    off the Roman yoke; knowing well the resources of Rome, and the hopelessness of
                    successfully <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0785-0752"/> resisting her power, he (according to his own
                    account, which is not in itself very improbable) did his best to dissuade them
                    from any such attempt. Ultimately, however, after the victory over Cestius
                    Gallus, he yielded to the force of the current, and joined the revolutionary
                    movement in 66, being entrusted with the task of governing and defending the
                    province of Galilee, an appointment for which he was indebted to family
                    influence rather than to any known military skill. Proceeding at once to his
                    province, he set about the execution of plans of political reorganization, at
                    the same time fortifying various military positions, and getting together and
                    drilling an army of 100,000 men. Very soon, however, he had to encounter the
                    opposition of a strong party, headed by John of Giscala, and it was with
                    difficulty that he averted an insurrection at Taricheae, and afterwards saved
                    himself by flight from Tiberias. His enemies actually at one time had succeeded
                    in obtaining his recall; but the act was afterwards cancelled, through the
                    powerful influence he still possessed in Jerusalem. Meanwhile Vespasian had
                    assembled a large force at Antioch, and in the spring of 67 threw a garrison
                    into Sepphoris, whence (the troops of Josephus not waiting his attack) he made
                    himself master of all Lower Galilee. Josephus himself falling back on Tiberias
                    sent for large reinforcements from Jerusalem; these not being forthcoming, he in
                    May shut himself up in Jotopata, the defence of which he maintained against all
                    the efforts of the Romans for forty-seven days. At the end of that period the
                    place was taken by storm, and such of the garrison as had not perished in the
                    siege were put to death by the conquerors. The governor himself demanded to be
                    led into the presence of the general, and, with great adroitness assuming the
                    rôle of a prophet, told his captor that he was no chance prisoner, but had been
                    commissioned by heaven to predict that he was shortly to become the sole head of
                    the Roman empire. The plan was so far successful that the prisoner’s life was
                    spared; Vespasian, however, kept him in close confinement for two years, but on
                    attaining the purple liberatedhim. Thenceforward Josephus assumed the family
                    name of his patron (Flavius). After having accompanied Vespasian to Alexandria,
                    he attended Titus to Palestine, and remained in his train until the close of the
                    war. At the risk of his life he was more than once sent to urge his countrymen
                    to yield, but without success. After the fall of the city he accompanied Titus
                    to Rome, where Vespasian assigned him a residence in what had once been his own
                    house, conferred on him the citizenship*-and gave him a yearly pension, to which
                    was afterwards added an estate in Judaea. Under Titus and Domitian he was
                    confirmed in all his privileges, devoting the peaceful remainder of his days to
                    those literary labours with which his name is now so exclusively associated. The
                    precise date of his death is unknown; he must have survived the first century,
                    for his autobiography mentions the death of Agrippa II., which occurred in 100
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi></p>
                <p>His extant works are the following. (1) <hi rend="italic">History of the Jewish
                    War</hi> (∏epl του ’Ιουδαϊκού <hi rend="italic">πoλiμoυ),</hi> in seven books.
                    It was originally written in Aramaic for the benefit of the Jews dwelling beyond
                    the Euphrates, but was afterwards translated by its author into the Greek, which
                    alone we now possess. Books i.-ii. 14 sketch the whole course of Jewish history
                    from the period of the Maccabees to the beginning of the war. The remainder of
                    the work gives a minute account of the entire struggle from 6δ to its complete
                    suppression in 73 A.n. On its completion the whole work was submitted to
                    Vespasian, Titus, and Agrippa II., who, the author tells us, bore witness to its
                    accuracy. Of its general trustworthiness there can be no reasonable doubt:
                    Josephus had a considerable personal share in much of what he records; and on
                    other points he seems to have had access to direct documentary evidence. The
                    speeches which he reports are not of course to be construed by stricter rules
                    than those which occur in the works of Livy or Thucydides; and apart from this
                    some allowance also must be made for a tendency to exaggeration or false
                    accentuation wherever his vanity judged such a thing to be desirable. (2) <hi
                    rend="italic">Antiquities of the Jews</hi><hi rend="italic">(’Ιουδαϊκή</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">iρχaιoKoyia),</hi> in twenty books, a comprehensive Jewish history
                    from the earliest times down to the outbreak of the war in ,66. It was completed
                    in the thirteenth year of Domitian (93-94 A.D. ), long after the author's own
                    interest in it had exhausted itself. For the first eleven books, covered by the
                    Scripture narrative, his exclusive authority seems to have been the Bible
                    itself, especially the LXX. translation. He frequently, however, omits or
                    modifies points which seemed to him likely to give offence; sometimes he
                    supplements with current traditions or uses the woιks of his predecessors in the
                    same field, Demetrius and Artapanus; and occasionally he gives excerpts from
                    profane writers. The remaining nine books are very unequal in merit. The period
                    between Alexander the Great and the Maccabees is almost an entire blank. For the
                    Maccabean wars (xii. 5-xiii. 7) he had 1 Macc. to draw upon; for the reigns of
                    the later Hasmoneans (xiii. 8-xiv.) he is dependent upon the historians Strabo
                    and Nicolaus of Damascus. The last-named writer is also his chief authority for
                    the portion of his narrative which relates to the times of Herod (xiv.- xvii.),
                    but he appears to have had access to some original memoirs. The last three books
                    (xviii∙-xx.), relating to the times immediately subsequent to the death of
                    Herod, are more meagre than might have been expected, and by the carelessness of
                    their manner bear witness to the author’s confessed fatigue. Book xviii. (chap.
                    iii. sec. 3) contains a remarkable passage relating to Jesus Christ, which is
                    twice cited by Eusebius as genuine <hi rend="italic">(H. B.,</hi> i. 11; <hi
                    rend="italic">Dem. Bv.,</hi> iii. 3, 105-6), and which is met with in all the
                    extant MSS. It is, however, unanimously believed to be, in its present form at
                    least, spurious, and those who contend even for its partial genuineness are
                    decidedly in the minority. (3) <hi rend="italic">Autobiography,</hi> in
                    seventy-six chapters, all of which, however, except the first six and the last
                    two relate to the occurrences in Galilee in which he had so large a share during
                    66-67 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> written in defence of himself against the
                    representations of a certain Justus of Tiberias. His narrative of these events
                    cannot be regarded as an impartial one, and that in some points at least he was
                    led to sacrifice truth to self-interest can be conclusively shown by comparison
                    even with his own earlier work, the <hi rend="italic">History of the Jewish
                    War.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Vita,</hi> which èontains the allusion to the
                    death of Agrippa II., must have been written at a date subsequent to 100 A.m (4)
                    <hi rend="italic">Against</hi><hi rend="italic">Apion,</hi> in two books. This
                    is the .usual but somewhat misleading title of a general apology for Judaism in
                    which the polemic against Apion occupies only a subordinate place. Porphyry
                    cites it by the title Πp0s τoυj "Eλληυαs, while Origen and Eusebius call it ∏∈pl
                    τηs <hi rend="italic">των</hi><hi rend="italic">'Ιουδαίων αρχαιότητας.</hi> The
                    date of its composition is later than that of the <hi rend="italic"

                    5, 6), which is most probably to be identified with the composition elsewhere
                    cited by the title ∏∈pl <hi rend="italic">tθωv κal</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >αίτιων</hi><hi rend="italic">(Ank</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> iv. 8, 4); and

                    rend="italic">(Ant.,</hi> xx. 11, 2). The so-called fourth book of Maccabees has
                    sometimes, but erroneously, been assigned to Josephus. One or two philosophical
                    treatises are also attributed to him by Photius; they are, however, obviously of
                    Christian origin, and most probably are from the pen of Hippolytus of Ostia.</p>
                <p>The Greek text of the works of Josephus was first printed at Basel in 1544. The
                    earliest critical editions were those of Hudson (Oxford, 1720) and Havercamp
                    (Utrecht, 1726); the text of the latter is that given by Oberthür (3 vols. 8vo.,
                    Leipsic, 1782-85) and by hichter (Leipsic, 1826-27). Further emendations occur
                    in the edition of Dindorf (Paris, 1845-47), which is the basis of Bekker <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> s edition (Leipsic, 1855-56). A new edition based
                    upon fresh collation of MSS. is promised by Niese. The treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">Against</hi><hi rend="italic">Apion</hi> was separately edited,
                    with notes, by J. G. Müller, 1877. The translations of Josephus have been very
                    numerous, and his writings are also the basis of the <hi rend="italic">Bellum
                    Judaicum</hi> which bears the name of Egesippus (corrupted from Josippus), and
                    of the mediaeval Hebrew history ascribed to Josippon ben Gorion. For the whole
                    subject, biographical and literary, see Schürer’s <hi rend="italic"
