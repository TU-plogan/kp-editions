                    the historian of the Gothic nation, flourished about the middle of the 6th
                    century of the Christian era.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The evidence of MSS. is overwhelming against the form
                    Jornandes adopted in the two earliest editions. Strictly speaking, the MSS.
                    favour Jordanis; but this seems to be only an incorrect spelling of
                    Jordanes.</p></note> All that we certainly know about his life is contained in
                    three sentences of his history of the Goths (cap. 50), from which, among other
                    particulars as •to the history of his family, we learn that his grandfather
                    Peria was notary to Candac, the chief of a confederation of Alans and other
                    tribes settled during the latter half of the 5th century on the south of the
                    Danube in the provinces which are now Bulgaria and the Dobrudscha. Jordanes
                    himself was a notary until he renounced his worldly calling and took the vows of
                    a monk. This, according to the manner of speaking of that day, is the meaning of
                    his words “ante conversionem meam,” though it is quite possible that he may at
                    the same time have renounced the Arian creed of his forefathers, which it is
                    clear that he no longer held when he wrote his Gothic history.</p>
                <p>It is probable that the latter part at any rate of the life of Jordanes was spent
                    in Italy. In some early editions of his works he is called “episcopus Ravennas,”
                    but tho ample details which we possess as to the bishops of Ravenna make it
                    certain that he never occupied that see. He may have been a bishop, but the best
                    authority for that assertion (according to the statement in Muratori’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Rerum Italicarum Scriptores,</hi> i. 189) is only Sigebert of
                    Gembloux, who lived five centuries later. Traces have been discovered of a
                    certain Jordanes, bishop of Crotona, in 551, and a “Jordanes defensor ecclesiae
                    nostrae” is mentioned in a letter of Pope Pelagius in 556.</p>
                <p>We pass from the extremely shadowy personality of Jordanes to the more
                    interesting question of his works.</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Regnorum et Temporum
                    Successione,</hi> or, as he himself called it, <hi rend="italic">Breviatio
                    Chronicorum,</hi> was probably composed in 550 or 551. It is a short and dry
                    sketch of the history of the world from the creation, founded on the chronicles
                    of Eusebius and Jerome. The book has no value, literary or historical, till the
                    historian comes near to his own times; and here, from about 450 to 550, the <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Regnorum Successione</hi> is sometimes a
                    really important authority, owing to the extreme scarcity of other information
                    as to this epoch.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    terms of the dedication of this book to a certain Vigilius make it impossible
                    that the pope of that name is meant.</p></note></p>
                <p>2. The other work of Jordanes, <hi rend="italic">De Rebus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Geticis,</hi> as it is commonly called, was styled by himself <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Origine Actuque</hi><hi rend="italic">Geticae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gentis,</hi> and was probably written in the year 552. He informs
                    us that while he was engaged upon <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n781/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0781-0748"/> the <hi rend="italic">Breviatio</hi> a friend
                    named Castalius invited him to compress into one small treatise the twelve
                    books—now lost— of the senator Cassiodorius, or Cassiodorus, on <hi
                    rend="italic">The Origin and Actions of the Goths.</hi> Jordanes professes to
                    have had the work of Cassiodorius in his hands for but three days, and to
                    reproduce the sense, not the words; but his book, short as it is, evidently
                    contains long verbatim extracts from the earlier author, and it may be suspected
                    that the story of the “triduana lectio” and the apology “quamvis verba non
                    recolo,” possibly even the friendly invitation of Castalius, are mere blinds to
                    cover his own entire want of originality. This suspicion is strengthened by the
                    fact (discovered by Von Sybel) that even the very preface to his book is taken
                    almost word for word from Rufinus’s translation of Origen’s commentary on the
                    epistle to the Romans. There is no doubt, even on Jordanes’s own statements,
                    that his work is based upon that of Cassiodorius, and that any historical worth
                    which it possesses is due to that fact. Cassiodorius was one of the very few men
                    who, Roman by birth and sympathies, could yet appreciate the greatness of the
                    barbarians by whom the empire was overthrown. The chief adviser of Theodoric,
                    the East Gothic king in Italy, he accepted with ardour that monarch’s great
                    scheme, if indeed he did not himself originally suggest it to his master, of
                    welding Roman and Goth together into one harmonious state, which should preserve
                    the social refinement and the intellectual culture of the Latin-speaking races,
                    without losing the hardy virtues of their Teutonic conquerors. To this aim
                    everything in the political life of Cassiodorius was subservient, and this aim
                    he evidently kept before him in his Gothic history. He translated into his
                    somewhat stilted prose the sagas which were still sung by the Gothic warriors
                    round their camp-fires,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>“Quemadmodum et in priscis eorum carminibus paene historico ritu in commune
                    recolitur,” <hi rend="italic">De Reb. Get.,</hi> iv.</p></note> telling of the
                    past migrations and dangers of their people. He reduced into form the pedigree
                    which traced the descent of the Amals, Theodoric’s kingly house, from gods and
                    heroes. In all this he worked on such lines as a modern historical inquirer
                    would have him work on. Unfortunately, he also accepted the current theory of
                    his age which identified the Goths with the Scythians, whose country Darius
                    Hystaspis invaded, and with the Getae of Dacia whom Trajan conquered. This
                    double identification enabled him to bring the favoured race in line with the
                    people of classical antiquity, to interweave with their history stories about
                    Hercules and the Amazons, to make them invade Egypt, to claim for them a share
                    in the wisdom of the semi-mythical Scythian philosopher Zamolxis. He was thus
                    able with some "show of plausibility to represent the Goths as “wiser than all
                    the other barbarians and almost like the Greeks” (Jord., <hi rend="italic">De
                    Reb. Get.,</hi> cap. v.), and to send a son of the Gothic king Telephus to fight
                    at the siege of Troy, on the right side, in rank with the ancestors of the
                    Romans. All this we can now perceive to have no relation to history, but at the
                    time it may have made the subjugation of the Roman less bitter to feel that he
                    was not after all bowing down before a race of barbarian upstarts, but that his
                    Amal sovereign was as firmly rooted in classical antiquity as any Julius or
                    Claudius who ever wore the purple. A grateful king of the Goths, the young
                    Athalaric, truly said of Cassiodorius, “Originem Gothicam historiam fecit esse
                    Romanam, colligens quasi in unam coronam germen floridum, quod per librorum
                    campos passim fuerat ante dispersum” (Cassiod., <hi rend="italic">Var.</hi> ix.
                    25).</p>
                <p>Cassiodorius completed his history of the Goths probably about the year 534. In
                    the eighteen years which elapsed between that date and the composition of the
                    <hi rend="italic">De Rebus</hi><hi rend="italic">Geticis</hi> of Jordanes, great
                    events, and most disastrous for the Romano-Gothic monarchy of Theodoric, had
                    transpired. It was no longer possible to write as if the whole civilization of
                    the Western world would sit down contentedly under the shadow of East Gothic
                    dominion and Amal sovereignty. And moreover, the instincts of Jordanes, as
                    churchman and Catholic, predisposed him to flatter the sacred majesty of
                    Justinian, by whose victorious arms the overthrow of the barbarian kingdom in
                    Italy had been effected. Hence we perceive two currents of tendency in the <hi
                    rend="italic">De Rebus</hi><hi rend="italic">Geticis.</hi> On the one hand, as a
                    Goth himself and as a transcriber of the philo-Goth Cassiodorius, he magnifies
                    the race of Alaric and Theodoric, and claims for them their full share, perhaps
                    more than their full share, of glory in the past. On the other hand, he speaks
                    of the great anti-Teuton emperor Justinian, and of his reversal of the German
                    conquests of the 5th century, in language which would certainly have grated on
                    the ears of Totila and his heroes. Gelimer the Vandal is “overtaken by the
                    revenge of Justinian,” and Africa “long subject to the Vandal yoke is recalled
                    into the liberty of the Roman kingdom.” When Ravenna is taken, and Vitigis
                    carried into captivity, Jordanes almost exults in the fact that “the nobility of
                    the Amals and the illustrious offspring of so many mighty men have surrendered
                    to a yet more illustrious prince and a yet mightier genera], whose fame shall
                    not grow dim through all the centuries.”</p>
                <p>This laudation, both of the Goths and of their Byzantine conquerors may perhaps
                    help us to understand the political motive with which the <hi rend="italic">De
                    Rebus</hi><hi rend="italic">Geticis</hi> was written. In the year 551 Germanus,
                    nephew of Justinian, accompanied by his bride, Matasuntha, granddaughter of
                    Theodoric, set forth to reconquer Italy for the empire. His early death (in 552)
                    prevented any schemes for a revived Romano-Gothic kingdom which may have been
                    based on his personality. His widow, however, bore a posthumous child, also
                    named Germanus, of whom Jordanes speaks (cap. 60) as “blending the blood of the
                    Anicii and the Amals, and furnishing a hope under the divine blessing of one day
                    uniting their glories.” This younger Germanus did nothing in after life to
                    realize these anticipations; but the somewhat pointed way in which his name and
                    his mother’s name are mentioned by Jordanes lends some probability to the idea
                    that the <hi rend="italic">De Rebus</hi><hi rend="italic">Geticis</hi> was put
                    forth in the interests of a third party, Italian rather than Gothic or
                    Byzantine, and possibly headed by Pope Vigilius, who may have wished to advocate
                    the claims of this infant to an independent sovereignty in Italy.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">De Rebus</hi><hi rend="italic">Geticis</hi> falls naturally
                    into four parts. The first (chaps, i,-xiii.) commences with a geographical
                    description of the three quarters of the world, and in more detail of Britain
                    and “Scanzia” (Sweden), from which the Goths under their king Berig migrated to
                    the southern coast of the Baltic. Their migration across what has since been
                    called Lithuania, to the shores of the Euxine, and their differentiation into
                    Visigoths and Ostrogoths, follow. Chaps, v.-xiii. contain an account of the
                    intrusive Geto-Scythian element before alluded to.</p>
                <p>The second section (chaps, xiv. -xxiv. ) returns to the true history of the
                    Gothic nation, sets forth the genealogy of the Amal kings, and describes the
                    inroads of the Goths into the Roman empire in the 3d century, with the
                    foundation and the overthrow of the great but somewhat shadowy kingdom of
                    Hermanric. The author here probably rests to some extent on Orosius, Ammianus,
                    and other Latin historians, but draws partially at least from native
                    sources.</p>
                <p>The third section (chaps, xxv.-xlvii.) traces the history of the West Goths from
                    the Hunnish invasion to the downfall of the Gothic kingdom in Gaul under Alaric
                    II. (376 to 507 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> The best part of this section,
                    and indeed of the whole book, is the seven chapters devoted to Attila’s invasion
                    of Gaul and the battle of the Mauriac plains. Here we have in all probability a
                    verbatim extract from Cassiodorius, who has interwoven with his narrative large
                    portions of the Gothic sagas. The celebrated expression “certaminis gaudia”
                    assuredly came at first neither from the suave minister Cassiodorius nor from
                    the small-souled <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n782/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0782-0749"/> notary Jordanes, but is the translation of some
                    thought which first found utterance through the lips of a Gothic minstrel.</p>
                <p>The fourth section (chaps, xlviii,-lx. ) traces the history of the East Goths
                    from the same Hunnish invasion to the first overthrow of the Gothic monarchy in
                    Italy (376-539). In this fourth section are inserted, somewhat out of their
                    proper place, some valuable details as to the <hi rend="italic">Gothi
                    Minores,</hi> “an immense people dwelling in the region of Nicopolis, with their
                    high priest and primate Vulfilas, who-is said also to have taught them letters.”
                    The book closes with the allusion to Germanus and the panegyric on Justinian as
                    the conqueror of the Goths referred to above.</p>
                <p>. As to the style and literary character of Jordanes, every author who has used
                    him speaks in terms of severe censure. When he is left to himself and not merely
                    transcribing, he is sometimes scarcely grammatical. There are awkward gaps in
                    his narrative and statements inconsistent with each other. He quotes, as if he
                    were familiarly acquainted with their writings, about twenty Greek and Roman
                    writers, of whom it is almost certain that he had not read more than three or
                    four. At the same time he does not quote the chronicler Marcellinus, from whom
                    he has copied verbatim the history of the deposition of Augustulus. All these
                    faults make him a peculiarly unsatisfactory authority to depend upon where we
                    cannot check his statements by those of other authors. It may, however, be
                    pleaded in extenuation that he is professedly a transcriber, and, if his story
                    be correct, a transcriber under peculiarly unfavourable circumstances. He has
                    also himself suffered much from the inaccuracy of copyists. But nothing has
                    really been more unfortunate for the reputation of Jordanes as a writer than the
                    extreme preciousness of the information which he has preserved to us. The
                    Teutonic tribes whose dim original he records have in the course of centuries
                    attained to world-wide dominion. The battle in the Mauriac plains, of which he
                    is really the sole historian, is now seen to have had at least as important
                    bearings on the destinies of the world as Marathon or Waterloo. And thus the
                    hasty pamphlet of a half-educated Gothic monk has been forced into prominence,
                    almost into rivalry with the finished productions of the great writers of
                    classical antiquity. No wonder that it stands the comparison badly; but with all
                    its faults the <hi rend="italic">De Rebus</hi><hi rend="italic">Geticis</hi> of
                    Jordanes will probably ever retain its place side by side with the <hi

                    chief source of information respecting the history, institutions, and modes of
