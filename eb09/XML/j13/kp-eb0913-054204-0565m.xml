                    distinguished Orientalist and Biblical critic of the Roman Catholic Church, was
                    born at Tasswitz, Moravia, on June 18, 1750. After completing his school
                    education at Znaim he studied philosophy at Olmütz, andin 1772 began his
                    theological studies at the Praemonstratensian convent of Bruck in the
                    neighbourhood of Znaim. Having been ordained to the priesthood in 1775, he for a

                    suppression of the convent by Joseph II. in 1784, Jahn was removed to a chair at
                    Olmütz corresponding to that which he had previously held, and in 1789 he was
                    transferred to Vienna as professor of Oriental languages, Biblical archaeology,
                    and dogmatics. In 1792 he published his <hi rend="italic">Einleitung ins
                    Alte</hi><hi rend="italic">Testament</hi> (2 vols.), which almost <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0566-0543"/> immediately began to cause him trouble; a certain
                    Cardinal Migazzi laid a complaint against him before the emperor because in his
                    preface he had confessed himself to have in some points departed from the views
                    of his learned predecessors and adopted opinions of his own, while in the work
                    itself he declared Job, Jonah, Tobit, and Judith to be didactic poems. To these
                    charges was added a third, that in his New Testament lectures he had stated the
                    cases of demoniacal possession there mentioned to be cases of natural disease.
                    On the matter being referred to an ecclesiastical commission, it was reported
                    that the views themselves were not necessarily heretical, but that Jahn had
                    shown undue rashness in giving out, as his own, opinions which teachers of
                    theology ought not to mention otherwise than as foreign; in accordance with this
                    it was decided that he ought to modify his expressions in future editions of his
                    work and in his subsequent lecturing. Although he appears honestly to have
                    accepted this judgment, the hostility of those who were opposed to his teaching
                    did not cease until at last (1806) he was compelled to accept a canonry at
                    Vienna, which involved the resignation of his chair. This step had been preceded
                    by the condemnation of his <hi rend="italic">Introductio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi><hi rend="italic">libros sacros Veteris</hi><hi rend="italic">Foederis
                    in compendium</hi><hi rend="italic">redacta,</hi> published in 1804, and also of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Archaeologia</hi><hi rend="italic">Biblica in
                    compendium</hi><hi rend="italic">redacta</hi> (1805). The only work of
                    importance, outside the region of mere philology, afterwards published by him,
                    was the <hi rend="italic">Enchiridion</hi><hi rend="italic">Hermeneuticae</hi>
                    (1812). He died August 16, 1816. Jahn’s place in the history of the modern
                    science of Biblical criticism is undoubtedly an honourable one, and also of some
                    importance, especially when his ecclesiastical environment is taken into
                    account. If he cannot be said to have been either very original or very
                    profound, he has at least the merit of being laborious, candid, and
                    clear-sighted within his range of vision; one of his books, the <hi

                    entirely superseded.</p>
                <p>Besides the works already mentioned, he published <hi rend="italic">Hebräische

                    passed through several editions. See A. G. Hoffmann’s article in Erseh and
