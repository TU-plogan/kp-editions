                    <hi rend="italic">jaune,</hi> yellow), or <hi rend="smallcaps">Icterus</hi>
                    (from its resemblance to the colour of the golden oriole, of which Pliny relates
                    that if a jaundiced person looks upon it he recovers but the bird dies), a term
                    in medicine applied to a yellow coloration of the skin and other parts of the
                    body, depending in most instances on some derangement affecting the liver. This
                    yellow colour is due to the presence in the blood of bile or of some of the
                    elements of that secretion. Jaundice, however, must be regarded more as a
                    symptom of some morbid condition previously existing than as a disease' <hi
                    rend="italic">per se.</hi></p>
                <p>The manner in which jaundice is produced is still a matter of debate among
                    physicians, but it is generally admitted that there are two classes of causes,
                    either of which may bring about this condition. In the first place any
                    obstruction to the passage of bile from the liver into the intestinal canal is
                    sooner or later followed by the appearance of jaundice, which in such
                    circumstances is due to the excessive absorption of bile into the blood. To this
                    variety the term <hi rend="italic">obstructive</hi> jaundice is applied. But
                    secondly, a form of jaundice may be produced by causes not embracing
                    obstruction, but including a variety of morbid conditions affecting either the
                    secreting structure of the liver or the state of the blood, and to this the term
                    <hi rend="italic">non-obstructive</hi> jaundice is applied.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Obstructive jaundice</hi> may be due to the following causes:
                    —(1) simple catarrh of the hepatic and common bile duct (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Digestive Organs),</hi> whereby the calibre of these channels
                    is narrowed (this is frequently the result of cold or of temporary gastric
                    disturbance, but it may become a chronic condition); (2) impaction of gall
                    stones or plugs of hardened mucus in the ducts; (3) general congestion of the
                    liver, either alone or in connexion with pre-existing disease in the heart or
                    lungs; and (4) pressure of morbid growths either external to the liver or in its
                    substance.</p>
                <p>Obstruction from these causes may be partial or complete, and the degree of
                    jaundice will vary accordingly, but it is to be noted that extensive organic
                    disease of the liver may exist without the evidence of obstructive jaundice.</p>
                <p>The effect upon the liver of impediments to the outflow of bile such as those
                    above indicated is in the first place an increase in its size, the whole biliary
                    passages and the liver cells being distended with retained bile. This
                    enlargement, however, speedily subsides when the obstruction is removed, but
                    should it persist the liver ultimately shrinks and undergoes atrophy in its
                    whole texture. The bile thus retained is absorbed into the system, and shows
                    itself by the yellow staining seen to a greater or less extent in all the
                    tissues and many of the fluids of the body. The kidneys, which in such
                    circumstances act in some measure vicariously to the liver and excrete a portion
                    of the retained bile, are apt to become affected in their structure by the long
                    continuance of jaundice.</p>
                <p>The symptoms of obstructive jaundice necessarily vary according to the nature of
                    the exciting cause, but there generally exists evidence of some morbid condition
                    before the yellow coloration appears. Thus, if the obstruction be due to an
                    impacted gall stone in the common or hepatic duct, there will probably be the
                    symptoms of intense suffering characterizing “hepatic colic” (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Colic),</hi> after which the jaundice appears. In the cases
                    most frequently seen—those, namely, arising from simple catarrh of the bile
                    ducts due to gastro-duodenal irritation spreading on to the liver through the
                    common duct—the first sign to attract attention is the yellow appearance of the
                    white of the eye, which is speedily followed by a similar colour on the skin
                    over the body generally. The yellow tinge is most distinct where the skin is
                    thin, as on the forehead, breast, elbows, &amp;c. It may be also well seen in
                    the roof of the mouth, but in the lips and gums the colour is not observed till
                    the blood is first pressed from them. The tint varies, being in the milder cases
                    faint, in the more severe a deep saffron yellow, while in extreme degrees of
                    obstruction it may be of dark brown or greenish hue. The colour can scarcely, if
                    at all, be observed in artificial light.</p>
                <p>The urine exhibits well marked and characteristic changes in jaundice which exist
                    even before any evidence can be detected on the skin or elsewhere. It is always
                    of dark brown colour resembling porter, but after standing in the air it
                    acquires a greenish tint. Its froth is greenish-yellow, and it stains with this
                    colour any white substance. It contains not only the bile colouring matter but
                    also the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n626/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0626-0599"/> bile acids. The former is detected by the play of
                    colours yielded on the addition of nitric acid, the latter by the purple colour
                    produced by placing a piece of lump sugar in the urine tested, and adding
                    thereto a few drops of strong sulphuric acid. This test for the bile acids is
                    dwelt upon by Dr George Harley as an important point in serving to distinguish
                    jaundice with obstruction from jaundice without obstruction, in the latter of
                    which, although there is bile pigment in the urine, the bile acids are
                    absent.</p>
                <p>The contents of the bowels also undergo changes, being characterized chiefly by
                    their pale clay colour, which is in proportion to the amount of hepatic
                    obstruction, and to their consequent want of admixture with bile. For the same
                    reason they contain a large amount of unabsorbed fatty matter, and have an
                    extremely offensive odour.</p>
                <p>Constitutional symptoms always attend jaundice with obstruction. The patient
                    becomes languid, drowsy, and irritable, and has generally a slow pulse. The
                    appetite is usually but not always diminished, a bitter taste in the mouth is
                    complained of, while flatulent eructations arise from the stomach. Intolerable
                    itching of the skin is a common accompaniment of jaundice, and cutaneous
                    eruptions or boils are occasionally seen. Yellow vision appears to be present in
                    some very rare cases. Should the jaundice depend on advancing organic disease of
                    the liver, such as cancer, the tinge becomes gradually deeper, and the
                    emaciation and debility more marked towards the fatal termination, which in such
                    cases is seldom long postponed. Apart from this, however, jaundice from
                    obstruction may exist for many years, as in those instances where the walls of
                    the bile ducts are thickened from chronic catarrh, but where they are only
                    partially occluded. In the common cases of acute catarrhal jaundice recovery
                    usually takes place in two or three weeks.</p>
                <p>The treatment of this form of jaundice bears reference to the cause giving rise
                    to the obstruction. In the ordinary cases of simple catarrhal jaundice, or that
                    following the passing of gall stones, a light nutritious diet (milk, soups,
                    &amp;c., avoiding saccharine and farinaceous substances and alcoholic
                    stimulants), along with counter-irritation applied over the right side, and
                    after a few days the use of laxatives which tend to promote the flow of bile,
                    will be found to be advantageous. Rhubarb, taraxacum, podophyllum, mercury, are
                    among the remedies which have long been employed for this purpose, but the
                    recent researches of Professor Rutherford have brought to light certain other
                    agents (euonymin, iridin, leptandrin, &lt;fcc.), which exercise a powerful
                    influence as cholagogues, and are now coming into use. Diaphoretics and
                    diuretics to promote the action of the skin and kidneys are useful in jaundice.
                    In the more chronic forms, besides the remedies above named, the waters of
                    Carlsbad are of special efficacy. Where the jaundice depends on changes in the
                    substance of the liver, altering its structure, such as cancerous deposit, all
                    that can be accomplished is the palliation of symptoms, including the jaundice,
                    which may be mitigated by the treatment already indicated. With the view of
                    supplying bile to the alimentary canal, Dr Harley recommends the use of
                    inspissated ox-gall in doses of 5 to 10 grains administered in capsules of
                    gelatin.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Jaundice without obstruction</hi> is observed to occur as a
                    symptom in certain fevers, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> yellow fever, ague, and
                    relapsing fever, and in pyaemia (blood poisoning), also as the effect of the
                    action of certain poisonous substances, such as copper, mercury, antimony,
                    phosphorus, &amp;c., and the venom of snake bites. It is occasionally seen in
                    new-born infants. It is sometimes suddenly induced as the result of strong
                    mental excitement or emotion. Much difficulty has always been felt to account
                    for this form of jaundice, and numerous theories have been advanced to explain
                    its occurrence. Many of such cases might probably, as Virchow observes, be found
                    on careful investigation to depend on some obstruction in the biliary passages;
                    but there can be no doubt that many others admit of no such explanation, and as
                    regards these it is generally held that they are probably connected with some
                    alteration in the colouring matter of the blood, the source, it is believed, of
                    the bile pigment. Others suppose this form of jaundice to be due to an excess in
                    the normal reabsorption of bile into the blood. The pathology, however, is still
                    unsettled. Jaundice of this kind is almost always slight, and neither the urine
                    nor the discharges from the bowels exhibit changes in appearance to such a
                    degree as in the obstructive variety. Grave constitutional symptoms are often
                    present, but they are less to be ascribed to the jaundice than to the disease
                    with which it is associated.</p>
                <p>The uame <hi rend="italic">malignant jaundice</hi> is sometimes applied to that
                    very fatal form of disease otherwise termed acute yellow atrophy of the liver.
