                    whom his advancement in life was due.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>The name “Uprauda” itself is said to be derived from the
                            word “prauda,” which in Old Slavic means “jus,” “justitia,” the prefix
                            being simply a breathing frequently attached to Slavonic
                        names.</p></note> Of his early life we know nothing except that he came to
                    Constantinople while still a young man, and received there an excellent
                    education. Doubtless he knew Latin before Greek; it is alleged that he always
                    spoke Greek with a barbarian accent. When Justin ascended the throne in 518 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> Justinian became at once a person of the first
                    consequence, guiding, especially in church matters, the policy of his aged,
                    childless, and ignorant uncle, receiving high rank and office at his hands, and
                    soon coming to be regarded as his destined successor. On Justin’s death in 527,
                    having been a few months earlier associated with him as co-emperor, he succeeded
                    without opposition to the throne.</p>
                <p>His reign was filled with great events, both at home and abroad, both in peace
                    and in war. They may be classed under four heads :—(1) his legal reforms; (2)
                    his administration of the empire; (3) his ecclesiastical policy; and (4) his
                    wars and foreign policy generally.</p>
                <p>1. It is as a legislator and codifier of the law that Justinian’s name is most
                    familiar to the modern world; and it is therefore this department of his action
                    that requires to be most fully dealt with here. He found the law of the Roman
                    empire in a state of great confusion. It consisted of two masses, which were
                    usually distinguished as old law <hi rend="italic">(fus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >vetus)</hi> and new law <hi rend="italic">(jus novum).</hi> The first of
                    these comprised—(1) all such of the statutes <hi rend="italic">(leges)</hi>
                    passed under the republic and early empire as had not become obsolete; (2) the
                    decrees of the senate <hi rend="italic">(senatus consulta)</hi> passed at the
                    end of the republic and during the first two centuries of the empire; (3) the
                    writings of the jurists of the later republic and of the empire, and more
                    particularly of those jurists to whom the right of declaring the law with
                    authority <hi rend="italic">(jus</hi><hi rend="italic">respondendi)</hi> had
                    been committed by the emperors. As these jurists had in their commentaries upon
                    the <hi rend="italic">leges,</hi><hi rend="italic">senatus consulta,</hi> and
                    edicts of the magistrates practically incorporated all· that was of importance
                    in those documents, the books of the jurists may substantially be taken as
                    including (1) and (2). These writings were of course very numerous, and formed a
                    vast mass of literature. Many of them had become exceedingly scarce,—many having
                    of course been altogether lost. Some were of doubtful authenticity. They were so
                    costly that no person of moderate means could hope to possess any large number;
                    even the public libraries had nothing approaching to a complete collection.
                    Moreover, as they proceeded from a large number of independent authors, who
                    wrote expressing their own opinions, they contained many discrepancies and
                    contradictions, the dicta of one writer being controverted by another, while yet
                    both writers might enjoy the same formal authority. A remedy had been attempted
                    to be applied to this evil by a law of the emperors Theodosius II. and
                    Valentinian HL, which gave special weight to the writings of five eminent
                    jurists (Papinian, Paulus, Ulpian, Modestinus, Gaius); but it was very far from
                    removing it. As regards the <hi rend="italic">jus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >vetus,</hi> therefore, the judges and practitioners of Justinian’s time had
                    two terrible difficulties to contend with,—first, the bulk of the law, which
                    made it impossible for any one to be sure that he possessed any thing like the
                    whole of the authorities bearing on the point in question, so that he was always
                    liable to find his opponent quoting against him some authority for which he
                    could not be prepared; and, secondly, the uncertainty of the law, there being a
                    great many important points on which differing opinions of equal legal validity
                    might be cited, so that the practising counsel could not advise, nor the judge
                    decide, with any confidence that he was right, or that a superior court would
                    uphold his view.</p>
                <p>The new law <hi rend="italic">(jus novum),</hi> which consisted of the ordinances
                    of the emperors promulgated during the middle and later empire <hi rend="italic"
                        >(edicta, rescripta,</hi><hi rend="italic">mandata,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >decreta,</hi> usually called by the general name of <hi rend="italic"
                        >constitutiones),</hi> was in a condition not much better. These ordinances
                    or constitutions were extremely numerous. No complete collection of them
                    existed, for although two collections <hi rend="italic">(Codex
                        Gregorianus</hi><pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n826/mode/1up"

                        Hermogenianus)</hi> had been made by two jurists in the 4th century, and a
                    large supplementary collection published by the emperor Theodosius II. in 438
                        <hi rend="italic">(Codex</hi><hi rend="italic">Theodosianus),</hi> these
                    collections did not include all the constitutions, there were others which it
                    was necessary to obtain separately, but many whereof it must have been
                    impossible for a private person to procure. In this branch too of the law there
                    existed some, though a less formidable, uncertainty; for there were
                    constitutions which practically, if not formally, repealed or superseded others
                    without expressly mentioning them, so that a man who relied on the words of one
                    constitution might find that it had been varied or abrogated by another he had
                    never heard of or on whose sense he had not put such a construction. It was
                    therefore clearly necessary with regard to both the older and the newer law to
                    take some steps to collect into one or more bodies or masses so much of the law
                    as was to be regarded as binding, reducing it within a reasonable compass, and
                    purging away the contradictions or inconsistencies which it contained. The evil
                    had been long felt, and reforms apparently often proposed, but nothing (except
                    by the compilation of the <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Theodosianus)</hi> had been done till Justinian’s time. Immediately after
                    his accession, in 528, he appointed a commission to deal with the imperial
                    constitutions <hi rend="italic">(jus novum),</hi> this being the easier part of
                    the problem. The commissioners, ten in number, were directed to go through all
                    the constitutions of which copies existed, to select such as were of practical
                    value, to cut these down by retrenching all unnecessary matter, and gather them,
                    arranged in order of date, into one volume, getting rid of any contradictions by
                    omitting one or other of the conflicting passages.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See, for an account of the instructions
                            given to the commission, the constitution <hi rend="italic">Ilaec

                            >Civilis.</hi></p></note> These statute law commissioners, as one may
                    call them, set to work forthwith, and completed their task in fourteen months,
                    distributing the constitutions which they placed in the new collection into ten
                    books, in general conformity with the order of the Perpetual Edict as settled by
                    Salvius Julianus and enacted by Hadrian. By this means the bulk of the statute
                    law was immensely reduced, its obscurities and internal discrepancies in great
                    measure removed, its provisions adapted, by the abrogation of what was obsolete,
                    to the circumstances of Justinian’s own time. This <hi rend="italic"
                        >Codex</hi><hi rend="italic">Constitutionum</hi> was formally promulgated
                    and enacted as one great consolidating statute in 529, all imperial ordinances
                    not included in it being repealed at one stroke.</p>
                <p>The success of this first experiment encouraged the emperor to attempt the more
                    difficult enterprise of simplifying and digesting the older law contained in the
                    treatises of the jurists. Before entering on this, however, he wisely took the
                    preliminary step of settling the more important of the legal questions as to
                    which the older jurists had been divided in opinion, and which had therefore
                    remained sources of difficulty, a difficulty aggravated by the general decline,
                    during the last two centuries, of the level of forensic and judicial learning.
                    This was accomplished by a series of constitutions known as the “Fifty
                    Decisions” <hi rend="italic">(Quinqιιa-gintα</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Decisiones),</hi> along with which there were published other ordinances
                    amending the law in a variety of points, in which old and now inconvenient rules
                    had been suffered to subsist. Then in December 530 a new commission was
                    appointed, consisting of sixteen eminent lawyers, of whom the president,the
                    famous Tribonian (who had already served on the previous commission), was an
                    exalted official <hi rend="italic">(quaestor),</hi> four were professors of law,
                    and the remaining eleven practising advocates. The instructions given to them by
                    the emperor were as follows :—they were to procure and peruse all the writings
                    of all the authorized jurists</p>
                <p>(those who had enjoyed the <hi rend="italic">jus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >respondendi)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> were to extract from these
                    writings whatever was of most permanent and substantial value, with power to
                    change the expressions of the author wherever conciseness or clearness would be
                    thereby promoted, or wherever such a change was needed in order to adapt his
                    language to the condition of the law as it stood in Justinian’s time; were to
                    avoid repetitions and contradictions by giving only one statement of the law
                    upon each point; were to insert nothing at variance with any provision contained
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic">Constitutionum</hi>; and
                    were to distribute the results of their labours into fifty books, subdividing
                    each book into titles, and following generally the order of the Perpetual
                        Edict.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the

                <p>These directions were carried out with a speed which is surprising when we
                    remember not only that the work was interrupted by the terrible insurrection
                    which broke out in Constantinople in January 532, and which led to the temporary
                    retirement from office of Tribonian, but also that the mass of literature which
                    had to be read through consisted of no less than two thousand treatises,
                    comprising three millions of sentences. The commissioners, who had for greater
                    despatch divided themselves into several committees, presented their selection
                    of extracts to the emperor in 533, and he published it as an imperial statute on
                    December 16th of that year, with two prefatory constitutions (those known as <hi
                        rend="italic">Omnem</hi><hi rend="italic">reipublicae</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Dedit</hi><hi rend="italic">nobis).</hi> It is the volume
                    which we now call the <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >(Digesta)</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pandects</hi> (∏αvδ∈κται), and which is
                    by far the most precious monument of the legal genius of the Romans, and indeed,
                    whether one regards the intrinsic merits of its substance or the prodigious
                    influence it has exerted and still exerts, the most remarkable law-book that the
                    world has seen. The extracts comprised in it are 9123 in number, taken from
                    thirty-nine authors, and are of greatly varying length, mostly only a few lines
                    long. About one-third (in quantity) come from Ulpian, a very copious writer;
                    Paulus stands next. To each extract there is prefixed the name of the author,
                    and of the treatise whence it is taken.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>In the Middle Ages people used to cite passages by the

                    thing about the <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi> is its highly unscientific

                    as a sort of model for the general scheme of books and titles, was doubtless
                    convenient to the Roman lawyers from their familiarity with it, but was in
                    itself rather accidental and historical than logical. The disposition of the
                    extracts inside each title was still less rational; it has been shown by a
                    modern jurist to have been the result of the way in which the committees of the
                    commissioners worked through the books they had to peruse.<note anchored="true"

                    directed that those treatises should never be cited in future even by way of
                    illustration; and he of course at the same time abrogated all the older
                    statutes, from the Twelve Tables downwards, which had formed a part of the <hi

                    reform. But he went too far, and indeed attempted what was impossible, when he
                    forbade all commentaries upon the <hi rend="italic">Digest.</hi> He was obliged
                    to allow a Greek translation to be made of it, but directed this translation to

                    Tribonian, who seems to have acted both as his adviser and as his chief
                    executive officer in all legal affairs, conceived that a third book was needed,
                    viz., an elementary manual for beginners which should present an outline of the
                    law in a clear and simple form. The little work of Gaius, most of which we now
                    possess under the title of <hi rend="italic">Commentarii Institutionum,</hi> had
                    served this purpose for nearly four centuries; but much of it had, owing to
                    changes in the law, become inapplicable, so that a new manual seemed to be
                    required. Justinian accordingly directed Tribonian, with two coadjutors,
                    Theophilus, professor of law in the university of Constantinople, and Dorotheus,
                    professor in the great law school at Beyrout, to prepare an elementary text-book
                    on the lines of Gaius. This they did while the <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi> was
                    in progress, and produced the useful little treatise which has ever since been
                    the book with which students commonly begin their studies of Roman law, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Institutes of Justinian.</hi> It was published as a statute
                    with full legal validity shortly before the <hi rend="italic">Digest.</hi> Such
                    merits as it possesses—simplicity of arrangement, clearness and conciseness of
                    expression—belong rather to Gaius, who has been closely followed wherever the
                    alterations in the law had not made him obsolete, than to Tribonian. However,
                    the spirit of that great legal classic seems to have in a measure dwelt with and
                    inspired the inferior men who were recasting his work; the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Institutes</hi> is better both in Latinity and in substance than we should
                    have expected from the condition of Latin letters at that epoch, better than the
                    other laws which emanate from Justinian.</p>
                <p>In the four years and a half which elapsed between the publication of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Codex</hi> and that of the <hi rend="italic">Digest,</hi> many
                    important changes had been made in the law, notably by the publication of the
                    “Fifty Decisions,” which settled many questions that had exercised the legal
                    mind and given occasion to intricate statutory provisions. It was therefore
                    natural that the idea should present itself of revising the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Codex,</hi> so as to introduce these changes into it, for by so doing, not
                    only would it be simplified, but the one volume would again be made to contain
                    the whole statute law, whereas now it was necessary to read along with it the
                    ordinances issued since its publication. Accordingly another commission was
                    appointed, consisting of Tribonian with four other coadjutors, full power being
                    given them not only to incorporate the new constitutions with the <hi
                        rend="italic">Codex</hi> and make in it the requisite changes, but also to
                    revise the <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi> generally, cutting down or filling in
                    wherever they thought it necessary to do so. This work was completed in a few
                    months; and in November 534, the revised <hi rend="italic">Codex (Codex</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">repetitae praelectionis')</hi> was promulgated with the force
                    of law, prefaced by a constitution <hi rend="italic">(Cordi</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">nobis)</hi> which sets forth its history, and declares it to
                    be alone authoritative, the former <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi> being abrogated.
                    It is this revised <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi> which has come down to the
                    modern world, all copies of the earlier edition having disappeared.</p>
                <p>The constitutions contained in it number 4652, the earliest dating from Hadrian,
                    the latest being of course Justinian’s own, A few thus belong to the period to
                    which the greater part of the <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi> belongs, <hi
                        rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the so-called classical period of Roman law down to
                    the time of Alexander Severus (244); but the great majority are later,
                    and·belong to one or other of the four great eras of imperial legislation, the
                    eras of Diocletian, of Constantine, of Theodosius II., and of Justinian himself.
                    Although this <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi> is said to have the same general
                    order as that of the <hi rend="italic">Digest,</hi> viz., the order of the
                    Perpetual Edict, there are considerable differences of arrangement between the
                    two. It is divided into twelve books. Its contents, although of course of the
                    utmost practical importance to the lawyers of that time, and of much value
                    still, historical as well as legal, are far less interesting and scientifically
                    admirable than the extracts preserved in the <hi rend="italic">Digest.</hi> The
                    difference is even greater than that between the English Reports of Cases
                    decided since the days of Lord Holt and the English Acts of Parliament for the
                    same two centuries.</p>
                <p>The emperor’s scheme was now complete. All the Roman law had been gathered into
                    two volumes of not immoderate size, and a satisfactory manual for beginners
                    added. But, as the appetite comes with eating, Justinian and Tribonian had grown
                    so fond of legislating that they found it hard to leave off. Moreover, the very
                    simplifications that had been so far effected brought into view with more
                    clearness such anomalies or pieces of injustice as still continued to deform the
                    law. Thus no sooner had the work been rounded off than fresh excrescences began
                    to be created by the publication of new laws. Between 534 and 565 Justinian
                    issued a great number of ordinances, dealing with all sorts of subjects, and
                    seriously altering the law on many points,—the majority appearing before the
                    death of Tribonian, which happened in 545. These ordinances are called, by way
                    of distinction, new coastitutions, <hi rend="italic">Novellae</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">constitutiones</hi><hi rend="italic">post</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Codicem</hi><hi rend="italic">{reαρo.l διaτdξeιs),
                        Novels.</hi> Although the emperor had stated in publishing the <hi
                        rend="italic">Codex</hi> that all further statutes (if any) would be
                    officially collected, this promise does not seem tp have been redeemed. The
                    three collections of the <hi rend="italic">Novels</hi> which we possess are
                    apparently private collections, nor do we even know how many such constitutions
                    were promulgated. One of the three contains 168 (together with 13 Edicts), but
                    some of these are by the emperors Justin II. and Tiberius II. Another, the
                    so-called <hi rend="italic">Epitome of Julian,</hi> contains 125 Novels in
                    Latin; and the third, the <hi rend="italic">Liber Aτdhenticarum</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">Vulgata</hi><hi rend="italic">Versio,</hi> has 134, also in
                    Latin. This last was the collection first known and chiefly used in the West
                    during the Middle Ages; and of its 134 only 97 have been written on by the <hi
                        rend="italic">glossatoτcs</hi> or mediaeval commentators; these therefore
                    alone have been received as binding in those countries which recognize and obey
                    the Roman law,—according to the maxim <hi rend="italic">Quicquid non</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">agnoscit glossa, nec agnoscit curia.</hi> And, whereas
                    Justinian’s constitutions contained in the <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi> were all
                    issued in Latin, the rest of the book being in that tongue, these <hi
                        rend="italic">Novels</hi> were nearly all published in Greek, Latin
                    translations being of course made for the use of the western provinces. They are
                    very bulky, and with the exception of a few, particularly the 116th and 118th,
                    which introduce the most sweeping and laudable reforms into the law of intestate
                    succession, are much more interesting as supplying materials for the history of
                    the time, social, economical, and ecclesiastical, than in respect of any purely
                    legal merits. They may be found printed, in any edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Corpus Juris</hi><hi rend="italic">Civilis.</hi></p>
                <p>This <hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris,</hi> which bears and immortalizes
                    Justinian’s name, consists of the four books described above :—(1) the
                    authorized collection of imperial ordinances <hi rend="italic">{Codex</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Constitutionum)</hi>; (2) the authorized collection of
                    extracts from the great jurists <hi rend="italic">{Digesta</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">Pandectae)</hi>; (3) the elementary handbook <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Institutiones)</hi>; (4) the unauthorized collection of constitutions
                    subsequent to the <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >{Novellae).</hi></p>
                <p>From what has been already stated, the reader will perceive that Justinian did
                    not, according to a strict use of terms, codify the Roman law. By a
                    codification, we understand the reduction of the whole pre-existing body of law
                    to a new form, the restating it in a series of propositions, scientifically
                    ordered, which may or may not contain some new substance, but are at any rate
                    new in form. If he had, so to speak, thrown into one furnace all the law
                    contained in the treatises of the jurists and in the imperial ordinances, fused
                    them down, the gold of the one and the silver of the other, and run them out
                    into new moulds, this· would have been codification. What he did do was
                    something quite different. It was not codification but consolidation, not
                    remoulding but abridging. He made extracts from the existing law, preserving the
                    old words, and merely cutting out repetitions, removing contradictions,
                    retrenching superfluities, so as immensely to reduce the bulk of the whole. And
                    he made not one set of such extracts but two, one for the jurist law, the other
                    for the statute law. He gave to posterity not one code but two digests or
                    collections of extracts, which are new only to this extent that they are
                    arranged in a new order, having been previously altogether unconnected with one
                    another, and that here and there their words have been modified in order to
                    bring one extract into harmony with some other. Except for this, the matter is
                    old in expression as well as in substance.</p>
                <p>Thus regarded, and even omitting to remark that the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Novels,</hi> never having been officially collected, much less incorporated
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Codex,</hi> mar the symmetry of the structure,
                    Justinian’s work may appear to entitle him and Tribonian to much less credit
                    than they have usually <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n828/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0913-0828-0795"/> received for it. But let it be observed,
                    first, that to reduce the huge and confused mass of pre-existing law into the
                    compass of these two collections was an immense practical benefit to the empire;
                    secondly, that, whereas the work which he undertook was accomplished in seven
                    years, the infinitely more difficult task of codification might probably have
                    been left unfinished at Tribonian’s death, or even at Justinian’s own, and been
                    abandoned by his successor; thirdly, that in the extracts preserved in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Digest</hi> we have the opinions of the greatest legal
                    luminaries given in their own admirably lucid, philosophical, and concise
                    language, while in the extracts of which the <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi> is
                    composed we find valuable historical evidence bearing on the administration and
                    social condition of the later pagan and earlier Christian empire; fourthly, that
                    Justinian’s age, that is to say, the intellect of the men whose services he
                    commanded, was quite unequal to so vast an undertaking as the fusing upon
                    scientific principles into one new organic whole of the entire law of the
                    empire. With sufficient time and labour, the work might no doubt have« been
                    done; but what we possess of Justinian’s own legislation, and still more what we
                    know of the general condition of literary and legal capacity in his time, makes
                    it certain that it would not have beeu well done, and that the result would have
                    been not more valuable to the Romans of that age, and much less valuable to the
                    modern world, than are the results, preserved in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Digest</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Codex,</hi> of what he and Tribonian
                    actually did.</p>
                <p>To the merits of the work as actually performed some reference has already been
                    made. The chief defect of the <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi> is in point of
                    scientific arrangement, a matter about which the Roman lawyers, perhaps one may
                    say the ancients generally, cared very little. There are seme repetitions and
                    some inconsistencies, but not more than may fairly be allowed for in a
                    compilation of such magnitude executed so rapidly. Tribonian has been blamed for
                    the insertions the compilers made in the sentences of the old jurists (the
                    so-called <hi rend="italic">Emblemata Triboniani)</hi>; but it was a part of
                    Justinian’s plan that such insertions should be made, so as to adapt those
                    sentences to the law as settled in the emperor’s time. On Justinian’s own laws,
                    contained in the <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi> and in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Novels,</hi> a somewhat less favourable judgment must be pronounced. They,
                    and especially the latter, are diffuse and often lax in expression, needlessly
                    prolix, and pompously rhetorical. The policy of many, particularly of those
                    which deal with ecclesiastical matters, may also be condemned; yet some
                    gratitude is due to the legislator who put the law of intestate succession on
                    that plain and rational footing whereon it has ever since continued to stand. It
                    is somewhat remarkable that, although Justinian is so much more familiar to us
                    by his legislation than by anything else, this sphere of his imperial labour is
                    hardly referred to by any of the contemporary historians, and then only with
                    censure. Procopius complains that he and Tribonian were always repealing old
                    laws and enacting new ones, and accuses them of venal motives for doing so.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Corpus Buris</hi> of Justinian continued to be, with of
                    course a few additions in the ordinances of succeeding emperors, the chief
                    law-book of the Roman world till the time of the Macedonian dynasty, when,
                    towards the end of the 9th century, a new system was prepared and issued by
                    those sovereigns, which we know as the <hi rend="italic">Basilica.</hi> It is of
                    course written in Greek, and consists of parts of the substance of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Codex</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Digest,</hi> thrown
                    together and often altered in expression, together with some matter from the <hi
                        rend="italic">Novels</hi> and imperial ordinances posterior to Justinian. In
                    the western provinces, which had been wholly severed from the empire before the
                    publication of the <hi rend="italic">Basilica,</hi> the law as settled by
                    Justinian held its ground; but copies of the <hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris</hi>
                    were extremely rare, nor did the study of it revive until the end of the 11th
                    century.</p>
                <p>The best edition of the <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi> is that of Mommsen, Berlin,
                    1868-70, and of the <hi rend="italic">Codex</hi> that of Krueger, Berlin,
                    1875-77.</p>
                <p>2. In his financial administration of the empire, Justinian is represented to us
                    as being at once rapacious and extravagant. His unwearied activity and
                    inordinate vanity led him to form all kinds of expensive projects, and undertake
                    a great many costly public works, many of them, such as the erection of palaces
                    and churches, unremunerative. The money needed for these, for his wars, and for
                    buying off the barbarians who threatened the frontiers, had to be obtained by
                    increasing the burdens of the people. They suffered, not only from the regular
                    taxes, which were seldom remitted even after bad seasons, but also from
                    monopolies; and Procopius goes so far as to allege that the emperor made a
                    practice of further recruiting his treasury by confiscating on slight or
                    fictitious pretexts the property of persons who had displeased Theodora or
                    himself. Fiscal severities were no doubt one cause of the insurrections which
                    now and then broke out, and in the gravest of which, 532 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >a.d.,</hi> thirty thousand persons are said to have perished in the
                    capital. It is not always easy to discover, putting together the trustworthy
                    evidence of Justinian’s own laws and the angry complaints of Procopius, what was
                    the nature and justification of the changes made in the civil administration.
                    But the general conclusion seems to be that these changes were always in the
                    direction of further centralization, increasing the power of the chief ministers
                    and their offices, bringing all more directly under the control of the crown,
                    and in some cases limiting the powers and appropriating the funds of local
                    municipalities. Financial necessities compelled retrenchment, so that a certain
                    number of offices were suppressed altogether, much to the disgust of the
                    office-holding class, which was numerous and wealthy, and had almost come to
                    look on the civil service as its hereditary possession. The most remarkable
                    instance of this policy was the discontinuance of the consulship. This great
                    office had remained a dignity centuries after it had ceased to be a power; but
                    it was a very costly dignity, the holder being expected to spend large sums in
                    public displays. As these sums were provided by the state, Justinian saved
                    something considerable by stopping the payment. He named no consul after
                    Basilius, who was the name-giving consul of the year 541 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >a.d.</hi></p>
                <p>In a bureaucratic despotism the greatest merit of a sovereign is to choose
                    capable and honest ministers. Justinian’s selections were usually capable, but
                    not so often honest; probably it was hard to find thoroughly upright people;
                    possibly they were not the people who would have been most serviceable in
                    carrying out the imperial will, and especially in replenishing the imperial
                    treasury. Even the great Tribonian labours under the reproach of corruption,
                    while the fact that Justinian maintained John of Cappadocia in power long after
                    his greed, his unscrupulousness, and the excesses of his private life had
                    excited the anger of the whole empire, reflects little credit on his own
                    principles of government and sense of duty to his subjects. The department of
                    administration in which he seems to have felt most personal interest was that of
                    public works. He spent immense sums on buildings of all sorts, on quays and
                    harbours, on fortifications, repairing the walls of cities and erecting castles
                    in Thrace to check the inroads of the barbarians, on aqueducts, on monasteries,
                    above all, upon churches. Of these works only two remain perfect, St Sophia in
                    Constantinople, now a mosque, and one of the architectural wonders of the world,
                    and the church of SS. Sergius and Bacchus, now commonly called Little St Sophia,
                    which stands about half a mile from the great church, and is in its way a very
                    delicate and beautiful piece of work. The church of San Vitale at Ravenna,
                    though built in Justinian’s reign, and containing mosaic pictures of him and
                    Theodora, does not appear to have owed anything to his mind or purse.</p>

                <p>3. Justinian’s ecclesiastical policy was so complex and varying that it is
                    impossible within the limits of this article to do more than indicate its bare
                    outlines. For many years before the accession of his uncle Justin, the Eastern
                    world had been vexed by the struggles of the Monophysite party, who recognized
                    only one nature in Christ, against the view which then and ever since has
                    maintained itself as orthodox, that the divine and human natures coexisted in
                    Him. The latter doctrine had triumphed at the council of Chalcedon, and was held
                    by the whole Western Church, but Egypt, great part of Syria and Asia Minor, and
                    a considerable minority even in Constantinople clung to Monophysitism. The
                    emperors Zeno and Anastasius had been strongly suspected of it, and the Roman
                    bishops had refused to communicate with the patriarchs of Constantinople since
                    484, when they had condemned Acacius for accepting the formula of conciliation
                    issued by Zeno. One of Justinian’s first public acts was to put an end to this
                    schism by inducing Justin to make the then patriarch renounce this formula and
                    declare his full adhesion to the creed of Chalcedon. When he himself came to the
                    throne he endeavoured to persuade the Monophysites to come in by summoning some
                    of their leaders to a conference. This failing, he ejected suspected prelates,
                    and occasionally persecuted them, though with far less severity than that
                    applied to the heretics of a deeper dye, such as Montanists or even Arians. Not
                    long afterwards, his attention having been called to the spread of Origenistic
                    opinions in Syria, he issued an edict condemning fourteen propositions drawn
                    from the writings of the great Alexandrian, and caused a synod to be held under
                    the presidency of Mennas (whom he had named patriarch of Constantinople), which
                    renewed the condemnation of the impugned doctrines and anathematized Origen
                    himself. Still later, he was induced by the machinations of some of the prelates
                    who haunted his court, and by the influence of Theodora, herself much interested
                    in theological questions, and more than suspected of Monophysitism, to raise a
                    needless, mischievous, and protracted controversy. The Monophysites sometimes
                    alleged that they could not accept the decrees of the council of Chalcedon
                    because that council had not condemned, but (as they argued) virtually approved,
                    three writers tainted with Nestorian principles, viz., Theodore of Mopsuestia,
                    Theodoret, and Ibas, bishop of Edessa. It was represented to the emperor, who
                    was still pursued by the desire to bring back the schismatics, that a great step
                    would have been taken towards reconciliation if a condemnation of these
                    teachers, or rather of such of their books as were complained of, could be
                    brought about, since then the Chalcedonian party would be purged from any
                    appearance of sympathy with the errors of Nestorius. Not stopping to reflect
                    that in the angry and suspicious state of men’s minds he was sure to lose as
                    much in one direction as he would gain in the other, Justinian entered into the
                    idea, and put forth an edict exposing and denouncing the errors contained in the
                    writings of Theodore generally, in the treatise of Theodoret against Cyril of
                    Alexandria, and in a letter of Bishop Ibas (a letter whose authenticity was
                    doubted, but which passed under his name) to the Persian bishop Maris. This
                    edict was circulated through the Christian world to be subscribed by the
                    bishops. The four Eastern patriarchs, and the great majority of the Eastern
                    prelates generally, subscribed, though reluctantly, for it was felt that a
                    dangerous precedent was being set when dead authors were anathematized, and that
                    this new movement could hardly fail to weaken the authority of the council of
                    Chalcedon. Among the Western bishops, who were less disposed both to
                    Monophysitism and to subservience, and especially by those of Africa, the edict
                    was earnestly resisted. When it was found that Pope Vigilius did not forthwith
                    comply, he was summoned to Constantinople. Even there he resisted, not so much,
                    it would seem, from any scruples of his own, for he was not a high-minded man,
                    as because he knew that he dared not return to Italy if he gave way. Long
                    disputes and negotiations followed, the end of which was that Justinian summoned
                    a general council of the church, that which we reckon the Fifth, which condemned
                    the impugned writings, and anathematized several other heretical authors. Its
                    decrees were received in the East, but long contested in the Western Church,
                    where a schism arose that lasted for seventy years. This is the controversy
                    known as that of the Three Chapters <hi rend="italic">(Tria capitula,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">τρία</hi> κεφάλαια), apparently from the three propositions or
                    condemnations contained in Justinian’s original edict, one relating to
                    Theodore’s writings and person, the second to the incriminated treatise of
                    Theodoret (whose person was not attacked), the third to the letter (if genuine)
                    of Ibas (see Hefcle, <hi rend="italic">Conciliengeschichte,</hi> ii. 777).</p>
                <p>At the very end of his long career of theological discussion, Justinian himself
                    lapsed into heresy, by accepting the doctrine that the earthly body of Christ
                    was incorruptible, insensible to the weaknesses of the flesh, a doctrine which
                    had been advanced by Julian, bishop of Halicarnassus, and went by the name of
                    Aphthartodocetism. According to his usual practice, he issued an edict enforcing
                    this view, and requiring all patriarchs, metropolitans, and bishops to subscribe
                    to it. Some, who not unnaturally held that it was rank Monophysitism, refused at
                    once, and were deprived of their sees, among them Eutychius the eminent
                    patriarch of Constantinople. Others submitted or temporized; but, before there
                    had been time enough for the matter to be carried through, the emperor died,
                    having tarnished if not utterly forfeited by this last error the reputation won
                    by a life devoted to the service of orthodoxy.</p>
                <p>As no preceding sovereign had been so much interested in church affairs, so none
                    seems to have shown so much activity as a persecutor both of heathens and of
                    heretics. He renewed with additional stringency the laws against both these
                    classes. The former embraced a large part of the rural population in certain
                    secluded districts, such as parts of Asia Minor and Peloponnesus; and we are
                    told that the efforts directed against them resulted in the forcible baptism of
                    seventy thousand persons in Asia Minor alone. Heathenism, however, survived; we
                    find it in Laconia in the end of the 9th century, and in northern Syria it has
                    lasted till our own times. There were also a good many crypto-pagans among the
                    educated population of the capital. Procopius, for instance, if he was not
                    actually a pagan, was certainly very little of a Christian. Inquiries made in
                    the third year of Justinian’s reign drove nearly all of these persons into an
                    outward conformity, and their offspring seem to have become ordinary Christians.
                    At Athens, the philosophers who taught in the schools hallowed by memories of
                    Plato still openly professed what passed for heathenism, though it was really a
                    body of moral doctrine, strongly tinged with mysticism, in which there was far
                    more of Christianity and of the speculative metaphysics of the East than of the
                    old Olympian religion. Justinian, partly from religious motives, partly because
                    he discountenanced all rivals to the imperial university of Constantinople,
                    closed these Athenian schools (529). The professors sought refuge at the court
                    of Chosroes, king of Persia, but were soon so much disgusted by the ideas and
                    practices of the fire-worshippers that they returned to the empire, Chosroes
                    having magnanimously obtained from Justinian a promise that they should be
                    suffered to pass the rest of their days unmolested. Heresy proved more
                    obstinate. The severities directed against the Montanists of Phrygia led to a
                    furious war, in which most of the sectaries perished, while the doctrine was not
                    extinguished. Harsh <pb break="no"

                    from whose effects Palestine had not recovered when conquered by the Arabs in
                    the following century. The Nestorians and the Eutychian Monophysites were not
                    threatened with such severe civil penalties, although their worship was
                    interdicted, and their bishops were sometimes banished; but this vexatious
                    treatment was quite enough to keep them disaffected, and the rapidity of the
                    Mahometan conquests may be partly traced to that alienation of the bulk of the
                    Egyptian and a large part of the Syrian population which dates from Justinian’s
                        persecutions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For a

                <p>4. Justinian was engaged in three great foreign wars, two of them of his own
                    seeking, the third a legacy which nearly every emperor had come into for three
                    centuries, the secular strife of Rome and Persia. The Sassanid kings of Persia
                    ruled a dominion which extended from the confines of Syria to those of India,
                    and from the straits of Oman to the Caucasus. The martial character of their
                    population made them formidable enemies to the Romans, whose troops were at this
                    epoch mainly barbarians, the settled and civilized subjects of the empire being
                    as a rule averse to' war. When Justinian came to the throne, his troops were
                    maintaining an unequal struggle on the Euphrates against the armies of Kobad.
                    After some campaigns, in which the skill of Belisarius obtained considerable
                    successes, a peace was concluded in 533 with Chosroes Anush irvan, who had
                    succeeded Kobad two years before. This lasted till 539, when Chosroes declared
                    war, alleging that Justinian had been secretly intriguing against him with the
                    Ephtha-lite Huns, and doubtless moved by alarm and envy at the victories which
                    the Romans had been gaining in Italy. The emperor was too much occupied in the
                    West to be able adequately to defend his eastern frontier. Chosroes advanced
                    into Syria with little resistance, and in 540 captured Antioch, then the
                    greatest city in Asia, carrying off its inhabitants into captivity. The war
                    continued with varying fortunes for four years more in this quarter; while in
                    the meantime an even fiercer struggle had begun in the mountainous region
                    inhabited by the Lazes at the southeastern corner of the Black Sea. When after
                    two and twenty years of fighting no substantial advantage had been gained by
                    either party, Chosroes agreed in 562 to a peace which left Lazica to the Romans,
                    but under the dishonourable condition of their paying thirty thousand pieces of
                    gold annually to the Persian king. Thus no result of permanent importance flowed
                    from these Persian wars, except that they greatly weakened the Roman empire,
                    increased Justinian’s financial embarrassments, and prevented him from
                    prosecuting with sufficient vigour his enterprises in the West.</p>
                <p>These enterprises had begun in 533 with an attack on the Vandals, who were then
                    reigning in Africa. Belisarius, despatched from Constantinople with a large
                    fleet and army, landed without opposition, and destroyed the barbarian power in
                    two engagements. North Africa from beyond the straits of Gibraltar to the Syrtes
                    became again a Roman province, although the Moorish tribes of the interior
                    maintained a species of independence; and part of southern Spain was also
                    recovered for the empire. The ease with which so important a conquest had been
                    effected encouraged Justinian to attack the Ostrogoths of Italy, whose kingdom,
                    though vast in extent, for it included part of south-eastern Gaul, Rhaetia,
                    Dalmatia, and part of Pannonia, as well as Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica,
                    had been grievously weakened by the death first of the great Theodoric, and some
                    years later of his grandson Athalaric, so that the Gothic nation was practically
                    without a head. Justinian began the war in 535, taking as his pretext the murder
                    of Queen Amalasontha, daughter of Theodoric, who had placed herself under his
                    protection, and alleging that the Ostrogothic kingdom had always owned a species
                    of allegiance to the emperor at Constantinople. There was some foundation for
                    this claim, although of course it could not have been made effective against
                    Theodoric, who was more powerful than his supposed suzerain. Belisarius, who had
                    been made commander of the Italian expedition, overran Sicily, reduced southern
                    Italy, and in 536 occupied Rome. Here he was attacked in the following year by
                    Vitigis, who had been chosen king by the Goths, with a greatly superior force.
                    After a siege of more than a year, the energy, skill, and courage of Belisarius,
                    and the sickness which was preying on his troops, obliged Vitigis to retire.
                    Belisarius pursued his diminished army northwards, shut him up in Ravenna, and
                    ultimately received the surrender of that impregnable city. Vitigis was sent
                    prisoner to Constantinople, where Justinian treated him, as he had previously
                    treated the captive Vandal king, with clemency. The imperial administration was
                    established through Italy, but its rapacity soon began to excite discontent, and
                    the kernel of the Gothic nation had not submitted. After two short and
                    unfortunate reigns, the crown had been bestowed on Totila or Baduila, a warrior
                    of distinguished abilities, who by degrees drove the imperial generals and
                    governors out of Italy. Belisarius was sent against him, but with forces too
                    small for the gravity of the situation. He moved from place, to place during
                    several years, but saw city after city captured by or open its gates to Totila,
                    till only Ravenna, Otranto, and Ancona remained. Justinian was occupied by the
                    ecclesiastical controversy of the Three Chapters, and had not the money to fit
                    out a proper army and fleet; indeed, it may be doubted whether he would ever
                    have roused himself to the necessary exertions but for the presence at
                    Constantinople of a knot of Roman exiles, who kept urging him to reconquer
                    Italy, representing that with their help and the sympathy of the people it would
                    not be a difficult enterprise. The emperor at last complied, and in 552 a
                    powerful army was despatched under Narses, an Armenian eunuch now advanced in
                    life, but reputed the most skilful general of the age, as Belisarius was the
                    hottest soldier. He marched along the coast of the Gulf of Venice, and
                    encountered the army of Totila at Taginae, not far from Cesena. Totila was
                    slain, and the Gothic cause irretrievably lost. The valiant remains of the
                    nation made anotherstand under Teiason the Lactarian hillin Campania; after that
                    they disappear from history. Italy was recovered for the empire, but it was an
                    Italy terribly impoverished and depopulated, whose possession carried little
                    strength with it. Justinian’s policy both in the Vandalic and in the Gothic war
                    stands condemned by the result. The resources of the state, which might better
                    have been spent in defending the northern frontier against Slavs and Huns and
                    the eastern frontier against Persians, were consumed in the conquest of two
                    countries which had suffered too much to be of any substantial value, and which,
                    separated by language as well as by intervening seas, could not be permanently
                    retained. However, Justinian must have been almost preternaturally wise to have
                    foreseen this: his conduct was in the circumstances only what might have been
                    expected from an ambitious prince who perceived an opportunity of recovering
                    territories that had formerly belonged to the empire, and over which its rights
                    were conceived to be only suspended.</p>
                <p>Besides these three great foreign wars, Justinian’s reign was troubled by a
                    constant succession of border inroads, especially on the northern frontier,
                    where the various Slavonic and Hunnish tribes who were established along <pb

                    the Black Sea made frequent marauding expeditions into Thrace and Macedonia,
                    sometimes penetrating as far as the walls of Constantinople in one direction and
                    the isthmus of Corinth in another. Immense damage was inflicted by these
                    marauders on the subjects of the empire, who seem to have been mostly too
                    peaceable to defend themselves, and whom the emperor conld not spare troops
                    enough to protect. Fields were laid waste, villages burnt, large numbers of
                    people carried into -captivity; and on one occasion the capital was itself in
                    danger.</p>
                <p>It only remains to say something regarding Justinian’s personal character and
                    capacities, with regard to which a great diversity of opinion has existed among
                    .historians. The civilians, looking on him as a patriarch of their science, have
                    as a rule extolled his wisdom and virtues; while ecclesiastics of the Roman
                    Church, from Cardinal Baronius downwards, have been offended by his arbitrary
                    conduct towards the popes, and by his last lapse into heresy, and have therefore
                    been disposed to accept the stories which ascribe to him perfidy, cruelty,
                    rapacity, and extravagance. The difficulty of arriving at a fair conclusion is
                    increased by the fact that Procopius, who is our chief authority for the events
                    of his reign, speaks with a very different voice in his secret memoirs (the <hi
                        rend="italic">Anecdotal)</hi> from that which he has used in his published
                    history, and that some of the accusations contained in the former work are so
                    rancorous and improbable that a certain measure of discredit attaches to
                    everything which it contains. The truth seems to be that Justinian was not a
                    great ruler in the higher sense of the word, that is to say, a man of large
                    views, deep insight, a capacity for forming just such plans as the circumstances
                    needed, and carrying them out by a skilful adaptation of means to ends. But he
                    was a man of considerable abilities, wonderful activity of mind, and admirable
                    industry. He was interested in many things, and threw himself with ardour into
                    whatever he took up; he contrived schemes quickly, and pushed them on with an
                    energy which usually made them succeed when no long time was needed, for, if a
                    project was delayed, there was a risk of his tiring of it and dropping it.
                    Although vain and full of selfconfidence, he was easily led by those who knew
                    how to get at him, and particularly by his wife. She exercised over him that
                    influence which a stronger character always exercises over a weaker, whatever
                    their respective positions; and unfortunately it was seldom a good influence,
                    for Theodora seems to have been a woman who, with all her brilliant gifts of
                    intelligence and manner, hadno principles and no pity. Justinian was rather
                    quick than strong or profound; his policy does not strike one as the result of
                    deliberate and well-considered, views, but dictated by the hopes and fancies of
                    the moment. His activity was in so far a misfortune as it led him to attempt too
                    many things at once, and engage in undertakings so costly that oppression became
                    necessary to provide the funds for them. Even his devotion to work, which
                    excites our admiration in the centre of a luxurious court, was to a great extent
                    unprofitable, for it was mainly given to theological controversies which neither
                    he nor any one else could settle. Still, after making all deductions, it is
                    plain that the man who accomplished so much, and kept the whole world so
                    occupied, as Justinian did during the thirty-eight years of his reign, mqst have
                    possessed no common abilities. He was affable and easy of approach to all his
                    subjects, with a pleasant address; nor does he seem to have been, like his wife,
                    either cruel or revengeful. We hear several times of his sparing those who had
                    conspired against him. But he was not scrupulous in the means he employed, and
                    he was willing to maintain in power detestable ministers if only they served him
                    efficiently and filled his coffers. His chief passion, after that for his own
                    fame and glory, seems to have been for theology and religion; it was in this
                    field that his literary powers exerted themselves (for he wrote controversial
                    treatises and hymns), and his taste also, for among his numerous buildings the
                    churches are those on which he spent most thought and money. Considering that
                    his legal reforms are those by which his name is mainly known to posterity, it
                    is curious that we should have hardly any information as to his’legal knowledge,
                    or the share which he took in those reforms. In person he was somewhat above the
                    middle height, well-shaped, with plenty of fresh colour in his cheeks, and an
                    extraordinary power of doing without food and sleep. He spent most of the night
                    in reading or writing, and would sometimes go for a day with no food but a few
                    green herbs. Two mosaic figures of him exist at Ravenna, one in the apse of the
                    church of S. Vitale, the other in the church of S. Apollinare in ITrbe; but of
                    course one cannot be sure how far in such a stiff material the portrait fairly
                    represents the original. He had no children by his marriage with Theodora, and
                    did not many after her decease. On his°death, which took place November 14,
                    5.65, the crown passed to his nephew Justin II.</p>
