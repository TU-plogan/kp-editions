                <p><label type="entry">JEPHTHAH</label> (∏∏5), Ιe&lt;∕&gt;0dε), one of the “judges”
                    of Israel, was an illegitimate son of “Gilead,” and, being expelled from his
                    father’s house by his lawful brethren, took refuge in the Syrian land of Tob,
                    where he gathered around him a powerful band of homeless men like himself. The
                    Ammonites pressing hard on his countrymen, the “elders of Gilead” called for his
                    help, which he consented to give on condition that in the event of victory the
                    supremacy should be conferred upon him. The success of his arms was complete,
                    and he became in consequence “judge” of Israel until his death six years
                    afterwards. His name is best known in history and literature in connexion with
                    his “vow,” which led to the sacrifice of his daughter as a burnt offering on his
                    return from the war. Much reluctance has been, and continues to be, shown by
                    many writers in accepting the plain sense of the Scripture narrative on this
                    point, —reluctance which proceeds to a large extent on unwarranted assumptions
                    as to the stage of ethical development which had been reached in Israel in the
                    period of the judges, or at the time when the narrative took shape. Several
                    modern writers, on the other hand, are disposed to find a mythical element in
                    the history of Jephthah. In this connexion weight has been laid on his name,
                    “the opener,” on the fact that Gilead is not a personal name, and particularly
                    on the circumstance that what is related about his daughter appears to be the
                    popular explanation of a ceremony closely allied to well-known rites connected
                    with solar mythology. The story of Jephthah is told in Judg. X. 15-xii. 7; a
                    great part of this section of that book, however, is occupied with an allocution
                    (xi. 14-27) to the children of Ammon which almost certainly belongs to a later
                    hand.</p>
