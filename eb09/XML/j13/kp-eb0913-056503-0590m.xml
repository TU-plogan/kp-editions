                    he studied for a short time at the Jesuit college; but afterwards, becoming
                    dissatisfied with the doctrines there taught on the hotly discussed questions of
                    free will and grace, he transferred himself to the college of Adrian VI., where
                    he came under the influence of a pious and learned teacher, Jacobus Jansonius by
                    name, who is described as having been an ardent disciple of Augustine and a
                    follower of Michael Bajus (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Ba jus),</hi> whose
                    doctrinal views had been condemned by Pius V. and Gregory XIII. At the same time
                    he formed an acquaintance, which grew into intimate friendship, with the
                    likeminded Vergerius (see Du <hi rend="smallcaps">Vergier de Hauranne),</hi> who
                    afterwards became abbé of St Cyran. Having graduated in philosophy at Louvain in
                    1604, Jansen went to Paris for the benefit of his health, which had suffered
                    from the ardour with which he had pursued his studies in theology with a view to
                    a doctor’s degree. Here he remained for some time, supporting himself by
                    teaching; afterwards he accompained Vergerius to Bayonne, the native place of
                    the latter, where they spent several years together, Du Vergier ultimately
                    becoming canon of the cathedral, and Jansen head of the episcopal college. Every
                    available moment of their time was devoted to the study of the fathers and
                    especially of Augustine. In 1617 Jansen returned to Louvain, whither he had been
                    urgently summoned by Jansonius, who greatly desired to have there a man of real
                    learning and energy who should be able to counteract the growing influence of
                    the Jesuits. On his arrival he undertook the principal charge of the newly
                    founded college of St Pulcheria, but this appointment he did not long retain,
                    feeling, it is said, a growing aversion to philosophical pursuits, and desiring
                    to possess the utmost possible leisure that he might devote himself wholly to
                    theology. In 1619 he became doctor in that faculty. The reputation which he even
                    then enjoyed as a theologian is well indicated by the fact that he was formally
                    requested by the papal nuncio to undertake a reply to the recently published <hi
                    rend="italic">De Republica</hi><hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastica</hi> of Marco
                    Antonio de Dominis, archbishop of Spalatro, while the direction in which his
                    sympathies so strongly ran was at the same time not obscurely indicated by the
                    fact that he excused himself from complying with the invitation. In 1624, and
                    again in 1626, he undertook a journey to Spain, on behalf of the university,
                    with reference to certain encroachments of the Jesuits on its exclusive
                    privileges; in the second of these missions he was successful, the members of
                    the Society of Jesus in the Low Countries being ordered to continue to observe
                    the restrictions which had been laid upon them in 1612. In 1630 Jansen was made
                    regius professor of Biblical exegesis; and in the same year, in connexion with
                    the recent introduction of the Reformed religion into Bois-le-Duc, he entered
                    upon a controversy about Protestantism with the learned Voetius, the issue of
                    which conclusively showed that he had grievously underestimated his adversary’s
                    strength. In 1635 he published a pseudonymous work entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alexandri Patricii</hi><hi rend="italic">Arma-cani,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Theologi,</hi><hi rend="italic">Mars</hi><hi rend="italic">Gallicus,

                    Regis Gallise libri</hi><hi rend="italic">duo,</hi> embodying an argument and
                    remonstrance against the policy of France in its recent alliance with the
                    Protestant Gustavus Adolphus. For this supposed service to Spain he was rewarded
                    in 1636 with the bishopric of Ypres. He was preparing for the press his great
                    work upon St Augustine, which had occupied him for twenty-two years, when he was
                    cut off by sudden illness on May 6, 1638. By his last will the MSS. of this work
                    were bequeathed to his chaplain Lamaeus, and his friends Fromondus and Calenus,
                    to be published “quam fidelissime”; at the same time he declared his obedience
                    to the Roman See should any alterations be desired.</p>
                <p>The title of the first work of Jansen against Voetius was <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alexi-phαrmαcon</hi>; it called forth <hi rend="italic">Notae</hi><hi

                    >Desperata</hi><hi rend="italic">Causa Ρapatus</hi> in 1635, Jansen handed over
                    the further management of the controversy to Fromond, whose <hi rend="italic"
