                    Francisco</hi></label> (1436-1517), cardinal and statesman, was born in 1436 at
                    Torrelaguna in Castile, of good but poor family. He studied at Alcala de Henares
                    and afterwards at Salamanca; and in 1459, having entered holy orders, he went to
                    Rome. Returning to Spain in 1465, he brought with him an “expective” letter from
                    the pope, in virtue of which he took possession of the archpriestship of Uzeda
                    in the diocese of Toledo in 1473. Carillo, archbishop of Toledo, opposed him,
                    and on his obstinate refusal to give way threw him into prison. For six years
                    Jimenes held out, and at length in 1480 Carillo restored him to his beüefice.
                    This Jimenes exchanged almost at once for a chaplaincy at Siguenza, under
                    Cardinal Mendoza, .bishop of Siguenza, who shortly appointed him vicar-general
                    of the diocese. In that position Jimenes won golden opinions from ecclesiastic
                    and layman; and he seemed to be on the sure road to distinction among the
                    secular clergy, when he abruptly resolved to become a monk. Throwing up all his
                    benefices, and changing his baptismal name Gonzales for that of Francisco, he
                    entered the Franciscan monastery of San Juan de los Reyes, recently founded by
                    Ferdinand and Isabella at Toledo. Not content with the ordinary severities of
                    the noviciate, he added voluntary austerities. He slept on the bare ground, wore
                    a hair-shirt, doubled his fasts, and scourged himself with much fervour; indeed
                    throughout his whole life, even when at the acme of his greatness, his private
                    life was most rigorously ascetic. The report of his sanctity brought crowds to
                    confess to him; but from them he retired to the lonely monastery of Our Lady of
                    Castanar; and he even built with his own hands a rude hut in the neighbouring
                    woods, in which he lived at times as an anchorite. He was afterwards guardian of
                    a monastery at Salzeda. Meanwhile Mendoza (now archbishop of Toledo) had not
                    forgotten him; and in 1492 he recommended him to Isabella as her confessor. The
                    queen sent for Jimenes, was pleased with him, and to his great reluctance forced
                    the office upon him. The post was politically important, for Isabella submitted
                    to the judgment of her father-confessor not only her private affairs but also
                    matters of state. Jimenes’s severe sanctity soon won him considerable influence
                    over Isabella; and thus it was that he first emerged into political life. In
                    1494 the queen’s confessor was appointed provincial of the order of St Francis,
                    and at once set about reducing the laxity of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conventual</hi> to the strictness of the <hi rend="italic">Obserυantirιe</hi>
                    Franciscans. As was to be expected, intense opposition was offered, and
                    continued even after Jimenes became archbishop of Toledo. The general of the
                    order himself came from Rome to interfere with the archbishop’s measures of
                    reform, but the stern inflexibility of Jimenes, backed by the influence of the
                    queen, met and subdued every obstacle. Cardinal Mendoza had died in 1495, and
                    Isabella had secretly procured a papal bull nominating her confessor to his
                    diocese of Toledo, the richest and most powerful in Spain, second perhaps to no
                    other dignity of the Roman church save the papacy. Long and sincerely Jimenes
                    strove to evade the honour; but his <hi rend="italic">nolo episcopari</hi> was
                    after six months overcome by a second bull ordering him to accept consecration.
                    With the primacy of Spain was associated the lofty dignity of high chancellor of
                    Castile; but Jimenes still maintained his lowly life; and, although a message
                    from Rome required him to live in a style befitting his rank, the outward pomp
                    only concealed his private asceticism, just as his splendid robes covered his
                    monk’s frock. In 1499 Jimenes accompanied the court to Granada, and there
                    eagerly joined the mild and pious Archbishop Talavera in his efforts to convert
                    the Moors. Talavera had begun with gentle measures, but Jimenes preferred to
                    proceed by haranguing the <hi rend="italic">fakihs</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> or doctors of religion, and loading them with gifts.
                    Outwardly the latter method was successful; in two months the converts were so
                    numerous that they had to be baptized by aspersion. The indignation of the
                    unconverted Moors swelled into open revolt. Jimenes was besieged in his house,
                    and the utmost difficulty was found in quieting the city. Baptism or exile was
                    offered to the Moors as a punishment for rebellion. The majority accepted
                    baptism; and Isabella, who had been momentarily annoyed at her archbishop’s
                    imprudence, was satisfied that he had done good service to Christianity.</p>
                <p>On November 26, 1504, Isabella died. Ferdinand at once resigned the title of king
                    of Castile in favour of his daughter Joan and her husband the archduke Philip,
                    assuming instead that of regent. Philip was keenly jealous of Ferdinand’s
                    pretensions to the regency; and it required all the tact of Jimenes to bring
                    about a friendly interview between the princes. Ferdinand finally retired from
                    Castile; and, though Jimenes remained, his political weight was less than
                    before. The sudden death of Philip in September 1506 quite overset the already
                    tottering intellect of his wife; his son and heir Charles was still a child; and
                    Ferdinand was at Naples. The nobles of Castile, mutually jealous, agreed to
                    entrust affairs to the archbishop of Toledo, who, moved more by patriotic regard
                    for his country’s welfare than by special friendship for Ferdinand, strove to
                    establish the final influence of that king in Castile. Ferdinand did not return
                    till August 1507; and with him he brought a cardinal’s hat for Jimenes. Shortly
                    afterwards the new cardinal of Spain was appointed grand inquisitor-general for
                    Castile and Leon. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Inquisition.</hi></p>
                <p>The next great event in the cardinal’s life was the expedition against the
                    Moorish city of Oran in the north of Africa, in which his religious zeal was
                    supported by the prospect of the political and material gain that would accrue
                    to Spain from the possession of such a station. A preliminary expedition,
                    equipped, like the following, at the expense of Jimenes, captured the port of
                    Mers-el-Kebir in 1506; and in 1509 a strong force, accompanied by the cardinal
                    in person (now in his seventy-second year), set sail for Africa, and in one day
                    the wealthy city was taken by storm. Though the army remained to make fresh
                    conquests, Jimenes returned to Spain, and occupied himself with the
                    administration of his diocese, and in endeavouring to recover from the regent
                    the expenses of his Oran expedition. On January 23, 1516, Ferdinand died,
                    leaving Jimenes as regent of Castile for Charles (afterwards Charles V.), then a
                    youth of sixteen in the Netherlands. Though Jimenes at once took firm hold of
                    the reins of government, and ruled <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n727/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0727-0694"/> in a determined and even autocratic manner, the
                    haughty and turbulent Castilian nobility and the jealous intriguing Flemish
                    councillors of Charles combined to render his position peculiarly difficult;
                    while the evils consequent upon the unlimited demands of Charles for money threw
                    much undeserved odium upon the regent. In violation of the laws, Jimenes acceded
                    to Charles’s desire to be proclaimed king; he secured the person of Charles’s
                    younger brother Ferdinand; he fixed the seat of the cortes at Madrid; and he
                    established a standing army by drilling the citizens of the great towns.
                    Immediately on Ferdinand’s death, Adrian, dean of Louvain, afterwards pope,
                    produced a commission from Charles appointing him regent. Jimenes admitted him
                    to a nominal equality, but took care that neither he nor the subsequent
                    commissioners of Charles ever had any real share of the power. In September 1517
                    Charles landed in the province of Asturias, and Jimenes hastened to meet him. On
                    the way, however, he fell ill, not without a suspicion of poison. While thus
                    feeble, he received a letter from Charles coldly thanking him for his services,
                    and giving him leave to retire to his diocese, A few hours after this virtual
                    dismissal, which some, however, say the cardinal never saw, Francisco Jimenes
                    died at Roa, November 8, 1517.</p>
                <p>Jimenes was a bold and determined statesman. Sternly and inflexibly, with a
                    confidence that became at times overbearing, he carried through what he had
                    decided to be right, with as little regard for the convenience of others as for
                    his own. In the midst of a corrupt clergy his morals were irreproachable. He was
                    liberal to all, and founded and maintained very many benevolent institutions in
                    his diocese. His whole time was devoted either to the state or to religion; his
                    only recreation was in theological or schola*stic discussion. Perhaps one of the
                    most noteworthy points about the cardinal is the advanced period of life at
                    which he entered upon the stage where he was to play such leading parts. Whether
                    his abrupt change from the secular to the regular clergy was the fervid outcome
                    of religious enthusiasm or the far-seeing move of a wily schemer has been
                    disputed; but the constant austerity of his life, his unvarying superiority to
                    small personal aims, are arguments for the former alternative that are not to be
                    met by merely pointing to the actual honours and power he at last attained.</p>
                <p>His services to learning and literature have yet to be noted. In 1500 was
                    founded, and in 1508 was opened the university of Alcala de Henares, which,
                    fostered by Cardinal Jimenes, at whose sole expense it was raised, attained a
                    great pitch of outward magnificence and internal worth. At one time 7000
                    students met within its walls. In 1836 the university was removed to Madrid, and
                    the costly buildings were left vacant. In the hopes of supplanting the romances
                    generally found in the hands of the young, Jimenes caused to be published
                    religious treatises by himself and others. He revived also the Mozarabic
                    liturgy, and endowed a chapel at Toledo, in which it was to be used. But his
                    most famous literary service was the printing at Alcala (in Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">Complutum)</hi> of the Complutensian Polyglott, the first edition
                    of the Christian Scriptures in the original text.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In this work, on which he is said to have
                    expended half a million of ducats, the cardinal was aided by the celebrated
                    Stunica (D. Lopez de Zuniga), the Greek scholar Nunez de Guzman (Pincianus), the
                    Hebraist Vergara, and the humanist Nebrija, by a Cretan Greek Demetrius Ducas,
                    and by three Jewish converts, of whom Zamora edited the Targum to the
                    Pentateuch. The other Targums are not included. In the Old Testament Jerome’s
                    version stands between the Greek and Hebrew. The synagogue and the Eastern
                    Church, as the preface expresses it, are set like the thieves on this side and
                    on that, with Jesus (that is, the Roman Church) in the midst. The text occupies
                    five volumes, and a sixth contains a Hebrew lexicon, &amp;c. The work commenced
                    in 1502. The New Testament was finished in January 1514, and the whole in April
                    1517. It was dedicated to Leo X., whose permission to publish was so tardy that
                    the book did not come before the public till 1522. The MSS. on which the Hebrew
                    text was based are still at Madrid; the history of those used for the New.
                    Testament has long been a problem, but the story that they were sold to a
                    fireworks maker appears to be a fable. See Delitzsch’s unfinished studies on the
                    subject (London, 1872, and Leipsic, 1878).</p></note></p>
