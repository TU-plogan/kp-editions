                <p><label type="entry">JILOLO, <hi rend="smallcaps">Gilolo</hi>, or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Djilolo</hi></label> (properly Jailolo or Djailolo, and in the
                    native tongue <hi rend="italic">Halmahera</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Halema-hera,
                    i.e.,</hi> the mother or great land), is one of the larger islands of the East
                    Indian archipelago,’forming part administratively of the Dutch residency of
                    Ternate. The equator cuts across the southern peninsula, the most northerly
                    point of the island lying in 2° 13' N. lat., and the southern extremity in 0°
                    52' S. A large proportion of Jilolo is practically <hi rend="italic">terra
                    incognita,</hi> though information has somewhat accumulated since Wallace
                    complained in 1856 of the smallness of our knowledge in regard to it. The area
                    is stated at 6410 square miles; the extreme irregularity of the outline,
                    however, renders the estimate a peculiarly precarious one. Jilolo may be said to
                    consist of four peninsulas so arranged as to enclose three great bays (Kaou,
                    Bitjoli, Weda), all opening towards the east,—the northern peninsula being
                    connected with the others by an isthmus only 5 miles wide. On the western side
                    of the isthmus lies another bay, that of Dodinga, in the mouth of which are
                    situated the two islands Ternate and Tidore, whose political celebrity so far
                    exceeds that of their larger neighbour Jilolo. To the north-east of the northern
                    peninsula we have the considerable island of Morotai, and to the west of the
                    southern peninsula the far more important island of Batchian. The northern
                    peninsula is full of mountain chains, which give clear evidence of former
                    volcanic activity; and at least one of the summits, Tolo or Gunong Api (3000
                    feet), was not quite extinct in the 16th century according to Valentijn’s
                    report. At present the crater, as described by Bernstein, is 200 feet deep, and
                    contains a small lake. Gunong Tabello is higher than Tolo, and Gunong Mamuya has
                    a similar altitude. In the south of the peninsula lies a lake, Talaga Lamo (the
                    Tela-galina of Bernstein’s account), about 4 or 5 miles long. The principal
                    village is Galela, situated on a bay of the same name on the east coast, in a
                    well-cultivated plain which extends southward and inland. The three remaining
                    peninsulas, which have been less explored, seem to be hardly so mountainous. The
                    whole island is clothed with a prolific vegetation, some of the more important
                    features of which will be found described in Teysmann’s paper in the Report of
                    the Botanic Garden at Buitenzorg. Rice is grown by the natives, but the sago
                    tree is of far greater importance to them.</p>
                <p>The people of Jilolo are for the most part pagans, living in a very backward
                    state of civilization. Attempts to Christianize them have been made with but
                    small success by the missionaries of the Utrecht Society, who have their chief
                    stations at Swakenora and Dokolamo, near Lake Talaga Lamo (see <hi rend="italic"
                    >Berigten</hi><hi rend="italic">der</hi><hi rend="italic">Utrechlsehe
                    Zendingsvereeniging,</hi> 1869). Μ. Achille Raffray gives the following
                    description of the Halmaherians in <hi rend="italic">Tour du Monde,</hi> 1879,
                    where photographs of a number of the natives will be found. “They are as unlike
                    the Malays as we are, excelling them in tallness of stature and elegance of
                    shape, and being perfectly distinguished by their oval face, with a fairly high
                    and open brow, their aquiline nose, and their horizontally placed eyes. Their
                    beards are sometimes thick; their limbs are muscular; the colour of their skins
                    is cinnamon brown. Spears of iron-wood, abundantly barbed, and small bows and
                    bamboo arrows free from <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n726/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0726-0693"/> poison are their principal weapons.” According to
                    Teysmann they have temples <hi rend="italic">{sabuas)</hi> in which they suspend
                    images of serpents and other monsters as well as the trophies procured by war.
                    They believe in a better life hereafter, but have no idea of a hell or a devil,
                    their evil spirits only tormenting them in the present state.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese and Spaniards were better acquainted with Jilolo than with many
                    other parts of the archipelago; they called it sometimes Batu China and
                    sometimes Moro. It was circumnavigated by one of their vessels in 1525, and the
                    general outline of the coasts is correctly given in their maps at a time when
                    separate portions of Celebes, such as Macassar and Menado, are represented as
                    distinct islands. The current name of the island (Jilolo) was really that of a
                    native state, the sultan of which had the chief rank among the princes of the
                    Moluccas before he was supplanted by the sultan of Ternate about 1380. His
                    capital, Jilolo, lay on the west coast on the first bay to the north of that of
                    Dodinga. In 1876 Danu Hassan, a descendant of the sultans of Jilolo, raised an
                    insurrection in the island for the purpose of throwing off the authority of the
                    sultans of Tidore and Ternate; and his efforts would probably have been
                    successful but for the intervention of the Dutch.</p>
