                    (1747-1792), was born July 6, 1747, on the estate of Arbigland, in the parish of
                    Kirkbean and the stewartry of Kirkcudbright, Scotland, where his father, John
                    Paul, was gardener. At twelve he went to sea as apprentice to a merchant of
                    Whitehaven, in whose ships he visited America several times. He became a skilful
                    sailor, and was for some time mate of a slaver in the West Indies. On his way
                    back to England, after leaving the slave trade in disgust, the captain and mate
                    of the ship in which he was both died; and the skilful manner in which Paul
                    Jones brought the ship safely into port induced the owners to appoint him
                    captain. In 1773, having for some unknown reason assumed the cognomen Jones, he
                    settled in Virginia, on a property which had fallen to him on the death of an
                    older brother. When the American war of independence broke out two years later,
                    Jones took up arms for the colonies, and accepted a command in the navy of the
                    new republic. He did good service against his native land, and in 1777 was sent
                    to France to receive a more important command. Disappointed in that, he sailed
                    in 1778 to the English coast in his ship “Ranger,” and availed himself of his
                    early knowledge to land at Whitehaven, where, however, he was unsuccessful in
                    his attempt to fire the shipping. Next year he sailed on a similar expedition in
                    the “Bonhomme Richard,” along with other vessels, and, steering up the Firth of
                    Forth, was only prevented by a strong westerly gale from attacking Leith. On his
                    way south again he fell in, off Flamborough Head, with the English ship
                    “Serapis,” which after a long and bloody combat he compelled to strike. That
                    exploit raised his fame to its acme. On his return to Paris he was fêted and
                    caressed by the best society; and Louis XVI. presented him with a gold-hilted
                    sword, and decorated him with the military Order of Merit. After some time spent
                    in America, where he was much chagrined by the neglect that met his boastful
                    requests for further employment, Paul Jones returned to Paris as agent for all
                    prizes taken in Europe under his own command. While he resumed his efforts to
                    pose as a man of <hi rend="italic">ton,</hi> he attended carefully to his
                    duties. A favourable report to Congress as to his naval services was followed by
                    a vote of a gold medal from that body in 1786. In 1788 the Chevalier Jones
                    entered the service of the empress Catherine of Russia, and became as
                    enthusiastic a Russian as he had been an American. He was appointed to a command
                    in the Black Sea, with the rank of rear-admiral, to act against the Turks; but
                    the jealousy and rivalry of the Russian commanders brought about his recall in
                    less than eight months. Summoned to St Petersburg, on pretext of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0772-0739"/> receiving a post in the North Sea, he was left in
                    restless idleness, until at last two years’ formal leave of absence was granted
                    him. On this virtual dismissal, Paul Jones retired to Paris, soured and
                    disappointed; and after two years spent in fruitlessly importuning the Russian
                    court, he died in that city ofi July 18, 1792.</p>
                <p>Paul Jones is described as a “short, thick, little fellow, about 5 feet 8 inches
                    in height, of a dark swarthy complexion.” Naval skill and bravery he certainly
                    had, but his letters prove him to have been boastful and quarrelsome. He writhed
                    under the suspicion of being an “adventurer once and again he eagerly repels the
                    charge. English contemporary accounts generally speak of him as a pirate; and,
                    though he certainly ranked as an officer of the United States, the independent
                    manner in which he cruised might well suggest letters of marque rather than a
                    Government commission.</p>
                <p>The life of Paul Jones has given rise to much romance. Cooper, Dumas, and Allan
                    Cunningham have celebrated him in their novels; and scarcely less fictitious are
                    some of his so-called biographies. The most authentic seems to be the <hi
