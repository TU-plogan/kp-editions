                <p><label type="entry">JAMES IV</label>. (1472-1513), king of Scotland, son of James
                    III., was born March 17, 1472, and on the death of his father in 1488 was
                    crowned king at Scone, probably on June 26th. As he not only adopted an entirely
                    opposite policy with the nobles from his father, but also showed great
                    affability towards the lower classes of his subjects, among whom he delighted to
                    wander incognito, few kings of Scotland won such general popularity or passed a
                    reign so untroubled by intestine broils. His libertinism was overlooked on
                    account of his open and friendly bearing, and was to some extent atoned for by
                    his hardiness and courage and his just and temperate rule. So slight were the
                    attempts at insurrection on his accession to the throne that they scarcely
                    required repression; and, although in 1491 Lord Bothwell and others entered into
                    an agreement with Henry VII. to seize his person, the circumstances were always
                    such as either not to require or not to favour the carrying out of the project.
                    Indeed, Henry seems throughout to have greatly preferred the friendship of the
                    Scotch monarch either to his active hostility or his enforced submission; and
                    accordingly, although James-had welcomed “Perkin Warbeck,” the pretender to the
                    English throne, and made a futile invasion of England in support of his claims,
                    Henry after Warbeck left Scotland in 1497 was willing to forget all old causes
                    of enmity. In September of that year a truce of seven years was negotiated
                    between the two monarchs, and in August 1503 the alliance was confirmed by the
                    marriage of James with the princess Margaret of England,—a union which led
                    eventually in default of the Tudors to the accession of the Stuart dynasty to
                    the English throne. Of the peace with England James took advantage to establish
                    order in the Highlands, where he introduced a more complete legal jurisdiction.
                    After the accession of Henry VIII. it became apparent that the friendly
                    relations with England were no longer possible; and, James, having several
                    private grounds of quarrel, was induced by the king of France to venture in 1513
                    on an invasion of England. His methods of warfare seem, however, to have been
                    formed chiefly according to notions borrowed from the knightly tourneys, the
                    organization of which had made him famous throughout Europe; and on the
                    threshold of his enterprise he was slain on the 9th September at Flodden Field,
                    his death and the disastrous rout of his army being due to his rash and quixotic
                    bravery.</p>
