                    old he was sent to Harrow, where he soon far excelled all his school-fellows in
                    every branch of study. But the classical routine of a public school failed to
                    satisfy the ardent thirst for knowledge displayed by the boy from his earliest
                    childhood. He accordingly began to apply himself, during the last three years of
                    his life at Harrow, to the study of Oriental languages, teaching himself the
                    rudiments of Arabic, and becoming sufficiently familiar with Hebrew to be able
                    to read that language with tolerable ease. The greater part of his vacations he
                    devoted to the improvement of his acquaintance with French and Italian by
                    assiduously practising composition in those tongues. In 1764 young Jones went to
                    Oxford and entered University College, where he continued to prosecute his
                    studies with unabated vigour. Though obliged to give up a considerable portion
                    of his time to the classical studies required by the university course, he still
                    directed his attention chiefly to Oriental literature, particularly to Persian
                    and Arabic. In acquiring the latter language he received effective assistance
                    from a Syrian named Mirza, whom he discovered in London and brought with him to
                    Oxford. Meanwhile, however, not content with all this work, he managed to make
                    considerable progress in Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese. At nineteen he left
                    Oxford to become tutor to Earl Spencer’s eldest son, and remained with that
                    nobleman’s family for five years. In 1766 Jones obtained a fellowship which
                    placed him in a position of independence, and enabled him to give his undivided
                    attention to his linguistic pursuits. On his return from a short visit to the
                    Continent, where he picked up some knowledge of German, he began the study of
                    Chinese, and made himself master of the radical characters of that language.
                    Though not more than twenty-two years of age, he was already becoming famous for
                    his acquirements as a linguist and Oriental scholar. Accordingly when Christian
                    VII., king of Denmark, visited England in 1768, bringing with him a life of
                    Nadir Shah in Persian, Jones was requested to render the MS. into French. He
                    agreed, and the translation appeared in 1770, with an introduction containing a
                    description of Asia and a short history of Persia (2 vols. 8vo; new ed., 1790).
                    This was followed in the same year by a treatise in French on Oriental poetry,
                    and by a metrical translation, in the same language, of the odes of Hafiz.</p>
                <p>For some time Jones had been thinking of taking up the law as a profession, and,
                    having now finally decided on doing so, he became a member of the Temple. About
                    this time the French Orientalist, Anquetil Du Perron, published his translation
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Zend Avesta,</hi> in the introduction to which he made
                    an unjustifiable attack on Oxford. Jones, taking on himself the defence of his
                    university, addressed an anonymous letter in French to Du Perron, in which he
                    convicted that scholar of unwarrantable invective and wilful misrepresentation.
                    It is a remarkable proof of Jones’s great talent for languages that the racy and
                    idiomatic style of the French in this pamphlet led several foreign <hi
                    rend="italic">saνans</hi> to attribute it to the pen of some <hi rend="italic"
                    >bel</hi><hi rend="italic">esprit</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n773/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0773-0740"/> of the French capital. In the same year appeared
                    his grammar of the Persian language (9th ed., with corrections and additions by
                    Samuel Lee, D.D., Lond., 1828), which is still considered one of the best
                    text-books on the subject. In 1772 Jones published a small volume of poems,
                    chiefly translations from Asiatic languages, together with two elegant essays on
                    the poetry of Eastern nations and on the arts commonly called imitative. His
                    next publication, which appeared in 1774, was a treatise entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Poeseos</hi><hi rend="italic">Asiaticae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >commentariorum· libri</hi><hi rend="italic">sex,</hi> the chief aim of which
                    was to familiarize the European mind with the genius of Oriental poetry.</p>
                <p>Being now admitted to the bar, Jones determined to give up all his energies to
                    his legal studies, and renounced polite literature for some years. Setting to
                    work with the same eagerness which he displayed in the pursuit of all other
                    kinds of knowledge, he made it his endeavour; not merely to master the
                    technicalities of law, but to devote himself to it as a branch of philosophy.
                    Having within two years acquired a considerable legal reputation, he was in 1776
                    appointed commissioner of bankrupts. In 1780 he was induced by his friends to
                    come forward as a candidate for the representation of the university of Oxford
                    in parliament, but he withdrew from the contest before the day of election, as
                    he found he had no chance of success, owing to the liberal principles he held,
                    especially on the questions of the American war and of the slave trade.</p>
                <p>In the winter of 1780-81 he found leisure to complete his translation of the
                    seven ancient Arabic poems called <hi rend="italic">Moallakdt.</hi> Besides
                    writing an <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Law of Bailments,</hi> Jones
                    translated in 1781 the speeches of Isaeus on the right of inheritance, and an
                    Arabian poem on the Mahometan law of succession to the property of intestates,
                    as bearing on his legal studies.</p>
                <p>The hopes which he had for some time entertained of obtaining a seat on the
                    judicial bench in Bengal, were at last gratified on the accession to power of
                    the Shelburne administration, by which he was in 1783 appointed a judge of the
                    supreme court of judicature at Fort William, at the same time receiving the
                    honour of knighthood. Shortly after his arrival in Calcutta he founded, in
                    January 1784, the Asiatic Society, of which he remained president till his
                    death. Convinced as he was of the great importance of consulting the Hindu legal
                    authorities in the original, he lost no time in commencing the study of
                    Sanskrit. Having in a few years made himself complete master of the language, he
                    undertook, in 1788, the task of compiling a digest of Hindu and Mahometan law,
                    the completion of which he did not live to see; the work was finished, however,
                    by Colebrooke, who edited it at Calcutta in 1800 under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Digest of Hindu Laws.</hi> In 1789 Sir William Jones published the
                    first volume of <hi rend="italic">Asiatic Researches</hi> and his translation of
                    <hi rend="italic">Sakuntalâ,</hi> the most famous play of Kâlidâsa, the greatest
                    Indian dramatist. He also translated the well-known collection of fables
                    entitled the <hi rend="italic">Hitopadeςa,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gitagovinda,</hi> an erotic poem by Jayadeva, and considerable portions of the
                    Veda, besides editing the text of the <hi rend="italic">Ritusamhara,</hi> a
                    short but celebrated poem by Kâlidâsa. His last work, which appeared in 1794,
                    was the translation of the <hi rend="italic">Institutes of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Manu,</hi> a compilation of laws and ordinances, dating from the 5th century
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Sir William’s unremitting literary labours,
                    together with the conscientious performance of his heavy judicial work, could
                    not fail to tell on his health after a ten years’ residence in the climate of
                    Bengal; and he was about to return to England when a sudden attack of
                    inflammation of the liver carried him off in the forty-eighth year of his age
                    (April 27, 1794).</p>
                <p>The amount of labour of various kinds which Sir William Jones compressed into the
                    space of a comparatively short life seems almost incredible. In addition to
                    numerous other acquirements, he knew thirteen languages well, and had an
                    elementary acquaintance with twenty-eight others. His capacity for assimilating
                    and reproducing knowledge of every sort was almost unparalleled. But his works,
                    though they display a vast amount of learning, do not bear the stamp of genius.
                    He shows no originality either in discovering new truths or in placing old
                    truths in a new light. Had he concentrated his powers, his extraordinary
                    industry might have secured him greatness in some one branch of knowledge; but
                    their diffusion over too great a surface contributed greatly to that weakness
                    which is so manifest both ∙in his style and in his critical faculty. His chief
                    claim to the remembrance of posterity will rest on the fact that by founding the
                    Asiatic Society he rendered the language and literature of the ancient Hindus
                    accessible to European scholars, and thus became the indirect cause of the
                    splendid achievements in the field of Sanskrit and comparative philology which
                    the present century has witnessed.</p>
                <p>Sir William Jones’s complete works were edited in 1799 (6 vols. 4to), and
                    reprinted in 1807 (13 vols. 8vo). Lord Teignmonth published memoirs of his life,
                    writings, and correspondence in 1807 (new ed. 1835, 2 vols. 8vo); and an
                    autobiography, published by his son, was printed in 1846. (A. A. Μ.)</p>
