                    other Latin poet, with the exception of Virgil, Horace, and perhaps Ovid. The
                    attraction which he has had, not for scholars only, but for men of letters and
                    men of the world, is probably due less to any intrinsic superiority of
                    genius,—for in genius he is not the equal of Lucretius or Catullus,— but to a
                    quality of his writing to which one of the most recent and best of his English
                    editors has drawn attention. “In depicting character,” says Mτ Lewis,<note

                    turns of expression, he is, of all ancient authors, the most distinctly modern.”
                    But besides this attraction, which is due to the fact that he wrote at a time
                    when the interest in social life and manners had superseded that formerly felt
                    in the commonwealth, he has his own peculiar value to students of antiquity. He
                    closes the roll of the great writers of Rome, and is the last vital
                    representative of her national spirit and genius. It is mainly from his
                    representation that the picture of the social life of the imperial city during
                    the first century of our era lives in the imagination of the world: He is the
                    most effective satirist of Rome, not because he was the greatest writer who made
                    satire his theme, but because the age in which he lived supplied the largest
                    material for purely satiric representation, and because his eye was fixed on the
                    more sombre aspects of his time to the exclusion of those happier or more genial
                    aspects which are reflected in the pages of Statius, Martial, and Pliny. The
                    first impression produced by the satire of Juvenal is more powerful than that
                    produced by the satire of Horace, as the impression produced by the tragical and
                    sensational incidents of life is greater than that produced by its ordinary
                    course and its lighter humours. The final verdict as to their relative
                    excellence need not be in accordance with the first impression, but will be
                    determined by the abiding sense of truth and conformity with real life which
                    each representation leaves upon us. But Juvenal does stand prominently out, not
                    in ancient literature only, but in the literature of the world, as the typical
                    example of a social satirist, writing with a serious purpose. The burning
                    indignation to which he attributes the inspiration of his verse, and its not
                    unfrequent accompaniment, the “censure of a sardonic laugh,” are his
                    distinguishing notes.</p>
                <p>Nor is it only in respect of subject-matter and the spirit in which that is
                    treated, but also in respect of literary form and style, that poetical satire
                    finds its typical representative in Juvenal. The systematic treatment of some
                    special topic, the sustained rhetorical pitch, so unlike the natural
                    conversational manner of Horace, at which the treatment is maintained, the
                    strongly-drawn scenes and portraits illustrative of the theme, the effort to
                    make every line effective by point and emphasis, which distinguish some of the
                    great products of modern poetical satire, have their prototype in Juvenal. The
                    frank communicativeness,—the impulse to establish a confidential relation with
                    the reader, —which made the writings of Lucilius appear to a later generation
                    like a “picture of his life” drawn by his own hand, and which gives to the
                    satires of Horace all the charm of an autobiography, has altogether disappeared
                    from the satire of Juvenal, and given place to an attitude almost as impersonal
                    as that assumed in the letters of Junius. And this is the attitude which modern
                    poetical satire for the most part maintains. It commands respect by the boldness
                    and incisiveness of its assaults on classes and individuals, or it gains
                    popularity by gratifying the natural love of detraction, but it leaves to the
                    prose essayist and the novelist the humaner part of acting on the reader through
                    his sympathies.</p>
                <p>This absence from the writings of Juvenal of that personal element which played
                    so large a part in the satires of Lucilius and Horace forces us to depend almost
                    entirely on external evidence for our knowledge of his life. And our available
                    external evidence is unfortunately very meagre and untrustworthy. After
                    reviewing it all and reading it as far as possible by light derived from his own
                    writings, we shall have to acknowledge that we know very little with certainty
                    of his career, that the impression we form of his character and associations is
                    indistinct and perhaps fallacious, and that even the indications which seem to
                    fix the date of the composition of various satires may be misleading. Still, in
                    order to read his writings with full profit and pleasure, we must try to bring
                    ourselves in thought as near to the writer as our knowledge admits of. The ideal
                    presentation of human life and character in an epic poem or drama bears its own
                    evidence of its truth. It either conforms to, or fails to conform to, what the
                    imagination conceives of the capabilities of human nature. In reading the
                    realistic representation of an exceptional phase of society, we wish to know
                    whether the painter of it was, from his position, likely to have seen and
                    understood it, whether his object was to describe it as he saw it, and whether
                    he was a man capable of judging it reasonably and candidly.</p>
                <p>A brief account of Juvenal’s life, varying considerably in some of its details,
                    is prefixed to the different MSS. of his works. But the original on which these
                    various versions of the life are founded cannot be traced to Suetonius or to any
                    competent authority, and some of the statements contained in it are
                    intrinsically improbable. According to the form prefixed to the most valuable of
                    the MSS., “J uvenal was the son or ward of a wealthy freedman; he practised
                    declamation till middle age, not as a professional teacher, but as an amateur,
                    and made his first essay in satire by writing the lines on Paris, the actor and
                    favourite of Domitian, now found in the seventh satire (line 90 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.)</hi></p>
                <p>‘ Quod non dant proceres, dabit histrio,’ &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Encouraged by their success, he devoted himself diligently to this kind of
                    composition, but refrained for a long time from either publicly reciting or
                    publishing his verses. When at last he did come before the public, his
                    recitations were attended by great crowds and received with the utmost favour.
                    But the lines originally written on Paris, having been inserted in one of his
                    new satires, excited the jealous anger of an actor of the time, who was a
                    favourite of the emperor, and procured the poet’s banishment under the form of a
                    military appointment to the extremity of Egypt. Being then eighty years of age,
                    he died shortly afterwards of grief and vexation.” In one account the time of
                    his banishment is said to have been the last years of Domitian; in another he is
                    said to have been appointed to a command against the Scots by Trajan, in another
                    to have died in exile in the reign of Antoninus Pius, and in another to have
                    died of a broken heart on his return to Rome, because he found his friend
                    Martial was no longer there. One account even makes Claudius the author of his
                    banishment. In several Aquinum is mentioned as his birthplace, and in one he is
                    said to have been born in the time of Claudius.</p>
                <p>Some of these statements are so much in consonance with the indirect evidence
                    afforded by the satires that they might almost be supposed to be a series of
                    conjectures based upon them. The rare passages in which the poet speaks of his
                    own position, as in satires xi. and xii., indicate that he was in comfortable
                    but moderate circumstances. We should infer also that he was not dependent on
                    any professional occupation, and that he was separated in social station, and
                    probably too by tastes and manners, from the higher class to which Tacitus and
                    Pliny belonged, as ho <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0838-0805"/> was by character from the new men who rose to
                    wealth by servility under the empire. Juvenal is no organ of the pride and
                    dignity, still less of the urbanity, of the cultivated representatives of the
                    great families of the republic. He is the champion of the more sober virtues and
                    ideas, and perhaps the organ of the rancours and detraction, of an educated but
                    depressed and embittered middle class. The literary representative of such a
                    class might well be found in the heir of a well-to-do freedman, born and bred in
                    a provincial town, too independent both in position and character to become
                    permanently a hanger-on of the great, and perhaps too ungracious in manner and
                    uncompromising in speech to mix easily with the class which inherited the
                    aristocratic and courtly traditions of Roman literature. The statement that he
                    was a trained and practised declaimer is confirmed both by his own words (i. 16)
                    and by the rhetorical mould in which his thoughts and illustrations are cast.
                    The allusions which fix the dates when his satires first appeared, and the large
                    experience of life which they imply, agree with the statement that he did not
                    come before the world as a professed satirist till after middle age.</p>
                <p>The statement that he continued to write satires long before he gave them to the
                    world accords well with the nature of their contents and the elaborate character
                    of their composition. They are not the expression of some passing impulse, but
                    seem to sum up the experience of a lifetime. They hive indeed the freshness of
                    immediate impressions, but they are so combined as to show that they have been
                    long brooded over before assuming their final form. And. that he was known as a
                    writer of satires for years before the publication of any of them in their
                    present form might almost be inferred from the emphatic but yet guarded
                    statement of Quintilian in his short summary of Roman literature. After speaking
                    of the merits of Lucilius, Horace, and Persius as satirists, he adds, “There
                    are, too, in our own day, distinguished writers of satire whose names will be
                    heard of hereafter” <hi rend="italic">(Inst. Or.,</hi> x. 1, 94). There is no
                    Roman writer of satire who could be mentioned along with those others by so
                    judicious a critic, and whose names have been heard of in after times, except
                    Juvenal.</p>
                <p>The motive which a writer of satire must have had for secrecy under Domitian is
                    sufficiently obvious; and the necessity of concealment and self-suppression thus
                    imposed upon the writer may have permanently affected his whole manner of
                    composition.</p>
                <p>So far the various authors of these lives have followed a probable and consistent
                    tradition. But when we come to the story of the poet’s exile, they are at
                    variance both with probability and with one another. Some apparent confirmation
                    is given to the tradition by the lines of a poet of the 5th century, Sidonius
                    Apollinaris :—</p>
                <p>“Nec qui consimili deinde casu Ad vulgi tenuem strepentis auram Irati fuit
                    histrionis exui.”</p>
                <p>There is no reason to doubt that these lines refer to Juvenal, but they only
                    prove that the original story from which all the varying lives are derived was
                    generally believed before the middle of the 5th century of our era. If Juvenal
                    was banished at the age of eighty, the author of his banishment could not have
                    been the “enraged actor” in reference to whom the original lines were written,
                    as Paris was put to death in 83, and Juvenal was certainly writing satires long
                    after 100 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> The satire in which the lines now
                    appear was probably first published soon after the accession of Hadrian, when
                    Juvenal was not an octogenarian but in the maturity of his powers. The cause of
                    the poet’s banishment at that advanced age could not therefore have been either
                    the original composition or the first publication of the lines. But it has been
                    conjectured that the anger of another actor, a favourite of the emperor, may
                    have been excited by a later application of them on some public occasion, and
                    that the poet was punished for this unfortunate revival of lines which had never
                    been intended for the person who resented them. Against this conjecture, based
                    on a number of confused, uncertain, and contradictory traditions, we have to
                    weigh the intrinsic improbability of the story. An expression in sat. xv. 45 is
                    quoted as a proof that Juvenal had visited Egypt. He may have done so as an
                    exile or in a military command; but it seems hardly consistent with the
                    importance which the emperors attached to the security of Egypt, or with the
                    concern which they took in the interests of the army, that these conditions were
                    combined at an age so unfit for military employment. If any conjecture is
                    warrantable on so obscure a subject, it is more likely that this temporary
                    disgrace may have been inflicted on the poet by Domitian. Among the many victims
                    of Juvenal’s satire it is only against him and against one of the vilest
                    instruments of his court, the Egyptian Crispinus, that the poet seems to ,be
                    animated by personal hatred.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>For the possible connexion of Crispinus with Juvenal’s
                    banishment compare Mayor, vol. ii. p. 421.</p></note> A sense of wrong suffered
                    at their hands may perhaps have mingled with the detestation which he felt
                    towards them on public grounds. But if he was banished under Domitian, it must
                    have been either before or after the year 93 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> at
                    which time, as we learn from an epigram of Martial, Juvenal was in Rome. The
                    whole story may be ranked with the tradition of the love potion which is said to
                    have maddened Lucretius, as one resting on such slight evidence as to admit
                    neither of confirmation nor refutation.</p>
                <p>More ancient and apparently more authentic evidence of the position filled by
                    Juvenal during some period of his life has been recovered in recent times, in
                    the form of an inscription found at Aquinum, recording, so far as it can be
                    deciphered, the dedication of an altar to Ceres, by J unius J uvenalis, tribune
                    of the first cohort of Dalmatians, “duumvir quinquennalis,” and “flamen Divi
                    Vespasiani.” The terms of this inscription, when read along with one of the few
                    passages in the satires in which Juvenal distinctly speaks of himself (iii. 318
                    <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi></p>
                <p>“Et quotiens te Roma tuo refici properantem reddet Aquino, Me quoque ad Helvinam
                    Cererem vestramque Dianam Converte a Cumis: satirarum ego, ni pudet illas,
                    Auditor gelidos veniam caligatus in agros—”</p>
                <p>leaves little doubt that the author of the inscription was either the poet
                    himself or some member of his family, of whose existence we have no other
                    indication. If then, as is most probable, Juvenal is himself the author of it,
                    we learn that he did hold, at one period of his life, a post of military rank,
                    one of municipal importance in his native town, and a priesthood of the deified
                    Vespasian. But to what period of his life does this tablet bear evidence! The
                    fact that he filled the position of “duumvir quinquennalis” shows that he was a
                    man of influential position in the <hi rend="italic">municipium,</hi> but the
                    office was only held for a year,— the year apparently in which the census was
                    taken at Rome,—and its tenure does not imply any prolonged absence from the
                    metropolis. The satires, though they indicate an occasional preference for the
                    simpler life of the country towns, are the product not of leisure in the
                    provinces but of immediate and intimate familiarity with the life of the great
                    city; and an epigram of Martial, written at the time when Juvenal was most
                    vigorously employed ‘in their composition, speaks of him as settled in Rome. It
                    is possible, but not likely, that he may have retired to his native town in the
                    latter years of his life, and that the last book of his satires (xiiL-xvi.),

                    angry mood than the earlier ones, may be the work of this retirement, and that
                    it may have been during that time that he filled this office. On the other hand,
                    it was by Domitian that the worship of Vespasian was established with especial
                    sanctity, and it may be doubted whether a priesthood instituted in his honour
                    would be recorded as a title of dignity late on in the reign of Hadrian. The
                    lines already quoted from satire iii. imply that during his early career as a
                    satirist Juvenal maintained his connexion with Aquinum, and that he had some
                    special interest in the worship of the “Helvinian Ceres.” Nor is the tribute to
                    the national religion implied by the dedication of the altar to Ceres
                    inconsistent with the beliefs and feelings expressed in The satires. While the
                    fables of mythology are often treated contemptuously or humorously by him, other
                    passages in the satires clearly imply a conformity to and even a respect for the
                    observances of the national religion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Juvenal, which sought for a standard of right action rather in the old Roman and
                    Italian traditions than in the tenets of philosophy, would incline him to
                    sympathize with the revival of religious observance and also of a kind of belief
                    in divine agency on human affairs, which accompanied the establishment of the
                    empire. The evidence as to the military post filled by him is curious, when
                    taken in connexion with the confused tradition of his exile in a position of
                    military importance'; and there appears to be some further evidence that the
                    cohort of which he was tribune was quartered in Britain. But it cannot be said
                    that the satires bear traces of military experience. The life described in them
                    is such as would present itself to the eyes of a civilian, and would be talked
                    about and commented on at the dinner tables and in the clubs, baths, theatres,
                    and places of public resort in the great metropolis.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The only other contemporary evidence which affords a glimpse of his actual life
                    is contained in three epigrams of Martial. Two of these (vii. 24 and 91) were
                    written in the time of Domitian, the other (xii. 18) early in the reign of
                    Trajan, after Martial had retired to his native Bilbilis. The first of these
                    epigrams, addressed to some backbiter who had endeavoured to embroil the two
                    friends with one another, attests the strong regard which Martial felt for him;
                    but the subject of the epigram seems to hint that there may have been something
                    suspicious or uneasy in the temper of the satirist, which made the maintenance
                    of a steady friendship with him difficult. In the second of these epigrams,
                    addressed to Juvenal himself, the epithet “facundus” is applied to him, one
                    which might equally be employed whether he was best known at the time as a
                    writer of poetic satires or as an eloquent rhetorician. In the last Martial
                    imagines his friend wandering about discontentedly <hi rend="italic"
                    >(inquietus)</hi> through the crowded streets of Rome, and undergoing all the
                    discomforts incident to attendance on the levees of the great</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ Dum per limina te potentiorum Sudatrix toga ventilat.”</p>
                <p>Two lines in the poem (22-3) suggest that the satirist, who has inveighed with
                    just severity against the worst corruptions of Roman morals, was not too rigid a
                    censor of the morals of his friend. Indeed, his intimacy with Martial is a
                    ground for not attributing to him exceptional strictness of life.</p>
                <p>The additional information as to the poet’s life and circumstances derivable from
                    the satires themselves is not important. He tells us what might easily be
                    inferred from the number of allusions to the Greek and Latin poets contained in
                    his satires, that he had enjoyed the training whmh all educated men received in
                    his day (i. 15); he indicates, as was mentioned above, his connexion with the
                    old Volscian town Aquinum; he speaks of his farm in the territory of Tibur (xi.
                    64), which furnished a young kid and mountain asparagus for a homely dinner to
                    which he invites a friend during the festival of the Megalesiaca. In the satire
                    in which this invitation is contained, and in one or two more of the later ones,
                    he seems partially to remove the mask which he wears in the earlier and more
                    directly aggressive satires. From it we are able to form an idea of the style in
                    which he habitually lived, and to think of him as enjoying a hale and vigorous
                    age (line 203), and also as a kindly master of a household (159 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.).</hi> The negative evidence, afforded in the account of his
                    establishment, and the bitter tone in which his friend is reminded of his
                    domestic unhappiness (186-9), suggest the inference that, like Lucilius and
                    Horace, Juvenal had no personal experience of either the.cares or the softening
                    influence of family life. A comparison of this poem with the invitation of
                    Horace to Torquatus <hi rend="italic">(Ep.,</hi> i. 5) brings out strongly the
                    .differences not in urbanity only but in kindly feeling between the two
                    satirists. It reminds us also of how much less we know of the one poet than of
                    the other, and of how shadowy a personage the Persius of the one is as
                    contrasted with the Torquatus of the other.</p>
                <p>An excellent critic of Latin literature, Μ. Gaston Boissier, has drawn from the
                    indications afforded of the career and character of the persons to whom the
                    satires are addressed most unfavourable conclusions as to the social
                    circumstances and associations of Juvenal. If we believe that the Trebius,
                    Postumus, Ponticus, Naevolus, Persicus, of the satires were real people, with
                    whom Juvenal lived in intimacy, we should conclude that he was most unfortunate
                    in his associates, and that his own relations to them were marked rather by
                    outspoken frankness than civility. But these personages seem to be more “nominis
                    umbrae” than real men; they serve the purpose of enabling the satirist to aim
                    his blows at one particular object instead of declaiming at.large. They have
                    none of the individuality and traits of personal character discernible in the
                    Damasippus or Trebatius of Horace’s satires, or the Julius Florus, the
                    Torquatus, the Celsus, the Fuscus, the Bullatius, &amp;c., of the epistles. It
                    is noticeable that, while Juvenal writes of the poets and men of letters,
                    Statius, Saleius Bassus, Quintilian, &amp;c., of a somewhat earlier time, as if
                    they were still living, he has no reference to the career or reputation of his
                    friend Martial, and that he is equally silent about the two illustrious writers
                    who wrote their works during the years of his own literary activity,—the younger
                    Pliny and Tacitus. It is equally noticeable that among the many cultivated and
                    estimable men and women who are brought before us in the correspondence of the
                    former of these writers the name of Juvenal does not appear.</p>
                <p>We feel on more certain ground in endeavouring to determine the times at which
                    the satires were given to the world. But these do not in all cases coincide with
                    those at which they were written and to which they immediately refer. Thus the
                    manners and personages of the age of Domitian often supply the material of
                    satiric representation, and are spoken of as if they belonged to the actual life
                    of the present,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is

                    in the earliest show that, as a finished literary composition, it belongs to the
                    age of Trajan. The most probable explanation of these discrepancies is that
                    already hinted at, viz., that in their present form the satires are the work of
                    the last thirty years of the poet’s life, while the first nine at least, the
                    most powerful and most characteristic among them, not only reproduce the
                    impressions of his earlier manhood, but may have preserved with little change
                    passages written and perhaps familiarly known in his own literary circles during
                    this earlier time.</p>

                <p>This seems more probable than that he should have used such famous names as those
                    of Statius and Quintilian to signify some poet or rhetorical professor of a
                    later time; although probably like Horace he may have availed himself either of
                    false names, or names belonging to a former time, for his satiric nomenclature.
                    The combination of the impressions, and, perhaps of the actual compositions, of
                    different periods also explains a certain want of unity and continuity found in
                    some of them.</p>
                <p>There is no reason to doubt that the sixteen satires which we possess were given
                    to the world in the order in which we find them, and that they were divided, as
                    they are referred to in the ancient grammarians, into five books. A minute
                    examination of the various satires composing these books enables us to form at
                    least a probable conjecture as to the intervals at which they appeared, and to
                    conceive the changes of mood through which, the poet passed during these
                    intervals. Book I., embracing the first five satires, is written in the freshest
                    vigour of the author s powers, and is animated with the strongest hatred of
                    Domitian. The publication of this book belongs to the early years of Trajan. The
                    mention of the exile of Marius (49) shows that it was not published before the
                    year 100 A.D. In the second satire, the lines 29 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi></p>
                <p>“Qualis erat nuper tragico pollutus adulter Concubitu," show that the memory of
                    one of the foulest scandals of the reign of Domitian was still fresh in the
                    minds of men. The third satire, imitated by Johnson in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >London,</hi> presents such a picture as Borne may have offered to the satirist
                    at any time in the 1st century of our era; but it was under the worst emperors,
                    Nero and Domitian, that the arts of flatterers and foreign adventurers were most
                    successful, and that such scenes of violence as that described at 277 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.</hi> were most likely to occur j<note anchored="true"

                    rend="italic">Annals,</hi> xiii. 25.</p></note> while the mention of Veiento
                    (185) as still enjoying influence is a distinct reference to the court of
                    Domitian. The fourth, which alone has any political significance, and reflects
                    on the emperor as a frivolous trifler rather than as a monster of lust and
                    cruelty, is the reproduction of a real or imaginary scene from the reign of
                    Domitian, and is animated by the profoundest scorn and loathing both of the
                    tyrant himself and of the worst instruments of his tyranny. The fifth is a
                    social picture of the degradation to which poor guests were exposed at the
                    banquets of the rich, but many of the epigrams of Martial and the more sober
                    evidence of one of Pliny’s letters show that the picture painted by Juvenal,
                    though perhaps exaggerated in colouring, was drawn from a state of society
                    prevalent during and immediately subsequent to the times of Domitian.<note

                    The second book contains the most elaborate of’ the satires, that which by many
                    critics is regarded as the poet’s masterpiece, the famous sixth satire, directed
                    against the whole female sex, which shares with Domitian and his creatureä*the
                    most cherished place in the poet’s antipathies. It shows certainly no diminution
                    of vigour either in its representation or its invective. If it is desirable that
                    such a subject should be treated in the spirit in which Juvenal has treated it,
                    it may be regarded as fortunate that it has been done once for all with such
                    power, with such freedom from the restraints imposed either by modesty or
                    humanity, and with, apparently, such intimate knowledge, that no writer of later
                    ages has attempted to rival it. The time at which this satire was composed
                    cannot be fixed with certainty, but some allusions (lines 502, 407-11, 205,
                    555<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Mr Lewis’s
                    edition, p. 317.</p></note>) render it highly probable that it was given to the
                    world in the later years of Trajan, and before the accession of Hadriam The date
                    of the publication of Book III., containing the seventh, eighth, and ninth
                    satires, seems to be fixed by its opening line “Etspes et ratio studiorum in
                    C⅛esare tantum,” to the first years after the accession of Hadrian. If the
                    seventh satire stood alone, we might, from the notices of Statius, Quintilian.
                    &amp;c., regard it as probably belonging to the age of Domitian; nor is it
                    unlikely that much of it was written then, and that the condition of poets and
                    men of letters there described, with more of fellow-feeling than is apparent in
                    most of his satires, is drawn from the life at Rome with which the poet was
                    first familiar. But it is inconceivable that the complimentary language applied
                    to “Caesar” in the opening lines could have been meant for Domitian; and the new
                    hopes which are held out for the neglected race of poets would naturally be
                    suggested by the change from the rule of a great soldier, whose thoughts were
                    chiefly bent on foreign conquest, to that of an accomplished lover of art, like
                    Hadrian. In the eighth satire another reference is made (line 120) to the
                    misgovernment of Marius in Africa as a recent event <hi rend="italic"
                    >(nuper),</hi> and at line 51 there may be an allusion to the Eastern wars that
                    occupied the last years of Trajan’s reign. The ninth has no allusion to
                    determine its date, but it is written with the same outspoken freedom as the
                    second and the sixth, and belongs to the period when the poet’s power was most
                    vigorous, and his exposure of vice most uncompromising. In the fourth book,
                    comprising the famous tenth, the eleventh, and the twelfth satires, the author
                    appears more as a moralist than as a pure satirist. In the tenth, the theme of
                    the “vanity of human wishes” is illustrated by great historic instances, rather
                    than by pictures of the men and manners of the age; and, though the declamatory
                    vigour and power of expression in it are occasionally as great as in the earlier
                    satires, and although touches of his saturnine humour, and especially of his
                    misogyny, appear in all the satires of this book, yet their general tone shows
                    that the white heat of his indignation is abated; and the lines of the eleventh,
                    already referred to (199 s?.},</p>

                <p>Two important dates are found in the last book, comprising· satires xiii,-xvi. At
                    xiii. 16 Juvenal speaks of his fιiend Calvinus “as now past sixty years of age,
                    having been born in the consulship of Fonteius.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Friedländer supposes that, as Juvenal has

                    birth. But elsewhere we find the poet changing suddenly from the second to the

                    Fonteius Capito consul in ,59 A.I)., and L. Fonteius Capito in 67. If it is
                    accepted that the different books of the satires appeared at different
                    intervals, that the third book was given to the world after Hadrian’s return to
                    Rome (118 A.D.), and that some time must have elapsed bitweeπ the appearance of
                    the third and fourth books, and again between that of the fourth and fifth, the
                    date referred to must be the latter of these, and thus the fifth and last book
                    could not have been published till after the year 127 A.D. Again at xv. 27 an
                    event is said to have happened in Egypt “nuper consule Junco,” for which some
                    editions read “Junio. There was a Junius consul'in 119 A.τ&gt;. Even if he were
                    the person referred to, the word <hi rend="italic">nuper</hi> (as at ii. 29,
                    viii. 120) might well indicate a date of some ten or twelve years earlier than
                    that of the composition of the satire. Recent investigations, however, make out
                    that there was a L. Aemilius Junctis consul <hi rend="italic">suffectus</hi> in
                    127 A.D. (see Mayor’s note on the passage). The fifth book must therefore have
                    been published some time after this date. More than the"fourth, this book bears
                    the marks of age, both in the milder tone of the sentiments expressed, and in
                    the feebler power of cotn position exhibited. The last satire is left
                    incomplete, and the authenticity both of it and of the fifteenth has been
                    questioned, though on insufficient grounds.</p>
                <p>The general conclusion arrived at is that the satires were published at different
                    intervals, and for the most part, composed, under Trajan and Hadrian, between
                    the years 100 and 130 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> or a year , or two later,
                    but that the most powerful in feeling and vivid in conception among them deal
                    with the experience and impressions of the reign of Domitian, occasionally
                    recall the memories or traditions of the times of Nero and Claudius, and
                    reproduce at least one startling page from the annals of Tiberius.<note

                    same overmastering feeling which constrained Tacitus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Agric.,</hi> 2, 3), when the time of long endurance and silence was over, to
                    recall the “memory of the former oppression,” acted upon Juvenal. There is no
                    evidence that these two great writers, who lived and wrote at the same time, who
                    were animated by the same hatred of the tyrant under whom the best years of
                    their manhood were spent, and who both felt most deeply the degradation of their
                    times, were even known to one another. They belonged to different social
                    circles, Tacitus to that of the highest official and senatorial class, Juvenal
                    apparently to the middle class and to that of the struggling men of letters; and
                    this difference in position had much influence in determining the different bent
                    of their genius, and in forming one to be a great national historian, the other
                    to be a great social satirist. If the view of the satirist is owing to this
                    circumstance more limited in some directions, and his taste and temper less
                    conformable to <pb break="no"

                    also saved by it from prejudices to which the traditions of his class exposed
                    the historian. But both writers are thoroughly national in sentiment, thoroughly
                    masculine in tone. No ancient authors express so strong a hatred of evil. None
                    of the other contemporary writers share this feeling. Pliny has the natural
                    repugnance of a gentleman and honourable man to coarseness and baseness; but he
                    liked to live with people of tastes and manners congenial to his own, and to see
                    as little as possible of the corruption which existed under the surface of
                    society. Martial, as a foreigner living in Rome, endowed with a lively
                    observation and a keen capacity for pleasure, enjoyed whatever was enjoyable in
                    the life around )ιim, found in its excesses and perversions materials for his
                    wit, and, after flattering the worst of the emperors assiduously through all his
                    career, was ready with impartial sycophancy to flatter one of the best. The
                    peculiar greatness and value of both Juvenal and Tacitus is that they did not
                    shut their eyes to the evil through which they had lived, but deeply resented
                    it,—the one with a vehement and burning passion, like the “saeva indignatio” of
                    Swift, the other with perhaps even deeper but more restrained emotions of
                    mingled scorn and sorrow, like the scorn and sorrow of Milton when “fallen on
                    evil days and evil tongues.” The wickedness of the age brought out more strongly
                    than at any previous time the opposition between good and evil. The idea of
                    conscience, as the connecting bond between religion and morality, appears in
                    greater prominence in Tacitus and Juvenal than in any other ancient writers.</p>
                <p>There is a criticism of an eminent living writer<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Swinburne.</p></note> to the effect that
                    the secret of Juvenal’s concentrated power consisted in this, that he knew what
                    he hated, and that what he did hate was despotism and democracy. But it would be
                    hardly true to say that the animating motive of his satire was political. It is
                    true that he finds the most typical examples of lust, cruelty, levity, and
                    weakness in the emperors and their wives,—in Domitian, Otho, Nero, Claudius, and
                    Messalina. It is true also that he shares in the traditional idolatry of Brutus,
                    that he strikes at Augustus in his mention of the “three disciples of Sulla,”
                    and that he has no word of recognition for what even Tacitus acknowledges as the
                    beneficent rule of Trajan, So too his scorn for the Roman populace of his time,
                    who cared only for their dole of bread and the public games, is unqualified. But
                    it is only in connexion with its indirect effects that he seems to think of
                    despotism; and he has.no thought of democracy at all. It is not for the loss of
                    liberty and of the senatorian rule that he chafes, but for the loss of the old
                    national manliness and self-respect, alike in the descendants of “the Latian
                    boors”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Unde nefas tantum
                    Latiis pastoribus? (ii. 127).</p></note> and in the representatives of the
                    Aemilii and the Fabii. There is no more grandly imaginative passage in all his
                    satires than that in which he evokes the ghosts of those who died at Cremera and
                    Cannae (ii. 153 <hi rend="italic">sqj)</hi> to shame the degenerate debauchees
                    of his own time. While we feel that we know little or nothing of his career,
                    while we may imagine that personal disappointment may have supplied some of the
                    gall in which his pen is dipped, and may doubt whether his own life and
                    associations would have justified him in acting as a severer censor on what most
                    Romans regarded as permitted indulgences than Lucilius and Horace, we cannot
                    doubt that both his intellect and character were of a most masculine strength,
                    and that his hatred for all that corrupted the old national character and
                    enféebled the national intellect was sincere and consistent. This feeling
                    explains his detestation of foreign manners and superstitions, his loathing not
                    only of inhuman crimes and cruelties but of such derelictions from self-respect
                    as the appearance of a Roman nobleman on the arena or even the more harmless
                    indulgence of a taste for driving, his scorn of luxury and of art as ministering
                    to luxury, his mockery of the poetry and of the stale and dilettante culture of
                    his time, and perhaps, too, his indifference to the schools of philosophy and
                    his readiness to identify all the professors of stoicism with the reserved and
                    close-cropped puritans,—</p>

                <p>who concealed the worst vices-under an outward appearance of austerity. The great
                    fault of his character, as it appears in his writings, is that he too
                    exclusively indulged this mood. It is much more difficult to find what he loved
                    and admired than what he hated. But it is characteristic of his strong nature
                    that, where he does betray any sign of human sympathy or tenderness, it is for
                    those who by their weakness and position are dependent on others for their
                    protection,—as for “the peasant boy with the little dog, his playfellow,”<note

                <p>If Juvenal is to be ranked as a great moralist, it is not for his greatness and
                    consistency as a thinker on moral questions. In the rhetorical exaggeration of
                    the famous tenth satire, for instance, the highest energies of patriotism, —the
                    gallant and desperate defence of great causes, by sword or speech,—are quoted as
                    mere examples of disappointed ambition; and, in the indiscriminate condemnation
                    of the arts by which men sought to gain a livelihood., he leaves no room for the
                    legitimate pursuits of industry. His services to morals do not consist in any
                    positive contributions to the notions of active duty, but in the strength with
                    which he has realized and expressed the restraining influence of the old Roman
                    and Italian ideal of character, and also of that religious conscience which was
                    becoming a new power in the world. Though he disclaims any debt to philosophy
                    (xiii. 121), yet he really owes more to the “Stoica dogmata,” then prevalent,
                    than he is aware of.' But his highest and rarest literary quality is his power
                    of painting characters, scenes, incidents, and actions, whether from past
                    history or from contemporary life. In this power, which is also the great power
                    of Tacitus, he has few equals and perhaps no superior among ancient writers. The
                    difference between Tacitus and Juvenal in power of representation is that the
                    prose historian is more of an imaginative poet, the satirist more of a realist
                    and a grotesque humorist. He can paint great historical pictures in all their
                    detail—as in the famops representation of the fall of Sejanus,—or call them up
                    with all their imaginative associations in a line or two, as for instance in
                    these—</p>
                <p>“Atque ideo'postquam ad Cimbros stragemque volabant</p>
                <p>Qui nunquam attigerant majora cadavera corvi;”</p>
                <p>he can describe a character elaborately or hit it off with a single stroke; and
                    in either case he fixes the impression which he desires to produce firmly in the
                    mind. The picture drawn may be a caricature, or a misrepresentation of the
                    fact,—as that of the father of Demosthenes, “blear-eyed with the soot of the
                    glowing mass,” &amp;c.,—but it is, with rare exceptions, realistically
                    conceived, and, as is well said by Mr Lewis, it is brought before us with the
                    vivid touches of a Defoe or a Swift. Still more happily the same editor has
                    illustrated Juvenal’s power as a realistic painter of scenes from contemporary
                    life,—and of scenes which generally combine grotesque and humorous features with
                    serious <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n842/mode/1up"

                    pictorial satirist of the last century, Hogarth.<note anchored="true"

                    proneness to exaggeration, the attraction which coarse and repulsive images have
                    for his mind, and the tendency to sacrifice general effect to minuteness of
                    detail not unfrequently mar his best effects.</p>
                <p>The difficulty is often felt of distinguishing between a powerful rhetorician and
                    a genuine poet,—and there is no writer about whom it is more difficult to
                    determine to which of the two classes he belongs than about Juvenal. He himself
                    knew and has well described (vii. 53 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> the conditions
                    under which a great poet could flourish; and he felt that his own age was
                    incapable of producing one. He has little sense of beauty either in human life
                    or nature. Whenever such sense is evoked it is only as a momentary relief to his
                    prevailing sense of the hideousness of contemporary life, or in protest to what
                    he regarded as the enervating influences of art. Even his references to the
                    great poets of the past indicate rather a <hi rend="italic">blasé</hi> sense of
                    indifference and weariness than a fresh enjoyment of them. Yet his power of
                    touching the springs of tragic awe and horror is a genuine poetical gift, of the
                    same kind as that which is displayed by some of the early English dramatists.
                    But he is, on the whole, more essentially a great rhetorician than a great poet.
                    His training, the practical bent of his understanding, his strong but morose
                    character, the circumstances of his time, and the materials available for his
                    art, all fitted him to rebuke his own age and all after times in the tones of a
                    powerful preacher, rather than to charm them with the art of an accomplished
                    poet. The composition of his various satires shows no negligence, but rather the
                    excess of elaboration; but it produces the impression of mechanical contrivance
                    rather than of organic growth. His movement is sustained and powerful, but there
                    is no rise and fall in it. He seems to forget how much more telling indignation
                    is when it is severely controlled, but allowed occasionally to break forth in
                    blasting scorn and wrath, as it is in Tacitus, than when it shows itself as the
                    habitual mood of the writer. The verse is most carefully constructed, and is
                    also most effective, but it is so with the rhetorical effectiveness of Lucan,
                    not with the musical charm of Virgil. It was calculated to bring down the
                    applause of an excited audience, not to perpetuate its melody through all
                    succeeding times. So, too, the diction is full, eyen to excess, of meaning,
                    point, and emphasis. Few writers have added so much to the currency of
                    quotation. But his style altogether wants the charm of ease and simplicity. It
                    wearies by the constant strain after effect, its mock-heroics, and allusive
                    periphrasis. It excites distrust by its want of moderation. It makes us long to
                    return to nature and to the apparently more careless but really truer art and
                    the lighter touch of the satirist of the Augustan age—</p>
                <p>“Parcentis viribus atque Extenuantis eas consulto.”</p>
                <p>On the whole no one of the ten or twelve really great writers whom ancient Rome
                    produced leaves on the mind so mixed an impression, both as a writer and as a
                    man, as Juvenal. He has little, if anything at all, of the high imaginative
                    mood—the mood of reverence and noble admiration—which made Ennius, Lucretius,
                    and Virgil the truest poetical representatives of the genius of Rome. He has
                    nothing of the wide humanity of Cicero, of the urbanity of Horace, of the ease
                    and grace of Catullus. Yet he represents another mood of ancient Rome, the mood
                    natural to her before she was humanized by the lessons of Greek art and thought.
                    If we could imagine the elder Cato living under Domitian, cut off from all share
                    in public life, and finding no sphere for his combative and censorious energy
                    except that of literature, we shoùld perhaps understand the motives of Juvenal’s
                    satire and the place which is his due as a representative of the genius of his
                    country. Asa man he shows many of the strong qualities of the old Roman
                    plebeian,—the aggressive boldness, the intolerance of superiority and privilege,
                    which animated the tribunes in their opposition to the senatorial! rule. Even
                    where we least like him we find nothing small or mean to alienate our respect
                    from him. Though he loses no opportunity of being coarse, he is not licentious;
                    though he is often truculent, he cannot bp called malignant. It is, indeed,
                    impossible to say what motives of personal chagrin, of love of detraction, of
                    the mere literary passion for effective writing, may have contributed to the
                    indignation which inspired his verse, But the prevailing impression, we carry
                    away after reading him is that, in all his early satires, he was animated by a
                    sincere and manly detestation of the tyranny and cruelty, the debauchery and
                    luxury, the levity and effeminacy, the crimes and frauds, which we know from
                    other sources were rife in Rome in the century in which Christianity made its
                    first converts there, and that a more serene wisdom and a happier frame of mind
                    were attained by him when old age had somewhat allayed the fierce rage which
                    vexed his manhood.</p>
                <p>It would be impossible to enumerate here the various editions and works forming
                    the literature connected with Juvenal which have sprung up between the
                    appearance of the <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> in 1470 and the present
                    day. They occupy more than five pages of E. Hübner’s <hi rend="italic">Grundriss
                    zu Vorlesungen über die Römische Literaturgeschichte.</hi> Among the best
                    critical editions of the text is that of 0. Jahn, and among those which may be
                    most recommended to students are the editions of Heinrich, Macleane, Mayor, and
                    Lewis. The last is accompanied by a literal prose translation. The verse
                    translations of Dryden and Gifford, and Johnson’s imitations of the third and
                    tenth satires in the <hi rend="italic">London</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vanity
                    of Human Wishes,</hi> will convey to readers ignorant of Latin a good impression
                    of the power of the original. There is no better criticism of Juvenal as a
                    writer than that contributed by the late Professor Ramsay to Dr Smith’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Dictionary of Ancient Biography and Mythology.</hi> (W.Y.S.)</p>
