                    >Israel.</hi> The modern history of the race in its political and intellectual
                    emancipation begins with Moses Mendelssohn, who flourished at Berlin in the
                    latter part of the 18th century. The persecutions of the Middle Ages had
                    produced their natural effect. Cut off from their fellow-citizens, excluded by
                    oppressive laws from all trades except that of peddling in old clothes» and even
                    from buying certain classes of these, specially taxed, confined to Ghettos and
                    Judengassen, strictly prohibited from entering some towns, limited in numbers in
                    others, forbidden to marry except under restrictions designed to check the
                    growth of the Jewish population, disabled from employing Christian servants or
                    being members of trade guilds, the Jews seemed by their abject condition to
                    deserve the evils which were its cause.</p>

                <p>There were always, it is true, exceptions to the general degradation of the race.
                    The exiles from the Spanish peninsula (who in western Europe were found chiefly
                    in Amsterdam, Bordeaux, Paris, and London, and also in Hamburg and Copenhagen)
                    were in many cases persons of distinguished culture and intelligence, having
                    been enabled, while protected by their disguise of Christianity, to live a life
                    more worthy of freemen than was that of their oppressed and pillaged brethren in
                    the north. In Germany itself Frederick William, the great elector of Brandenburg
                    (1640 to 1688), was indebted for zealous service to Gompertz and Solomon Elias.
                    Beckman of Frankfort-on-the-Oder obtained permission in 1696 to print the
                    Talmud. In Austria Wolf Schlesinger was personally exempted from the decree
                    which banished the Jews from Vienna in the time of Leopold I. The Oppenheimers
                    had sufficient influence in Austria to prevent the publication there of
                    Eisenmenger’s libels on their race; the Arnsteins, Sinzheimers, and other
                    families earned the favour of Maria Theresa, and were decorated with titles of
                    nobility. But the general condition of the multitude was shown by the
                    excommunication of Spinoza at Amsterdam, by the rise of the Chasidim and of
                    Frank, and the marvellous history of Sabbathai Zebi. The German Jews grew
                    distrustful of their knowledge of their own religion, and instructed their
                    children by the aid of long-ringleted rabbis from Poland, who overspread the
                    country, inculcating contempt for all except the too subtle dialectics of their
                    peculiar school of disputation. Led by these blind guides, the German Jews
                    continued to speak their own jargon of Hebrew and German, to correspond and even
                    endorse their commercial bills in Hebrew characters, and abandoned the hopeless
                    attempt to enter into the general life of their country. Fortunately the
                    hereditary desire of learning still survived, though the selection of subjects
                    for study helped to isolate them from their happier neighbours. Moses
                    Mendelssohn (1729-1786), who did so much to induce the Jews to become at one
                    with the spirit of the age, and the Christians to tolerate them, was at three
                    years old taught by his father, a professional copyist of Hebrew religious
                    manuscripts, to repeat the wise sayings of the Talmud. Later on he found in the
                    rabbi Fränkel, of his native town of Dessau in Anhalt, a capable and enlightened
                    teacher. When Fränkel was promoted, the young Mendelssohn followed him, at the
                    age of fourteen, to Berlin. In Prussia the condition of the Jews had been
                    comparatively favoured. Forty or fifty respectable families fleeing from
                    persecutions in Austria had been admitted to Berlin towards the end of the 17th
                    century. The colony increased, and was specially patronized in his own grotesque
                    and tyrannical fashion by the half-mad sovereign Frederick William I. Frederick
                    the Great held the maxim that “to oppress the Jews never brought prosperity to
                    any Government,” but his “general privilege,” issued in 1750, while it abolished
                    some old restrictions, was only a halting step in advance. It divided the Jews
                    into two classes,—the hereditarily and the personally tolerated. In the first
                    were those who were actually engaged in commerce or who occupied some office in
                    connexion with the synagogue. Their right of abode extended to merely one child
                    of the family. Those who were personally tolerated were men who had means of
                    independent subsistence, though not engaged in commerce, and their right did not
                    descend to their children. The right to residence for a second child of each
                    family of hereditary inhabitants was purchased by the Jews for 70,000 thalers.
                    The restrictions imposed by Frederick on marriage were severe; poor Jews could
                    not marry at all. No Jew was permitted to own land in fee or to possess more
                    than forty houses. Their business was confined to trade in money or goods.
                    Frederick the Great, penetrated as he was by the sentiments of Voltaire, yet
                    struck out Mendelssohn’s name when it was put forward for election into the
                    Berlin Academy. Mendelssohn was with difficulty admitted into Berlin when he
                    presented himself at its gates as a poor boy, having no friend but his teacher
                    Fränkel. He went into a silk manufacturer’s house as teacher to the children,
                    and became a clerk and afterwards a partner in the firm. He formed a warm
                    friendship with Lessing, and inspired the drama of <hi rend="italic">Hathan the
                    Wise,</hi> in which the Jew was for the first time in modern literature
                    represented in a benevolent light. He translated the Pentateuch into German, and
                    issued his translation in Hebrew characters, added to it a commentary in Hebrew
                    (incorporating the rational as distinguished from the Aga-distic interpretations
                    of former Hebrew commentators), partly by himself and partly by others, whom he
                    associated with himself, and by this and other works introduced the Jews to
                    modern culture. At the same time he gained a distinguished place in the world of
                    letters by the pure and exalted tone, and the charming style, of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Dialogues,</hi> his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phoedo,</hi><hi rend="italic">or the Immortality of the Soul,</hi> and other
                    works, which showed him to be at the height of the philosophy of that time. He
                    remained warmly attached in feeling and practice to the synagogue, and was
                    requested by the chief rabbi of Berlin, Hirschel Levin, who for a brief period
                    had been chief rabbi in London, to prepare the German digest of the ritual laws
                    of the Jews, which was ordered by Frederick the Great. Every visitor to Berlin,
                    Jew or Gentile, sought to make his acquaintance at a kind of <hi rend="italic"
                    >salon</hi> which he held in the afternoons. By the great majority of the
                    orthodox Jews the writings of Mendelssohn were received with delight, and it was
                    only by exception (as in Hamburg, Prague, Fürth, and Poland) that they were
                    fiercely denounced as rationalistic in tendency. The times were favourable to
                    the development to which he led the way. The ideas of the great writers who
                    preceded the French Revolution were teaching the abolition of privilege and of
                    religious persecution. Although neither Voltaire nor Bayle wrote in a kindly
                    spirit of the degraded Hebrew race, the general tendency of their teaching was
                    in the direction of toleration, and so it happened that, just at the moment when
                    the Jews were become more than ever willing and ready to enter into the national
                    life of Germany, the country was being prepared to receive them. The civil
                    restrictions were only gradually abolished; painful revivals of hatred recurred
                    from time to time, but henceforth the name of Jew grew year by year to mean less
                    a distinction of nationality, and became more exclusively a denomination
                    referring merely to ancestry and religious belief.</p>
                <p>Among the friends and disciples of Mendelssohn who continued his work were
                    Wessely (the father of modern Hebrew poetry), David Friedländer (founder of the
                    Jews’ Free School in Berlin), Joel Lowe (professor at the Jewish, Wilhelm schule
                    in Breslau), Herz Homberg (tutor in the house of Moses Mendelssohn, and
                    inspector of German schools of the Jews in Galicia), Aaron Wolfsohn (teacher at
                    Breslau), Baruch Lindau (writer on physics), Marcus Herz (Mendelssohn’s family
                    doctor, whose more famous wife, afterwards converted to Christianity, received
                    at her house a brilliant society, the two Humboldts, Count Bernstorf, Gentz, and
                    Borne), Isaac Euchel (translator of the Jewish prayer-book), Lazarus Ben da vid
                    (who was specially concerned with education). All these and others contributed
                    to the Hebrew periodical <hi rend="italic">Mcαssef</hi> (“The Gatherer”),
                    published at Königsberg and Berlin, 1783-1790; Breslau, 1794-1797; Berlin,
                    Altona, Dessau, 1809-1811. The activity of the literary period which followed
                    appears from the long list of rabbinical reprints, some with valuable notes, or
                    translations, issued immediately before the close of the 18th century from the
                    Jews’ Free School printing-press at Berlin, under the direction of Isaac
                    Satanow.</p>
                <p>From minimizing differences in religion some were led to give up their
                    distinctive religion altogether, and adopt a nominal, sometimes a real,
                    Christianity, and thus the famous names of Heine, Börne, Edward Gans the jurist,
                    Rah el, the younger Mendelssohn the composer, and Neander <pb break="no"

                    article. These celebrated persons belong rather to the general history of German
                    culture than to that of the race from which they sprang. Among the general body
                    of the Jews, the removal of political restrictions and a closer communion with
                    modern thought worked noticeable, though less radical, changes. The old system
                    of preaching in the synagogue was revived, and led to the excision of some of
                    the interminable prayers and sacred poems which the piety of preceding ages had
                    accumulated in embarrassing profusion. After the establishment of the consistory
                    in the (French) kingdom of Westphalia, German lectures were held in Cassel,
                    Dessau, Berlin, Hamburg, &amp;c.; and now there is scarcely anywhere an
                    important Jewish community without a preacher. Organs were introduced into some
                    synagogues. The alterations brought about disputes in several communities and
                    even secessions, as at Hamburg in 1819. In Prussia the Government, acting on the
                    principles urged in Mendelssohn’s time by his friend Dohm, but vigorously
                    combated by the Jewish philosopher, gave the sanction of state authority to the
                    resolutions of the orthodox. The private synagogue ’ founded in Berlin by Israel
                    Jakobsohn, after the breaking up of the Westphalian consistory, on principles
                    similar to those of the reformed Hamburg Temple, was closed, and suffered the
                    same fate when reopened as a public synagogue in 1817 and again in 1823. Even
                    choirs and sermons were prohibited as un-Jewish innovations. Such regulations
                    tended to disgust many educated persons who might otherwise have continued to
                    remain attached to the faith of their fathers. They felt themselves isolated in
                    the midst of their less advanced brethren, and were tempted to identify
                    themselves even in religion with their more cultured Christian associates.
                    Besides, a change of faith offered an escape from humiliating legal
                    restrictions, and opened the way to more dignified careers than those permitted
                    to the conforming Jews. The smaller German states appointed rabbis who were more
                    or less state officials. When the Government restrictions were removed,
                    considerable divergences manifested themselves, which the assemblies of rabbis
                    and synods, beginning in 1844, and continued from time to time to the present
                    day, did little to heal. There now exist in most German towns an orthodox and a
                    reform congregation, which differ in their mode of conducting public service, in
                    the prominence given to the belief in the Messiah and the return to the Holy
                    Land, and in their greater or less adherence to the laws of the Sabbath, and
                    laws concerning diet, &amp;c. One reformed congregation in Berlin keeps the
                    Sabbath on the first day of the week.</p>
                <p>More remarkable examples of sectarian dissent were the movements known by the
                    names of Sabbathai Zebi, of Frank, and of the Chasidim. Sabbathai’s career had
                    Turkey for its theatre, but the influence of his strange pretensions was felt in
                    Poland and Germany, as well as throughout the East. Sabbathai Zebi was born at
                    Smyrna in 1626. He announced himself the Messiah in Jerusalem, named his
                    brothers kings of Judah and Israel, took the title for himself of king of the
                    kings of the earth. Miracles were related of him; from Poland, Hamburg, and
                    Amsterdam treasures poured into his court; in the Levant young men and maidens
                    prophesied before him; the Persian Jews refused to till the fields. “We shall
                    pay no more tribute,” they said, “our Messiah is come.” The pretender, whom so
                    many unhappy people were ready to acclaim as their deliverer from unendurable
                    evils, afterwards embraced Mahometanism to escape death from the Porte. Some of
                    his followers went over with him to Islam; others treated his conversion as
                    forced, and still proclaimed themselves Jews and his disciples. Their faith was
                    nearer to immortality than their Messiah, and he was still believed in and his
                    return expected after his death. Out of the wrecks of the Sabbathaic party Jacob
                    Frank formed in Podolia the Zoharites, whose Bible was the Cabbalistic work
                    called <hi rend="italic">Zohar.</hi> Persecuted by the orthodox, he put himself
                    under the protection of the bishop of Kaminiek, and burnt the Talmud in public.
                    When his protector died he migrated with hundreds of followers, and afterwards
                    lived in royal state at Vienna, Briinn, and Offenbach, ending by becoming a
                    Roman Catholic. He died in 1791, and his sect perished with him. Very different
                    was the fate of the Chasidim (“the pious”), who preceded Frank and have survived
                    him. They also swear by the <hi rend="italic">Zohar,</hi> and revere as their
                    founder Israel Baal Shem (“possessor of the wonder-working name ”), or Besht,
                    who flourished at Miedziboz in Podolia in 1740. Besht pretended to be the
                    promised child foretold by the prophet Elijah, and named by him Israel before
                    his birth. A long sojourn in solitary places, much fasting and physical torment,
                    the tortures of rolling in thorns in summer and of bathing in half-frozen rivers
                    at midnight in the winter, gave this prophet the faculty of seeing visions, the
                    power to heal diseases, and to release souls held captive in the bodies of
                    brutes. Like the older Kabbalists he treated the Talmud with contempt; he
                    exhorted his followers not to lead a gloomy ascetic life, but praised gaiety and
                    enjoyment as tending to a career agreeable to God. Joyful religious worship was
                    to be induced by drinking, jumping, clapping of hands, making noises and
                    screaming, to which were added ablutions according to the fashion of the Essenes
                    of old, and the wearing of a peculiar dress. Amongst his followers many found
                    out how to derive advantage from the superstition and ignorance of the masses.
                    Dob Beer (Berush) of Mizricz seldom showed himself but to his disciples, and had
                    reports of his wondrous works spread by them; many sick and lame went to him for
                    cure; offerings of money came in and supplied the Zaddik with means to lead a
                    princely life. The Chasidim still flourish in Russia and Jerusalem, and the
                    Zaddikim (or “righteous”) and Rebbés, as their leaders are called, live in
                    magnificence upon the contributions of the most ignorant of the people.</p>
                <p>While this and cognate heresies were driven back into the over-crowded Jewish
                    communities of Russia and Poland from which they came, in Germany Talmudic
                    studies were pursued with undiminishing zeal, though carried on in gradually
                    narrowing circles, and largely owing to the knowledge of the Talmud being a
                    qualification for appointments in large congregations. Gradually the Talmud,
                    which had been once the common pabulum of all education, passed out of the
                    knowledge of the laity, and was abandoned almost entirely to candidates for the
                    rabbinate. In the earlier part of this period, the rabbis received their
                    education at the Yeshiboth (“sessions” of academies devoted to the Talmud, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Slιulchan Aruch,</hi> and their commentators). As the spirit
                    kindled by Mendelssohn penetrated the various sections of the Jews, it was felt
                    that this mode of instruction would not suffice, and institutions were founded,
                    not confined exclusively to these studies, but embracing the whole domain of
                    Hebrew theology, philosophy, and history. Jonas Fränkel in 1854 established the
                    Judaeo-theological seminary at Breslau, an institution which has provided
                    Germany and Austria as well as England and the United States with many rabbis.
                    Its first director was Zacharias Fränkel (1801-1875), predecessor of Graetz in
                    editing the <hi rend="italic">Monatschrift,</hi> and author of works on the
                    Septuagint, the Mishna, and the Talmud of Jerusalem. Of later date are the high
                    school for the study of Judaism, founded in 1872, and the “seminary for rabbis
                    for orthodox Judaism,” under Dr Hildesheimer, established at Berlin in 1877.
                    Israel Jakobsohn, president of the Westphalian consistory (1768- 1823), did good
                    service in improving teaching. He founded in Seesen (Brunswick) an educational
                    and normal institution, bearing his name, for Jews and Christians, which still
                    flourishes. A similar college was instituted by his brother-in-law Isaac Samson,
                    and directed by S. Μ. Ehrenberg, amongst whose pupils were Jost and Zunz.
                    Schools of a more elementary character were the Berlin Free School, already
                    referred to, and others. In Dessau, Moses Mendelssohn’s birthplace, the free
                    school fostered by the duke, and called after him Franzschule, flourished under
                    David Fränkel (1779-1865), editor of the journal <hi rend="italic">Sulamit</hi>;
                    in Frankfort-on-the-Main was the Philanthropin, now converted into a technical
                    school. In almost all Jewish communities we now find institutions teaching
                    religion. After a first and unsuccessful attempt, Dr Moritz Veit founded a
                    normal school, which existed under Zunz in Berlin from 1840 to 1852, and was
                    revived by Dr Veit and the famous preacher and author Dr Μ. Sachs. Similar
                    schools were founded in other places—Hanover, Münster, Düsseldorf, Cassel,—with
                    more or less success. The union <pb break="no"

                    the Culturverein had a brief existence. Instead of receiving support and thanks,
                    the chief workers were regarded as heretics.</p>
                <p>The modern historical study of Judaism was inaugurated by Rapoport and Zunz.
                    Solomon Juda (Löb) Rapoport, sprung from an old family boasting many learned
                    Talmudists, was born in Lemberg in 1790, and was rabbi at Tarnopol and in
                    Prague, where he died in 1867. His published essays in various periodicals or in
                    the form of prefaces are largely biographical, and display a great range of
                    reading and power of combining distant references. Of his projected Talmudic
                    encyclopaedia but one part appeared, and his scheme for a biographical series
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Men of Penown</hi> remained unrealized,
                    except some fragments. Nachman Krochmal (1780-1840) was not less learned than
                    Rapoport, and perhaps surpassed him in philosophical acuteness.<note

                <p>Of greater importance and influence were the writings of the patriarch of living

                    (1793— 1860), teacher in the Jewish normal school at Frankfort, editor of a
                    valuable edition of the Mishna with a German translation (1832-34), and author
                    of several important histories of Judaism and its sects, A. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Geiger</hi> (ç.v.), and H. Graetz of Breslau, who has composed the most
                    comprehensive history of the Israelites that has yet appeared. To the names of
                    these scholars may be added <hi rend="smallcaps">Fürst</hi> the lexicographer
                    <hi rend="italic">(q∙v.},</hi> M. Steinschneider the bibliographer, Herxheimer

                    literature Philippson of Bonn and Lehmann of Mainz are leading representatives
                    in journalism of reform and orthodoxy. German Jews have also distinguished
                    themselves in general public life, claiming such names as Lasker in politics,
                    Auerbach in literature, Rübenstein and Joachim in music, Traube in medicine,
                    Lazarus in psychology. Especially famous have been the Jewish linguists,
                    pre-eminent among whom are T. Benfey of Göttingen (1809-1881), the most original
                    of modern comparative philologists and the greatest Sanskrit scholar of our day,
                    and the admirable Greek scholar and critic Jacob Bernays of Bonn (1824-
                    1881).</p>
                <p>Within the last year or two the success of the Hebrew race in commerce and the
                    professions has led in Germany to a singular revival of old-world prejudices. A
                    series of leagues of ‘ ’ Germans” were formed against the “Semites.” Stocker, a
                    “Christian Socialist” and court preacher to the emperor, gave importance to the
                    movement by placing himself at its head. Its weapon is social ostracism:
                    meetings are held at which the Jews are loudly denounced; and members of the
                    “German” leagues vow to have no commerce with the hated race. Occasionally the
                    two parties came to blows, some Jewish houses were wrecked, and a synagogue at
                    Neu-Stettin burnt. At this point the Government interfered.</p>
                <p>The universal admission of the Jews to public posts only dates from the
                    establishment of the empire. In the German states the spiritual emancipation of
                    the Jews was not immediately followed by political emancipation. They were freed
                    in Germany by the French law as a result of the conquests of Napoleon, but lost
                    their civil equality when the French retired, to regain it bit by bit in
                    succeeding years.</p>
                <p>The Leibzυll, the odious tax imposed upon a Jew as often as he crossed the
                    boundary of a city or petty state, even if he went in and out twenty times in
                    the day, was removed in Prussia in 1790, and in other German states in 1803. In
                    1812 the royal edict declared all Jews in Prussia to be citizens, and gave them
                    equal rights and privileges with their Christian fellow countrymen. They fought
                    in the war of liberation, but after its success there was a reaction, and the
                    new privileges (more particularly free admission to academic posts) were in part
                    withdrawn. The Jews who had been promoted to the rank of officers during the war
                    had to quit military service to escape the degradation of losing their
                    commissions. The national parliament, which met at Frankfort in 1848, adopted
                    resolutions in favour of the removal of religious disabilities. The Prussian
                    constitution of 1850 declared that the enjoyment of civil rights was independent
                    of religious confession. The legislation with which the empire was inaugurated
                    in 1871 at length gave political and civil equality to the Jews throughout
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>The number of the Jews in the German empire is now 520,575, or 1 per cent, of the
                    whole population (census of 1875). The Gemeindebund, or union of congregations
                    for some religious and charitable purposes, has recently been established at
                    Leipsic. The Jews are engaged in all the occupations which other citizens pursue
                    in Germany. While they show a marked predilection for and success in commerce
                    and the learned professions, a few are farmers and sailors. Being subject to the
                    ordinary military laws, they serve in the army, and many Jews hold commissions
                    in those regiments in which noble descent is not a necessary qualification.</p>
                <p>While the spiritual awakening of the Jews was essentially a German movement,
                    having its centre in Prussia, the most powerful impulse to their political
                    liberation came from France. The Jews had been banished from France by Charles
                    VI., but a few had returned. Some Portuguese fugitives had taken up their
                    residence at Bordeaux and. Bayonne. Others had settled at Avignon under papal
                    protection, and at Carpentras there was a congregation with a liturgy in some
                    respects peculiar. To Paris the Jews began to return in 1550, but held the
                    privilege of domicile by a precarious tenure till Pereyre, the founder of the
                    institution for deaf mutes, obtained in 1776 formal confirmation of the leave
                    given to the Portuguese Jews to reside in the capital. There were already
                    several hundred German Jews resident in an unlawful way, and protected chiefly
                    through the influence of a German Jew named Calmer, who had been naturalized for
                    services to the Government. The conquest of Alsace had added largely to the
                    Jewish subjects of France. In 1780 the Alsatian Jews presented to the king a
                    petition complaining of the seignorial dues exacted of them, of the restrictions
                    on their trade, and the efforts of the priests to convert their children. The
                    complaint was not <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> without effect. The capitation
                    tax was abolished in 1784, projects of enfranchisement began to be broached, and
                    a commission was appointed for the revision of the laws about the Jews, but its
                    work was interrupted by the Revolution. The Jews addressed themselves with
                    better hopes to the national assembly, and those of Paris distinguished
                    themselves by demanding the withdrawal of the authority of the synagogue over
                    its members. In 1790 the French Jews united in sending into the assembly a
                    petition demanding their admission to full and equal rights with other citizens.
                    This requisition at first met with some serious opposition even among the
                    advocates of universal liberty; the ancient prejudice against this people had
                    not been entirely eradicated. But the exertions and influence of Mirabeau and
                    Rabaut St Étienne prevailed. In 1790 the Portuguese Jews, and in 1791 the whole
                    Hebrew population of France, were admitted to complete rights of citizenship.
                    The constitution of 1795 confirmed the declarations of the assembly.</p>

                <p>The gratitude of the Jews was shown by their patriotic devotion in the wars of
                    the Revolution.</p>
                <p>One of the most remarkable events in modern Jewish history was the convocation of
                    the Sanhedrin (Synedrion) by Napoleon. It was preceded by the session of a
                    general assembly of one hundred and eleven delegates, held in Paris in 1806
                    under the presidency of Abraham Furtado, merchant, author, and scientific
                    agriculturist, the delegate of the Portuguese congregation in the port of the
                    Gironde. To this assembly twelve questions were submitted by the emperor, and
                    its principal answers were afterwards confirmed and formulated in nine
                    propositions of law by a Sanhedrin formally elected by the synagogues in France
                    and Italy. The Sanhedrin commenced its sittings on February 9, 1807, under the
                    presidency of Rabbi David Sintzheim of Strasburg, with a Piedmontese rabbi as
                    first, and an ex-legislator of Italy as second assessor. The forms of the old
                    Sanhedrin were observed as far as possible; the responses are couched in the
                    form of statutes binding the constituents of the Sanhedrin, and these decisions
                    have usually been treated with much respect even by communities which sent no
                    delegates, while the Jews of Frankfort and Holland formally accepted them.</p>
                <p>The following are the nine decrees :—(1) polygamy is forbidden, according to a
                    decree of the synod of Worms in 1050; (2) divorce is allowed to the Jews if and
                    so far as it is confirmatory of a legal divorce pronounced by the authority of
                    the civil law of the land in which they live; (3) no Jew may perform the
                    ceremony of marriage unless civil formalities have been
                    fulfilled,—intermarriages with Christians are valid civilly, and, although they
                    cannot be solemnized with any religious celebration, they involve the parties to
                    them in no ban; (4) the Jews of France recognize in the fullest sense the French
                    people as their brethren; (5) acts of justice and charity are to be performed
                    towards all mankind who recognize the Creator, irrespective of their religion;
                    (6) Jews born in France and treated by its laws as citizens consider it their
                    native country,—they are bound to obey the laws of the land; Jews are dispensed
                    from ceremonial observances during service in the army; (7) the Sanhedrin
                    exhorts the Jews to train their children to laborious lives in useful and
                    liberal arts, to acquire landed property as a means of becoming more firmly
                    attached to their fatherland, to renounce occupations which render men odious
                    and contemptible in the eyes of their fellow-citizens, and to do all in their
                    power to acquire their neighbours’ esteem and good wishes; (8) interest is not
                    allowed to be taken when money is lent for the support of a family, but interest
                    is permitted when money is lent for commercial purposes, if the lender runs any
                    risk, and if the legal rate is not exceeded; (9) the above declarations
                    concerning interest, and the texts of the Holy Scripture on the same subject,
                    apply between Jews and fellow-citizens in precisely the same way as between Jews
                    and Jews. Usury is altogether forbidden. At the close of the Sanhedrin, the
                    emperor established the consistorial organization which in its main features
                    still exists in France. Every two thousand Jews were to form a synagogue and a
                    consistory consisting of one chief rabbi, and two rabbis with three laymen
                    householders belonging to the capital town of the consistory. Bankrupts and
                    usurers were excluded from the consistory, which was to watch over the conduct
                    of the rabbis, to maintain order in the synagogues, and to admonish the Jews of
                    the district to follow handicrafts and obey the laws of the conscription. The
                    central consistory, sitting at Paris, had power to appoint and depose the
                    rabbis. The rabbis were to publish the decrees of the Sanhedrin, to preach
                    obedience to the laws, and to pray in the synagogues for the imperial house.
                    Many Hebrew hymns of praise were composed in honour of the despot who had framed
                    this organization, although at the same time the emperor issued a decree which
                    made considerable concessions to the popular prejudices against the Jews in
                    Alsace and eastern France generally, forbade the Jews to change their domicile
                    or enter into occupation without special permission, framed stringent
                    precautions against usury, and excepted the Alsatian Jews from the right to
                    provide substitutes for military service. The laws of 1814, 1819, and 1823 made
                    some beneficial changes in the position of the Israelites, andin 1829 Charles X.
                    established at Metz a central school for the instruction of candidates for the
                    rabbinate. It was subsequently removed to Paris. In 1831 the Government
                    definitively decided, in accordance with the ideas of Napoleon, that the rabbis
                    should be state functionaries. From that year they have been paid by the state.
                    In 1833 the French Government suspended relations with a Swiss canton which had
                    denied equal rights to a French subject on the ground that he was a Jew.</p>
                <p>In France the absence of political restrictions has been unfavourable to the
                    separate development of Judaism. The ministers Crémieux (1796-1879), Fould, and
                    Goudchaux, the archaeologists and philologians Jules Oppert and Halévy and the
                    Darmesteters, the composer Meyerbeer, and many others, are well-known names in
                    the general history of their country. Many Israelites have occupied high civil
                    and military posts. Other Israelites by race have become indistinguishable by
                    religious practice from the main body of the citizens; and the principal
                    contributions in France to Hebrew literature have been from writers born in
                    Germany, like Munk (1802-1867) and Derenbourg, like Samuel Cohen and Franck.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> Before the year 1860, an outbreak against the Jews
                    in Russia, the accusations at Damascus, the Mortara abduction case in Italy, and
                    about this time the sufferings of the Jews in Morocco, had vividly excited the
                    sympathies of the Jews in western Europe <hi rend="italic">; they</hi> had
                    joined together to make contributions of money for relief of distress at
                    Königsberg and in the Holy Land, and had even made representations to the
                    Governments of the various countries in which they resided in order to bring
                    political means to bear to alleviate the fate of their unfortunate
                    co-religionists. An English Jew, Sir Moses Montefiore, took the lead in these
                    efforts. But there was no regular provision for prompt and concerted action in
                    defence of outlying and oppressed communities of Jews till, in 1860, an
                    organization was established in Paris which was destined to exert a permanent
                    watchfulness over the oppressions practised in the less civilized countries upon
                    Jews, as well as to improve the backward communities of Hebrews by education.
                    This was the Alliance Israélite Universelle, which on January 1, 1881, had
                    24,000 subscribers in all parts of the world, though Israelites are by no means
                    unanimous in supporting it.</p>
                <p>The connexion be tween .the local committeesand the central body is not very
                    intimate, but a correspondence is constantly kept up, and subscriptions for
                    public objects flow from one to the other according to their respective wants
                    and wealth. The Alliance and similar societies of a more strictly national
                    character which exist in London and Vienna made representations at the Berlin
                    conference in 1878, and helped to procure some alleviations of the state of the
                    Jews in Roumanie and Servia. The exertions of the same bodies had previously
                    arrested, by making them known to Europe, the atrocities practised upon the
                    Roumanian Jews in 1872. Similar action was brought to bear at the Madrid
                    conference in 1880 in favour of the Jews in Morocco. Another part of the work of
                    the Alliance is to maintain or assist schools for boys and girls in North Africa
                    and in the Turkish empire, &amp;c. In this task it cooperates with the
                    Anglo-Jewish association formed for similar objects in England, the Board of
                    Deputies in London, and the Alliance in Vienna. The Alliance has also an
                    organization for apprenticing Jewish children to useful tradesin elevenEastern
                    towns. Other Jewish public institutions at Paris are the rabbinical seminary
                    under chief rabbi Wogue, schools and an industrial school for girls, the
                    hospital founded by the late Baron James de Rothschild, the orphanage
                    established by the late Baron Salomon de Rothschild, the ladies’ committee and
                    house of refuge, a central committee for Jerusalem schools, the society of
                    Talmudical studies, and many burial and mutual aid societies. At Lyons and
                    Marseilles there are similar institutions.</p>
                <p>The distinction between reform and orthodox congregations, which has been noticed
                    in Germany, and reappears elsewhere, is not found in France. The older
                    distinction between the Spanish and Portuguese Jews (Sephardim) on the one hand,
                    and the Polish and German Jews (Ashkenazim) on the other, is, however, still
                    made. They have different synagogues, in which a somewhat different ritual and a
                    different pronunciation of Hebrew are employed. No doctrinal distinction,
                    however, exists between the two divisions, and they now freely intermarry and
                    associate with each other, although at their first meeting in France and
                    England, about a century ago, and for some time later, the rich and polished
                    emigrés from the south refused to mix with their uncultured northern brethren.
                    The Jews of German rite are now much more numerous and wealthy in western Europe
                    than the Sephardim.</p>
                <p>The number of Jews in France in 1880 was about 60,000, of whom 34,000 were in the
                    consistorial circonscription of Paris, 8800 in that of Nancy, 2200 in Lyons,
                    4000 in Bordeaux, 2200 in Bayonne, 4000 in Marseilles. The Jewish population in
                    Franco (including northern Italy, and Treves, Mainz, Coblentz, &amp;c.) in 1808
                    was 77,000; it had risen to 158,994 (without including Italy or Treves and its
                    sister cities) when the census of 1866 was taken, but fell to 49,439 in the
                    census of 1872, owing to the loss of Alsace-Lorraine<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n717/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0717-0684"/>, the part of France in which the most numerous
                    Jewish population existed. The Jewish inhabitants of the Paris circonscription
                    were in 1808 only 3585 in number, about a tenth of their number in 1880. Two
                    Jewish newspapers are published in the French language at Paris, and one at
                    Avignon. The Jewish population of Algeria in 1880 was (according to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Annuaire Israélite)</hi> 72,800, of whom 52,000 were in the
                    consistorial circonscription of Oran. These figures show a large increase in the
                    population in recent years. Μ. Cremieux by a stroke of the pen obliged the
                    Israelites in Algiers to become French citizens, a step that had previously
                    involved certain formalities which their conservative feeling resisted. The
                    measure, however, led to an outbreak of the Arabs. In Versailles exertions were
                    made to cancel it, and its operation was suspended, but finally the decree was
                    sustained, and the Jews, who form the class among the native population most
                    fitted for civilization, retain the franchise.</p>
                <p>The Jews were readmitted into England by Cromwell on the application of Manasseh
                    ben Israel; and the Spanish and Portuguese Jews from Amsterdam took a lease of
                    ground for a burying-place at Stepney in February 1657. The first recorded
                    interment was in 1658. The city of London, which was afterwards to aid so
                    powerfully in the emancipation of the Jews, petitioned the council in the first
                    years of the restoration to remove the competing Jewish merchants, but, this and
                    other petitions being unsuccessful, a synagogue was built and the copyhold of
                    the cemetery was acquired, although up to fifty years ago doubt was sometimes
                    expressed whether Israelites even if born in the country could hold land in
                    England. The right of Jewish charities to hold land was clearly established by
                    an Act passed in 1846. The Jews were too few in number to be visited with
                    special disabilities, but suffered from the general operation of the Tests Acts,
                    which excluded them from political, civil, and municipal offices, from the bar,
                    &amp;c., and could be invoked to prevent them from voting at parliamentary
                    elections. Jacob Abendana and David Nieto are rabbinical writers who flourished
                    in England in the 17th and early in the 18th centuries. In 1725 Sarmento, a
                    mathematician, was (like Gompertz and others after him) made a Fellow of the
                    Royal Society. Emanuel Mendes da Costa was secretary and librarian of the
                    society a few years later (died 1769). Sir Solomon Medina financed the
                    commissariat in the duke of Marlborough’s campaigns. But the Sephardic
                    immigration is best known by the converts to Christianity whom it supplied, as
                    Isaac Disraeli, and his son Lord Beaconsfield (who was baptized at the age of
                    twelve), David Ricardo, the Lopes family, and others. Conversion to Christianity
                    was encouraged by a statute of Anne (repealed in 1846), which compelled Jewish
                    parents to make an allowance to their children who embraced the dominant faith.
                    German Jews began to immigrate in large numbers after the accession of the house
                    of Hanover. English statesmen soon perceived what important contributions the
                    business ability of the Jews was capable of rendering to the wealth of the
                    country in which they settled, but the enlightened appreciation of the governing
                    class was long in making its way among the electors. In 1753 Mr Pelham passed
                    his Jewish Naturalization Act, which was repealed the next year owing to popular
                    clamour, “No more Jews, no wooden shoes,” becoming as influential a refrain as
                    Lilliburlero. This premature emancipation supplied an argument which afterwards
                    assisted to retard the political liberation of the Jews. The Jews were excepted
                    from the benefit of the Irish Naturalization Actin 1783; the exception was
                    abolished in 1846; in that year also the obsolete statute De Judaismo, which
                    prescribed a special dress for Jews, &lt;fcc., was formally repealed. It had
                    been disregarded ever since the return of the Jews under Cromwell. The Reform
                    Act of 1832 gave the right of voting for members of parliament in all
                    constituencies to Jews who possessed the property or other qualification
                    required. Mr Robert Grant, M.P. for Inverness, in 1830 proposed to admit Jewish
                    members to the House of Commons, Mr Huskisson having previously presented a
                    petition asking for this concession. The bill was carried on the first reading
                    by eighteen votes, but lost on the second by sixty-three. The Board of Deputies
                    had been appointed in 1760 to watch over the interests of the “Portuguese
                    nation” as the Sephardic Jews called themselves in England and France; it was
                    shortly afterwards joined by delegates of the German congregation, and now
                    represents the orthodox congregations in the principal towns of the United
                    Kingdom. Through this board the House of Commons was frequently petitioned in
                    the next thirty years to grant political equality to the Jews, and the claim was
                    supported by eminent statesmen, notably by Macaulay and by Lord Russell, the
                    latter of whom brought in an annual bill on the subject. Baron Lionel de
                    Rothschild was elected five times by the city of London before he was allowed to
                    vote, and was eleven years a member of the House of Commons without taking the
                    oath. Aiderman Salomons was returned for Greenwich in 1851, and took his seat,
                    spoke, and voted, having in repeating the oath omitted the words “on the true
                    faith of a Christian.” He was fined £500 by the court of exchequer, and was
                    obliged to retire from parliament. The enabling bills had been passed year after
                    year in the House of Commons, but as often rejected by the Lords, until in 1858
                    a compromise was effected, and Jews were permitted by the joint operation of an
                    Act of Parliament and a resolution of the House of Commons to omit on taking the
                    oath required of a member of the Lower House the words to which they
                    conscientiously objected. In 1866 and 1868 Acts were passed which prescribed an
                    oath in a form unobjectionable to Jews to be used in the Houses of Lords and
                    Commons alike, but no Jew by religion has yet been raised to the peerage.
                    Remarkable legislative provisions in favour of the Jews are the exceptions by
                    which they have enjoyed since 1870 under the Factories Acts the right to labour
                    on Sunday in certain factories if they rest on their own Sabbath. Till 1828 only
                    twelve Jewish brokers were permitted to carry on business in the city of London,
                    and the patent was purchased for large sums when vacancies occurred. No Jew
                    could open a shop in the city till 1832, because that permission was only
                    accorded to freemen. Even baptized Jews were not admitted to the freedom of the
                    city between 1785 and 1828. The first Jewish sheriff of London, Sir D. Salomons,
                    was unable to take the oaths till a special Act was passed by Lord Campbell in
                    1835, and, although he was followed two years later by another Jewish sheriff,
                    Sir Moses Montefiore, it was not until ten years after his election as aiderman
                    that Lord Lyndhurst’s Act (1845) enabled him to perform the duties of that
                    office. Among the names of Jews in England distinguished in science and
                    literature are the mathematician Sylvester, the Sanskrit scholar Goldstiicker,
                    and the Orientalists Zedner and Deutsch. The first Jewish barrister (Sir F.
                    Goldsmid) was called to the bar in 1833.</p>
                <p>The Jews’ Free School in London is probably the largest and most efficient
                    elementary school in England. Two Jewish newspapers are published in London. The
                    Jewish community in England maintains many charitable and other public
                    institutions. The most important are the boards of guardians in London and
                    Manchester, which are chiefly occupied in the relief of penniless emigrants from
                    Russian Poland. Dr Benisch, the late editor of the <hi rend="italic">Jeιvish
                    Chronicle,</hi> founded in 1871 the Anglo-Je wish association to co-operate with
                    the Alliance Israélite of Paris, which has been already described. The
                    association has nearly 3000 members, chiefly in England and the colonies, but
                    also at Alexandria and Tangiers. The Jews’ college in London and the Aria
                    college at Pottsea are designed for the training of ministers and teachers.
                    Three societies for the promotion of Hebrew literature have been formed. The
                    only one which still exists is the Society of Hebrew Literature, to which
                    Christian scholars have contributed equally with the Jeλvish students of the
                    same subject. The principal religious movement has been the formation of the
                    West London congregation of British Jews, a body of dissenters, who have
                    simplified the ritual, only keep one day of the festivals, and do not
                    acknowledge the spiritual ascendency of the chief rabbi.</p>

                <p>They seceded, in 1840. Congregations at Manchester and Bradford worship with the
                    same rites. The Sephardim and Ashkenazim still differ in liturgy and in
                    pronunciation of Hebrew. The principal London synagogues of the latter body were
                    federated by private Act of Parliament in 1870 under the name of the United
                    Synagogue, which now consists of ten London congregations. Its liturgy was
                    modified in the direction of brevity in 1880. Forty provincial orthodox
                    synagogues are recognized by the Board of Deputies, which under the Marriage
                    Acts certifies the secretaries of orthodox synagogues entitled to register
                    marriages.</p>
                <p>The Jewish population of Great Britain is estimated (in the absence of a census
                    by religions) to be 62,000, of whom 40,000 are reckoned to be in London. There
                    were 453 Jews in Ireland at the census of 1881.</p>
                <p>In the British colonies Jews are numerous and their congregations flourishing.
                    There are nearly 2000 Jews in Gibraltar, who carry on an active commerce with
                    their brethren in Morocco, sending Manchester and Sheffield goods, and receiving
                    corn, hides, and other produce. Their settlement dates from the British
                    occupation in 1704, which allowed the unhappy Spanish refugees in Morocco to
                    return to a corner of Spain. Jews have been law-officers, ministers, members of
                    the legislatures, and magistrates in the Australasian colonies, Cape Colony, the
                    West Indies, &amp;c. In Victoria there were 3571 Jews iu 1870, and a Jewish
                    newspaper is published at Melbourne; in West Australia there were 62 only in
                    1870; in Tasmania they formed only 0’23 per cent, of the total population of
                    99,328.</p>
                <p>A remarkable settlement exists in Bombay under the name of the Beni Israel. They
                    are 5000 in number, and are for the most part artisans, some of them soldiers.
                    They support a school to which the Anglo-Jewish association in London and
                    Manchester contributes. The Beni Israel have a tradition that they were
                    shipwrecked on that coast more than one thousand years ago. They have always
                    strictly observed the Sabbath, refraining from cooking their food or doing any
                    other work on that day. They do not eat unclean fish or flesh; they observe the
                    great feasts, and have a Jewish type of countenance. The Beni Israel are found
                    not only in Bombay itself but in other towns on the coast not beneath the direct
                    rule of the British Government. They relate that David Rababia, a Jew either of
                    Baghdad or Cochin, came to that part of India about nine hundred years ago, and,
                    having discovered that the Beni Israel were observing the Jewish code, was
                    convinced of their Jewish origin, and established a Hebrew school. Before his
                    death he gave a written order to two of his scholars to succeed him as religious
                    ministers. This office has been retained to this day by their descendants. These
                    ministers are called kajees, and are considered superior to the ordinary
                    religious ministers who receive payment for officiating in the synagogues. They
                    are in some respects like high priests and civil heads of the community; and in
                    the outlying villages ecclesiastical and civil matters are investigated and
                    settled by them with the aid of a council. With these kajees maybe compared the
                    cohanim (priests) in the Western Jewish communities, who are reputed to be
                    descendants of Aaron, and enjoy the prerogative of blessing the people, and a
                    certain precedence in synagogue, to the exclusion of ministers who are not of
                    the same lineage. In Bombay judicial and other civil functions for the Beni
                    Israel are performed by a person called Nassi or head, aided by a council. The
                    Beni Israel have been settled in Bombay itself for upwards of one hundred and
                    fifty years. Their first synagogue was built in 1796 by Samuel Ezekiel, a native
                    commandant in the British army sent against Tippoo Sahib. The Sephardic daily
                    prayer-book, Dr Hermann Adler’s sermons, and some other works have been
                    translated by the Beni Israel into Marathi. Some of them know Hebrew, although
                    Marathi is their ordinary language, and their knowledge of Hebrew is probably
                    rather due to frequent intercommunication with the Jews of Baghdad and Europe
                    than to independent tradition. The Beni Israel rarely intermarry with the
                    ordinary Jews. They have a literature in Marathi. They tie a golden band (“munny
                    ”) with black glass beads round the bride’s neck during marriage to show that
                    the bride is a married woman; when she is stripped of it she is considered a
                    widow. They say that they adopted the title of Beni Israel because that of
                    Jehudim or Jews was hateful to the Mussulmans. The Baghdad and Cochin Jews
                    attend their synagogues and. eat with them, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> They have among them a class of Beni Israel whom they designate Kala
                    Israel or Black Israel. Between them and the white Beni Israel no intermarriages
                    are ever solemnized. They are descendants of Beni Israel by heathen wives, or
                    are proselytes or their descendants. They have separate burying-grounds.</p>
                <p>The Jews of Cochin, found in that British port of the Madras presidency and
                    elsewhere on the Malabar coast, have the tradition that they arrived at
                    Cranganore in the sixty-eighth year of the Christian era, and received a written
                    charter from the native ruler, and that when the Portuguese came they suffered
                    oppression and. removed to Cochin, λvhere the rajah granted them places to build
                    their synagogues and houses. They again suffered from the Portuguese, but the
                    Dutch conquest in 1662 gave them protection. At Cochin there are black and white
                    Jews. The white Jews consider themselves as immigrants from Palestine. The black
                    Jews are regarded as proselytes and emancipated slaves of the white Jews. The
                    black and white do not intermarry with each other, and the black Jews do not
                    observe all the ceremonies of the law.</p>
                <p>The history and condition of the Jews in three important countries and their
                    colonies having been somewhat fully sketched, a shorter account of their
                    situation elsewhere will be sufficient. The Austrian Jews participated in all
                    the intellectual movements of their brethren in Germany. Their chief writers are
                    Kompert (the brilliant author of <hi rend="italic">Tales of the Ghetto),</hi>
                    Frankl the poet, G. Wolf, historian, Mosenthal, dramatist, Dukes, Kayserling,
                    Mannheimer, Jellinek, Giidemann, Kaufmann, Letteris. The chief training
                    establishment for rabbis is the Budapest seminary established with the proceeds
                    of the fine imposed upon the Jews for participation in the insurrection in 1848.
                    Austria was long notorious for ill-treatment of the Jews, but Joseph II. made in
                    1783 a new departure in his policy towards this class of his subjects. He
                    abolished the Leibzoll, night-notices, passport regulations, and gave the Jews
                    permission to learn trades, art, science, and, under certain restrictions,
                    agriculture. The doors of the universities and academies were opened to them. He
                    founded Jewish elementary and normal schools, and also compelled the adults to
                    learn the language of the country. In spite of these reforms, considerable
                    restrictions were still imposed upon the Jews with regard to right of residence,
                    &amp;c., and the successors of the philosophic emperor, ’Leopold II. and Francis
                    I., restored many of the old humiliating regulations. The Jews in Austria
                    remained during the greater part of the present century subject to special
                    restrictions. To remove from province to province they required the permission
                    of the central Government. In many parts of the empire they were not allowed to
                    rent or purchase lands beyond their own dwellings. The Magyar nobles, however,
                    employed them largely as bailiff's, gave them great freedom of tenure, and
                    actually fought under their lead as military officers in the struggle for
                    independence. After 1848 the Jewish capitation tax was reduced except in Vienna;
                    but, as many Jews had taken part in the revolutionary movement in Hungary, a
                    heavy exaction was imposed upon them after its suppression. The reforms
                    inaugurated by the constitution of 1860 for Austria and in 1861 for the rest of
                    the empire, and completed in 1868, at length gave the Austrian Jews the freedom
                    which they now enjoy, which makes them influential and respected in Vienna and
                    the other great towns, and even in the backward province of Galicia a striking
                    contrast to their less favoured brethren in the neighbouring country of Russian
                    Poland. Several Jews, two of them rabbis, sit in the legislatures. The
                    Israelitish Alliance was founded in Vienna in 1872. The number of the Jews in
                    the empire of Austria-Hungary is 1,372,333, or more than 3 per cent, of the
                    total population. Of the total number, 820,200 are found in Austria (including
                    575,433, or more than a tenth of the total population in Galicia), and 552,133
                    in Hungary.</p>
                <p>In Italy, while Venice and Leghorn sheltered large and comparatively flourishing
                    colonies, the Roman Jews had long an unenviable pre-eminence in suffering. Till
                    1847 they were not permitted to leave the Ghetto, and their conversion was
                    sought by most oppressive means. It was in the papal states after this date that
                    the young Mortara, secretly baptized by his nurse, was tonι from his parents,
                    and trained to be a monk. The kingdom of Italy brought freedom and political
                    equality to the Jews. The most celebrated of recent Jewish scholars in Italy was
                    S. D. Luzzatto (1800-1865). The rabbinical college at Padua, founded by J. S.
                    Reggio of Gorz (1784-1855), fell with the Austrian domination in 1866. The
                    number of Jews in Italy was in 1876 estimated to be 53,000, of whom 5000 were in
                    Rome, 2800 in Modena, 3000 in Venice, 2000 in Sicily, 7688 in Leghorn, 2500 in
                    Turin, 2000 in Padua.</p>
                <p>The census of 1870 gave 2582 as the number of the Jews in Greece. They enjoy
                    perfect freedom of worship, and live on terms of friendship and equality with
                    their neighbours in the kingdom of Greece, although at Alexandria, Smyrna, and
                    other towns of the Levant, quarrels sometimes occur between the two races.</p>
                <p>The liberal institutions established during the last few years in Spain have
                    permitted the Jews to return to a country in which their ancestors enjoyed a
                    glorious period of literary and social activity. In 1881 the Spanish
                    representative at Constantinople was authorized to assure some distressed Jews
                    who fled into Turkey to escape the persecutions of Russia that the Government of
                    Spain would welcome them to that country, in which, he added, all Jews could now
                    settle. At Seville Jewish worship is regularly held, and meat killed according
                    to Jewish rites can be bought. At Madrid a congregation assembles on the most
                    solemn fast in a private house.</p>
                <p>Since the commencement of this century foreign Jews of Portuguese origin from
                    Gibraltar and Africa have immigrated into Portugal and been permitted to
                    solemnize religious service there. There are three synagogues at Lisbon and one
                    in Oporto. On the Day of Atonement, unknown persons from a distance in the
                    interior have been observed to join these congregations; they were members of
                    Jewish families who had secretly preserved their religion and the tradition of
                    their origin during the whole time of the exclusion of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0719-0686"/> the Jews from Portugal. In 1821 the cortes
                    abolished the Inquisition, and resolved that all rights and privileges which had
                    been accorded to the Jews by former sovereigns should be renewed, and that all
                    Jews who dwelt in any part of the world might settle in Portugal. About 1000
                    Jews reside in this country.</p>
                <p>In Holland, which was long the refuge of the Jews, and was the cradle of a
                    flourishing Jewish literature, the Israelite immigrants were not entirely
                    without restrictions, although Mendelssohn pointed to Amsterdam as a commercial
                    paradise where all men were allowed free interchange of commodities. The 50,000
                    Jews of Holland, 20,000 of whom resided in Amsterdam, were first admitted to
                    political equality in 1796, and the closer union with France which followed
                    completed the work of liberation. At first this gift was not willingly received
                    by the leaders of the Jewish community. They enjoyed great power over
                    individuals, could levy large fines upon those members of the congregation who
                    incurred their displeasure, and feared that the new duty of serving as soldiers
                    and the new right of filling all the employments of the state would alienate
                    their flocks. The Portuguese (or Sephardic) J ews, who were regarded as the
                    aristocracy of their race, were especially conservative, and ultimately the
                    discussions about emancipation led to the secession of the neoterizing party
                    under the name of 'Adat Jeshurun. The number of Jews in Holland is now 68,000,
                    to whom 665 may be added for Luxembourg.</p>
                <p>In Belgium there are about 2000 Jews, who enjoy freedom and state subvention for
                    their worship as in France.</p>
                <p>In Switzerland the Jews were long treated with great severity, and the French
                    domination brought them only temporary relief. It was only in 1874 that full
                    religious equality was conceded to the Swiss Jews. Their number is now 6996.</p>
                <p>In Denmark the number of Jews does not exceed 4500. Since 1814 they have been
                    eligible as magistrates.</p>
                <p>The archives of the Sephardic synagogue in London contain a curious printed
                    invitation from the king of Sweden, sent in the year 1746, in which wealthy Jews
                    are invited to Sweden, while the poor are warned that their residence will be
                    unwelcome. The London Jews declined this calculating hospitality. There are now
                    1836 Jews in Sweden, and an insignificant number in Norway.</p>
                <p>In Russia the Jews are more numerous and more harshly treated than in any other
                    country in the world. From Russia proper the Jews were long and still are
                    excluded, but the conquests of the Muscovites brought them face to face With
                    large numbers of Israelites who, driven out of Germany by persecution, had taken
                    refuge in Poland under the sway of Casimir the Great. The half Hebrew half
                    German patois (Jüdisch-Deutsch) which Jews still speak in Russia and Roumania
                    preserves this part of their history. A literature exists in this language:
                    journals are printed in it with Hebrew characters; theatrical representations
                    are given in it, and two companies in London lately played dramas in it, in
                    which the main point of the action was the misery of the religious Jew, who is
                    dragged away from the study of his favourite Talmudical books to serve in the
                    army, where he can hope, as a Jew, for no promotion. The flourishing factories,
                    agriculture, and commerce of the Polish and Lithuanian Jews were wrecked by the
                    intolerance of the successors of Casimir, and Russian oppression completed the
                    ruin. The Jews are still confined to <hi rend="italic">a few</hi> over-populated
                    provinces, and loaded with special taxes and restrictions. Under Alexander II.
                    the condition of the Jews was in some respects improved, and the permission
                    accorded for three Jews to settle at each railway station has enabled a few to
                    escape from the old overcrowded settlements and find a new sphere for their
                    commercial activity. They are still, however, largely at the mercy of the
                    official class, and popular risings against them have been repeatedly permitted
                    or encouraged. They are excluded from many vocations, or practise them only by
                    the connivance of bribed officials. For some purposes they are still subject to
                    the jurisdiction of the rabbis. Haτkavy, Pinsker, Mandelstamm, Reiffman, and
                    Levinsohn are among their most learned writers; Baron Günzburg is at the head of
                    a society for spreading culture among the masses. In spite of their
                    disabilities, there are among the Russian Jews enterprising contractors, skilful
                    doctors, and successful lawyers. The number of Jews in European Russia was
                    returned for 1876 as 2,612,179. In Russia in Asia they are estimated to number
                    25,000. For the <hi rend="smallcaps">Karaites</hi> in Russia see that
                    article.</p>
                <p>At the beginning of the present century the Jews were found in Moldavia
                    everywhere keeping the village inns and forming the centres for the commerce of
                    their districts. Engaged in this occupation, or travelling through the country
                    to buy or advance money upon the crops, and to sell foreign merchandise, were
                    Jews, some of whom had come from Poland or Russia, while the families of others,
                    resident chiefly at Bucharest, had been in the country from time immemorial.
                    They also exercised many handicrafts. They were glaziers, locksmiths, tinmen,
                    tailors, &amp;c. The metal roofs and pinnacles of churches were all the work of
                    Jews. In the great towns of Moldavia, and also in the Wallachian city of
                    Bucharest, there were established wealthy communities belonging to both
                    divisions of the modern Jews, Ashkenazim and Sephardim. Of the Sephardim or
                    Spanish Jews it is known beyond a doubt that they settled in the country many
                    centuries ago. They belonged to the families driven from Spain by the
                    Inquisition. The principal bankers of Roumania are Jews. Their children have
                    been in the habit of attending the same schools as the wealthy native families,
                    and the parents held a good position in society. In Jassy, the principal city of
                    Moldavia, 30,000 or 40,000 out of the 90,000 inhabitants are Jews. In 1804 the
                    practice of the neighbouring states began to creep into Roumania. In that year
                    an ordinance of Prince Mourousi of Moldavia deprived the Jews of the right to
                    hold farms except when attached to village inns. Since that time there have been
                    a series of laws and edicts limiting the freedom of the Jews to hold land and
                    engage in various professions and trades; the Jews have also had much to suffer
                    from popular outbreaks, and even the treaty of Berlin, which abolished all
                    incapacitation on grounds of religion, has been interpreted by the Roumanian
                    Government as not applying , to the Jews, who are regarded as foreigners, and
                    only naturalized in small numbers and by special acts of the legislature. There
                    are 200,000 Jews in Roumania, and perhaps two or three thousand may have been
                    admitted to naturalization.</p>
                <p>In Servia there are 2000 Jews. They have suffered from occasional orders of
                    expulsion from the country districts, but on the whole their condition is
                    comparatively favoured, and they are believed to be on the eve of being
                    admitted, if not already admitted, to political rights.</p>
                <p>The Jews in European Turkey before the war which ended with the treaty of 1878
                    were estimated to number 72,000 (in Adrianople 15,000, Shumla 1500, Widdin 1200,
                    Varna 300, Tatar Bazardjik 1050, Dardanelles 2000, Philippopoli 2100, Rustshuk
                    2500, &amp;c.). There are some thousands in eastern Roumelia, and others in
                    Bulgaria, who have been very fairly treated by the authorities of the new
                    principality, having grants for their schools, &amp;c. The exertions of Dr
                    Allatιni of Salonica have provided the community of that town (25,000 to 30,000
                    persons) with excellent means of education. Here is published the <hi
                    rend="italic">Epoca,</hi> a Spanish newspaper in Hebrew characters, which
                    recalls the fact that this, like so many of the Jewish communities on the shores
                    of the Mediterranean, sprang from exiles from Spain. The Jewish population of
                    Constantinople consists of about 30,000 souls. Most of the Jews are Sephardim.
                    Two thousand follow the German rite, and are principally to be found in Galata.
                    The Jews in Constantinople are chiefly engaged in traffic. They are governed by
                    a caim-macam appointed by themselves, and salaried by the Government. There are
                    forty-two synagogues in the suburbs. Besides the schools of the Alliance, there
                    are 2287 pupils in the wretched Talmud Torah schools. There are also three
                    infant schools. The number of Jews in Asiatic Turkey is stated to be from
                    106,000 to 130,000. The Smyrna Jews number 25,000. In Baghdad, where there are
                    30,000 Jews, and where the wealthy family of Sassoon first became known, there
                    are twenty-one synagogues. Pilgrimages are made to the tombs of Ezra, Ezekiel,
                    Joshua the priest, and Sheikh Isaac. There are 500 families in Aidin, 400 in
                    Magnesia, 250 in Casaba, 130 in Pergamos, 516 in Canea in Crete, 200 in Candia,
                    1200 in Beyrout, 2000 in Damascus, 10,200 in Aleppo. Outbreaks of religious
                    hatred between the Greeks and the Jews, and even between the Mahometans and the
                    Jews, have occasionally occurred at Smyrna, Rhodes, &amp;c. The Jews on each
                    occasion have been accused of using Christian blood at the passover. The falsity
                    of this charge was publicly established in 1840, owing to the efforts of Sir
                    Moses Montefiore, who journeyed to the East, accompanied by Crémieux and Munk,
                    to vindicate the innocence of those of his coreligionists who had been put to
                    death, and to liberate those who were imprisoned. The sultan then issued, at the
                    request of Sir Moses Montefiore, a firman declaring the innocence of the Jews,
                    and their title to his equal protection. They now suffer under no disabilities,
                    and are admissible to office.</p>
                <p>There are 15,000 Jews in Jerusalem (forming half the population), whose chief
                    occupation is to study the Talmud. To maintain them in this hallowed indolence
                    their brethren throughout the world send annual contributions <hi rend="italic"
                    >{hcduka)</hi> amounting to about £50,000 a year, or five-sevenths of the total
                    revenue of Palestine. The rabbis who administer these large funds, and also
                    wield the dreaded weapon of excommunication <hi rend="italic">(hercm),</hi> have
                    set their faces against secular education, regarding Jerusalem as the one great
                    rabbinical college of the world, where the contributors of the haluka fulfil the
                    sacred duty of studying the law by proxy. Both Ashkenazim and Sephardim (whose
                    leaders, more liberal than the Ashkenazim, permit Arabic to be taught), both
                    Chasidim and Karaites, are represented here; the Sephardim dress as Orientals;
                    the Russians and Poles wear their long silk or cloth gowns and fur caps, the
                    Germans the quaintly cut coat and flattened wideawake of the early part of this
                    century. All cultivate the long love-locks brought down in front of the ears in
                    obedience to Lev. xix. 27. Boys often marry at fifteen, girls at thirteen. There
                    are two weekly Hebrew newspapers. The synagogues are very numerous; around them
                    cluster the Talmud schools. There are three hospitals for Jews, one of which is
                    maintained by a Christian mission, numerous almshouses, of which the Juda Touro
                    house is the principal, and several endowed schools.</p>

                <p>Jewish agricultural colonies have been formed at Lydda and elsewhere, and an
                    excellent agricultural school at Jaffa receives thirty pupils. Jews are found at
                    Hebron, Tiberias (1100 in number), Kamleh, Safed (5666), and elsewhere in the
                    Holy Land.</p>
                <p>In the mountains of Kurdistan and on the plain of Urmiah there are Jews who speak
                    an Aramaic dialect—“the language of the Targum.” The Jews in Persia, as in many
                    other countries, write their vernacular in Hebrew characters. They are engaged
                    as peddlers in petty trades or in larger commerce, or enter into partnership
                    with Kurdish farmers, to whom they supply capital, receiving half the produce.
                    As a rule monogamy prevails, but exceptions are frequent when the marriage
                    proves childless, or when the levirate law comes into operation. Jews settle
                    their differences with each other by· applying to the <hi rend="italic">malum
                    {j.e.,</hi> the rabbi) of the place, who together* with his <hi rend="italic"
                    >beth din</hi> forms the authorized court of justice. Boys are taught reading,
                    writing, the Scriptures, and sometimes the Mishna. Every man and woman wears
                    charms as safeguards against the evil eye, as protections both from ailments and
                    from the attacks of enemies. The fear of infidelity is one of the causes which
                    deter parents from letting their children learn secular subjects. Yet as each
                    congregation requires the services of a <hi rend="italic">dayan</hi> or
                    religious chief, the necessity of cultivating some kind of knowledge cannot be
                    entirely ignored. Persons desirous of pursuing a course of studies have had to
                    resort to Urmiah and to Baghdad. There are ten synagogues, and 3θ0 families in
                    Teheran, partly engaged in skilled trades and professions. Jews are also found
                    in Ispahan and other towns, &amp;c. They are very poor, the majority in Ispahan
                    being day-labourers and porters. The total number of the Jews in Persia is
                    estimated to be 16,000.</p>
                <p>In Bokhara (13,000), in Samarkand (10,000), in Merv, throughout Central Asia,
                    Jews are scattered. The small colonies of Jews in Kai-fung-foo, Hansho, Ningpo,
                    and Peking are regarded by the Chinese as a sect of Mahometans. They are termed
                    Taou-Kin-Kedou (“separators of the sinew from the flesh”). These colonies, of
                    ancient settlement, are not to be confounded with the European Jewish merchants,
                    who under European protection now trade in the ports. The Jews of Kai-fung-foo
                    have parted with their sacred scrolls, and their synagogues are ruined.</p>
                <p>The Jews in Yemen have a long history, but the present Jewish population is
                    stated by the latest observer (a correspondent of the Alliance Israélite,
                    writing in 1881 ) to be only 15,000 in number. An older estimate (1876) made
                    them number 200,000. They are chiefly found in Sanaa, the capital (where they
                    are from 2000 to 3000 in number, and have thirteen synagogues under a Chacham
                    Bashi), and also in the mountain villages. For upwards of eighty years the Jews
                    of Sanaa have been the victims of repeated persecutions, false accusations, and
                    exactions; and until twelve years ago to these were added the duties of
                    scavengers and night-men, imposed even upon the rabbis, and not redeemable by
                    money payments. The assumption of sovereignty by the Porte much improved their
                    position. They are artisans, labourers, and merchants.</p>
                <p>Wealthy Jews reside at Cairo (3000), others at Alexandria (where the odious blood
                    accusations were recently revived against them) and Port Said. There are in all
                    about 8000 Jews in Egypt.</p>
                <p>In Abyssinia are found the Falashas, whose Jewish descent is doubted J&gt;y some
                    ethnologists. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Falashas,</hi> and Halévy in <hi

                <p>The Jews in Tripoli are estimated at 100,000. Tunis is variously said to contain
                    40,000 or 60,000 Jews. Those in the ports are European, chiefly Spanish, in
                    recent origin. In the interior Jews live in tents, carry on agriculture on a
                    communal basis, dress like their neighbours, bear long matchlocks, and rove from
                    place to place like them; many, however, are goldsmiths. They conform strictly
                    to the Jewish ceremonial laws.</p>
                <p>The number of the Jews in Morocco was stated by the deputation which petitioned
                    the British foreign office on their behalf in 1880 to be 300,000. There are 1200
                    in Larache, 1400 in Alcazar, 6000 in Tetuan, 8000 in Tangiers. Many are of
                    Spanish origin. Jews have frequently been chosen, in bygone times, to represent
                    the sultan as envoys. They now suffer from the fanaticism of the Mahometans, and
                    are compelled to go barefoot in sign of their submission in nearly all the
                    cities. Robbers plunder them almost with impunity, and murders of Jews are
                    frequent. About a hundred enjoy protection from Christian powers, which was
                    confirmed at the conference of Madrid in 1880, but is impatiently submitted to
                    by the</p>
                <p>Jews in the interior or beyond the boundary of Morocco live a nomad life like the
                    Jewish tribes of Arabia, and conduct caravans across the desert as far as
                    Timbuctoo. Mardochée, a member of the first Israelite family who settled in
                    Timbuctoo, has described the Daggatoun (merchants), a tribe of Jews who have
                    forgotten their religion, but cherish the tradition of their descent, and
                    proclaim it by their fair complexions and the character of their features; they
                    live in the Sahara in the midst of a Mussulman race, with whom they do not
                    intermarry.</p>
                <p>There are several thousands of Jews in Brazil; a Dutch Jewish colony was founded
                    at Savannas in Surinam, but has lost its distinctive character; a few Jews are
                    scattered in Mexico and the South American ports.</p>
                <p>In the United States Jews are numerous, and enjoy full equality of rights and
                    great material prosperity. A Jewish colony was founded by Judge Mordecai Noah,
                    sheriff of New York, in 1825, at Grand Island in the Niagara river, but did not
                    long endure. The Jews of the United States organize themselves in great friendly
                    societies. Of these there are four principal orders :—the B’nai Berith (Sons of
                    the Covenant), which in 1878 had 22,814 members, had paid $1,000,000 in
                    benefits, and retained $570,000 in hand; the Independent Order of Free Sons of
                    Israel, with 8604 members; the Kesher shel Barzel (Iron Link), with 10,000
                    members and $112,000; the Improved Order Free Sons of Israel, with 2849 members.
                    Jewish hospitals, orphan asylums, free schools, benevolent institutions, exist
                    in very many cities. The union of American congregations comprises 118
                    congregations, and has for its objects (1) to promote religious instruction, and
                    (2) to co-operate with similar associations throughout the world to relieve and
                    elevate oppressed Jews. Many ways of interpreting Scripture prevail among the
                    Jews in the United States<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The leader of the most advanced school is Dr Felix Adler, who, in his
                    discourses, <hi rend="italic">Creed and Deed,</hi> advocates the supersession of
                    religion by ethical culture.</p></note>. Some keep Sabbath on Sunday, others
                    pray in English without any use of Hebrew; there is much laxity in observance,
                    but alζsects agree in building magnificent synagogues. In 1878 there werd'in the
                    United States 278 congregations with 12,546 members, owning in their corporate
                    capacity real estate worth $4,778,700 and other property worth $1,860,030,
                    sending 12,886 children to their schools, and forming a population of about
                    250,000.</p>
                <p>Some further particulars may be given regarding the Jewish press. There are,
                    according to Lippe, 86 Jewish periodicals, as follows :— 18 in the Hebrew
                    language, published at Vienna (2), Warsaw (2), Wilna, St Petersburg, Königsberg
                    (2), Lyck (2), Mainz, Jerusalem (3), and 4 in Galicia (at Brody, Kolomea,
                    Tarnopol, and Lemberg); 14 in Jüdisch-Deutsch, published at Vienna (2),
                    Bucharest (3), Mainz, New York, Pressburg, Chicago, Königsberg, Lernberg,
                    Budapest (2); 22 in German, published at Würzburg, Breslau, Berlin (4),
                    Frankfort-on-the-Main, Leipsic (3), Bromberg, Krotoschin, Mainz, Magdeburg,
                    Lemberg, Budapest (2), Melnik (Bohemia), Bilni (Bohemia), Vienna, Cincinnati,
                    and Milwaukee; 4 in French (reckoning the bulletin of the Alliance as one) at
                    Paris (3), Avignon; 14 in English, at London (2), New York (4), Cincinnati (2),
                    San Francisco (partly in German), Chicago, Philadelphia, Atalanta, St Louis, and
                    Melbourne; 3 in Italian, at Trieste, Casale Monferrato, and Corfu; 3 in Dutch,
                    at Rotterdam (2), Amsterdam; 2 in Russian, both at St . Petersburg; 2 in Polish,
                    at Warsaw and Tarnopol in Galicia; 1 in Hungarian, at Budapest; 6 in Spanish (5
                    of them in Hebrew characters), at Vienna (2), Constantinople (2), Salonica, and
                    Smyrna. In addition to these, Lippe gives 8 annuals:—1 in Roumanian at
                    Bucharest, 1 in French at Paris, 1 in Russian at St Petersburg, 1 partly in
                    German and partly in Hebrew at Bamberg, and 4 in German at Brody,
                    Frankfort-on-the-Main, Halberstadt, and Prague. Two Jewish calendars appear
                    annually in London.</p>
                <p>From the numbers of the Jewish population which we have given it results that
                    there are about 5,000,000 Jews in Europe. In Asia 200,000, in Africa 700,000,
                    maybe approximately correct totals, in America 300,000, in Australia 20,000. The
                    total Jewish population of the world would thus be 6,200,000. It may be added
                    that the vital statistics of the Jews differ a little from those of the nations
                    with which they have been compared. The Jews have a somewhat greater average
                    longevity,which is attributed to their abstinence, comparative freedom from
                    phthisis, &amp;c., and to their not often following employments which shorten
                    life. Their dietary laws and ceremonial ablutions have an influence in
                    preserving them from epidemics.</p>
