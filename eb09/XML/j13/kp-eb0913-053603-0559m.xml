                    implies also his union with Leah (whose maid was Zilpah). Before he left Padan
                    Aram he had become the father of twelve sons, including Benjamin (Gen. xχxv.
                    23-26). On his return, with the property he had acquired, to his father Isaac in
                    Canaan (xxxi. 18), God met him and blessed him and changed his name from Jacob
                    to Israel; the place where this occurred was called by him Bethel (xxxv. 9-13,
                    XXXV. 15). In the course of a further migration southwards, Rachel died at a
                    point not far from Ephrath (Bethlehem); finally Mamre, near Kirjath Arba
                    (Hebron), where Isaac was living, was reached, and a permanent settlement
                    appears to have been made until the death of Isaac there at the age of one
                    hundred and eighty years. The subsequent migration of Jacob to Egypt with his
                    household of seventy souls is then briefly indicated, and his hospitable
                    reception as an old man of one hundred and thirty by Pharaoh. A residence was
                    assigned to the colony in the best part of the land, the land of Rameses, by
                    Joseph, and here the Israelites prospered much and rapidly increased. Seventeen
                    years after the interview with Pharaoh the patriarch died, after having blessed
                    his sons and particularly Joseph, whose two sons Ephraim and Manasseh he put
                    upon a level with Reuben and Simeon. He was buried by his family, according to
                    his own desire, in the cave of Machpelah, fronting Mamre, in the land of Canaan.
                    The combined parallel narrative of the Jehovist and the other (elder) Elohist is
                    much fuller, and in some points not easily to be reconciled with the preceding
                    account. Various circumstances connected with the birth of the twins Isaac and
                    Jacob are detailed; the partiality of Isaac for the elder and of Rebekah for the
                    younger is indicated; Jacob’s departure from Canaan is represented as a flight
                    necessitated by his fraudulent conduct towards Isaac and Esau with reference to
                    the blessing of the former; a revelation received at Bethel in the course of
                    this flight is described; many minute particulars of his domestic life at Padan
                    Aram and of his relations with Laban his uncle and father-in-law are given; the
                    scene of the change of name is placed at Peniel, where he wrestled with the
                    angel (see Hos. xii. 5); a period of residence at Shechem is mentioned; the
                    death of Rachel at Ephrath is said to have happened in childbed; after having
                    fixed his home successively at Hebron and Beersheba, he is ultimately led by
                    circumstances, which are described with much fulness and vividness, to migrate
                    to Egypt, where he dies. Consideration of the relations of these parallel
                    narratives may be postponed to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Pentateuch.
                    As</hi> to the interpretation of the history of Jacob, it is now usual to regard
                    it as having an ethnological at least quite as much as a personal significance;
                    but none of the attempts hitherto made to mythologize it (as by Popper, who sees
                    in the wrestling Jacob the Asiatic Hercules, Melicertes, Palaemon) can be
                    regarded as even plausible.</p>
