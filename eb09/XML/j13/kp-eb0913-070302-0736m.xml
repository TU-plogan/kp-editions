                    and the British district of Thar and Pârkar in Sind. The general aspect of the
                    country is that of a sandy plain, divided into two unequal parts by the river
                    Lτini, and dotted with bold and picturesque conical hills, attaining in places
                    an elevation rising to 3000 feet. The river Lùni is the principal feature in the
                    physical aspects of Jodhpur. It takes its rise in the sacred lake of Pushkar in
                    Ajmere, and flows through Jodhpur in a south-westerly direction till it is
                    finally lost in the marshy ground at the head of the Runn of Cutch. It is-fed by
                    numerous tributaries and occasionally overflows its banks, fine crops of wheat
                    and barley being grown on the saturated soil. Its water is, as a rule, saline or
                    brackish, but comparatively sweet water is obtained from wells sunk at a
                    distance of 20 or 30 yards from the river bank. The famous salt-lake of Sarabhar
                    is situated on the borders of Jodhpur and Jeypore, and two smaller lakes of the
                    same description lie within the limits of the district, from which large
                    quantities of salt are annually extracted. Zinc is also obtained in considerable
                    quantities, and marble is mined in the north of the state, and along the
                    south-east border.</p>
                <p>The population consists of Rahtor Râjputs (who form the ruling class), Charans,
                    Bhâts, Jâts, Bishnawis, Minas, Bhils, and Bauris, with a small proportion of
                    Mahometans. The Charans, a sacred race, hold large religious grants of land, and
                    enjoy peculiar immunities as traders in local produce. The Bhâts are by
                    profession genealogists, but also engage in trade. The Minas, Bauris, and Bhils
                    are predatory classes, but are employed in menial capacities. The Mahometans are
                    principally soldiers. The natives, as a race, are enterprising and industrious,
                    but the agricultural classes have to undergo great privations from poor food,
                    and often bad water. Märwari traders are to be found throughout the length and
                    breadth of the peninsula. No census of the population has ever been taken, but
                    it has roughly been estimated at about 2,850,000, of whom 86 per cent, are said
                    to be Hindus, 10 per cent. Jains, and 4 per cent. Mahometans.</p>
                <p>The principal crops are pulses and millets, but wheat and barley are largely
                    produced in the fertile tract watered by the Luni river. The manufactures
                    comprise leather boxes and brass utensils; and turbans and scarfs and a
                    description of embroidered silk knotted thread are specialities of the country.
                    A large proportion of the population can read and write Hindi, including most
                    ladies of good birth, which is believed to be peculiar to this state. Jodhpur
                    town contains two good schools, one for the sons of chiefs and the higher
                    classes, and the other for the children of tradespeople downwards. Every large
                    village also has a school of its own, in which the vernacular is taught.</p>
                <p>The maharaja belongs to the Rahtor clan of Rajputs. The local historians relate
                    that after the downfall of the Rahtor dynasty of Kanauj in 1194 at Sivaji, the
                    grandson of Jai Ch⅛nd, the last king of Kanauj, entered Marwâr on a pilgrimage
                    to Dwarka, and on halting at the town of Pâli he and his followers settled there
                    to protect the Brahman community from the constant raids of marauding bands. The
                    Rahtor chief thus laid the foundation of the state, but it was not till the time
                    of Râo Chanda, the tenth in succession from Sivaji, that Mârwâr was actually
                    conquered. His grandson Jodha founded the city of Jodhpur, which he made his <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0737-0704"/> capital. In 1561 the country was invaded by
                    Akbar, and the chief was forced to submit, and to send his son as a mark of
                    homage to take service under the Mughal emperor. When this son Udai Sinh
                    succeeded to the chiefship, he gave his sister Jodhbai in marriage to Akbar, and
                    was rewarded by the restoration of most of his former possessions. Udâi Sinh’s
                    son, Raja Geve Sinh, held high service under Akbar, and conducted successful
                    expeditions in Guzerat and the Deccan. The bigoted and intolerant Aurangzeb
                    invaded Marwar in 1679, plundered Jodhpur, sacked all the large towns, and
                    commanded the conversion of the Rahtors to Mahometanism. This cemented all the
                    Rajput clans into a bond of union, and a triple alliance was formed by the three
                    states of Jodhpur, Udaipur, and Jeypore, to throw off the Mahometan joke. One of
                    the conditions of this alliance was that the chiefs of Jodhpur and Jeypore
                    should regain the privilege of marriage with the Udaipur family, which they had
                    forfeited by contracting alliances with the Mughal emperors, on the
                    understanding that the offspring of Udaipur princesses should succeed to the
                    state in preference to all other children. The quarrels arising from this
                    stipulation lasted through many generations, and led to the invitation of
                    Marhattâ help from the rival aspirants to power, and finally to the subjection
                    of all the Rajput states to the Marhattas. Jodhpur was conquered by Sindhia, who
                    levied from it a tribute of £60,000, and took from it the fort and town of
                    Ajmere. Internecine disputes and succession wars disturbed the peace of the
                    early years of the century, until in January 1818 Jodhpur was taken under ·
                    British protection. In 1839 the misgovernment of the raja led to an insurrection
                    which compelled the interference of the British, and Jodhpur was held in
                    military occupation for five months, until the raj&lt;i entered into engagements
                    for the future good government of his subjects. In 1843 the chief having died
                    without a son, and without having adopted an heir, the nobles and state
                    officials were left to select a successor from the nearest of kin. Their choice
                    fell upon Raja Takht Sinh, chief of Ahmadnagar. This chief, who did good service
                    during the mutiny, died in 1873. The constitution of Jodhpur may be described as
                    a tribal suzerainty rapidly passing into the feudal stage. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >pattait</hi> or tribal chief is the ruler of his estate, and the judge almost
                    exclusively in all matters of civil and criminal jurisdiction over his people.
                    These chiefs owe military service to their suzerain, and exact the same from
                    their dependants, to whom assignments of land have been made, and who form their
                    following—the whole constituting the following of the suzerain himself. The
                    maharaja alone has the power of life and death. The revenue of the state is
                    mainly derived from the land, salt, and customs duties, a cess imposed on the
                    feudatory nobles, succession dues, &amp;c., estimated at a total of about
                    £250,000 a year. The state pays a tribute to the British of £9800 a year,
                    besides an annual payment of £11,500 for the support of a contingent—the
                    Erinpura Irregular Force. The maharaja also maintains an independent military
                    force of 20 field and 250 other guns, 200 gunners, 3545 cavalry, and 5020
                    infantry.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Jodhpur,</hi> the capital of the above state, in 26° 17' N.
                    lat. and 73° 4' E. long., was built by Rào Jodha in 1549, and from that time has
                    been the seat of government of the principality. It is surrounded by a strong
                    wall nearly 6 miles in extent, with seventy gates. The fort stands on an
                    isolated rock, and contains the mahârâjâ’s palace, a large and handsome
                    building, completely covering the crest of the hill on which it stands, and
                    overlooking the city, which lies several hundred feet below. The city contains
                    many handsome buildings—palaces of the mahârâjâ, and town residences of the <hi

                    Building stone is plentiful, and close at hand, and the architecture solid and
                    handsome. Three miles north from Jodhpur are the ruins of Mandor, the site of
                    the ancient capital of the Purihar princes of Mârwâr, prior to its conquest by
                    the Rahtors.</p>
