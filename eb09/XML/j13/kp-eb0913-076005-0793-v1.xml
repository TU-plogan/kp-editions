                    son of Simon Iscariot (John. vi. 71, xiii. 26), and one of the twelve apostles;
                    he is always enumerated last, with special mention of the fact that he was the
                    betrayer of Jesus. If the now generally accepted explanation of his surname (Γ∏Γ
                    ’ ιi ’ E <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> % <hi rend="italic">i.e∙,</hi> “man of
                    Kerioth”; see Josh. XV. 25) be correct, he was the only original member of the
                    apostolic band who was not a Galilaean. (For other <pb break="no"

                    led to his admission into the apostolic circle are not stated; according to the
                    Fourth Gospel (vi. 64), his treachery had been foreseen by Jesus from the very
                    first, but this is not suggested by the synoptists. The motives by which he was
                    actuated in rendering to the J ewish authorities the petty and base service of
                    enabling them to arrest his Master without tumult have been analysed by scholars
                    with very various degrees of subtlety and insight. According to some his sole
                    object was to place Jesus in a position in which He should be compelled to make
                    what had seemed to His followers the too tardy display of His Messianic power;
                    according to others (and their view seems the best supported by the narrative of
                    the Gospels) he was simply an avaricious and dishonest man, who felt that his
                    opportunities for petty peculation—as keeper of the common purse, John xii. 6,
                    xiii. 29—were rapidly disappearing. As regards the effects of his subsequent
                    remorse and the use to which his ill-gotten gains were put, the strikingly
                    apparent discrepancies between the narratives of Matt, xxvii. 3-10 and Acts i.
                    18, 19 have continually attracted the attention of Biblical scholars ever since
                    Papias, in his fourth book, of which a fragment has been preserved, discussed
                    the subject; the probability is that they simply represent divergent traditions,
                    one of which has possibly been coloured by the history of Ahithophel. In
                    ecclesiastical legend and in sacred art Judas Iscariot has taken a prominent
                    place, being generally treated as the very incarnation of treachery,
                    ingratitude, and impiety. The Middle Ages, after their fashion, have supplied
                    the lacunae in what they deemed his too meagre biography. According to the
                    common form of their story, he belonged to the tribe.of Reuben<note

                    that he was destined to murder his father, commit incest with his mother, and
                    sell his God. The attempts made by her and her husband to avert this curse
                    simply led to its accomplishment. At his birth he was enclosed in a chest and
                    flung into the sea; picked up on a foreign shore, he was educated at the court
                    until an act of murder committed in a moment of passion compelled his flight.
                    Coming to Judaea, he entered the service of Pontius Pilate as page, and during
                    this period committed the first two of the crimes which had been expressly
                    foretold. Learning the secret of his birth, he, full of remorse, seeks the
                    prophet who, he has heard, has power on earth to forgive sins. He is accepted as
                    a disciple and promoted to a position of trust, where avarice, the only vice in
                    which he has hitherto been unpractised, gradually takes possession of his soul,
                    and leads to the complete fulfilment of his evil destiny. This Judas legend, as
                    given by Jacobus a Voragine, obtained no small popularity; and it is to be found
                    in various shapes in every important literature of Europe. For the history of
                    its genesis and its diffusion the reader may consult D’Ancona, <hi rend="italic"

                    symbolical expression in various parts of Christendom. In Corfu, for instance,
                    the people at a given signal on Easter eve throw vast quantities of crockery
                    from their windows and roofs into the streets, and thus execute an imaginary
                    stoning of Judas (see Kirkwall, <hi rend="italic">Ionian Islands,</hi> vol. ii.
                    p. 47). At one time (according to Mustoxidi, <hi rend="italic">Delle</hi><hi
