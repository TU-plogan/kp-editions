                    of Hushiârpur, on the N.W. by the native state of Kapurthäla and the river Biâs,
                    and on the S. by the Sutlej. The blunt triangular tongue of land enclosed by the
                    confluent streams of the Sutlej and the Biâs bears the general name of the
                    Jalandhar Doâb. Its submontane portion belongs to Hushiârpur; the remainder is
                    divided between Kapurthâla state and the district of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0569-0546"/> Jalandhar. Below the hills, the whole Doâb
                    consists of one unbroken alluvial expanse, whose fertility extends from river to
                    river. A well-defined bank marks the bed of the Sutlej on the Jalandhar side. In
                    winter the river contains about 15 feet of water in its deepest parts, and is
                    navigable at all seasons for large flat-bottomed country boats. The main channel
                    shifts from year to year through the wide bed, often forming new islands by
                    slight changes in its course. The Biâs touches upon the district for a few miles
                    only. The torrents from the Siwâlik hills in Hushiârpur district unite in two
                    main streams, the White and the Black Ben, the former of which runs through the
                    whole of Jalandhar. The White Ben receives numerous affluents, which meet it at
                    right angles; and, following a serpentine path in a deep channel, it finally
                    falls into the Sutlej 4 miles above its junction with the Biâs. Several marshy
                    lakes <hi rend="italic">(fhils)</hi> collect a considerable quantity of water in
                    the· rains, which they retain throughout the dry season.</p>
                <p>The chief staples are wheat, barley, gram, rice, sugar-cane, Indian corn, <hi
                    rend="italic">joàr,</hi> cotton, and moth. Except on the low alluvial tract of
                    the Sutlej, irrigation is carried on by means of wells, worked with Persian
                    wheels. Water lies everywhere near the surface, and is absolutely necessary for
                    the higher cereals and sugar-cane, so that well irrigation prevails very
                    generally. The traffic of the district consists mainly in its agricultural
                    produce. Sugar-cane forms the chief commercial crop, and sugar and molasses are
                    largely manufactured. English piece-goods and draught cattle are the principal
                    imports. Cotton cloth, silver wire, and gold and silver lace are manufactured at
                    Jalandhar town. The Sind, Punjab, and Delhi Railway passes through the district,
                    with stations at several of the principal towns. Education was carried on in
                    1875-76 by means of 1615 aided schools, with a total roll of 7876 pupils. The
                    proximity of the hills renders the climate of Jalandhar comparatively moist, and
                    the annual rainfall for the seven years ending 1872-73 amounted to 28 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 inches. Malarious fever in an endemic form proves
                    the chief cause of mortality, but small-pox often appears as an epidemic, and
                    dysenteric complaints are frequent. There are five Government charitable
                    dispensaries, which afforded relief in 1872 to 34,308 persons.</p>
                <p>Jalandhar ranks first in the density of its population amongst all the Punjab
                    districts, and is only exceeded by those of Benares, Jaunpur, and Ghazipur in
                    the North-Western Provinces. The enumeration of 1868, taken over an area of 1332
                    square miles, disclosed a total population of 794,764 persons, of whom 436,689
                    were males and 358,075 females. As regards religion, Hindus numbered 318,401;
                    Mahometans, 358,427; Sikhs, 117,167; and others, 769. The district contained
                    eleven municipal towns in 1875-76, whose names and populations were as follows
                    :—Jalandhar, 48,933; Kartarpur, 10,953; Alawalpur, 4873; Adampur, 3269; Banga,
                    4508; Nawashahr, 4946; Rahon, 14,394; Phillaur, 7535; Nur-mahal, 7866; Mahatpur,
                    6374; and Nakodar, 8800. The following towns had populations exceeding 5000 in
                    1868 :—Basti Shaikh, 80Ö0; Bilga, 6441; Jan&lt;liala, 6439; Malsian, 6286; and
                    Rurkha Kalan, 5721. The district contains a total cultivated area of 657,094
                    acres, of which 200,097 are artificially irrigated.</p>
                <p>The Jalandhar Doab in early times formed a separate Hindu kingdom, ruled by a
                    family of Rajputs, whose descendants still exist in the petty princes of the
                    Kangra hills. Under Mahometan rule the Doab was generally attached to the
                    province of Lahore, in which it is included as a <hi rend="italic">sarkAr</hi>
                    or governorship in the great revenue survey of Akbar’s reign. Its governors seem
                    to have held a partially independent position, subject to the payment of a fixed
                    tribute into the imperial treasury. The Sikh reaction extended to Jalandhar at
                    an early period, and a number of petty chieftains established themselves by
                    force as independent princes throughout the Doab. In 1766 the town of Jalandhar
                    fell into the hands of the Sikh confederacy of Faiz-ulla-puria, then presided
                    over by Khushal Sinh. His son and successor built a masonry fort in the city,
                    while several other leaders similarly fortified themselves in the suburbs.
                    Meanwhile, Ranjit Sinh was consolidating his power in the south, and in 1811 he
                    annexed the Faiz-ullâ-puria dominions in the Doab. By the autumn of the same
                    year the maharaja’s authority was successfully established. Thenceforth
                    Jalandhar became the capital of the Lahore possessions in the surrounding Doab
                    up to the date of the British annexation, which took place at the close of the
                    first Sikh war.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Jalandhar,</hi> a municipal town and cantonment in the above
                    district, is situated in 31° 19' 50" N. lat. and 75° 37' 20" E. long. It lays
                    claim to considerable antiquity, having been the original capital of the Râjput
                    kingdom of Kâtoch, which dates back to the period before Alexander’s invasion.
                    Hweu Tsang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim of the 7th century, describes the town
                    as 2 miles in circuit, the metropolis of a considerable state. Ibrâhîm Shâh of
                    Ghazni reduced the town to the Mahometan yoke, and it appears as a place of
                    considerable strength during the early Musalmân times. The modern city consists
                    of a cluster of wards, originally distinct, and each enclosed by a wall of its
                    own. Some of them still remain detached, but the majority have now united. The
                    cantonment is 4 miles from the town, and was established in 1846. It has an area
                    of 7∣ square miles, and a population (1868) of 11,634 persons. Numerous suburbs,
                    known as <hi rend="italic">hastis,</hi> surround the city. The trade, though
                    considerable, presents little special interest. The staples of local traffic are
                    English piece-goods and country produce. In 1871-72 the imports were valued at
                    £105,248, and the exports at £96,020. The population in 1868 was 50,067, of whom
                    15,921 were Hindus, 33,601 Mahometans, 468 Sikhs, and 77 Christians.</p>
