                    name to the offshoots and plateaus of the Jura mountains, which occupy more than
                    half its area. It is bounded N. by Doubs, Haute-Saône, and Côte-d’Or; E. by
                    Doubs, Ain, and Switzerland; S. by Ain; and W. by Saône-et-Loire and Côte d’Or.

                    region of mountains in the south-east, increasing in height towards the Swiss
                    frontier. The highest summit is Noir Mont (5085 feet). Jura belongs almost
                    entirely to the basin of the Rhone,—its chief streams being the Oignon, Doubs,
                    and Seille, affluents of the Saône, and the Ain and Valserine, direct
                    tributaries of the Rhone. The Doubs and Ain are navigable. There are numerous
                    lakes; those of Rousses, Châlin, Chambly, and of the abbey of Grandvaux are
                    noteworthy. The climate is, on the whole, cold; the temperature is subject to
                    sudden and violent changes, and among the mountains winter lingers for nearly
                    six months. The plain called the Bresse is rich in fruit trees, and in fields of
                    wheat, rye, maize, and buckwheat; the hill-region grows vines, barley, oats,
                    maize, rape, walnuts, and fruits; the mountains, which exhibit some of the
                    grandest scenery of leaping torrent and silent tarn, are covered with forests or
                    pastures. Jura is one of the most thickly wooded departments of France; a third
                    of its surface is covered with forests, of which that of Chaux, with an area of
                    about 75 square miles, is the largest. The commonest trees are oaks, beeches,
                    hornbeams, aspens, birches, box-trees, and firs. Wolves and foxes are numerous
                    in Jura; wild boars and deer lurk in the forests. The principal minerals are
                    iron, salt, limestone, marble, sandstone, millstone, and clay. Peats are very
                    abundant. Agriculture employs about three-fourths of the inhabitants, though the
                    manufactures extend to wine, cheese (made in the mountain dairies), watches,
                    files, stationery, toys and fancy wooden-ware, machinery, candles, porcelain,
                    basket-work, &lt;fcc.; while some industry is maintained in wool-spinning,
                    silk-weaving, and in brass, pottery, and tanning works. The trade is mainly in
                    wines, cheese, and wooden goods. The first are full-bodied, stout, and rather
                    coarse-flavoured; their chief market is Paris, where they form the basis of the
                    <hi rend="italic">vin ordinaire</hi> of the wine-shops. The department of Jura
                    embraces the arrondissements of Lons-le-Saunier, Dole, Poligny, and St Claude,
                    with 32 cantons and 583 communes. Lons-le-Saunier is the chief town. The total
                    area is about 1928 square miles; the population in 1866 was 298,477; in 1876,
                    288,823.</p>
