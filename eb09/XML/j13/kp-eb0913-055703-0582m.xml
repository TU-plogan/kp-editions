                    was born in the castle of Edinburgh 19th June 1566. His mother while in
                    captivity having been forced to abdicate the sovereignty, James was crowned king
                    at Stirling July 29, 1567. The regency was vested in the earl of Murray, who by
                    his masterly political skill and force of character held <pb break="no"

                    his assassination at Linlithgow in February 1570. The absence of his
                    authoritative will at once allowed free scope to the various elements of
                    disorder latent in the kingdom, and during the regency of Lennox, who was
                    mortally wounded in a fray at Stirling with the adherents of Mary, September
                    1571, and of the earl of Mar his successor, who died in October 1572, strife and
                    confusion held almost rampant sway. The earl of Morton, the next regent, being
                    possessed, however, of some of the high qualities of his predecessor Murray,
                    succeeded with assistance from Elizabeth of England in quelling the last embers
                    of insurrection, and afterwards held in check the interested ambition of the
                    nobles, until in 1578 they succeeded in discrediting his influence by the scheme
                    of placing the government nominally in the hands of the boy monarch. In June
                    1581 Morton suffered death for his connexion with the murder of Darnley. James,
                    to whom were thus early entrusted the functions of sovereignty, had spent his
                    infancy under the care of the earl of Mar, on whose death he was taken charge of
                    by the earl’s brother, Alexander Erskine. For his principal tutor he had George
                    Buchanan, who inspired him with a genuine interest in learning and a strong
                    ambition to excel in poetical composition; he was also so far influenced by the
                    Reformed type of religion as to have imbibed a love for theological argument,
                    although he always cherished a strong distaste towards both Calvinistic doctrine
                    and the Presbyterian form of government. His character was indeed formed amidst
                    moral and intellectual surroundings strangely mingled and inharmonious, in
                    addition to which the nature he inherited was rather a medley of isolated
                    capacities than a definite and distinct idiosyncracy. From the first compelled
                    to adopt an attitude hostile to his mother, and, at the same time that he could
                    not but resent her imprisonment by Elizabeth, unable to trust in her intentions
                    towards himself, he seems to have regarded her death both as a relief and as a
                    calamity and disgrace. As he knew that each party in the state, the Catholics,
                    the nobles, the Presbyterians, wished to make him their tool, he resolved to act
                    towards them as suited his convenience; but, although he possessed a certain
                    sharp shrewdness and foresight as well as no small knowledge of character, his
                    inability to take a comprehensive view of affairs, or to form a truly courageous
                    resolution, made his policy often rash and reckless in regard to matters
                    seemingly small, and always shifting and irresolute in regard to affairs of the
                    highest moment. The moral courage he possessed was not inconsistent with
                    physical cowardice; indeed the chief element in it was an overweening
                    self-conceit, to which the consciousness of superior intellectual attainments
                    gave the consummating touch; and thus it was that the very difficulties of his
                    position gradually nourished within him the conviction of the divine right
                    inherent in his office, and caused all his conduct, wavering and uncertain as it
                    was, to be inspired by the one purpose of building up his kingly
                    prerogative.</p>
                <p>Taking advantage of the weakness of the royal authority during the king’s
                    minority, the General Assembly of the Scottish Church resolved in 1581 to
                    substitute Presbyterianism for Episcopacy, and James, being shortly afterwards
                    seized by the nobles at the raid of Ruthven, was unable to put his veto on their
                    procedure, until after the overthrow of those implicated in the conspiracy, when
                    in 1584 the estates passed an act denouncing their assumption of legislative
                    power. In 1585 James was, however, besieged in Stirling by the exiled lords, and
                    compelled to pardon them and dismiss his favourite, Arran. As their influence
                    was moreover backed by Elizabeth, and as the hopes of James were even thus early
                    directed towards succeeding her on the English throne, he discovered it to be
                    advantageous to disguise his sentiments towards the Presbyterians. The
                    destruction in 1588 that overtook the Armada of the Catholic Philip of Spain
                    deprived James of all anxiety regarding the effects of his mother’s testamentary
                    disposal of her crown to that monarch, but it naturally inclined him for a time
                    to a more close alliance with the Protestants, the result of which was seen, not
                    only in his marriage in 1589 to the Protestant princess Anne of Denmark, but in
                    an Act of the estates in 1592, which sanctioned the formal abolition of
                    Episcopacy. In 1594 he also found it necessary to reduce the Catholic lords of
                    the north of Scotland, but in 1597 he deemed it prudent to balance the influence
                    of the Presbyterians, and also to flatter the hopes of the Catholics of England
                    by securing the revocation of the forfeiture of the estates of the banished
                    nobles, and permitting them to return. Previous to this his action against the
                    preacher of a sermon in which Elizabeth was attacked as an atheist led to a “No
                    Popery” riot in Edinburgh. The breach between him and the Presbyterians was
                    still further widened by the statute of 1599, appointing a certain number of
                    ministers to a seat in parliament with the title of bishop, and by his
                    publication in the same year of his <hi rend="italic">Basilicon Doron</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> in which he promulgated his views in regard to
                    the divine right of kings. With the exception, however, of his peculiar
                    experiences in connexion with the mysterious Gowrie conspiracy at Perth (August
                    5, 1600), the remainder of his reign in Scotland until his succession to the
                    English throne in 1603 was quiet and uneventful; and the only fact of notable
                    importance connected with his subsequent government of that kingdom is his
                    suspension of the meetings of the General Assembly, until by the banishment and
                    imprisonment of Melville and its principal leaders he was able in 1610 to
                    convene an Assembly which agreed to the organization of a modified Episcopacy.
                    The peculiar union of talents and defects which constituted the character of
                    James made him perhaps the most unfit successor of Elizabeth that could have
                    been chosen. His strutting pomposity was rendered strangely ludicrous by a
                    personal appearance the several defects of which were heightened by their
                    contrast with each other, and it was also constantly interfered with by his want
                    of a proper sense of decorum. If he displayed great cleverness in avoiding
                    immediate political difficulties and in gaining for the moment his own ends, he
                    was incapable of adapting himself mentally to his new position as sovereign of
                    England, and his fussy self-importance made it almost inevitable that he should
                    mortally offend the political temperament then in England so peculiarly
                    sensitive. Indeed, the traditional policy which the circumstances of Scotland
                    had rendered almost a second nature to the Stuarts was repugnant to the
                    susceptibilities of England, and utterly alien to her political constitution,
                    and in the case of James all the worst defects of this policy were exaggerated.
                    Thus his seeming shrewdness in small matters, and his witty and terse political
                    axioms, only secured him the reputation of being the “wisest fool in
                    Christendom;” and, while his absurd personality cast ridicule on his kingly
                    pretensions, the general character of his political procedure estranged from him
                    every party in the state, and called into action influences which in the
                    subsequent reign wrought the overthrow of the monarchy whose prestige he had
                    almost hopelessly tarnished. Having narrowly escaped a plot of the Catholics to
                    seize his person shortly after his arrival in London, Janies resolved to flatter
                    their hopes by granting them toleration, but his proclamation in February 1604
                    against the Jesuits revealed the hollowness of his professions and led to the
                    futile gunpowder conspiracy of November 1605. Its discovery dissipated for the
                    time the alienation already begun between him and the Commons on account of his
                    imprudent assertion of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n584/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0584-0559"/> his prerogative against the Puritans at the
                    Hampton Court conference, and the subsequent disagreements in regard to
                    ecclesiastical reform and a union with Scotland. Against the goodwill of the
                    Commons, which showed itself iu the readiness with which a subsidy was granted
                    for his debts, he, however, trespassed almost immediately by abusing the royal
                    custom of placing impositions on merchandise. All attempts at a compromise on
                    the subject having failed, James in February 1611 dissolved the parliament, and
                    a second parliament which he summoned in 1614 proving equally recalcitrant was
                    also dissolved, the fact that it was not allowed the opportunity of transacting
                    business earning for it from the courtiers the name of the “addled parliament.”
                    To help in filling the vacuum in his treasury, James had recourse with small
                    success to the odious practice of demanding benevolences, and, in addition to
                    various other misuses of his prerogative, to the excessive increase of
                    monopolies, and to the virtual sale of peerages and other high offices. The
                    administration of the affairs of the kingdom was at the same time gradually
                    withdrawn from the council, and the whole executive authority entrusted to
                    favourites. As the breach between him and his subjects gradually widened he
                    became more anxious—both in order to supply himself with money, and to obtain
                    the support of an influential external authority— for an alliance with Spain,
                    and in 1617 negotiations were entered into for a marriage between the young
                    prince Charles and the Spanish infanta. But on the part of Spain those proposals
                    were never seriously entertained. Their only result was to impart such
                    irresolution to the policy of James in reference to the Bohemian insurrection as
                    to afford Spain the opportunity of seizing the Palatinate; and by continuing to
                    dangle the possibility of the marriage before the eyes of James the emperor
                    succeeded in delaying his interference till the Palatinate was lost. Still
                    intent on his purpose of the Spanish marriage, to which he had ruthlessly
                    sacrificed the life of Sir Walter Raleigh, James despatched his favourite
                    Buckingham along with Charles to Madrid, and the return of the baffled and
                    disappointed wooer in 1624 dissipated the last lingering sentiment of respect
                    which the English nation may have cherished towards the king. Buckingham and
                    Charles now virtually overrode the royal prerogative, and at their instance not
                    only was war declared against Spain, but on the condition of granting toleration
                    to the Catholics of England, a treaty of marriage between Charles and Henrietta
                    Maria of France was signed at the close of 1624. James died on March
                    25,1625.</p>
                <p>James inaugurated his literary career in 1584 by the publication of the <hi

                    Revelation of St John and a version of the Psalms; As he deemed it necessary to
                    give to the world his opinion on almost every subject of importance which then
                    occupied public attention, his prose disquisitions are legion, but the best

                    >Counterblast to Tobacco,</hi> 1616. A collected edition of his prose writings
                    was published in 1616, edited by the bishop of Winchester. Some of his poetical
                    translations are not without merit, but both his prose and poetry, though
                    displaying occasional wit and cleverness and some faculty of composition, are
                    studded with absurdities, and but for the fact that their author was a monarch
                    would scarcely deserve a reference.</p>
