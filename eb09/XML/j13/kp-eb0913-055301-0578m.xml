                    of</hi></label>. Of the author of this epistle enough has been said in the
                    previous article (3); it only remains to add in connexion with the introductory
                    words thereof that probably the same reason actuated both St James and St Jude
                    to leave out any mention that they were “brethren of the Lord.” We need not
                    enter into the question of what relationship is intended by those words, though,
                    from the mention of Joseph on each occasion where the “brethren” are spoken of,
                    it is probable that they were really his children by a former marriage. Thus
                    Jesus would be younger than those who are called “his brethren,” and their
                    behaviour in rejecting his teaching for so long a time may have been partly a
                    result of their growing up with him and regarding him as a younger member of the
                    same family, and from familiarity becoming less willing than strangers would be
                    to acknowledge anything which looked like an assertion of superiority. But,
                    whatever the reason for their former unbelief, it is easy to see that, when they
                    had at length come to own Jesus as their Lord, humility would check the mention
                    of the relationship in which they might claim to stand to Jesus, as would also a
                    desire not to appear to place themselves in a position of close connexion with
                    Christ, to which none others could lay claim.</p>
                <p>The epistle is addressed “to the twelve tribes which are of the dispersion.” The
                    word “dispersion” (διασττορά) was employed in the New Testament times to signify
                    the Jewish population in every part of the then known world. Jews were to be
                    found in Persia, Egypt, Asia Minor, and indeed in all the lands surrounding the
                    Mediterranean Sea. When the writer addresses them as “the twelve tribes” he
                    gives us the key to the character of his epistle. It was written to Christians
                    who had been converts from Judaism, but to whom their ancient faith was still of
                    the very highest importance, indeed, of somewhat more importance than it ought
                    to have been. We can see therefore why the language of this epistle partakes so
                    largely of the character of the preaching of John the Baptist (comp. Jas. i. 22,
                    27 with Matt. iii. 8; Jas. ii. 15,16 with Luke iii. 11; <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n579/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0579-0554"/> Jas. ii. 19, 20 with Matt. iii. 9; and Jas. v.
                    1-6 with Matt, iii. 10-12) and of that of our Lord’s earliest teaching in the
                    Sermon on the Mount (c∕. especially Jas. i. 2, 4, 5, 9, 20; ii. 13, 14; iii.
                    17-18; iv. 4, 10, 11; v. 2, 10, 12, 15), and why it is so largely illustrated by
                    the language of books like Ecclesiasticus and the Book of Wisdom, which were
                    specially esteemed by the Jews of Alexandria and other Hellenistic centres of
                    Judaism (see Jas. i. 1, 5, 8, 11, 12, 17, 19, 20, 23, 25; ii. 21; iii. 5, 6; iv.
                    14). We should judge from this that the bishop of Jerusalem, in the earlier days
                    of the Christian church, availed himself of his central position to circulate
                    among the scattered Judaeo-Christian populations, of whom representatives would
                    constantly be within his reach, such a letter as was suited to stimulate the new
                    converts to more truly Christian life, and to check errors into which, from
                    their attachment to the older faith, they were prone to fall. The epistle
                    contains many exhortations to accept a higher standard for the conduct of life,
                    though a considerable section (i. 22—ii. 26) applies more specifically to the
                    dangers that beset Jewish converts of trusting to a faith which produced no
                    results in the form of Christian love.</p>
                <p>But it was not only for those who were scattered into distant parts of the world
                    that the epistle was written. It bears marks of its relation to a time of
                    special trial and hardship, and has much to say of how trials and sufferings are
                    to be borne. “Count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations” is the
                    opening language; and the writer returns to the same theme at the close of his
                    letter: “Be ye also patient,” “Stablish your hearts,” “Behold, we count them
                    happy which endure.” Such words agree best with the dispersion of the first
                    Christian brotherhood after the death of Stephen, and with that persecution by
                    Herod Agrippa I. in which James the brother of John was put to death. It is an
                    additional indication that the epistle was written about those times that in it
                    there is no word of that contention which soon agitated the whole Christian
                    church about the circumcision of the Gentiles, and about which James pronounced
                    the sentence of the council of Jerusalem in 51 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    The persecution which ensued on the martyrdom of Stephen (33 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> is too early a date after the ascension for us to
                    think it probable that Christianity could have had enough representatives among
                    the dispersion to make such an epistle as the present necessary. It seems better
                    therefore to refer it to that larger persecution in which the one James suffered
                    death, and after which the other James comes into special prominence in
                    Christian church history. This would lead to the conclusion that the epistle,
                    primarily addressed to the Jewish Christians throughout Palestine, but intended
                    also for others who lived beyond the limits of the Holy Land, was written at
                    Jerusalem, from which James the Just seems never to have departed, and that it
                    should be dated some time after 44 A.D., the date of Herod’s persecution, and
                    antecedent probably by several years (for the agitation which led to the council
                    must have existed for some time) to the council at Jerusalem (51 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a,d.).</hi></p>
                <p>The epistle contains nothing to indicate where it was written, but at the same
                    time there is nothing in the imagery and illustrations employed by the writer
                    which would be out of character with one writing in Palestine. It is therefore
                    probable that, since tradition represents James as constantly resident in
                    Jerusalem, the epistle was written there. He uses the Jewish name “synagogue”
                    (ii. 2) for the place of assembly for worship, which would perhaps be longer
                    preserved among the Christians in Jerusalem than elsewhere; but on the other
                    hand he speaks (v. 14) of the “elders of the church” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(lκκλη</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> σ</hi><hi rend="italic">la)</hi> just
                    as we find St Luke doing in the Acts of the Apostles. He mentions the “burning
                    wind” <hi rend="italic">(κavσωv)</hi> spoken of in the Gospels (Matt. xx. 12;
                    Luke xii. 55), and his language (iii. 4) about ships and the storms by which
                    they are driven is such as would be natural in one who knew by experience of the
                    tempests that sometimes sweep suddenly over the Sea of Galilee, with which this
                    James must have been familiar as well as the son of Zebedee.</p>
                <p>The epistle appears to have been written with a view, in the first place, to
                    comfort some who were undergoing severe trials. This is clear from the opening
                    sentence, “Count it all joy when ye fall into divers trials.” But the words also
                    seem to show that there was a spirit prevailing among those for whom the letter
                    was first intended which did not tend to that perfect patience under sufferings
                    that should characterize the faithful Christian. And so the writer passes on to
                    notice a want of perfect trust in God, and a too great regard for temporal
                    things, concerning which they are exhorted to foster such a mind as shall make
                    changes in worldly affairs, when they are for the worse, yet still no cause for
                    sorrow. For the only perfect gifts are of God’s own sending, and in His gifts as
                    in Himself there is no change. The epistle next dwells on that which was the
                    great danger with Jewish converts, the profession of a belief in God and Christ
                    without a corresponding Christian life; they are further exhorted to avoid sins
                    of the tongue and sins of presumption, while those to whom wealth had become the
                    chief object in life are severely condemned. But before the close the writer
                    turns once more to his first theme, the commendation of patience under
                    sufferings, which he enforces by the examples of the prophets and of Job. Then
                    with certain cautions about the use of oaths, some precepts for conduct under
                    sorrow, joy, sickness, or the consciousness of sin, the epistle is brought to a
                    close, and has not the apostolic benediction, a feature which also marks the
                    letter as one of the earliest of the Christian writings. The time of trial
                    alluded to suits well with the date which has been suggested, when Herod’s
                    persecutions made it necessary for the Christians in Jerusalem to meet in
                    secluded rooms, and to exercise the utmost precaution about all whom they
                    admitted to their meetings. We know too, from the statements of Josephus, that
                    it was from the wealthy Sadducees that the Christians in Jerusalem experienced
                    most persecution, and that they especially were adverse to Christianity because
                    of the preaching of the resurrection of Jesus. The followers of Jesus were, as
                    we know, at this time just beginning to be called Christians, and this name soon
                    became (if it was not at first given as) a name of reproach. These circumstances
                    seem to be specially noticed in this epistle (ii. 6, 7). To the necessities of
                    those days then the letter appears to be first directed, though it contains
                    precepts eminently profitable for those who, having field firm to the belief in
                    the unity of God (ii. 19), were disposed, even after the acceptance of the
                    teaching of the gospel, to think that an intellectual assent to what was set
                    forth was enough, without any effort to build up on the groundwork of faith the
                    superstructure of Christ-like virtues.</p>
                <p>In the time of Eusebius (325 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> the epistle of St
                    James was reckoned among the books not fully accepted by the church. He says <hi
                    rend="italic">(H. E.,</hi> iii. 25) “among the controverted books, which are yet
                    well known and recognized by most is the epistle circulated under the name of
                    James.” But among the apostolic fathers we have quotations from it in the
                    writings of Clement of Rome (1 <hi rend="italic">Hp. ad Cor.,</hi> cc. 10, 12)
                    and perhaps of Hermas <hi rend="italic">(Pastor,</hi> mand. xii. 5). Further, in
                    the Syriac version of Melito’s apology there are some passages which bear a
                    striking resemblance to the words of St James, and may have been quotations (see
                    Cureton’s <hi rend="italic">Spicil. Syr.,</hi> pp. 42, 48); and the Peshito
                    Syriac version contains the epistle. Origen in his commentary on John (TFbrZ·s,
                    xix. 6) speaks of the epistle as <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n580/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0580-0555"/> in “circulation under the name of James,” and he
                    quotes from it in another place (<hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> xii. 129) as that
                    of James, without any comment. Dionysius of Alexandria, who was at the head of
                    the catechetical school there (245), quotes from the epistle. These are all the
                    notices of the epistle on which dependence can be placed before the council of
                    Laodicea (363), when it was included among the canonical books. But there seems
                    no doubt that the words “well known and recognized by most,” used by Eusebius
                    indicate that the epistle was by him regarded as a part of Scripture, for in
                    other portions of his works he alludes to it as if he so esteemed it, and
                    evidence of its recognition in the Syrian Church speaks strongly in favour of
                    its authenticity. For that church was most likely to have the best knowledge
                    concerning the origin and early circulation of the epistle. We can account for
                    the slight extent to which it was known from the fact that it was addressed, by
                    a bishop who never moved from his home, to one section only of the Christian
                    church, and was not likely to gain such wide acceptance at first as the epistles
                    of St Paul, whose missionary labours made his name and his writings well known
                    in different countries. Moreover, the tone of the epistle is practical and not
                    doctrinal, and for this reason also it would be less likely to be noticed in the
                    writings of the Christian fathers. Indeed, this feature of the epistle led
                    Luther, who thought there was in it some contradiction to St Paul’s teaching on
                    the doctrine of justification by faith, to call it <hi rend="italic">eine rechte
                    stroherne</hi><hi rend="italic">Hfnstel</hi> (ed. of German N. T., 1522), “a
                    veritable epistle of straw.” But language like this is due to the distorted way
                    in which the great Reformer looked at the subject. His day called for prominence
                    to be given to the Pauline view of justification. St James’s day had different
                    needs. The character of those for whom this epistle was intended and their
                    special dangers are sufficient to account for the way in which St James
                    emphasizes what St Paul would as stoutly have maintained in a like case, that
                    “faith without works is dead.”</p>
                <p>The view given above, which dates the epistle before the rise of the Pauline
                    controversy, has been ably maintained by many recent theologians, especially in
                    Germany, in opposition to the Tübingen school. Seo Schneckenburger’s <hi

                    the epistle, recognize in it distinct allusions to the Pauline theology, and so
                    prefer a later date. So, for example, Ewald <hi rend="italic">(Geschichte,</hi>
                    vi. 591 <hi rend="italic">seq.; Sendsch. ah d.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    epistle as directed against mistaken inferences from Paul’s teaching. The
                    Tübingen school, on the other hand, regards the epistle as directly
                    anti-Pauline, and at the same time denies that it is genuine. So Baur, <hi

                    rend="italic">Bibellex.,</hi> s.v. ’ ‘ Jakobosbrief.” The argument turns mainly
                    on the interpretation of the doctrine of faith and works in chap. ii. 24, which
                    formally at least is in direct opposition to Rom. iii. 28. In other words,
                    Luther’s difficulty is still the chief turning-point of the argument. Now it is
                    certain that the antithesis between Paul and James is not really so sharp as it
                    appears in the verses just cited, because the two do not attach the same meaning
                    to the word “faith.” In fact, James’s faith without works is not Paul’s
                    justifying faith, but the useless faith without love spoken of in 1 Cor. xiii.
                    We have to deal with two types of doctrine using the same terms in different
                    senses, so that it is not inconceivable that the two may really be capable of
                    such reconciliation in the practical Christian life as to make their divergences
                    unimportant. But, say Baur and his school, there is no proof and great internal
                    improbability that any type of doctrine existed before Paul, maintaining
                    justification by faith alone, precisely in Pauline terms, and using the very
                    illustrations of Abraham and Rahab which occur in the Pauline theology and the
                    kindred epistle to the Hebrews. Starting with this difficulty, and indicating in
                    detail the proofs of the author’s familiarity with the peculiar terminology of
                    the great Pauline epistles, the Tübingen school urge also that James ii. 5, i.
                    12 presuppose acquaintance with Rev. ii.</p>
                <p>9, 10, and even that the allusion to Rahab (ii. 25) proves the author to have
                    read Heb. xi. 31. Further, it is contended that the supposed marks of an early
                    date, in the condition of the churches addressed, are capable of another
                    interpretation, and that the persecution alluded to may be best understood of
                    the time of Domitian. Finally, the language of the epistle is regarded as a
                    proof that the date is not very early, and the author different from the
                    thoroughly Hebrew figure of James as described by Hegesippus. The weight of
                    these arguments is plainly very unequal, and the ultimate solution of the
                    controversy must mainly be in the region of Biblical theology, where one side
                    has often been tempted to minimize the difference between James and Paul, while
                    the other has not done justice to the positive value of the teaching of our
                    epistle, often speaking of it as a mere ineffective polemic against Paul by one
                    who did not understand him. Compare further Alford, <hi rend="italic">Gk.
