                <p><label type="entry">JAY, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label> (1769-1853),
                    dissenting preacher and religious author, was born at Tisbury in Wiltshire on
                    May 6, 1769. The son of a stone mason, he had adopted his father’s calling, when
                    his appearance attracted the attention of the Rev. Cornelius Winter, the
                    dissenting minister. Mr Winter at that time presided over a religious seminary
                    at Marlborough, in which, with his advice and assistance, the young mason became
                    a student in 1785. During the three years and a half that Jay spent at
                    Marlborough, the wonderful preaching powers which distinguished him till the day
                    of his death were rapidly developed. His first sermon was delivered in his
                    seventeenth year; and before his majority he had preached nearly a thousand
                    times. In 1788 he had even for a season occupied Rowland Hill’s pulpit in
                    London. But his youth warned him to seek more time for study, and he therefore
                    accepted the humble pastorate of Christian Malford, near Chippenham, where he
                    remained about two years. He had hardly spent a year in his next charge at the
                    Hot Wells, Clifton, when he was unanimously chosen to be minister of Argyle
                    Independent Chapel in Bath; and on January 30, 1791, he entered the sphere in
                    which he was to spend the rest of his active life, attracting to his chapel
                    hearers of every religious denomination and of every social and literary rank,
                    and winning for himself a wide and solid reputation as a brilliant pulpit
                    orator, as an earnest religious author, and as a pious minister. In 1841 the
                    jubilee of his pastorate was celebrated; in 1852 he was requested to retire; and
                    the connexion of sixty-three years formally ended in January 1853. He died on
                    December 27, 1853.</p>
                <p>Asa preacher Jay was eloquent and impressive; but his expressions and style at
                    times wanted refinement and delicacy. His sermons were often so practical and
                    direct as to excite suspicion, though quite unfounded, of being aimed at
                    individuals. He was fond of peculiar texts, and did not always restrain his
                    sense of humour when in the pulpit. The popularity which his writings,
                    especially his devotional writings, have found with a wide circle of readers
                    vouches for their worth. In his books he is always earnest, homely, and
                    practical, and at times attains a certain neatness of diction and aptness of
                    illustration. Perhaps the best known of his works are his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Morning and Evening Exercises; The Christian Contemplated; The Domestic
                    Minister's Assistant</hi>; and his <hi rend="italic">Discourses.</hi> For his
                    <hi rend="italic">Short Discourses for the Use of Families</hi> the diploma of
                    D.D. was conferred upon him by the college of New Jersey; but he did not avail
                    himself of the title. Jay also wrote an excellent <hi rend="italic">Life of Rev.
                    Cornelius Winter,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Rev. John Clarke.</hi>
                    An edition of Jay’s <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> in 12 vols. 8vo, revised by
                    himself, was issued in 1842-44; again, reduced in price, in 1856. A new edition,
                    in 8 vols. 8vo, was announced in 1876. For further particulars see Jay’s <hi
