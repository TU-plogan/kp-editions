                    Jeddah, Djiddah, or Djeddah, a town of Arabia, on the eastern coast of the Red
                    Sea, in 21° 28' N. lat. and 39° 17' E. long., is of importance mainly as the
                    principal landing-place of the pilgrims to Mecca. Its distance from that city is
                    estimated at 44 or 46 miles. Built on a slight eminence, with a purple
                    background of distant hills, Jiddah as seen from the sea presents an attractive
                    aspect. The white tower-like houses, fancifully enriched with balconies,
                    cornices, and lattices of rich-toned woodwork, shine out from an environment of
                    grey sand and blue-green sea with startling effect. The town extends along the
                    beach for about a mile, and is surrounded by a high wall of modern date and in
                    bad repair, with towers at intervals. At the northern end of the seaface stand
                    the prison and other public buildings, and at the southern end a small fort no
                    longer available for the defence of the harbour. There are three landward gates,
                    the Mecca gate to the east, through which all caravans pass, and where toll is
                    levied on the transit of camels, the Medina gate to the north, and the Yemen
                    gate to the south. In front of the Mecca gate is a rambling suburb, with shops,
                    coffeehouses, and an open market-place. Before the Medina gate are the Turkish
                    barracks, and beyond them the great holy place of Jiddah, the singular tomb of
                    “our mother Eve,” surrounded by the principal cemetery.</p>
                <p>The tomb is a walled enclosure said to represent the dimensions of the body,
                    about two hundred paces long and 15 feet broad. At the head is a small erection
                    where gifts are deposited, and rather more than half-way down a whitewashed dome
                    encloses a small dark chapel within which is the black stone known as <hi
                        rend="italic">Bl-surrah,</hi> the navel. The grave of Eve is mentioned by
                    Edrisi, but except the black stone nothing bears any aspect of antiquity.

                <p>Beyond the immediate suburbs the country as far as the foot of the hill is
                    desert, with scanty pasturage and a few villages of Arab huts. The inhabitants
                    (Harb, Huteym, Zobeid) are engaged in camel transport, slave running, and mother
                    of pearl fishery.</p>
                <p>The town itself, which consists of four quarters, is well built, with a good
                    bazaar and many lofty and spacious houses, built of the madrepore rock of the
                    district. The best dwellings are near the Medina gate; the mosques are not
                    remarkable, and the streets are narrow and in part very filthy.. The wretched
                    huts which formerly occupied part <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n725/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0913-0725-0692"/> of the enceinte have been almost entirely
                    removed since the frightful outbreak of cholera among the pilgrims in 1864-65,
                    and the lowest strata of the population now occupy a village without the walls.
                    The sanitary condition of Jiddah still, however, leaves much to be desired,
                    especially in the pilgrim season. The chief defect is the scanty water supply
                    derived from cisterns and wells outside the town. A conduit from the hills has
                    been projected, and would yield a copious stream of excellent water, but the
                    scheme is opposed by the owners of the cisterns, who drive a lucrative trade, a
                    camel-load of water (16 skins of about 7 pints each) costing as much as
                    sixteenpence, or after protracted drought much more. The permanent population of
                    Jiddah is very variously estimated. Mr Beyts <hi rend="italic">(Consular
                        Reports,</hi> 1875) places it at 30,000, including 2000 Indian settlers, 100
                    Greeks, Syrians, and Maltese, and 25 Franks; but the Dutch consul in 1879 allows
                    a total of 15,000 only. The native population is of very mixed blood.</p>
                <p>Jiddah is said to have been founded by Persian merchants in the caliphate of
                    Othman, but its great commercial prosperity dates from the beginning of the 15th
                    century, when it became the centre of trade between Egypt and India. Down to the
                    time of Burckhardt the Suez ships went no farther than Jiddah, where they were
                    met by Indian vessels. The introduction of steamers in the Red Sea has deprived
                    Jiddah of its place as an emporium not only for Indian goods but for the
                    products of the Red Sea, which formerly were collected here, but are now largely
                    exported direct by steamer from Hodeida, Suâkin, and other ports, though coffee
                    from Yemen and gums from the African coast still pass in considerable quantities
                    through the hands of the Jiddah merchants. The chief exports apart from these
                    are mother of pearl (fished by slave divers) and hides. The chief local
                    manufactures are a coarse cotton fabric, embroideries in gold and silver,
                    lacquer work, beads in black coral, and the like. Boat-building is carried on
                    with great skill. The baggalas of from 50 to 60 tons are built of East Indian
                    wood, and are excellent sailers. The imports of Jiddah are considerable, as the
                    town supplies the interior not only with manufactured goods but with grain and
                    other provisions. See full details of the' trade in a valuable paper by the
                    Dutch consul, Mr Kruyt, in <hi rend="italic">Tijdsch. v. h. Aardr.
                        Genootschap</hi> (Amsterdam, 1880, No. 5). The total exports and imports for
                    1879 are valued at £2,201,030. In the same year the port was visited by 241
                    steamships (213,295 tons) and 1156 sailing vessels (55,932 tons). The harbour is
                    not convenient of «access, but the roadstead when entered is well protected by
                    coral reefs.</p>
                <p>The introduction of steam traffic, while fatal to other local interests, has
                    given a great impulse to the pilgrim trade, which is now regarded as the annual
                    harvest of Jiddah. The pilgrim steamers are usually chartered by European
                    merchants in conjunction with native capitalists and persons of religious
                    influence. The average number of pilgrims annually landed at the port is not
                    much short of 40,000. For 1879 Mr Kruyt enumerates 7995 Turks, 2286 from the
                    Barbary states, 3459 Egyptians, 8787 Malayans and Javanese, 10,894 Indians, 3506
                    Persians, 3300 Arabs from Yemen, the Sùdân, and other places.</p>
                <p>In the early years of the present century Jiddah resisted with success repeated
                    attacks of the Wahhâbites, and remained in the hands of the grand sherif when he
                    had lost the rest of the Hijâz. It was governed by Egypt during the Arabian wars
                    of Mehemet Ali, but since 1840 has been again occupied by the Turks. There is a
                    Turkish caim-macam under the wâly of the Hij&lt;4z and a Turkish cadi, but the
                    sherif through his resident agent exercises an authority practically superior to
                    that of these officials. In 1858 the attempts of England to suppress the slave
                    trade and a supposed insult to the Ottoman flag led to a plot to murder all the
                    Christians in town, which was executed with fatal success (15th June), the
                    English consul Page and the French consul Éveillard being among the victims.
                    This outrage was followed by the bombardment of the town by the English
                    man-of-war “Cyclops,” and the authorities were compelled publicly to execute the
                    Turkish governor and two leading citizens involved in the plot.</p>
