                    daughter of the Canaanite Shuah is to be referred to a union of the tribe with
                    Canaanite elements. Er and Onan are extinct subdivisions of the mixed
                    population, though a minor family of the former name appears as incorporated
                    with Shelah, the third clan of this branch of the tribe (1 Chron. iv. 21). The
                    details of the disappearance of these ancient stocks are obscure.<note

                    are represented as secondary. They are children of Judah and Tamar, but the
                    former is their father in virtue of an extension of the levirate principle. As
                    the author represents Tamar’s conduct as justifiable under the circumstances,
                    the narrative must have taken shape before the levirate law assumed the narrower
                    form given in Deuteronomy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    ingenious explanation of Tamar, Pharez, and Zerah is given by Lagarde, <hi
                    rend="italic">Orientalia,</hi> ii. (1880). He identifies Tamar (palm tree) with
                    Phoenicia, and regards Zerah (∏ΙT=ΓD1K, <hi rend="italic">indigena)</hi> as the
                    old Canaanite element of the union which had to yield precedence to the younger
                    Hebrew invaders (Pharez). In any case the narrative of Gen. xxxviii., with all
                    its obscurities, indicates two of the most notable features in the early history
                    of Judah, its mixed character and its long separation from the rest of Israel
                    (ver. 1). The latter point receives further illustration in the book of Judges.
                    Judah and Simeon seem to have broken off from Israel at Gilgal, and taken a
                    separate course. In the song of Deborah the tribe is not named among the rest,
                    and even in the time of David Judah and Israel are still more conscious of their
                    separation than of their original unity. Indeed the two soon fell apart again at
                    the division of the kingdom, but after the time of David the idea of unity was
                    never lost; and, while the prophets look for a restoration of the realm of the
                    house of Jesse, Deut, xxxiii. 7 (the work of a poet of Ephraim) prays for
                    victory to Judah against his enemies and his ultimate restoration to his people,
                    the greater Israel of the north. The blessing of Jacob, on the other hand, views
                    Judah in the light of the Davidic sovereignty as holding the hegemony over his
                    brethren until the coming of the Messiah.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    information as to the tribal history of Judah is derived from 1 Chron. ii. l-iv.
                    23. It appears that the tribe absorbed a large element of non-Israelite origin,
                    the Hezronites, or, as the Arabs would now say, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hadar,</hi> original nomads who had settled down in villages and towns. To
                    these belonged not only the Jerahmeelites but the Calibbites in Hebron and the
                    southern steppes. It appears to have been the incorporation of these elements
                    that raised Judah to the eminent place which it maintained from the time of
                    David. The details of this important piece of history have been analysed by
