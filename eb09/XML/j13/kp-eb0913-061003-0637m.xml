                <p><label type="entry">JAY</label> (French, <hi rend="italic">Geaι),</hi> a
                    well-known and very beautiful European bird, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Corvus</hi><hi rend="italic">glandarius</hi> of Linnaeus, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Garrulus glandarius</hi> of modern ornithologists. To this species are more or
                    less closely allied numerous birds inhabiting the Palaearctic and Indian
                    Regions, as well as the greater part of America, but not occurring in the
                    Antilles, in the southern portion of the Neotropical Region, or in the Ethiopian
                    or Australian. All these birds are commonly called Jays, and form a group of the
                    Crows or <hi rend="italic">Corvidae,</hi> which may fairly be considered a
                    Subfamily, <hi rend="italic">Garrulinae.</hi> Indeed there are, or have been,
                    systematists who would elevate the Jays to the rank of a Family, <hi
                    rend="italic">Garrulidae</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> a proceeding which seems
                    unnecessary. Some of them have an unquestionable resemblance to the Pies, if the
                    group now known by that name can be satisfactorily severed from the true <hi
                    rend="italic">Corvinae.</hi> In structure the Jays are not readily
                    differentiated from the Pies; but in habit, so far as is known of them, they are
                    much more arboreal, delighting in thick coverts, seldom appearing in the open,
                    and seeking their food on or under trees. They seem also never to walk or run
                    when on the ground, but always to hop. The body-feathers are commonly loose and
                    soft; and, gaily coloured as are most of the species, in few of them has the
                    plumage the metallic glossiness it generally presents in the Pies, while the
                    proverbial beauty of the “Jay’s wing” is due to the vivid tints of
                    blue—turquoise and cobalt, heightened by bars of jet-black, an indication of the
                    same style of ornament being observable in the greater number of the other forms
                    of the group, and in some predominating over nearly the whole surface. Of the
                    many genera th it have been proposed by ornithologists, perhaps about nine may
                    be deemed sufficiently well established.</p>
                <p>The ordinary European Jay, <hi rend="italic">Garrulus glandarius</hi> (fig. 1),
                    has of late years suffered so much persecution in the British Islands as to have
                    become in many districts a rare bird. In Ireland it seems now to be indigenous
                    to the southern half of the island only; in England generally, it is far less
                    numerous than formerly; and Mr Lumsden <hi rend="italic">{Scottish
                    Naturalist,</hi> iii. pp. 230-240) has shewn that in Scotland its numbers have
                    decreased with still greater rapidity. There is little doubt that it would have
                    been exterminated by this time but for its stock being supplied in autumn by
                    immigration, and for its shy and wary behaviour, especially at the
                    breeding-season, when it becomes almost wholly mute, and thereby often escapes
                    detection. No truthful man, however much he may love the bird, will gainsay the
                    depredations on fruit and eggs that it at times commits; but the gardeners and
                    gamekeepers of Britain fall into the usual error of persons imperfectly
                    acquainted with the ways of Nature, and, instead of taking a few simple steps to
                    guard their charge from injury, or at most of punishing the individual birds
                    from which they suffer, deliberately adopt methods of wholesale
                    destruction—methods that in the case of this species are only too easy and too
                    effectual— by proffering temptation to trespass which it is not in Jay-nature to
                    resist, and accordingly the bird runs great chance of total extirpation.
                    Notwithstanding the war carried on against the Jay, its varied cries and active
                    gesticulations shew it to be a sprightly bird, and at a distance that renders
                    its beauty-spots invisible, it is yet rendered conspicuous by its
                    cinnamon-coloured body and pure white tail-coverts, which contrast with the deep
                    black and rich chestnut that otherwise mark its plumage, and even the young at
                    once assume a dress closely resembling that of the adult. The nest, generally
                    concealed in a leafy tree or bush, is carefully built, with a lining formed of
                    fine roots neatly interwoven. Herein from four to seven eggs, of a
                    greenish-white closely freckled, so as to seem suffused with light olive, are
                    laid in March or April, and the young on quitting it accompany their parents for
                    some weeks.</p>
                <p>Though the common Jay of Europe inhabits nearly the whole of this quarter of the
                    globe south of 64° N. lat., its territory in the east of Russia is also occupied
                    by <hi rend="italic">G. braηdti,</hi> a kindred form, which replaces it on the
                    other side of the Ural, and ranges thence across Siberia to Japan; and again on
                    the Lower Danube and thence to Constantinople the nearly-allied <hi
                    rend="italic">G. krynicki</hi> (which alone is found in southern Russia,
                    Caucasia, and Asia Minor) shares its haunts with it.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Further information will possibly shew that
                    these districts are not occupied at the same season of the year l&gt;y the two
                    forms.</p></note> It also crosses the Mediterranean to Algeria and Morocco; but
                    there, as in southern Spain, it is probably but a winter immigrant. The three
                    forms just named have the widest range of any of the genus. Next to them come

                    and <hi rend="italic">G. taeυaηus</hi> confined to the island of Formosa. The
                    most aberrant of the true Jays is <hi rend="italic">G. lidthi,</hi> a very rare
                    species, which seems to come from some part of Japan <hi rend="italic"
                    >(vide</hi> Salvador!, <hi rend="italic">Atti Accacl. Torino,</hi> vii. p. 474),
                    though its exact locality is not known.</p>
                <p>Leaving the true Jays of the genus <hi rend="italic">Garrulus,</hi> it is
                    expedient next to consider those of a group named, in 1831, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Perisoreus</hi> by Bonaparte <hi rend="italic">(Saggio,</hi> &lt;fcc., <hi
                    rend="italic">Anim. Vertebrati,</hi> p. 43) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dysornithia</hi> by Swainson <hi rend="italic">(F. B.-Americana,</hi> ii. p.
                    495).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Recent writers
                    have preferred the former name, though it was only used subgenerically by its
                    author, who assigned to it no characters, which the inventor of the latter was
                    careful to do, regarding it at the same time as a genus.</p></note></p>
                <p>This group contains two species—one the <hi rend="italic">Lanius infaustus</hi>
                    of Linnaeus and the Siberian Jay of English writers, which ranges throughout the
                    pine-forests of the north of Europe and Asia, and the second the <hi
                    rend="italic">Corvus canadensis</hi> of the same author, or Canada Jay,
                    occupying a similar station in America. The so-called Siberian Jay is one of the
                    most entertaining birds in the world. Its versatile cries and actions, as seen
                    and heard by those who penetrate the solitude of the northern forests it
                    inhabits,' can never be forgotten by one who has had experience of them, any
                    more than the pleasing sight of its rust-colour ed tail, which an occasional
                    gleam of sunshine will light up into a brilliancy quite unexpected by those who
                    have only surveyed the bird’s otherwise gloomy appearance in the glasscase of a
                    museum. It seems scarcely to know fear, obtruding itself on the notice of any
                    passenger who invades its haunts, and, should he halt, making itself at once a
                    denizen of his bivouac. In confinement it speedily becomes friendly, but
                    suitable food for it is not easily found. Linnaeus seems to have been under a
                    misapprehension when he applied to it the trivial epithet it bears; for by none
                    of his countrymen is it deemed an unlucky bird, but rather the reverse. In fact,
                    no one can listen to the cheery sound of its ordinary calls with any but a
                    hopeful feeling. The Canada Jay, or “Whiskey-Jack” (the corruption probably of a
                    Cree name), seems to be of a similar nature, but it presents a still more sombre
                    coloration, its nestling plumage,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In this it was described and figured <hi rend="italic">{F.

                    appearance and suggestive of its being a pristine form.</p>
                <p>As though to make amends for the dull plumage of the species last mentioned,
                    North America offers some of the most brilliantly coloured of the Subfamily, and

                    >Cyanurus</hi><hi rend="italic">cristatus</hi> (fig. 2), is one of the most
                    conspicuous birds of the transatlantic woods. The account of its habits by
                    Alexander Wilson is known to every student of ornithology, and Wilson’s
                    followers have had little to do but supplement his history with unimportant
                    details.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The “Blue Jay”
                    of a recent American humorist would, however, from the locality assigned to his

                    kindred—American ornithologists must determine which.</p></note> In this bird
                    and its many allied forms, coloration, though almost confined to various tints
                    of blue, seems to reach its climax, but want of space forbids more particular
