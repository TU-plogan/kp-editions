                    the roundness of its eye pupils, in its period of gestation, and to a large
                    extent also in its habits, while like the dog it is subject to hydrophobia. It
                    grows to a height of 15 inches at the shoulders, and to a length of about 2
                    feet, exclusive of its bushy fox-like tail. Its fur is of a greyish-yellow
                    colour, darker on the back and lighter coloured beneath. An excrescence
                    consisting of a horny cone, half an inch in length, and concealed by a tuft of
                    hair, is, according to Emerson Tennent, sometimes found on the head of the
                    jackal. The Singhalese aver that it is only found on the leader of the pack, and
                    they esteem it as an invaluable talisman. Jackals, of which there are several
                    well-marked varieties, are widely distributed throughout southern Asia and the
                    north of Africa. They are nocturnal animals, concealing themselves until dusk in
                    woody jungles and other natural lurking places, thereafter sallying forth in
                    packs, which sometimes number two hundred individuals, and visiting farmyards,
                    villages, and towns in search of food. This consists for the most part of the
                    smaller mammals and poultry, although their association in packs enables them
                    also to hunt down antelopes and sheep. When unable to obtain living prey, they
                    feed upon carrion and refuse of all kinds, and are thus useful in removing
                    putrescent matter from the streets of Eastern towns. They are also fond of
                    grapes and other fruits, and are thus the pests of the vineyard as well as the
                    poultry-yard. The cry of the jackal has been described as even more appalling
                    than that of the hyaena, a shriek from one member of a pack being the signal for
                    a general chorus of screams, which is kept up during the greater part of the
                    night. In India these animals are occasionally hunted with foxhounds and
                    greyhounds, and from their extreme cunning and pluck they are said to afford
                    excellent sport. When brought to bay, they frequently turn upon their assailants
                    and inflict severe wounds with their teeth; at other times they have been known
                    to feign death as a means of escape. Jackals are readily tamed; and domesticated
                    individuals are said, when called by their masters, to wag their tails, crouch,
                    and throw themselves on the ground, and otherwise behave in a dog-like fashion.
                    The jackal, like the fox, has a peculiarly offensive odour, due to the secretion
                    of a gland at the base of the tail, but in domesticated specimens this odour is
                    much fainter than in the wild forms.</p>
