                    political commotions which then agitated Ireland. His removal to England in 1798
                    confined his attention fortunately to his more peaceful calling, in which he
                    attained considerable skill, but his daughter’s mind seems to have been
                    influenced in the highest sense by the circumstances that surrounded her birth;
                    she was distinguished from her tenderest years by that ardour and courage and
                    keenness to supply the needs and redress the injuries of others which marked her
                    career through life.</p>
                <p>At sixteen years of age she undertook the office of governess in the family of
                    the marquis of Winchester, and later in that of Mr Littleton, afterwards Lord
                    Hatherton. Between these two engagements she accompanied a young pupil, one of a
                    party of travellers, to Italy, a tour which gave rise to a narrative of what she
                    saw and did, written in an imaginary character. This, her first literary
                    production, the merits of which she little appreciated, did not make its
                    appearance until after her marriage with Mr Robert Jameson, a barrister, in
                    1825, when it was advertised by a friend under the title of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ladfs Diary,</hi> and ultimately published by Mr Colburn as <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Diary of an</hi><hi rend="italic">Ennuyée.</hi> Mrs Jameson’s marriage was
                    not a happy one; but, if not more unfortunate than many of her sex in this form
                    of trial, she set the example of a rare discretion under it. Her marriage
                    troubles were made no excuse for appealing against the laws of the land or the
                    usages of society. The <hi rend="italic">Diary of an</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ennuyée</hi> attracted much attention. Italy was no such beaten ground then,
                    nor ∙a traveller with ardent feelings for art and nature so common, as both have
                    become since. The authoress has been blamed for assuming the disguise of an
                    invalid, who dies on her way back; but such a tinge of romance made no
                    difference in the truth of her descriptions, while it procured them more
                    readers.</p>
                <p>In 1829 Mr Jameson was appointed puisne judge in the island of Dominica. It was
                    decided to be impracticable for her to accompany him, and meanwhile Mrs Jameson
                    visited the Continent again with her father. Traces of this journey appear in
                    <hi rend="italic">Visits and Sketches at Home and Abl·oad.</hi> Hitherto the
                    subjects she had treated had been limited to impressions of outer scenes and
                    passing things, or to abridgments of history, as in her good schoolbook <hi
                    rend="italic">Female Sovereigns.</hi> The first work in which her powers of
                    original thought became embodied were her <hi rend="italic">Characteristics of
                    Shakespeare's Women,</hi> which appeared in 1832. These analyses of the great
                    poet’s heroines are unsurpassed for delicacy of critical insight and fineness of
                    literary touch. They are the result of a penetrating but essentially feminine
                    mind, applied to the study of individuals of its own sex, detecting
                    characteristics and defining differences not perceived by the ordinary critic,
                    and entirely overlooked by the general reader.</p>
                <p>In 1833 Mrs Jameson paid her first visit to Germany, the literature and art of
                    which country may be said to have then first roused the curiosity of English
                    minds. Dresden and Tieck and Retsch, Frankfort and Dannecker, Weimar and, if not
                    Goethe, who had died the year before, yet the homage which more than restored
                    him to life, successively occupied her. Nor was she proof to the spell of the
                    modem German art which the late King Louis of Bavaria had evoked in his capital.
                    Those conglomerations of hard lines, cold colours, and pedantic subjects which
                    decorated Munich were new to the world, and Mrs Jameson’s enthusiasm first gave
                    them the reputation which has long since faded away.</p>
                <p>It was in 1836 that Mrs Jameson was summoned by her husband to join him in
                    Canada. She started with many a regret for the life she was leaving, and was not
                    long left in doubt as to the fruitlessness of the step. He failed to meet her,
                    even by a letter, at New York, and she was left to make her way alone at the
                    worst of seasons to Toronto. After six months’ experiment she felt it useless to
                    prolong a life far from all ties of family happiness and Opportunities of
                    usefulness. Before leaving, she undertook a journey to the depths of the Indian
                    settlements in Canada; she explored Lake Huron, and saw much of emigrant and
                    aborigines life unknown to travellers, which she afterwards embodied in her <hi
                    rend="italic">Winter Studies and Summer Rambles.</hi> She returned to England in
                    1838. It was at this period that Mrs Jameson first devoted her attention to the
                    subject of art. She began by making careful notes of the chief private
                    collections in and near London which had hitherto received no systematic
                    description. This <hi rend="italic">Companion to the Private Galleries</hi> was
                    soon followed by the <hi rend="italic">Handbook to the Public Galleries.</hi>
                    These works were useful compilations, and had a certain circulation; but the
                    authoress laid claim to no powers of real discrimination, and many of her
                    verdicts, in which she only followed those that went before her, have been since
                    superseded by exacter knowledge. These works, however, led on to those by which
                    her literary career has been specially distinguished,—her series of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sacred and Legendary Art.</hi> The time was ripe for such
                    contributions to the traveller’s library. The <hi rend="italic">Acta
                    Sanctorum</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Rook of the Golden Legend</hi> had had
                    their readers, but no one had ever pointed out the connexion between these tales
                    and the works of Christian art. The painters employed by convent or church had
                    introduced the local or family saints according to contract, and the faithful
                    had retained the tradition of their names; but foi' the modern Protestant
                    traveller the whole was a <hi rend="italic">terra incognita.</hi> The way to
                    these studies had been pointed out in the preface to Kugler’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Handbook of Italian Painting</hi> by Sir Charles Eastlake, who had intended
                    pursuing the subject himself. Eventually he made over to Mrs Jameson the
                    materials and references he had collected. They could not have been placed in
                    better hands. She recognized the extent of the ground before her as a mingled
                    sphere of poetry, history, devotion, and art. She directed the taste of her
                    readers with judgment and even enthusiasm; and, with the same penetration that
                    had guided her in her literary tasks, she threw many a light on a master’s
                    intentions which had escaped both artists and critics.</p>
                <p>Another service Mrs Jameson rendered to the English public, and that the most
                    valuable of all, has still to be noticed. She began her literary career by
                    analysing books, she proceeded to analyse works of art, and she ended by
                    analysing society. It was a natural supplement to a course of varied personal
                    experience and no little struggle that her attention should be directed to the
                    great moral questions of the day, and especially to those affecting the
                    education, occupations, and maintenance of her own sex. Her early essay on <hi
                    rend="italic">The Relative Social Position of Mothers and Governesses</hi> is a
                    masterpiece. She knew both sides; and in no respect does she more clearly prove
                    the falseness of the position she describes than in the certainty with which she
                    predicts its eventual reform.</p>
                <p>To Mrs Jameson we owe the first popular enunciation of the principle of male and
                    female cooperation in works of mercy and education. Her mind was peculiarly to
                    be trusted with the advocacy of such tenets—it had become as clear and judicious
                    by experience as it was ardent and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n588/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0588-0563"/> vigorous by nature. In her later years she took
                    up a succession of subjects all bearing on the same principles of active
                    benevolence, and the best ways of carrying them into practice. Sisters of
                    charity, hospitals, penitentiaries, prisons, and workhouses all claimed her
                    interest—all more or less included under those definitions of “the communion of
                    love and communion of labour” which are inseparably connected with her memory.
                    To the clear and temperate forms in which she brought the results of her
                    convictions before her friends in the shape of private lectures, subsequently
                    printed, may be traced the source whence living reformers and philanthropists
                    took counsel and courage.</p>
                <p>Mrs Jameson died in March 1860. She left the last of her <hi rend="italic">Sacred
                    and Legendary Art</hi> series in preparation. It was completed, under the title
                    of <hi rend="italic">The History of our Lord in Art,</hi> by Lady Eastlake. <hi
