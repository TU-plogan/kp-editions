                    Damoh, Seoni, and Mandla, has an area of 18,564 square miles, and in 1878 had a
                    population of 1,839,100.</p></note> a British district in the commissionership
                    of the Central Provinces, India, between 21° 12' and 23° 56' N. lat., and
                    between 76° 40' and 81° 35' E. long., is bounded on the N. by Panna and Maihar,
                    on the E. by Rewah, on the S. by the districts of Mandla, Seoul, and Narsinhpur,
                    and on the W. by Damoh district</p>
                <p>Jabalpur consists of a long narrow plain running northeast and south-west, and
                    shut in on all sides by highlands. This plain, which forms an offshoot from the
                    great valley of the Nerbudda, is covered in its western and southern portions by
                    a rich alluvial deposit of black cotton-soil. At Jabalpur town the soil is
                    sandy, and water plentiful near the surface. The north and east belong to the
                    Ganges and Jumna basins, the south and west to the Nerbudda basin. Thus between
                    Jabalpur and Mirzâpur lies the great watershed betwixt the Gulf of Cambay and
                    the Bay of Bengal. The Nerbudda flows through the district for 70 miles from
                    east to west, passing about 9 miles below Jabalpur town through the famous
                    marble rocks, where it throws itself from a rocky ledge with a fall of 30 feet,
                    called <hi rend="italic">Dhudη-dhαr,</hi> or the “misty shoot.”</p>
                <p>The population was estimated in 1877 at 555,796; but a more careful census taken
                    in 1872 returned it at 528,859, of whom 270,237 were males and 258,622 females.
                    The ethnical division in 1877 showed—Europeans, 776; Eurasians, 201; aboriginal
                    tribes, 105,349; Hindus, 416,770; Mahometans, 27,282; Buddhists and Jains, 3654.
                    Jabalpur, the capital, which has a population of 55,188, is the only town with
                    more than 5000 inhabitants. Of the total area of 3918 square miles, only 1320
                    are cultivated, but 1308 more are returned as cultivable. Of the cultivated land
                    3949 acres are irrigated—entirely by private enterprise. Cereals, rice, cotton,
                    and oil-seeds are the principal crops. The district is rich in garden <pb

                    fruits, peaches, pineapples, strawberries, and potatoes. Both the plains and the
                    high lands are well wooded; the forest produce is of considerable value,
                    consisting of lac and gum, and <hi rend="italic">tasar</hi> silk. The trade of
                    the district converges at Jabalpur town, which is one of the most important
                    railway centres in India, being at the junction of the Great Indian Peninsula
                    and East Indian systems. One of the chief manufactures is iron. The most
                    productive mines are at Dabwârâ, Agariâ, and Janti; but the most important are
                    those of the Kumbhi pargana, which supply Panagur, the chief seat of the iron
                    industry in the district. The other manufactures include brass utensils, cotton
                    cloth, and leather articles. Coal is found at several places. The total revenue
                    in 1876-77 was £76,013. The number of Government or aided schools was 125,
                    attended by 7015 pupils. The climate is healthy, and the temperature extremely
                    moderate. As a rule, the hot weather extends only over two months, and, except
                    immediately before the rains, is not oppressive. The rains last from early in
                    June until the latter part of September. The prevailing diseases of the district
                    are fevers and dysentery. Cholera and small-pox are occasional visitants, and
                    influenza at times assumes the character of an epidemic. In 1876 eight
                    charitable dispensaries afforded medical relief to 35,795 indoor and outdoor
                    patients.</p>
                <p>The early history of Jabalpur is unknown; but inscriptions record the existence
                    during the 11th and 12th centuries of a local line of princes of that Haιhai
                    race which is so closely connected with the history of Gondwânâ. In the 16th
                    century the Gond raja of Garhâ· Mandla extended his power over fifty-two
                    districts, including the present Jabalpur. During the minority of his grandson,
                    Asaf Khan, the viceroy of Kara Mânikpur, conquered the Garhâ principality and
                    held it at first as an independent chief. Eventually he resigned his
                    pretensions, and submitted himself to the emperor Akbar. The Delhi power,
                    however, enjoyed little more than a nominal supremacy; and the princes of Garhâ
                    Mandla maintained a practical independence until their subjugation by the
                    governors of Sagar (Saugor) in 1781. In 1798 the peshwâ granted theNerbudda
                    valley to the Bhonslâ princes of Nâgpur, who continued to hold the district
                    until the British occupied it after an engagement on the 19th December 1817. At
                    first the Sâgar and Nerbudda territories were governed by a commissioner in
                    subordination to the resident at Nagpur; but in 1861 Jabalpur was formed into a
                    separate district of the Central Provinces.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Jabalpur,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Jubbulpore,</hi> the
                    headquarters of the above district, is situated in 23° 1Γ N. 1at., 79° 59' E.
                    long., in a rocky basin, at an elevation above sea-level of about 1458 feet, 165
                    miles north-east from Nâgpur, and 108 miles south-east from Sâgar. The numerous
                    gorges in the neighbouring rocks have been taken advantage of to surround the
                    town with a series of lakes, which, shaded by fine trees, and bordered by
                    fantastic crags and massy boulders, add much beauty to the suburbs. The town
                    itself is modern, and is laid out in wide and regular streets. A streamlet
                    separates the civil station and cantonment from the town; but, though the
                    climate is mild, a swampy hollow beneath renders the site unhealthy for
                    Europeans. Jabalpur contains a school of industry, where tents and carpets are
                    largely manufactured. The opening of the railway system has immensely developed
                    the trade of Jabalpur, which has now become one of the most important centres of
                    commerce in the Central Provinces. In 1875-76 the total imports were valued at
                    £567,000, the chief itèms being piece-goods, wheat, sugar, metals, salt, rice,
                    country cloth, oil-seeds, spices, <hi rend="italic">ghi,</hi> oil, inferior
                    grains, lac, and raw cotton. The total exports, principally raw cotton and
                    wheat, were valued at £160,000. The population, almost entirely Hindu, was
                    55,188 in 1877.</p>
