                    of considerable prominence in the category of those mystics who, like St
                    Hildegard or the abbess Elizabeth, on behalf of a sounder morality protested in
                    prophetic denunciation against the many and gross abuses connected with the
                    ecclesiasticism which prevailed in Europe towards the close of the 12 th
                    century. The few details of his life that can be given are neither very precise
                    nor quite trustworthy; but it appears that he was born about 1145 at a village
                    in the neighbourhood of Cosenza, and that when a youth he had attended the
                    Sicilian court; afterwards he made a pilgrimage to Palestine, and, having
                    (whether previously or subsequently to his return is not stated) become a monk,
                    he ultimately attained to the dignity of abbot of the monastery of Corace in
                    Calabria (onwards from 1178). Here his studies in prophecy and apocalyptic
                    brought him into great repute, and successive popes—Lucius III., Urban III., and
                    Clement III.—manifested an interest in them. The last-named especially, in the
                    first year of his pontificate (1188), urged Joachim to the completion of his
                    commentary on the Apocalypse and also of his <hi rend="italic">Concordia
                    utriusque</hi><hi rend="italic">Testamenti.</hi> Soon afterwards the abbot,
                    accompanied by a friend named Rainerius, leaving Corace in search of a more
                    solitary life, set up among the lonely hills of Sylae near Cosenza a new
                    establishment, named “Sancti Joannis in Flori,” for which he drew up a new and
                    stringent rule, afterwards sanctioned (in 1196) by Celestine III. From this
                    cloister ultimately sprang a whole congregation, —the so-called “Ordo
                    Florensis.” The only work published during his lifetime was the <hi
                    rend="italic">Concordia,</hi> which had been duly submitted to the judgment of
                    the Holy See; and before his death (which occurred between September 1201 and
                    June 1202) he left in writing a memorandum with reference to his other
                    compositions,—the <hi rend="italic">Pxρositio in Apocalypsiη,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Psalterium</hi><hi rend="italic">decem</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >chordarum, Contra</hi><hi rend="italic">Judaeos,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Contra cathol.</hi><hi rend="italic">fidei adversarios,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> intimating his desire and intention that these should also be subject to
                    the same censorship.</p>
                <p>His study of apocalyptic prophecy had resulted in the construction of an
                    elaborate scheme of the past and future course of the divine kingdom which is
                    its interesting as it is curious. He distinguished three stages or ages of the
                    world corresponding to the three persons of the Trinity, the three conditions of
                    married persons, clergy, and monks, the three periods of the Old Testament, the
                    New Testament, and the final dispensation. The advent of the last of these
                    periods, that of the Holy Spirit, the “spiritualis intelligentia,” proceeding
                    from the Old and New Testaments, he regarded as imminent. It was to be the
                    period of perfect freedom from the letter, of monastic contemplation, adoration,
                    and jubilation, and of the widest possible diffusion of the gospel (even to the
                    Jews); but it was to be preceded by fearful judgments, in which Antichrist
                    should become manifest. He regarded the Church of Rome as having been typified
                    by the kingdom of Judah, while the Eastern Church corresponded to that of
                    Israel. The way in which he worked out this analogy gave him scope for pointing
                    out the manifold errors and corruptions into which he believed the Church of the
                    West to have fallen, yet in no spirit of hostility to that organization as such.
                    His eschatology found great currency and much acceptance amongst the stricter
                    members of the Franciscan order,—the “Zelatores” as they were called,—and
                    gradually gave rise to a cognate literature more manifestly opposed to Rome and
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n728/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0728-0695"/> even to ecclesiasticism of any kind. Among this
                    class of compositions the greatest historical importance belongs to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Liber intro-ductorius in</hi><hi rend="italic">Evangelium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">oeternum,</hi> now no longer extant, except in some excerpts. The
                    work was censured as heretical by the university of Paris, and the order for its
                    destruction was obtained from Alexander IV. in 1255; this, however, only
                    stimulated the public interest in the books of Joachim himself, which now began
                    to be circulated and read more widely than ever. That interest died a natural
                    death, however, when the year 1260, which Joachim had fixed as the time of the
                    end, had come and gone, leaving the old and evil world practically
                    unchanged.</p>
