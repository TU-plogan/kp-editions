                    thus early familiarized with the double part which he afterwards so successfully
                    filled himself. When sixteen years of age he found employment at a hairdresser’s
                    shop, and subsequently started a similar business of his own on the Gravier at A
                    gen. It is opposite this scene of his ripening genius and daily work that a
                    statue has been erected to his memory by public subscription. In 1835 he
                    published his first volume of <hi rend="italic">Papillotos</hi> (“Curl Papers
                    ”), containing poems in French (a language he used with a certain sense of
                    restraint), and in the familiar Agen patois —the popular speech of the working
                    classes—in which he was to achieve all his literary triumphs. Many of the pieces
                    in this volume had already been printed and submitted to the public. The dialect
                    which Jasmin spoke, though still harmonious and full of picturesque idioms, was
                    now almost exclusively used by illiterate persons, and was greatly modified by a
                    daily contact with French. It was, however, his native speech—the one in which
                    he found spontaneous and adequate expression, and he lost no opportunity of
                    making himself complete master of it by intercourse with the rural population in
                    outlying districts where it was spoken with less admixture. He rehabilitated,
                    disencumbered, and in a measure reconstructed his literary medium, and then,
                    fully realizing that his poems needed other exposition than the mere printed
                    text, he began those numerous public recitations which so largely added to his
                    reputation. His real poetic gift, and his flexible voice and action, fitted him
                    admirably for this double rôle of troubadour and jongleur. In 1835 he recited
                    his “Blind Girl of Castel-Cuillé” at Bordeaux, in 1836 at Toulouse; and he met
                    with an enthusiastic reception in both those important cities. Most of his
                    public recitations were given for benevolent purposes,—1,500,000 francs, the
                    proceeds of his poetical rounds, being contributed by him to the restoration of
                    the church of Vergt and other good works. Four successive volumes of <hi
                    rend="italic">Papillotos</hi> were published during his lifetime, and contained
                    amongst others the following remarkable poems, quoted in order: “The Charivari,”
                    “My Recollections” (supplemented after an interval of many years), “The Blind
                    Girl,” “Fran&lt; <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> ∙ou-netto,” “Martha the Simple,”
                    and “The Twin Brothers.” With the exception of the “Charivari,” these are all
                    touching pictures of humble life,—in most cases real episodes,—carefully
                    elaborated by the poet till the graphic descriptions, full of light and colour,
                    and the admirably varied and melodious verse, seem too spontaneous and easy to
                    have cost an effort. Jasmin was not a prolific writer, and, in spite of his
                    impetuous nature, would work a long time at one poem, striving to realize every
                    feeling he wished to describe, and give it its most lucid and natural
                    expression. A verse from his spirited poem, “The Third of May,” written in
                    honour of Henry IV., and published in the first volume of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Papillotos,</hi> is engraved on the base of the statue erected to that king at
                    Nérac. In 1852 Jasmin’s works were crowned by the Académie Française, and a
                    pension was awarded him. The medal struck on the occasion bore the inscription
                    “Au poete moral et populaire.” His title of “Maistre es Jeux” is a distinction
                    only conferred by the academy of Toulouse on illustrious writers. Pius IX. sent
                    him the insignia of a knight of St Gregory the Great, and he was made chevalier
                    of the legion of honour. He spent the latter years of his life on a small estate
                    which he had bought near Agen and named “Papillotos,” and which he describes in
                    <hi rend="italic">Ma Bigno</hi> (“My Vine”). Though invited to represent his
                    native city, he refused to do so, preferring the pleasures and leisure of a
                    country life, and wisely judging that he was no really eligible candidate for
                    electoral honours. He died October 4, 1864. His last poem, an answer to Renan,
                    was placed between his folded hands in his coffin.</p>
                <p>The linguistic and literary revival in the south of France, which received such
                    lustre from the genius of Jasmin, has now become a well-organized movement, and
                    has extended from Gascony to Languedoc, and to Provence, where it is most
                    marked.</p>
