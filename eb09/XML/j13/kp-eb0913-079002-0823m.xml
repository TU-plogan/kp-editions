                    dauntless in death <hi rend="italic">(Apoh,</hi> ii. 12); in the other he tells
                    how chance intercourse with an aged stranger brought him to know the truth <hi
                    rend="italic">(Dial. c. Tryph.,</hi> c. 2), but this passage may be allegorical.
                    In the introduction to the dialogue with Trypho, Justin describes various
                    systems of pagan philosophy and his relation to them. At first he associated
                    with the Stoics; from them he went to a Peripatetic, then to a Pythagorean; and
                    at length he embraced the doctrines of Platonism. His Platonism clung to him
                    through life, and curiously coloured many of his Christian speculations. We know
                    little about Justin’s life after his conversion. It is very probable that he
                    retained his philosopher’s cloak, the distinctive badge of the wandering and
                    professional teacher of philosophy, and went about from place to place
                    discussing the truths of Christianity in the hope of bringing educated pagans,
                    as he himself had been brought, through philosophy to Christ. At Ephesus he held
                    the famous disputation with Trypho the Jew, and in Rome he argued with Crescens
                    the Cynic. If the <hi rend="italic">Cohortatio</hi> be genuine, he also visited
                    Alexandria and Cumae. His martyrdom is well authenticated. In his second <hi
                    rend="italic">Apology</hi> Justin declares that he expected martyrdom, and that
                    he believed that his opponent Crescens, silenced in public by his arguments,
                    would do his best to get him thrown into prison and condemned to death; and this
                    declaration is probably the reason why Eusebius, who often manufactures facts
                    out of suppositions, asserts that Justin was slain through the plots of
                    Crescens. An old martyrium, of unknown authorship, records the trial and death
                    of’ a Justin, who is probably Justin Martyr, though there is no corroborative
                    historical evidence. If the account can be accepted, Justin was brought before
                    Rusticus, a Roman magistrate who was a Stoic; during his trial he was brave,
                    quiet, and dignified; he professed his faith in the God of heaven and earth, and
                    in His Son “the Master of Truth,” and confidently expressed the conviction that
                    after death he would share a blessed immortality. He was condemned and put to
                    death on the same day. We cannot fix with any certainty the dates of Justin’s
                    birth and death. He was probably born near the beginning of the 2d century, and
                    was martyred somewhere between 148 and 165.</p>
                <p>Justin was one of the earliest and ablest of the Christian Apologists, and it is
                    as an apologist rather than as a theologian that he must be criticized, for his
                    <hi rend="italic">Apologies</hi> did not lead him directly to exhibit and defend
                    the truths of Christianity. He was defending Christians not Christianity. Trajan
                    had formally authorized the persecution of the Christians. Hadrian and Antoninus
                    Pius had done nothing to put this decree in operation, but it hung over the
                    Christian church, and might have been put in force at any moment. The Christians
                    were legally proscribed. This was the state of matters which gave rise to
                    Justin’s <hi rend="italic">Apologies.</hi> He wrote like a man full of
                    Christianity; it was his philosophy, his religion, his rule of daily life. And
                    he wrote boldly, having nothing to fear and nothing to conceal. The argument of
                    his first <hi rend="italic">Apology,</hi> addressed to the emperor Antoninus
                    Pius, may be thus condensed. “In the name of these unjustly hated and much
                    abused men, I, Justin, one of themselves, present to you this discourse and
                    petition. You are everywhere called the Pious, the guardian of justice, the
                    friend of truth; your acts shall show whether you merit these titles. My design
                    is neither to flatter you by this letter nor to win your favour. Judge us by a
                    scrupulous and enlightened equity,: not by mere presumption, nor in the name of
                    superstition, nor by the persuasion of calumny; . . . . we fear no harm if we
                    are not guilty of any crime. You can kill, you cannot injure us. All that we ask
                    for is investigation; if the charges made against us are true, let us be
                    punished. . . J Our duty is to make our deeds and doctrines fully known; yours
                    is to investigate our cause and to act as good judges.” Justin then proceeds to
                    set forth the iniquity of the summary modes of trial in use against the
                    Christians, and goes on to state and deal with the charges brought against his
                    brethren. These were three: the Christians were denounced as atheists, as
                    rebels, and as evil-doers—faithless to God, the emperor, and society. Justin
                    answers, “We are atheists, if it be atheism not to acknowledge your gods; but we
                    hold this glorious atheism in common with Socrates, who was martyred for it as
                    we are; we are no atheists, for we worship the God of truth, the Father of
                    righteousness, of wisdom, and of all virtues. We are no rebels: the kingdom
                    founded by Jesus is purely spiritual, and need be no cause of alarm to the
                    emperors; we worship God only, but with this exception we joyfully obey you and
                    acknowledge<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n824/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0824-0791"/> you as our princes and governors. So far from our
                    being rebels, our religion helps true and good government; men may always hope
                    to elude human law, but they cannot hope to escape God, who sees and knows all
                    things. We are no criminals: the Crucified One whom we worship is the Divine
                    Word, living truth, and has enjoined us to live holy and pure lives.” Justin
                    contrasts pagan morals and the Christian life, the pagan deities and Jesus of
                    Nazareth. The empire and Christianity were at war because of the persecuting
                    edicts of the emperors, and Justin has no doubt that Christianity must in the
                    end win the day. The <hi rend="italic">Apology</hi> ends with solemn dignity:
                    “If this doctrine appears true and reasonable give heed to it; if not, treat it
                    as of no value. But do not condemn men to death who have done you no wrong; for
                    we declare to you that you will not escape the judgment of God if you persist in
                    injustice. For ourselves, we have but one cry—‘The will of God be done.’” In the
                    dialogue with Trypho, Justin endeavoured to show the truth of Christianity from
                    the Old Testament Scriptures, and he described the New Testament as the new law
                    which superseded, while it fulfilled, the old. It is not possible to construct a
                    scheme of Christian dogmatic from the writings of Justin, but some ideas may be
                    gathered from his <hi rend="italic">Apologies.</hi> Christ is the centre of
                    religion, and the exposition of Christian doctrine is to be grouped around a
                    description of Christ. God is the God and Father of Jesus Christ. He is the <hi
                    rend="italic">only</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">one</hi> God in opposition to
                    the polytheism of the heathen; the <hi rend="italic">unbegotten</hi> God, not
                    born and reared like Dionysus the son of Semele or Apollo son of Leto; the <hi
                    rend="italic">unspeakable</hi> God, because every thinking man knows that God’s
                    existence cannot be thought of or described. God is spiritual; He has
                    indescribable glory and shape; He is omniscient and almighty; He is creator; He
                    has made the world for man, and cares for His creatures; He is full of mercy and
                    goodness. With Justin the great fact in Christianity is that Jesus Christ is the
                    Son of God; he does not spend much time in thinking out what this means, but he
                    is one of the earliest writers who unconsciously tries to explain the
                    incarnation by the Platonic thought of the Logos. Justin, however, thinks of the
                    Logos as a personal being. The begetting of the Logos is an act of the Father’s;
                    but we cannot say when the Logos was begotten, because He was before all
                    creation, and so before all time. The Logos is the instrument through whom God
                    created and preserves the universe; He is the instrument in the miraculous
                    history of the Jews; He inspired the heathen sages; He is God; He became
                    incarnate. Justin does not seem to distinguish between the divine and human
                    natures of Christ, but he believes Christ to be man and to be God. And so on
                    with other doctrines. In Justin we see the earnest living Christianity of the 2d
                    century firmly centred on Jesus Christ, very God and very man, trying to live
                    again His life, taught by His Spirit. The faith rested in the great central
                    facts of Christianity, but the power of defining doctrine had not become
                    vigorous.</p>
                <p>No ancient writer gives a complete list of Justin’s writings; the fullest is that
                    of Eusebius <hi rend="italic">{Eccl. Hist.,</hi> iv. 18). The following, now
                    extant, have been ascribed to him :—The two <hi rend="italic">Apologies;
                    Dialogic with the Jew</hi><hi rend="italic">Trypho</hi><hi rend="italic">; A
                    Speech to the Greeks; An Address to the Greeks·, On the Sole Government of God;
                    An Epistle to Diognetus; Fragments on the Resurrection</hi>; and otheι <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> fragments. The following, now extant, and attributed
                    to Justin, are deemed spurious :— The <hi rend="italic">Exposition of the True
                    Faith; Epistle to Zenos and</hi><hi rend="italic">Serenus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >; A Refutation of Certain Doctrines of Aristotle; Questions and Answers to the
                    Orthodox; Questions of Christians to Heathens; Questions of Heathens to
                    Christians.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">First Apology</hi> is undoubtedly genuine. It refers to the
                    Jewish rebellion, 131-136, and was probably written 138-140 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Second Apology</hi> which has come down to us
                    is probably not the second apology mentioned by Eusebius, which has been lost,
                    but a portion of the first. The authenticity of the <hi rend="italic">Dialogue
                    with</hi><hi rend="italic">Trypho</hi> has been disputed by Lange, Koch,
                    Wettstein, &amp;c., but their arguments are not convincing; more interest
                    attaches to the question whether it is historical or written in imitation of the
                    dialogues of Plato; the greater weight of evidence lies on the side that it is
                    historical. The <hi rend="italic">Speech to the Greeks</hi> is probably
                    Justin’s; but the weight of evidence is against the authenticity of the
                    remaining writings.</p>
