                    Oviedo, Avila, and Alcala, and in 1767 became criminal judge at Seville. His
                    integrity and ability were rewarded in 1778 by a judgeship in Madrid, and in
                    1780 by appointment to the council of military orders. In the capital Jovellanos
                    took a good place in the literary and scientific societies; for the society of
                    Friends of the Country he wrote in 1787 his most valuable work, <hi

                    rend="italic">Ley Agraria.</hi> Involved in the disgrace of his friend, the
                    brilliant French adventurer Cabarrus, Jovellanos spent the years 1790 to 1797 in
                    a sort of banishment at Gijon, engaged in literary work and in founding the
                    Asturian institution for agricultural, industrial, social, and educational
                    reform throughout his native province. This institution continued his darling
                    project up to the latest hours of his life. Summoned again to public life in
                    1797, Jovellanos refused the post of ambassador to Russia, but accepted that of
                    minister of grace and justice, under “the Prince of the Peace,” whose attention
                    had been directed to him by Cabarrus, then a favourite of Godoy. Displeased with
                    Godoy’s policy and conduct, Jovellanos combined with his colleague Saavedra to
                    procure his dismissal. They were but temporarily successful; Godoy returned to
                    power in 1798; * Jovellanos was again sent to Gijon, but in 1801 was thrown into
                    prison in Majorca. The revolution of 1808, and the advance of the French into
                    Spain, set him once more at liberty. Joseph Bonaparte, on mounting the Spanish
                    throne, made Jovellanos the most brilliant offers; but the latter, sternly
                    refusing them all, joined the patriotic party, became a member of the central
                    junta, and contributed to reorganize the cortes. This accomplished, the junta at
                    once fell under suspicion, and Jovellanos was involved in its fall. To expose
                    the conduct of the cortes, and to defend the junta and himself were the last
                    labours of his pen. In 1811 he was enthusiastically welcomed to Gijpn; but the
                    approach of the French drove him forth again. The vessel in which he sailed was
                    compelled by stress of weather to put in at Vega in Asturias, where, on November
                    27, 1811, Jovellanos died.</p>
                <p>The poetical works of Jovellanos comprise a tragedy <hi rend="italic">Bl

                    and miscellaneous pieces, including a translation of the first book of <hi
                    rend="italic">Paradise Lost.</hi> His prose works, especially those on political
                    and legislative economy, constitute his real title to literary fame. In them
                    depth of thought and clear-sighted sagacity are couched in a certain Ciceronian
                    elegance and classical purity of style. Besides the <hi rend="italic"
