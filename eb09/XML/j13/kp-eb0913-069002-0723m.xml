                    Râwal Pindi district, E. by the Jhelum river, S. by Shâhpur district, and W. by
                    Bannu district. It forms the south-eastern portion of a rugged, Himâlayan spur,
                    extending between the Indus and Jhelum to the borders of the Sind Sâgar Doâb.
                    Its scenery is very picturesque, although not of so wild a character as the
                    mountain region of Râwal Pindi to the north, and is lighted up in places by
                    smiling patches of cultivated valley. The backbone of the district is formed by
                    the Salt Range, a treble line of parallel hills running in three long forks from
                    east to west throughout its whole breadth. The range rises in bold and striking
                    precipices, broken by gorges, <pb break="no"

                    trickling streams, at first pure and fresh, but soon impregnated with the saline
                    matter over which they pass. Between the line of hills lies a picturesque
                    table-land, in which the beautiful little lake of Kallar Kahâr nestles amongst
                    the minor ridges. North of the Salt Range, the country extends upwards in an
                    elevated plateau, diversified by countless ravines and fissures, until it loses
                    itself in the tangled masses of the Râwal Pindi mountains. In this rugged tract
                    cultivation is rare and difficult, the soil being choked with saline matter. At
                    the foot of the Salt Hills, however, lies a small strip of level soil, lying
                    along the banks of the Jhelum, and thickly dotted with prosperous villages. The
                    drainage of the district is determined by a low central watershed running north
                    and south at right angles to the Salt Range. The waters of the western portion
                    find their way into the Sohân, and finally into the Indus; those of the opposite
                    slope collect themselves into small torrents, and empty themselves into the
                    Jhelum.</p>
                <p>The census of 1868 returned the population of Jhelum district at 500,988,
                    inhabiting 113,010 houses, and spread over an area of 3910 square miles. The
                    Mahometans numbered 434,157; Hindus, 49, 111; Sikhs, 13,865; and “others,” 3855.
                    Five towns contained in 1868 a population exceeding 5000 :—Find Dädan Khan,
                    15,740; Chakwal, 5767; Talâgang, 5767; Lawa, 5256; and Jhelum, 5148. Of a total
                    area of 2,502,290 acres, but 763,845 acres are under cultivation, and only
                    258,825 acres more are returned as capable of tillage. The staple crops are
                    wheat and <hi rend="italic">bâjra.</hi> Trade is chiefly concentrated in the
                    town of Find Dadau Kham The exports are salt, silk and cotton goods, brass and
                    copper wares; the imports, English piece goods and metals, and woollen fabrics
                    from Kashmir and from Central Asia <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Peshawar. Salt is
                    procured in immense quantities from the central hills of the Salt Range; the net
                    revenue from this source in 1871-72 amounted to £362,193. The total revenue in
                    .1872-73, excluding salt, was £70,299, of which £59,766 was derived from the
                    land tax. The police force consisted in 1873 of 527 men. For fiscal and
                    administrative purposes the district is subdivided into 4 <hi rend="italic"
                    >tahsils</hi> and <hi rend="italic">V par</hi><hi rend="italic">garnis,</hi>
                    containing 939 estates, and owned by 49,866 proprietors.</p>
                <p>The history of the district dates back from the semi-mythical period of the <hi
                    rend="italic">MahΛbhcιrata.</hi> Hindu tradition represents the Salt Range as
                    the refuge of the five Pandava brethren during the period of their exile, and
                    every salient point in its scenery is connected with some legend of the national
                    heroes. Modern research has fixed the site of the conflict between Alexander and
                    Porus as within Jhelum district, although the exact point at which the
                    Macedonian king effected the passage of the Jhelum (or Hydaspes) is disputed.
                    After this event, we have little information with regard to the condition of the
                    district until the Mahometan conquest brought back literature and history to
                    Upper India. The Janjιiahs and Jâts, who now hold the Salt Range and its
                    northern plateau respectively, appear to have been the earliest inhabitants. The
                    Ghakkars seem to represent an early wave of conquest from the east, and they
                    still inhabit the whole eastern slope of the district; while the Awans, who now
                    cluster in the western plain, are apparently later invaders from the opposite
                    quarter. The Ghakkars were the dominant race at the period of the first
                    Mahometan incursions, and long continued to retain their independence. During
                    the flourishing period of the Mughal dynasty, the Ghakkar chieftains were among
                    the most prosperous and loyal vassals of the house of Babar; but after the
                    collapse of the Delhi empire Jhelum fell, like its neighbours, under the sway of
                    the Sikhs. In 1765 Gujar Sinh defeated the last independent Ghakkar prince, and
                    reduced the wild mountaineers to subjection. His son succeeded to his dominions,
                    until 1810, when he fell before the irresistible power of Ranjit Sinh. In 1849
                    the district passed, with the rest of the Sikh territories, into the hands of
                    the British. Ranjit Sinh, however, had so thoroughly subjugated the wild
                    mountain tribes that little difficulty was experienced in reducing it to working
                    order, and the subsequent history of Jhelum has been purely fiscal and
                    administrative.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Jhelum,</hi> the headquarters of the above district,

                    origin, and in 1868 contained a population of 5148, viz., Mahometans, 2831;

                    cantonments for a regiment of native infantry lie about a mile north of the
                    town, which is noted for boat building.</p>
