                    he was not an apostle (ver. 17), and with this agrees the statement (John vii.
                    5) that at a time not long before the crucifixion the brethren of Jesus did not
                    believe on Him. And it is some confirmation of this position that the writer of
                    the epistle of St James in like manner does not claim to be an apostle. The
                    brethren of the Lord are spoken of in Acts i. 14 as distinct from the apostolic
                    body, and are placed last in the enumeration, as though latest included among
                    the believers; and that their feeling towards Jesus should have been changed
                    since His death and resurrection has been thought to be sufficiently explained
                    by the assertion of St Paul (1 Cor. xv, 7) that the Lord had been “seen of
                    James” on one special occasion after he had risen from the dead. We conclude
                    therefore that the writer of the epistle was a different person from Jude the
                    apostle, who appears also to have had the names Lebbaeus and Thaddaeus (comp.
                    Matt. X. 3, Mark iii. 18, with Luke vi. 16, Acts i. 13).</p>
                <p>When we consider the brevity of St Jude’s epistle we can hardly wonder that it
                    did not receive more recognition from the early Christian writers than it has
                    met with. Clemens Alexandrinus (165-220) quotes from this epistle or alludes to
                    its language more than once, as does Tertullian (200), making express mention
                    that the book of Enoch is quoted in it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The book of Enoch (see vol. ii. p. 175) is cited in Jude 14,
                    and allusions to it occur in 4, 6, 13. Another apocalyptic work, the Assumption
                    of Moses, is the source of Jude 9.</p></note> Origen (186-253) gives several
                    notices of it, and in the Latin translation of some portions of his works, of
                    which the original has been lost, Jude is called an apostle. Nevertheless
                    Eusebius classes the epistle amongst the αντιλεγόμενα, and its omission from the
                    Syriac version shows us that in one branch of the Christian church it was either
                    not known, or not received for canonical, when that version was made. Jerome in
                    the 4th century <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0795-0762"/> gives a reason for its non-acceptance, which
                    perhaps operated with many of the early Christians. He says <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Catalog. Scr. Eccl.,</hi> 4), “Because in it Jude derives a testimony from the
                    book of Enoch, which is apocryphal, it is rejected by most.” Yet the canon of
                    Muratori, the date of which is judged to be about 170 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> includes the epistle of St Jude among the canonical books, though
                    Justin Martyr (140), Theophilus of Antioch (180), and Irenaeus (135-200) make no
                    mention of it. It was early included among the acknowledged Christian writings,
                    and was placed without question among the canonical books by the council of
                    Laodicea.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Many modern
                    critics, following Luther, have questioned the genuineness of the epistle. The
                    libertines against whom it is directed display close affinity to the
                    Carpocratians of the 2d century, of whose heresy Clemens Alexandrinus makes it a
                    prophecy. Mayerhoff, Schenkel, and Mangold suppose that it was written against
                    that heresy not long before the middle of the 2d century. It is also argued that
                    the Muratorian canon seems to regard the epistle as pseudonymous in the same
                    sense as the Wisdom of Solomon.</p></note></p>
                <p>The persons to whom the epistle was addressed must have been for the most part
                    Judaeo-Christians. This is the reason why the writer styles himself “brother of
                    James,” and the same is apparent from all the illustrations contained in the
                    letter. The deliverance from Egypt, the fallen angels, the cities of the plain,
                    the legend of Michael’s contention with Satan, the references to Cain, Balaam,
                    and Korah, as well as to the prophecy ascribed to Enoch, are all found in so
                    brief a space, and are so touched upon in a manner that could be edifying to
                    none save those who were familiar, not only with Old Testament Scripture, but
                    also with Jewish traditions, that we cannot but conclude that we have here the
                    work of a Jew writing for Jews, although the epistle is included among those
                    called “catholic.”</p>
                <p>From the notices of the descendants of Jude, the brother of the Lord, preserved
                    by Eusebius <hi rend="italic">(H. E.,</hi> iii. 19, 20) from Hegesippus, we
                    should conclude that they were resident in Palestine. It seems natural therefore
                    to suppose that the epistle was written in Palestine, and, it may be, for the
                    Jewish converts in some district of that country. But of this we can have no
                    certainty. If, as seems to be intimated by Hegesippus, Jude was dead in the time
                    of Domitian, we perhaps shall not be far wrong in assigning the composition of
                    the epistle to about 80 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> All arguments for an
                    earlier date, based on the assumption that in a letter of this character the
                    writer would not have failed to mention the destruction of Jerusalem as an
                    illustration, had that event already taken place, must be disregarded. For the
                    brevity of the letter is such as to deprive this reasoning of all force, while
                    the very recentness of the overthrow of Jerusalem would prevent its destruction
                    from entering as yet into such history as might be used for pointing a
                    moral.</p>
                <p>The epistle of St Jude appears to have been written after the second epistle of
                    St Peter. Of those corrupt teachers about whom St Peter spoke in the future
                    tense, “there shall be false teachers among you,” St Jude speaks in the past,
                    “certain men are crept in unawares and the like difference is observable
                    throughout the respective letters wherever verbs occur to which it is possible
                    to attach a definite notion of time. But, beside this, St Peter’s letter
                    represents all the corruption which he sees likely to break forth among the
                    Christian community as the outcome of false teaching. Destructive heresies are
                    abroad, and through them many shall be induced to follow lascivious doings, and
                    the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. With a promise of liberty which sounds
                    like a perverse employment of some of St Paul’s language they will lead their
                    followers astray. But in St Jude’s picture the colours seem much darker, and all
                    allusions to teaching, and to the idea that, by lessons such as we know from
                    other sources the Gnostics did give, these men were being beguiled into evil
                    courses through what appeared to be the gate of greater knowledge, have
                    disappeared. The sinners against whom this epistle is directed were avowed
                    libertines and practical unbelievers; they mocked at all sacred things; they
                    were sensual, and had not the Spirit. But stronger than any other reason for
                    believing in the later date of the present epistle is the direct quotation which
                    is made in it from the 2d epistle of St Peter. In verses 17-18 St Jude writes,
                    “But ye, beloved, remember ye the words which have been spoken before by the
                    apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ, how that they said to you, In the last time
                    there shall be mockers (e∕Λτrα7κται) walking after their own ungodly lusts.” The
                    whole of what is here given as apostolic teaching corresponds very closely
                    indeed with the words of 2 Peter iii. 2, while the word εp,τrαικται is one that
                    is found nowhere else in the New Testament until it is here quoted by St
                    Jude.</p>
                <p>Attempts have been made to prove that St Jude’s epistle originally appeared in
                    Aramaic, from which the Greek that we have is a translation. But there seems no
                    sufficient evidence for such a conclusion. No doubt a Jew when writing Greek
                    would not unfrequently give expression to his thoughts in a form more or less
                    moulded after his mother tongue, but there are far more points in the epistle
                    which are satisfactory Greek of the date of the New Testament than are the
                    instances which, even after much ingenuity, can be shown to be renderings of
                    Aramaic.</p>
