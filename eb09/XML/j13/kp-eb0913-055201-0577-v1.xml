                <p><label type="entry">JAMES</label> (’Ιάκωβος). This name, the Hebrew <hi
                        rend="italic">Yakob</hi> or Jacob, belongs to several persons mentioned in
                    the New Testament, of whom the first that appears in the Gospels is</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">James the son of Zebedee.</hi> He was among the first who
                    were called to be Christ’s immediate followers and afterwards chosen to be his
                    apostles, and is one—the others being Peter, Andrew, and John (the brother of
                    James)—of the always first-mentioned and, as the narrative shows, most
                    remarkable group of the apostolic band. In all the enumerations of the twelve
                    (Matt. x. 2; Mark iii. 17; Luke vi. 14; Acts i. 13), his name appears early in
                    the list, twice occupying the second place after Peter’s. The call of James and
                    John (the fullest account of which is given in Luke v. 1-11; comp. Mark i. 20)
                    took place on the same occasion when Peter and Andrew, the other pair of
                    brothers, were taken from their humble fisher’s trade to be fishers of men.
                    After this we next find James noticed as one of the persons present (Mark i. 29)
                    when Jesus restored Simon Peter’s wife’s mother, who was sick of a fever.</p>
                <p>His brother and he were surnamed by our Lord (Mark iii. 17) “Boanerges,” a name
                    derived from two Aramaic words signifying “Sons of thunder,” as it is
                    interpreted by the evangelist. The name has been explained as having reference
                    to the powers of their eloquence in preaching, or even from their being present
                    when the voice like thunder spake to Jesus from the cloud (John xii. 29). It is
                    more probable, especially as one meaning of the word translated “thunder” is
                    “rage, anger,” that the name was given to them by the Lord because he perceived
                    the fiery impetuosity of their nature. Two instances (Luke ix. 54; Mark x.
                    32-41) are recorded in the Gospels from which we can discern somewhat of this
                    character of the sons of Zebedee.</p>
                <p>James is included among those who after the ascension waited at Jerusalem (Acts
                    i. 13) for the descent of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost. This is one of
                    the passages in which the name of James is placed before those of John and
                    Andrew, and we may judge from the little that we are told of him subsequently
                    that he was a most zealous and prominent member of the Christian community. For
                    when a victim is to be chosen from among the apostles who should be sacrificed
                    to the animosity of the Jews, it is on James that the blow falls first. The
                    brief notice is given Acts xii. 1, 2: “Now about that time Herod [Agrippa I.]
                    the king put forth his hands to afflict certain of the church. And he killed
                    James the brother of John with the sword.”</p>
                <p>Eusebius (∕∕. <hi rend="italic">E.,</hi> ii. 9) has preserved for us from
                    •Clement of Alexandria the circumstance that the accuser of the apostle,
                    “beholding his confession and moved thereby, confessed that he too was a
                    Christian. So they were both led away to execution together, and on the road the
                    accuser asked James for forgiveness. Gazing on him for a little while, he said,
                        <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Peace be with thee,’ and kissed him. And then
                    both were beheaded together.” Other legends which tell of the apostle’s
                    preaching in Spain, and of the translation of his body to Compostella, are to be
                    found in the <hi rend="italic">Acta Sanctorum,</hi> July 25 (vol. vi. pp.
                    1-124),</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">James the son of</hi><hi rend="italic">Alphaeus.</hi> He
                    also was one of the apostles, and is mentioned in all the four lists (Matt. x.
                    3; Mark iii. 18; Luke vi. 15; Acts i. 13) by this name, but in no other place.
                    It is, however, thought by some that he is the same with</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">James the Lords brother.</hi> In Matt. xiii. 55 and Mark vi.
                    3 the brethren of the Lord are named James, Joses, Judas, and Simon. It is also
                    to be remarked that they are in both places spoken of as the children of the
                    carpenter, that is, of Joseph the husband of the Virgin Mary. But it has been
                    urged that they were called sons of Joseph and Mary because the children of two
                    families,— of Mary the Virgin and Mary the wife of Clopas, her half sister,—were
                    brought up together. Those who in this way make James the Lord’s brother to be a
                    son of Alphaeus require to establish (a) that Clopas is the same name as
                    Alphaeus, (δ) that Mary the wife of Clopas (John xix. 25) was the sister of the
                    Virgin Mary, and (c) that this Mary, wife of Clopas, is the same who is called
                    (Matt, xxvi. 56; Mark xv. 40) Mary the mother of James and Joses, and (Mark.
                    xvi. 1; Luke xxiv. 10) simply the mother of James, in which four passages the
                    same person is evidently intended. But the identity of the names Alphaeus and
                    Clopas is by no means certain. Those who maintain it take Clopas as the Aramaic
                    Chalpai, and Alphaeus to be a Graecized form thereof. But when we turn to what
                    might be supposed the best source of evidence on this point, viz., the Peshito
                    version of the New Testament, instead of finding the two names treated as the
                    same word, we find in all cases Chalpai where the Greek has Alphaeus, and where
                    Clopas or Cleopas occurs, it is simply transliterated Kleopha. The same is the
                    case with the Jerusalem Syriac. The identity of these names is thus far from
                    being established. Then in John xix. 25 the versions and best authorities are in
                    favour of making four persons of those there mentioned: “his mother, and his
                    mother’s sister, and Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.” This is the
                    Peshito rendering, and, even if the conjunction were not there, it is not
                    uncommon in Scriptural enumeration to find names given in pairs without any
                    conjunction, while to make Mary the wife of Clopas the Virgin’s sister would be
                    to assume two Maries in the same family of sisters, which is not very probable.
                    Whether Mary wife of Clopas was the mother of a James (called in one place “the
                    little ”) and of Joses can neither be asserted nor denied from the evidence in
                    the Gospels; but, when the other two assumptions have so little foundation to
                    rest on, it seems impossible to consider the son of Alphaeus the same person
                    with the “brother of the Lord.”</p>
                <p>Further, James the Lord’s brother was bishop of Jerusalem (comp. Gal. i. 19 with
                    Gal. ii. 9-12), and was president of the church in its earliest days (Acts xii.
                    17, xv. 13, xxi. 18). Such a position required him to be a resident in
                    Jerusalem, while had he been an apostle (as the son of Alphaeus was) we should
                    have expected him to take his share of the missionary labour of publishing the
                    gospel in distant lands. But this bishop of Jerusalem was the author of the
                    epistle of St James. He simply styles himself in the introduction thereto “a
                    servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.” He who could thus write with the
                    certainty of being identified must have been the most famous person of his name
                    in the church, must have been what St Paul, in a passage (Gal. ii. 9) where he
                    places James before both Peter and John, calls him, “a pillar” of the Christian
                    society. And again Jude, when commencing his epistle, calls himself the brother
                    of James, with no other mark of distinction. Here too the same <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n578/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0913-0578-0553"/> James must be intended, and when we read St
                    Jude’s epistle (17, 18) we find him distinguishing himself from the apostles,
                    and as it were disclaiming the apostolic dignity. This is as it would be if
                    James and Jude were both brethren of the Lord and were not apostles, but we
                    should certainly expect one or other would have left some indication in their
                    letters had they been of the number of the twelve, and most surely neither of
                    them would have been likely to give us reason for believing that he was not an
                    apostle.</p>
                <p>Tlιe two passages (1 Cor. xv. 7; Gal. i. 19) from which it might be argued that
                    James the brother of the Lord was an apostle cannot be relied on, for we find
                    the same title given to Barnabas, and it is certain that the name “apostle”
                    began to be more widely applied after the ascension than it is in the
                    Gospels.</p>
                <p>Once more, the brethren of the Lord are expressly said (John vii. 5) not to have
                    believed on Jesus at a period much later in his ministry than the appointment of
                    the twelve; while in the mention of them in Acts i. 14 there is given first a
                    list of the eleven, who are said all to have “continued in prayer with the women
                    and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brethren.” Such a studied severance of
                    the brethren of the Lord from the number of the apostles is very significant,
                    while the position which they hold in the list may well be due to the fact that
                    it was only at a late period that they had become disciples of Jesus. The change
                    in their opinions has been thought by many to be sufficiently accounted for by
                    the statement of St Paul (1 Cor. XV. 7) that after his resurrection Jesus “was
                    seen of Janies.” Such a demonstration of the truth of what others had long
                    believed and Jesus himself had taught could not fail to work conviction on a
                    mind which, if we may accept the tradition of the “Gospel according to the
                    Hebrews ' <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> (which also testifies to this
                    appearance of Christ to James), was somewhat inclined to believe, even before
                    the crucifixion.</p>
                <p>It seems right therefore to conclude that James the son of Alphaeus, one of the
                    apostles, was a different person from James the Lord’s brother and bishop of
                    Jerusalem. Of the history of the former we are told nothing except that he was
                    an apostle. The latter is spoken of by St Peter (Acts xii. 17) as if he were at
                    that time the recognized head of the Christian community in Jerusalem. Again
                    (Acts XV. 13), after the debate at Jerusalem about the circumcision of the
                    Gentiles, it is he who sums up the arguments and declares the sentence of the
                    council, as if he were the chief person among them. In Acts xxi. 18, on St
                    Paul’s last visit to Jerusalem, he holds the same position, and receives the
                    visit of St Paul in the presence of all the presbyters. In Gal. i. 19, ii. 9 he
                    is placed foremost among “the pillars” of the church of Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>From the New Testament we learn no more of the history of James the Lord’s
                    brother, but Eusebius <hi rend="italic">(H. E.,</hi> ii. 23) has preserved for
                    us from Hegesippus the earliest ecclesiastical traditions concerning him. By
                    that authority he is described as having been a Nazarite, and on account of his
                    eminent righteousness called “Just” and “Oblias.” So great was his influence
                    with the people that he was appealed to by the scribes and Pharisees for a true
                    and (as they hoped) unfavourable judgment about the Messiahship of Christ.
                    Placed, to give the greater publicity to his words, on a pinnacle of the temple,
                    he, when solemnly appealed to, made confession of his faith, and was at once
                    thrown down and murdered. This happened immediately before the siege. Josephus
                        <hi rend="italic">(Antiq.,</hi> xx. 9, 1) tells that it was by order of
                    Ananus the high priest, in the interval between the death of Festus and the
                    arrival of his successor Albinus, that James was put to death; and his narrative
                    gives the idea of some sort of judicial examination, for he says that along with
                    some others James was brought before an assembly of judges, by whom they were
                    condemned and delivered to be stoned.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Other less important bearers of this name are (4) James, of whom all we know is
                    that he was the “son of Mary” (Matt, xxviii. 56; Mark xv. 40, xvi. 1; Luke xxiv.
                    10) and the brother of a certain Joses (comp. Mark xv. 40 with xvi. 1), and that
                    he is called “the little,” ό <hi rend="italic">μικρός</hi> (A. V. “the less,”
                    wrongly); and (5) James, who was either the father or brother of Judas, one of
                    the apostles. The Greek gives (Luke vi. 16; Acts i. 13) “Judas of James.” The
                    ellipsis may, as has been shown by Winer, be supplied either by the word
                    “father” or “brother.” The A. V. supplies “brother.” But, as in both these lists
                    within a line of the name of this Judas a similar form “James of Alphaeus”
                    occurs, which is in both places rendered James the “son” of Alphaeus, as it is
                    also in both the other lists of the apostles in St Matthew and St Mark, it seems
                    natural to suppose that the evangelists intended the same noun to be supplied in
                    both cases. If this be so, the James here mentioned would be a person otherwise
                    unknown, but the father of the apostle Judas, who is distinguished as Lebbaeus
                    and Thaddens, and also by St John (xiv. 22) as “Judas not Iscariot.”</p>
