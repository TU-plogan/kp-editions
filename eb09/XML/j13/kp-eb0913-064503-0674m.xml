                    50" and 23° 47' N. lat., and between 88° 57' 33" and 90° 0' 13" E. long., with
                    an area (1878) of 3658 square miles, forms the eastern portion of the presidency
                    division. It is bounded on the N. and W. by Nadiyâ district, on the S. by the
                    Sundarbans, and on the E. by the district of Faridpur.</p>
                <p>Jessor forms the central portion of the delta between the Hooghly and the united
                    Ganges and Brahmaputra. It is a vast alluvial plain intersected by rivers and
                    watercourses, which at places in the southern portion of the district spread out
                    into large marshes. The northern part of the district is verdant, with extensive
                    groves of date-palms; villages are numerous and large; and the people are
                    prosperous. In the central portion the population is sparse, the only part of
                    the tract suitable for dwellings being the high land ∣&gt;n the banks of rivers.
                    The principal rivers of Jessor are the Madhumati (which forms the eastern
                    boundary of the district), with its tributaries the Nabagangâ, Chitra, and
                    Bhairab; the Kumar, Kabadak, Katki, Harihar, Bhadrâ, and Athârâbânkâ. Within the
                    last century the rivers in the interior of Jessor have ceased to be true deltaic
                    rivers; and, whereas the northern portion of the district formerly lay under
                    water for several months every year, it is now reached only by unusual
                    inundations. The tide reaches as far north as the latitude of Jessor town.</p>
                <p>The population of Jessor in 1872 numbered 2,075,021, of whom 1,051,126 were males
                    and 1,023,895 females. The inhabitants of the district are all Bengalis; the
                    better classes are Hindus, the lower orders being principally Mahometans. The
                    Hindus number 915,413, the Musalmâns 1,151,936, and the Christians 1142. The
                    Brahma Samâj has a few adherents. Among the lower ranks, the fishing and boating
                    castes deserve attention, the fisheries in the rivers and deeper swamps being
                    very valuable, and the right to fish being a regular tenure paid for like the
                    right to cultivate land. Jessor is noted for a colony of pure Kulin Brahmans,
                    who live at Lakshmipâsâ, a village on the Nabagangâ. These Kulins trace their
                    origin to Ramânand Chakrabartti, who five generations ago emigrated from
                    Sarmangal in Bâkarganj, a great Kulin settlement. The only place with a
                    population exceeding 5000 is Jessor town, which has 8152.</p>
                <p>The principal staple in Jessor is rice; among other crops are barley, Indian
                    corn, pease, mustard, jute, tobacco, potatoes, sugarcane, indigo, <hi
                    rend="italic">pan,</hi> dates, &amp;c. The total cultivated area is about
                    1,381,800 acres, more than a million of which arc said to be under rice. The
                    estimated area covered by date-palms for the manufacture of sugar is 17,500
                    acres. The area under indigo is 31,333 acres. The total produce in 1872-73 was
                    203 tons, valued at £114,400. There are about fifty-five European factories,
                    besides fifty worked in the interest of native proprietors under European or
                    native management. Blights occur occasionally. The district is subject to heavy
                    floods, which have sometimes been immediately-followed by disastrous cyclones.
                    Several inundations have taken place, causing famine.</p>
                <p>The trade of Jessor is carried on chiefly by means of permanent markets, but
                    there is also a considerable traffic at the numerous fairs and religious
                    gatherings held throughout the district. The chief exports are sugar, indigo,
                    rice, pulse, timber, honey, shells, &amp;c.; the chief imports are salt, English
                    goods, and cloth. The principal manufactures are date-sugar and indigo. The
                    police-force consisted in 1871 of 590 officers and men, maintained at a cost of
                    £13,548. In 1871 the number of Government and aided schools was 390, with 12,349
                    pupils. The climate does not differ from that of the other districts of Lower
                    Bengal. April, May, and June are very trying, their average mean temperature
                    being 83 <hi rend="superscript"> o-</hi> 6 Fahr. The average rainfall is about
                    65 inches. Malarious diseases are very prevalent, intermittent fever being
                    common throughout the year. Cholera breaks out every hot season.</p>
                <p>British administration was completely established in the district in 1781, when
                    the governor-general ordered the opening of a court at Murali near Jessor.
                    Before that, however, the fiscal administration of the district had been in the
                    hands of the English, having been transferred to the East India Company with
                    that of the rest of Bengal in 1765. The changes in jurisdiction in Jessor have
                    been very numerous. After many transfers and rectifications, the district was in
                    1863 finally constituted as it at present stands. The rajas of Jessor or
                    Chânchrâ trace their origin to Bhâbeswar Râi, a soldier in the army of
                    Khan-i-Azam, an imperial general, who deprived Râjâ Pratâpâditya, the popular
                    hero of the Sundarbans, of several fiscal divisions, and conferred them on
                    Bhâbeswar. But Manohar Râi (1649-1705) is regarded as the principal founder of
                    the family. The estate when he inherited it was of moderate size, but he
                    acquired one parganâ after another, until, at his death, the property was by far
                    the largest in the neighbourhood.</p>
