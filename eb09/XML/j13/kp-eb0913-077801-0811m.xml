                    (1545-1602), in French François du Jon, Huguenot divine and writer, was born of
                    good family at Bourges, in France, May 1, 1545. He was a precocious child, and
                    had studied law for two years under Donellus, when a place in the retinue of the
                    French ambassador to Constantinople was procured for him in his fifteenth year.
                    Before he reached Lyons, where he was to join the ambassador, the latter had
                    departed; but Junius, scarcely disappointed, found ample consolation in the
                    better opportunities for study to be found at Lyons. A religious tumult warned
                    the young Huguenot back to Bourges, where the judicious piety of his father not
                    only won him from certain atheistic principles that he had imbibed at Lyons, but
                    also inspired him with the desire of entering the church. To that end he went to
                    study at Geneva, where he was reduced to the direst straits of poverty by the
                    failure of remittances from home, owing to civil war in France. His pride or
                    independence allowed him to accept only the barest sustenance from a humble
                    friend who had himself been a protégé of Junius’s family at Bourges, and his
                    health was permanently injured by the weakness to which he was reduced. The
                    long-expected remittance from home was closely followed by the news of the
                    brutal murder of his father at Issoudun; and Junius resolved to remain at
                    Geneva, where his reputation for learning now enabled him to find support by
                    teaching. In 1565, however, he was appointed minister of the Walloon
                    congregation at Antwerp. His foreign birth excluded him from the privileges of
                    the native Reformed pastors, and exposed him to the persecutions of Margaret of
                    Parma, governess of the Netherlands. Several times he barely escaped arrest, and
                    finally, after spending six months in preaching at Limburg, he was forced to
                    retire to Heidelberg in 1567. There he was welcomed by the elector Frederick,
                    and temporarily settled in charge of a church at Schönau; but in 1568 his patron
                    sent him as chaplain with the prince of Orange in his unfortunate expedition to
                    the Netherlands. Junius escaped as soon as he could from that post, and
                    returning to his church remained there till 1573. From 1573 till 1578 he was at
                    Heidelberg, "assisting Tremellius in his Latin version of the Old Testament,
                    which appeared at Frankfort in 1579; and after two and a half years distributed
                    between Neustadt and Otterburg he was appointed to the chair of divinity at
                    Heidelberg. Thence in a short time he was taken to France by the duke of
                    Bouillon, and after an interview with Henry IV. was sent again to Germany on a
                    mission. As he was returning to France, he was named professor of theology at
                    Leyden. In that office, which he filled with success and popularity, he died
                    October 13, 1602. Junius was a learned and pious man, and in that age of
                    illiberal theologians was distinguished for his liberality. He was several times
                    married; “quatuor uxores,” he naively expresses himself in his autobiography,
                    “duxi <hi rend="italic">hactenusf</hi></p>
                <p>He was a voluminous writer on theological subjects, and translated and composed
                    many exegetical works. He is best known from his own edition of the Latin Old
                    Testament, slightly altered from the former joint edition, and with a version of
                    the New Testament added (Geneva, 1590; Hanover, 1624). The <hi rend="italic"
