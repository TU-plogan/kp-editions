                    Hanover Square, London, in 1801, and was educated at Greenwich and afterwards in
                    France. He began to write early, and had, according to his own account, composed
                    the stories afterwards published as <hi rend="italic">A String of Pearls</hi>
                    before he was seventeen. Contributing plentifully to newspapers and magazines,
                    he came under the notice of Washington Irving, who is said to have encouraged
                    him to produce (in 1822) his <hi rend="italic">Life of Edward the Black
                    Prince.</hi> His next attempt was <hi rend="italic">Richelieu,</hi> which was
                    finished in 1825, and was well thought of by Sir Walter Scott (who apparently
                    saw it in manuscript), but was not brought out till 1829. Perhaps Irving and
                    Scott, from their natural amiability and invariable habit of encouraging
                    literary aspirants, were rather dangerous advisers for a writer so well inclined
                    by nature to abundant production as James. But he took up the ball of historical
                    romance writing at a lucky moment. Scott had firmly established the popularity
                    of the style, and James in England, like Dumas in France, reaped the reward of
                    their masters’ labours as well as of their own. For thirty years the author of
                    <hi rend="italic">Richelieu</hi> continued to pour out novels of the same kind
                    though of varying merit. The full list of his works in prose fiction, verse
                    narrative, and history of an easy kind includes between seventy and eighty
                    items, most of them being three-volume novels of the usual length. The best
                    examples of his style are perhaps <hi rend="italic">Richelieu,</hi> 1829; <hi
                    rend="italic">Philip Augustus,</hi> 1831 <hi rend="italic">; Henry
                    Masterton</hi> (probably the best of all), 1832 <hi rend="italic">; Mary of
                    Burgundy,</hi> 1833; <hi rend="italic">Darnley,</hi> 1839 <hi rend="italic">;
                    Corse</hi><hi rend="italic">de Léon,</hi> 1841; <hi rend="italic">The
                    Smuggler,</hi> 1845. His poetry does not require special mention, nor does his
                    history, though for a short time in the reign of William IV. he held the office
                    of historiographer royal. After writing vigorously in all these styles for about
                    twenty years, James in 1850 went to America with his family. He was appointed
                    consul at Richmond, Virginia, and held that post from 1852 to 1858. In September
                    of the latter year he was appointed to a similar post at Venice, where he died
                    May 9, 1860. -</p>
                <p>James has been compared to Dumas, and the comparison holds good in respect of
                    kind, though by no means in respect of degree of merit. Both had a certain gift
                    of separating from the picturesque parts of history what could without much
                    difficulty be worked up into picturesque fiction, and both were possessed of a
                    ready pen. Here, however, the likeness ends. Of purely literary talent James had
                    little. His plots are poor, his descriptions weak, his dialogue often below even
                    a fair average, and he was deplorably prone to repeat himself. His “two
                    cavaliers” who in one form or another open most of his books have passed into a
                    proverb, and Thackeray’s good-natured but fatal parody of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Barbazure</hi> is likely to outlast <hi rend="italic">Richelieu</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Darnley</hi> by many a year. Nevertheless, though James cannot be
                    allowed any very high rank even among the second class of novelists, the
                    generation that read him, and those chiefly youthful persons who read him now
                    and will read him for some time to come so long as he is attainable on the
                    bookstalls, are not wholly without excuse. He had a considerable portion of the
                    narrative gift, and, though his very best books fall far below <hi rend="italic"
                    >Les trois Mousquetaires</hi> and <hi rend="italic">La Reine</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Margot,</hi> there is a certain even level of interest, such as it
                    is, to be found in all of them. James never resorted to illegitimate methods to
                    attract readers, and deserves such credit as may be due to a purveyor of
                    amusement to the public who never caters for the less creditable tastes of his
                    guests.</p>
