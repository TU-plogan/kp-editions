                    appear to have been among the very first objects on which the invention and
                    ingenuity of man were exercised; and there is no record of any people so rude as
                    not to employ some kind of personal decoration. Natural objects, such as small
                    shells, dried berries, small perforated stones, feathers of variegated colours,
                    were combined by stringing or tying together to ornament the head, neck, arms,
                    and legs, the fingers, and even the toes, whilst the cartilages of the nose and
                    ears were frequently perforated for the more ready suspension of suitable
                    ornaments.</p>
                <p>Amongst modern Oriental nations we find almost every kind of personal decoration,
                    from the simple caste mark on the forehead of the Hindu to the gorgeous examples
                    of beaten gold and silver work of the various cities and provinces of India. Nor
                    are such decorations mere ornaments without use or meaning. The hook with its
                    corresponding perforation or eye, the clasp, the buckle, the button, grew step
                    by step into a special ornament, according to the rank, means, taste, and wants
                    of the wearer, or became an evidence of the dignity of office. That these
                    ornaments were considered to have some representative purpose even after death
                    is abundantly proved; for it is in truth to the tombs of the various ancient
                    peoples that we must look for evidence of the early existence of the jeweller’s
                    art.</p>
                <p>That the Ass*yrians used personal decorations of a very distinct character, and
                    possibly made of precious materials, is proved by the bas reliefs. In the
                    British Museum we have a representation of Samsi Vul IV., king of Assyria (825
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> He wears a cross (Plate XL fig. 1) very similar
                    to the Maltese cross of modern times. The still more ancient Egyptian jewellery
                    is distinctly brought before us by the objects themselves, placed with the
                    embalmed bodies of the former wearers in sarcophagi, only to be opened in our
                    own time. The most remarkable collection of Egyptian art in this direction is to
                    be found in the jewellery taken from the coffin of Queen Aah-hotep, discovered
                    by M. Mariette in the entrance to the valley of the Tombs of the Kings in 1859,
                    and now preserved in the Bûlâk museum. In these objects we find the same
                    ingenuity and perfect mastery of the materials as characterize the monumental
                    work of the Egyptians. Hammered work, incised and chased work, the evidence of
                    soldering, the combination of layers of gold plates, together with coloured
                    stones, are all there,—the handicraft being complete in every respect.</p>

                <p>A diadem of gold and enamel, found at the back of the head of the mummy of the
                    queen (fig. 2), was fixed in the back hair, showing the cartouche in front. The
                    box holding this cartouche has on the upper surface the titles of the king, “the
                    son of the sun, Aahmes, living for ever and ever,” in gold on a ground of lapis
                    lazuli, with a chequered ornament in blue and red pastes, and a sphinx couchant
                    on each side. A necklace of the order or decoration of the Fly (fig. 3) is
                    entirely of gold, having a hook and loop to fasten it round the neck. A small
                    porcelain cylinder (fig. 4) is ornamented with interlaced lotus flowers in
                    intaglio, having a ring for suspension, and fig. 5 is a gold drop, inlaid with
                    turquoise or blue paste, in the shape of a fig. A gold chain (fig. 7) is formed
                    of wires closely plaited and very flexible, the ends terminating in the heads of
                    water fowl, and having small rings to secure the collar behind. To the centre is
                    suspended by a small ring a scarabeus of solid gold inlaid with lapis lazuli.
                    These scarabei were in constant use in Egyptian ornaments, and were worn in
                    rings by the military caste. We have an example of a bracelet, similar to those
                    in modern use (fig. 6), and worn by all persons of rank. It is formed of two
                    pieces joined by a hinge, and is decorated with figures in repoussé with a
                    ground inlaid with lapis lazuli. A signet ring (fig. 8) has a square revolving
                    bezel on which are four serpents interlaced.</p>
                <p>The discoveries of Dr Schliemann at Mycenae and at Hissarlik, the assumed site of
                    ancient Troy, supply further illustrations of ancient jewellery and gold work.
                    In extent and in the wonderful character of the design and workmanship, the
                    relics found at Mycenae present the most perfect examples, although some of the
                    objects brought from the “burnt city” at Hissarlik give evidence of singular
                    skill and ingenuity in the methods of combining the various portions of an
                    ornament and finesse in working the gold. From Mycenae the objects ranged over
                    most of the personal ornaments still in use: necklaces with gold beads and
                    pendants, butterflies (fig. 16), cuttlefish (fig. 10), single and concentric
                    circles, rosettes, and leafage, with perforations for attachment to clothing,
                    crosses (fig. 9), and stars formed of combined crosses, with crosses in the
                    centre forming spikes,—all elaborately ornamented in detail. The spiral forms an
                    incessant decoration from its facile production and repetition by means of
                    twisted gold wire. Grasshoppers or tree crickets in gold repoussé suspended by
                    chains and probably used for the decoration of the hair, and a griffin (fig.
                    17), having the upper part of the body of an eagle and ’the lower parts of a
                    lion, with wings decorated with spirals, are among the more remarkable examples
                    of perforated ornaments for attachment to the clothing. -There are also
                    perforated ornaments belonging to necklaces, with intaglio engravings of such
                    subjects as Hercules and the Nemean lion, and a duel of two warriors, possibly
                    Hector and Achilles, one of whom stabs his antagonist in the throat. Another has
                    a representation of a lion, very archaic in treatment, the style resembling that
                    of the fore part of the lion found on the statue of Sardis, attributed to
                    Croesus, 560 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> There are also pinheads and brooches
                    formed of two stags lying down (fig. 15), the bodies and necks crossing each
                    other, and the horns meeting symmetrically above the heads, forming a finial.
                    The heads of these ornaments were of gold, with silver blades or pointed pins
                    inserted for use. The bodies of the two stags rest on fronds of the date-palm
                    growing out of the stem which receives the pin. Another remarkable series is
                    composed of figures of women with doves (fig. 20). Some have one dove resting on
                    the head; others have three doves, one on the head and the others resting on
                    arms. The arms in both instances are extended to the elbow, the hands being
                    placed on the breasts. These ornaments are also perforated, and were evidently
                    sewed on the dresses, although there is some evidence that an example with three
                    doves has been fastened with a pin.</p>
                <p>Mention must be made of an extraordinary diadem found upon the head of one of the
                    bodies discovered in the same tomb with many objects similar to those noticed
                    above. It is 25 inches in length, covered with shieldlike or rosette ornaments
                    in repoussé, the relief being very low but perfectly distinct, and further
                    ornamented by thirty-six large leaves of repoussé gold attached to it. As an
                    example of design and perfection of detail, another smaller diadem found in
                    another tomb may be noted (fig. 11). It is of gold plate, so thick as to require
                    no “piping” at the back to sustain it; but in general the repoussé examples have
                    a piping of copper wire. Diadems of similar form are found on statues of
                    Aphrodite, and also on statuettes of Hercules in ivory, in the Assyrian
                    collection at the British Museum. Fig. 13 represents a remarkably elegant
                    pendant ornament, the design being of an exceptionally beautiful character. A
                    cross of thin gold work formed of four leaves (fig. 18), a finial-like ornament
                    (fig. 19), and the head of a pin or brooch evidently suggested by a butterfly
                    (fig. 14), are all characteristic of the gold work of Mycenae.</p>
                <p>The gold ornaments found at Hissarlik, in what Dr Schliemann calls the “Treasury
                    of Priam,” partake in most instances of the same characteristics as those found
                    in the sepulchres at Mycenae. There are necklaces, brooches, bracelets (fig.
                    29), hair-pins (fig. 23), earrings (figs. 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 28), with and
                    without pendants, beads, and twisted wire drops. The majority of these are
                    ornamented with spirals of twisted wire, or small rosettes, with fragments of
                    stones in the centres. The twisted wire ornaments were evidently portions of
                    necklaces. A circular plaque decorated with a rosette (fig. 30) is very similar
                    to those found at Mycenae, and a conventionalized eagle (fig. 31) is
                    characteristic of much of the detail found at that place as well as at
                    Hissarlik. They were all of pure gold, and the wire must have been drawn through
                    a plate of harder metal—probably bronze. The principal ornaments differing from
                    those found at Mycenae are diadems or head fillets of pure hammered gold (fig.
                    24) cut into thin plates, attached to rings by double gold wires, and fastened
                    together at the back with thin twisted wire. To these pendants (of which those
                    at the two ends are nearly three times the length of those forming the central
                    portions) are attached small figures, probably of idols. It has been assumed
                    that these were worn across the forehead by women, the long pendants falling on
                    each side of the face. If, however, the position on which they were found was
                    formerly part of a temple instead of a palace, it may be suggested that they
                    were used as veils for the priests when giving forth the oracles from the
                    shrine.</p>
                <p>Jewellery and gold work of a very similar character has been found at Cyprus
                    within the last few years by Major Cesnola. The rings (Plate XII. figs. 5 and 6)
                    have a great resemblance to the Greek, whilst the beetle, which is of green
                    stone set in gold (fig. 6), has a very Egyptian-like appearance. The great
                    similarity in design and workmanship between these Eastern examples and the gold
                    jewellery and personal ornaments found in Peru and Mexico (figs. 1,2, 3, 4) is
                    not a little remarkable. These, however, are more rude in design, though equally
                    good in workmanship.</p>
                <p>Greek, Etruscan, and Roman ornaments partake of very similar characteristics. Of
                    course there is variety in design and sometimes in treatment, but it does not
                    rise to any special individuality. Fretwork is a distinguishing feature of all,
                    together with the wave ornament, the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n710/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0710-0677"/> guilloche, and the occasional use of the human
                    figure. The workmanship is often of a character which modern gold workers can
                    only rival with their best skill, and can never surpass. The pendant oblong
                    ornament for containing a scroll (Plate XL fig. 34) is an example of this, as
                    also the Italo-Greek earring (fig. 32). The earring (fig. 36) is an exquisite
                    illustration of Greek skill in the introduction of the human figure; the rosette
                    for concealing the hook and the winged ornament at the back of the Cupid are
                    beautifully wrought. The other earrings (figs. 33, 35, 37) are all
                    characteristic. The Etruscan examples are of the same character. The pendant
                    (fig. 40), the rosette (fig. 38), and the plaque of gold (fig. 38) repeat some
                    of the forms found at Mycenae, with possibly a little more classic grace of
                    detail and refinement of workmanship. The brooch (fig. 41) is perhaps the most
                    characteristic example of purely classic design, essentially Greek in its
                    principal details, whilst the workmanship is all that can be desired.</p>
                <p>The granulation of surfaces practised by the Etruscans was long a puzzle and a
                    problem to the modern jeweller, until Signor Castellani of Rome discovered gold
                    workers in the Abruzzi to whom the method had descended through many
                    generations, and, by inducing some of these men to go to Naples, revived the
                    art, of which he contributed examples to the London Exhibition of 1872,
                    successfully applied to modern designs.</p>
                <p>The Merovingian jewellery of the 5th century, the Anglo-Saxon of a later date,
                    and the Celtic as leading to the Gothic or mediaeval, have each distinguishing
                    features. In the first two the characteristics are thin plates of gold,
                    decorated with thin slabs of garnet, set in walls of gold soldered vertically
                    like the lines of cloisonné enamel, with the addition of very decorative details
                    of filigree work, beading, and twisted gold. In Plate XII. figs. 9 and 13 we
                    have examples of Anglo-Saxon fibulae, the first being decorated with a species
                    of cloisonne, in which garnets are inserted, while the other is in hammered work
                    in relief. A pendant (fig. 8) is also set with garnets. The buckles (figs. 10,
                    11, 12) are remarkably characteristic examples, and very elegant in design. A
                    girdle ornament in gold, set with garnets (fig. 14), is an example of
                    Carlovingian design of a high class. The Celtic ornaments are of hammered work,
                    adapted to uses now comparatively unknown, but display another style of
                    workmanship,—details in repoussé, fillings in with amber, rock crystal with a
                    smooth rounded surface cut <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cabochon,</hi> with the addition of vitreous pastes. The minute filigree and
                    plaited work, in combination with niello and enamel, communicate to the
                    ornaments of this class found in Ireland and Scotland an unmistakable Oriental
                    spirit alike in design and workmanship.</p>
                <p>In figs. 15 and 17 are illustrations of two brooches. The first is 13th century;
                    the latter is probably 12th century, and is set with paste, amber, and blue. The
                    brooch in the form of a figure of St Christopher bearing the infant Saviour, and
                    supported by his staff (fig. 16), is of silver gilt. Chaucer mentions such a
                    brooch as worn by the yeoman :—“A Crystofre on his brest of silvyr scheue.”</p>
                <p>Rings are the chief specimens now seen of mediaeval jewellery from the 10th to
                    the 13th century. They are generally massive and simple. Through the 16 th
                    century a variety of changes arose; in the traditions and designs of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cinquecento</hi> we have plenty of evidence that the workmen used
                    their own designs, and the results culminated in the triumphs of Albert Dürer,
                    Benvenuto Cellini, and Hans Holbein. The goldsmiths of the Italian republics
                    must have produced works of surpassing excellence in workmanship, and reaching
                    the highest point in design as applied to handicrafts of any kind. The use of
                    enamels, precious stones, niello work, and engraving, in combination with
                    skilful execution of the human figure and animal life, produced effects which
                    modern art in this direction is not likely to approach, still less to rival.</p>
                <p>In Plate XII. illustrations are given of various characteristic specimens of the
                    Renaissance, and later forms of jewellery. A crystal cross set in enamelled gold
                    (fig. 18) is German work of the 16th century. The pendant reliquary (fig. 19),
                    enamelled and jewelled, is of 16th century Italian work, and so probably is the
                    jewel (fig. 20) of gold set with diamonds and rubies.</p>
                <p>The Darnley or Lenox jewel (fig. 21), now in the possession of the Queen, was
                    made about 1576-7 for Lady Margaret Douglas, countess of Lenox, the mother of
                    Henry Darnley. It is a pendant golden heart set with a heart-shaped sapphire,
                    richly jewelled and enamelled with emblematic figures and devices. It also has
                    Scottish mottoes around and within it. The earring (fig. 22) of gold, enamelled,
                    hung with small pearls, is an example of 17th century Russian work, and another
                    (fig. 23) is Italian of the same period, being of gold and filigree with enamel,
                    also with pendant pearls. A Spanish earring, of 18th century work (fig. 24), is
                    a combination of ribbon, cord, and filigree in gold; and another (fig. 25) is
                    Flemish, of probably the same period: it is of gold open work set with diamonds
                    in projecting collets. The old French-Normandy pendant cross and locket (fig.
                    26) presents a characteristic example of peasant jewellery; it is of branched
                    open work set with bosses and ridged ornaments of crystal. The earring (fig. 27)
                    is French of 17th century, also of gold open work set with crystals. A small
                    pendant locket (fig. 28) is of rock crystal, with the cross of Santiago in gold
                    and translucent crimson enamel; it is 16th or 17th century Spanish work. A
                    pretty earring of gold open scroll work (fig. 29), set with minute diamonds and
                    three pendant pearls, is Portuguese of 17th century, and another earring (fig.
                    30) of gold circular open work, set also with minute diamonds, is Portuguese
                    work of 18th century. These examples fairly illustrate the general features of
                    the most characteristic jewellery of the dates quoted.</p>
                <p>During the 17th and 18th centuries we see only a mechanical kind of excellence,
                    the results of the mere tradition of the workshop,—the lingering of the power
                    which when wisely directed had done so much and so well, but now simply living
                    on traditional forms, often combined in a most incongruous fashion. Gorgeous
                    effects were aimed at by massing the gold, and introducing stones elaborately
                    cut in themselves, or clustered in groups. Thus diamonds were clustered in
                    rosettes and bouquets; rubies, pearls, emeralds, and other coloured special
                    stones were brought together for little other purpose than to get them into a
                    given space in conjunction with a certain quantity of gold. The question was not
                    of design in its relation to use as personal decoration, but of the value which
                    could be got into a given space to produce the most striking effect.</p>
                <p>The traditions of Oriental design as they had come down through the various
                    periods quoted, were comparatively lost in the wretched results of the <hi
                    rend="italic">rococo</hi> of Louis XIV. and the inanities of what modern
                    revivalists of the Anglo-Dutch call “Queen Anne.” In the London Exhibition of
                    1851, the extravagances of modern jewellery had to stand a comparison with the
                    Oriental examples contributed from India. Since then we have learnt more about
                    these works, and have been compelled to acknowledge, in spite of what is
                    sometimes called inferiority of workmanship, how completely the Oriental
                    jeweller understood his work, and with what singular simplicity of method he
                    carried it out. The combinations are always <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n711/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0711-0678"/> harmonious, the result aimed at always achieved;
                    and, if in attempting to work to European ideas the jeweller failed, this was
                    rather the fault of the forms he had to follow, than due to any want of skill in
                    making the most of a subject in which half the thought and the intended use were
                    foreign to his experience.</p>
                <p>A collection of peasant jewellery got together by Castellani for the Paris
                    Exhibition of 1867, and now in the South Kensington Museum, illustrates in an
                    admirable manner the traditional jewellery and personal ornaments of a wide
                    range of peoples in Europe. This collection, and the additions made to it since
                    its acquisition by the nation, show the forms in which these objects existed
                    over several generations among the peasantry of France (chiefly Normandy),
                    Spain, Portugal, Holland, Denmark, Germany, and Switzerland, and also show how
                    the forms popular in one country are followed and adopted in another, almost
                    invariably because of their perfect adaptation to the purpose for which they
                    were designed.</p>
                <p>So far we have gone over the progress and results of the jeweller’s art in the
                    past. We have now to speak of the production of jewellery as a modern art
                    industry, in which large numbers of men and women are employed in the larger
                    cities of Europe, but which also has its special localities in which it
                    flourishes, and out of which an important national commerce arises.</p>
                <p>Nearly all the great capitals of Europe produce jewellery, but Paris, Vienna,
                    London, and Birmingham are the most important centres. An illustration of
                    methods and processes and the various kinds of jewellery produced at the present
                    day in the manufacture as carried on in London and Birmingham will be sufficient
                    for all practical purposes, and as giving an insight into the technique and
                    artistic manipulation of this branch of art industry; but, by way of contrast,
                    it may be interesting to give in the first place a description of the native
                    working jeweller of Hindustan. Travelling very much after the fashion of a
                    tinker in England, his “budget” contains tools, materials, fire pots, and all
                    the requisites of his handicraft. The gold to be used is generally supplied by
                    the patron or employer, and is frequently in gold coin, which the travelling
                    jeweller undertakes to convert into the ornaments required. He squats down in
                    the corner of a courtyard, or under cover of a veranda, lights his fire, cuts up
                    the gold pieces entrusted to him, hammers, cuts, shapes, drills, solders with
                    the blow-pipe, files, scrapes, and burnishes until he has produced the desired
                    effect. If he has stones to set or coloured enamels to introduce, he never seems
                    to make a mistake; his instinct for harmony of colour, like that of his brother
                    craftsman the weaver, is as unerring as that of the bird in the construction of
                    its nest. Whether the materials are common or rich and rare, he invariably does
                    the very best possible with them, according to native ideas of beauty in design
                    and combination. It is only when he is interfered with by European dictation
                    that he ever vulgarizes his art or makes a mistake. The result may appear rude
                    in its finish, but the design and the thought are invariably right. We thus see
                    how a trade in the working of which the “plant” is so simple and wants are so
                    readily met could spread itself, as in years past it did at Clerkenwell and at
                    Birmingham, before gigantic factories were invented for producing everything
                    under the sun.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to find any date at which the systematic production of jewellery
                    was introduced into England. Probably the Clerkenwell trade dates its origin
                    from the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, as the skilled artisans in the
                    jewellery, clock and watch, and trinket trades appear to have been descendants
                    of the emigrant Huguenots, as the Spitalfields weavers were. The Birmingham
                    trade would appear to have had its origin in the skill to which the workers in
                    fine steel had attained towards the middle and end of last century, a branch of
                    industry which collapsed after the French Revolution.</p>
                <p>Modern jewellery may be classified under three heads: —(1) objects in which gems
                    and stones form the principal portions, and in which the gold work is really
                    only a means for carrying out the design by fixing the gems or stones in the
                    position arranged by the designer, the gold being visible only as a “setting”;
                    (2) when gold work plays an important part in the development of the design,
                    being itself ornamented by engraving or enamelling or both, the stones and gems
                    being arranged in subordination to the gold work in such positions as to give a
                    decorative effect to the whole; (3) when gold or other metal is alone used, the
                    design being wrought out by hammering in repoussé, casting, engraving, or
                    chasing, or the surfaces left absolutely plain but polished and highly
                    finished.</p>
                <p>Of course the most ancient and primitive methods are those wholly dependent upon
                    the craft of the workman; but gradually various ingenious processes were
                    invented, by which greater accuracy in the portions to be repeated in a design
                    could be produced with certainty and economy: hence the various methods of
                    stamping used in the production of hand-made jewellery, which are in themselves
                    as much mechanical in relation to the end in view as if the whole object were
                    stamped out at a blow, twisted into its proper position as regards the detail,
                    or the various stamped portions fitted into each other for the mechanical
                    completion of the work. It is therefore rather difficult to draw an absolute
                    line between hand-made and machine-made jewellery, except in extreme cases of
                    hand-made, when everything is worked, so to speak, from the solid, or of
                    machine-made, when the hand has only to give the ornament a few touches of a
                    tool, or fit the parts together if of more than one piece.</p>
                <p>The best and most costly hand-made jewellery produced in England, whether as
                    regards gold work, gems, enamelling, or engraving, is made in London, and
                    chiefly at Clerkenwell. A design is first made on paper, or drawn and coloured,
                    and when needful with separate enlargement of details, everything in short to
                    make the drawing thoroughly intelligible to the working jeweller. According to
                    the nature and purpose of the design, he cuts out, hammers, files, and brings
                    into shape the constructive portions of the work as a basis. Upon this, as each
                    detail is wrought out, he solders, or fixes by rivets, &amp;c., the
                    ornamentation necessary to the effect. The human figure, representations of
                    animal life, leaves, fruit, &amp;c., are modelled in wax, moulded, and cast in
                    gold, to be chased up and finished. As the hammering goes on the metal becomes
                    brittle and hard, and then it is passed through the fire to anneal or soften it,
                    in fact to restore the particles of gold to their original position. In the case
                    of elaborate examples of repoussé, after the general forms are beaten up, the
                    interior is filled with a resinous compound, pitch mixed with firebrick dust;
                    and this, forming a solid but pliable body underneath the metal, allows of the
                    finished details being wrought out on the front of the design, and being finally
                    completed by chasing. When stones are to be set, or when they form the principal
                    portions of the design, the gold has to be wrought by hand so as to receive them
                    in little cup-like orifices, these walls of gold enclosing the stone and
                    allowing the edges to be bent over to secure it. Setting is never effected by
                    cement in well-made jewellery. Machine-made settings have in recent years been
                    made, but these are simply cheap imitations of the true handmade setting. Even
                    strips of gold have been used, serrated at the edges to allow of being easily
                    bent over, for the retention of the stones, true or false.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n712/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0712-0679"/>
                <p>Great skill and experience are necessary in the proper setting of stones and gems
                    of high value, in order to bring out the greatest amount of brilliancy and
                    colour, and the angle at which a diamond (say) shall be set, in order that the
                    light shall penetrate at the proper point to bring out the “spark” or “flash,”
                    is a subject of grave consideration to the setter. Stones set in a haphazard,
                    slovenly manner, however brilliant in themselves, will look commonplace by the
                    side of skilfully set gems of much less fine quality and water. Enamelling has
                    of late years largely taken the place of “paste” or false stones. This may be
                    divided into two kinds— <hi rend="italic">champlevé</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >cloisonné.</hi> In champlevé the enamelling substance is applied to the surface
                    of the gold as ornamental details, and is “fired” in a muffle or furnace under
                    the eye of the enameller. Here the metallic oxides play an important part in
                    imparting variety of colour, as in the case of the “strass” of which “paste” or
                    false stones are made. Cloisonné enamelling is effected by walls of gold wire
                    being fastened to the surface to be decorated, upon which surface the design has
                    been already drawn in outline. Within these walls oY “cloisons” the
                    various-coloured enamels are placed, and the whole fixed together by firing
                    until the surface is more than filled up. The surface is levelled by grinding
                    down with pumice stone, and then polished. One kind of champlevé closely
                    approaches in its character to cloisonné. It is when the gold is thick enough to
                    allow of portions to be cut away by the graver, and in these incised parts the
                    coloured enamels are fused as in the manner of the true cloisonné.</p>
                <p>Enamelled subjects or paintings, portraits, landscapes, animals’ heads, &amp;c.,
                    are sometimes used as a setting for pins, brooches, pendants, bracelets, &amp;c.
                    These are of course true champlevé; and formerly very able artists, such as
                    Bone, Essex, and others, were employed in the production of costly works of this
                    kind.</p>
                <p>Engraving is a simple process in itself, and diversity of effect can be produced
                    by skilful manipulation. An interesting variety in the effect of a single
                    ornament is often produced by the combination of coloured gold of various tints.
                    This colouring is a chemical process of great delicacy, and requires much skill
                    and experience in the manipulation, according to the quality of the gold and the
                    amount of silver alloy in it. Of general colouring it may be said that the
                    object aimed at is to enhance the appearance of the gold by removing the
                    particles of alloy on the surface, and thus allowing the pure gold only to
                    remain visible to the eye.</p>
                <p>The application of machinery to the economical production of certain classes of
                    jewellery, not necessarily imitations, but as much “real gold” work, to use a
                    trade phrase, as the best hand-made, has been on the increase for many years.
                    Nearly every kind of gold chain now made is manufactured by machinery, and
                    nothing like the beauty of design or perfection of workmanship could be obtained
                    by hand at, probably, any cost. The question therefore in relation to chains is
                    not the mode of manufacture, but the quality of the metaL Eighteen carat gold is
                    of course always affected by those who wear chains, but this is only gold in the
                    proportion of 18 to 24, pure gold being represented by 24. The gold coin of the
                    realm is 22 carat; that is, it contains one-twelfth of alloy to harden it to
                    stand wear and tear. Thus 18 carat gold has one-fourth of alloy, and so on with
                    lower qualities down to 12, which is in reality only gold by courtesy.</p>
                <p>The application of machinery to the production of personal ornaments in gold and
                    silver can only be economically and successfully carried on when there is a
                    large demand for similar objects, that is to say, objects of precisely the same
                    design and decoration throughout. In hand-made jewellery, so-called, mechanical
                    appliances are only used to economize time and reduce the necessity for the
                    handicraftsman doing that which can be done as well, perhaps better, by some
                    simple mechanical method applied under the hand. In machine-made jewellery
                    everything is stereotyped, so to speak, and the only work required for the hand
                    is to fit the parts together,—in some instances scarcely that. A design is made,
                    and from it steel dies are sunk for stamping out as rapidly as possible from a
                    plate of rolled metal the portion represented by each die. It is in these steel
                    dies that the skill of the artist die-sinker is manifested. Brooches, earrings,
                    pinheads, bracelets, lockets, pendants, &amp;c., are struck out by the gross.
                    This is more especially the case in silver and in plated work,—that is,
                    imitation jewellery,—the base of which is an alloy, afterwards gilt by the
                    electro-plating process. With these ornaments imitation stones in paste and
                    glass, pearls, &amp;c., are used as setting, and it is remarkable that of late
                    years some of the best designs, the most simple,, appropriate, and artistic,
                    have appeared in imitation jewellery. It is only just to those engaged in this
                    manufacture to state distinctly that their work is never sold wholesale for
                    anything else than what it is. The worker in gold only makes gold, or real
                    jewellery, and he only makes of a quality well known to his customers. The
                    producer of silver work only manufactures silver ornaments, and so on throughout
                    the whole class of plated goods. It is the unprincipled retailer who, taking
                    advantage of the ignorance of the buyer, sells for gold that which is in.
                    reality an imitation, and which he bought as such.</p>
                <p>Space will not permit of any notice of various kinds of personal ornaments coming
                    under the head of jewellery, such as the elegantly designed hand-made pearl
                    ornaments, Whitby jet, coral, &amp;c., nor can we allude to the methods adopted
                    in the workshops where gold and silver alone are used to economize the metal
                    that would be wasted without proper precautions. Even the minute quantities of
                    the material which adhere to the hands of the workman are washed off before he
                    leaves the premises, carried into a proper receptacle, and recovered by chemical
                    agency.</p>
                <p>The special localities of the jewellery trade pro; er, inEngland, are Clerkenwell
                    and Bentonville in London, and Birmingham. In Clerkenwell an inquiry made some
                    years ago showed that from 1600 to 2000 persons were employed in the trades
                    connected with the production of jewellery and personal ornaments. In Birmingham
                    at least 8000 were thus occupied, chiefly in production of what may be
                    considered as purely mechanical work. Among the higher class of jewellers in
                    Birmingham some of the best work sold in the London shops is produced, the
                    mechanical means employed being so ingenious, and the handicraft power so
                    skilfully applied in fitting, setting, and finishing, as to leave little or
                    nothing to desire, when compared with hand-made work of the same class. <hi
